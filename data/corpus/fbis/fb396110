  [Text] Australia has decided to recognize as an 
independent state the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
Announcing the diplomatic step, Australia's foreign minister, 
Gareth Evans, said Canberra made no presumption about the 
so-called name dispute between Greece and the republic. 
  He said Australia would follow the United Nations in 
referring the country as the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia. Senator Evans said Australia believed the new state 
should refrain from using the name Republic of Macedonia until 
the name issue was resolved with Greece.

  [Excerpts] SYDNEY, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Hong Kong Governor Chris 
Patten left a meeting with Prime Minister Paul Keating on 
Tuesday without winning Australia's public endorsement of 
Britain's drive for greater democracy in the colony. But Patten 
said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's 
support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was 
delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory 
meeting." 
  Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official 
residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional 
issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) 
group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Patten, who is on a six-day 
official visit at Keating's invitation, told reporters his visit 
was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian 
businesses to use Hong Kong as a springboard to China. [passage 
omitted] 
  Keating has never denied reports that he told Chinese 
Premier 
Li Peng in Beijing last June that Australia did not support 
Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong. "Australia is 
not particularly impressed with Patten's modus operandi or his 
taking an interest in Hong Kong's political situation so late in 
the peace," Keating reportedly said. 
  However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans subsequently told 
parliament that Australia had consistently expressed to both 
China and Britain its "support for democratic reform" consistent 
with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British declaration paving the 
way for Hong Kong's handback in 1997. [passage omitted] 
  An Australian government official said later that the 
meeting 
had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not 
know if Keating had privately endorsed Britain's position. 
  "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to Australia 
of 
Hong Kong's continuing prosperity and stability in the 
transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997," the official said.

  [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] prime minister, Paias 
Wingti, on a visit to New Zealand has said the situation on the 
troubled island of Bougainville was returning to normal. 
Speaking on the first day of his visit after talks with New 
Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, in Wellington, Mr. Wingti 
said that reports of a PNG blockade were not correct. He said 
there was no blockade, the problem is of getting services and 
reconstruction programs moving on Bougainville. 
  The Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] has been fighting 
a 
five-year campaign for independence. Mr. Wingti said the number 
of rebels on Bougainville had diminished, and the people there 
and in the rest of PNG were now getting to the situation where 
they wanted normal lives to be restored. 
  He said PNG was one nation and to give independence to 
Bougainville would divide that nation, so it was not an issue.

<F P=106> ["The United States Must Immediately Stop Its Scheme To </F>
Start Radio `Free Asia'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 13 (KCNA) -- China, Vietnam, 
Laos and other Asian countries expressed resentment at the 
installation of the Radio "Free Asia" by the United States, says 
a NODONG SINMUN analyst today, adding this is an expression of 
their independent stand to reject the Yankee-style culture and 
defend their own traditions, culture and way of life. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  As many Asian countries have recognized, the Radio "Free 
Asia" which the United States is going to start broadcasting is 
intended to spread the socalled "outlook on the value of 
American democracy" and bourgeois ideology. National disputes 
and confrontation have resulted in bloodletting and ruthlessly 
destroyed the economic and social life now in the region and 
countries which had been influenced by such radio waves in the 
past. 
  Through the Radio "Free Asia" the United States is seeking 
to 
reproduce such a reality in the Asian region and thereby 
disorganize and destroy the socialist and independent countries 
in this region from within. 
  Even if it started broadcasting tricky programmes against 
Asian countries, the United States will have nothing to gain 
therefrom. 
  As expressed clearly and repeatedly, the Korean and other 
Asian people will defend their national sovereignty with the 
firm stand of masters being responsible for their own destinies, 
and staunchly struggle against the Yankee-style culture and in 
defence of their traditions, culture and way of life. 
  The United States must immediately stop the farce of 
launching into the broadcasting of the Radio "Free Asia".

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries Must Act With Discretion"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- Nowadays the 
Japanese reactionaries and their subsidized media are 
circulating the fiction of "outflow of money" from the General 
Association of Korean residents in Japan (Chongnyon) to the DPRK 
and hysterically crying that it must be "checked". 
  Their voluble talk about "outflow of money" is totally 
unfounded fabrication. It is a product of their persistent 
intrigues against the DPRK and Chongnyon. 
  Their allegation that colossal funds amounting to several 
hundred billion yen flow to the DPRK from Japan annually is 
based on false materials provided by the modern Korea institute, 
an anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon plot-breeding organization. This 
is, indeed, a preposterous, trash which could be invented by 
two-bit shysters accustomed to telling a lie. 
  They, above all, give am extravagant overestimation of the 
number of Japan-resident Koreans visiting the homeland and are 
misleading the public opinion with the talk that they have been 
donating a large amount of money to the homeland. This is the 
height of folly. 
  It is unimaginable for the DPRK, a powerful socialist 
country, to receive money from Chongnyon, its overseas Koreans' 
organization, and the whole world knows that the DPRK Government 
has sent a large amount of educational aid fund and stipends to 
Chongnyon for the children of Koreans in Japan. 
  As far as the joint-venture factories run by Korean traders 
and manufacturers in Japan in the homeland are concerned, it is 
a matter of their legitimate rights as businessmen. 
  This notwithstanding, the Japanese reactionaries are 
misleading the public opinion in a bid to create the impression 
that the DPRK is getting along with the "funds" leaking from 
Japan. This is an intolerable insult to the DPRK. 
  The DPRK has owed nothing to Japan up until now. It has 
lived and can live without Japan's help, and is able to live by 
its own efforts. 
  Under the revolutionary banner of self-reliance we have 
built 
a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance 
and self-reliance in national defence, not affected by any 
fluctuation of the situation, and are proudly exalting its grand 
might. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK intrigue is an outcome 
of the consciousness of crisis of those who are dazed at the 
might and indestructibility of the anthropocentric Korean-style 
socialist system. 
  In fabricating the preposterous "outflow of money" fiction 
reversing the stark reality they seek an aim to tarnish the 
international image of the DPRK, a highly dignified country, and 
find an excuse for suppressing Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. 
  It is not a happenstance that they launched into a frenzied 
anti-DPRK false propaganda at a time when the United States and 
seditious forces were unhesitatingly driving the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to an extremely dangerous, catastrophic 
crisis on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear problem" of the 
DPRK. 
  Exasperating, indeed, is the despicable talk about 
fictitious 
"outflow of money" of the Japanese reactionaries who still do 
not intend at all to make an apology and adequate compensation 
for their disgraceful past in which they had inflicted 
immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon the Korean people, 
including the "comfort women for the army" issue. 
  Their talk about "checking" the "outflow of money", a mere 
fiction, is a ridiculous hokum of those seized with 
schizophrenia. 
  They must act with discretion, clearly mindful that if they 
persist in intrigues against the DPRK, working in collusion 
with the United States, no good results would await them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 13 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea hosted a reception on 
Saturday for the delegation of the Communist Party of Canada 
(M-L) led by its national leader Hardial Bains. 
  Speaking at the reception, secretary of the WPK Central 
Committee Hwang Chang-yop said that we highly estimate the 
Communist Party of Canada (M-L) which is expanding the basic 
party organisations among the working class and students and 
other broad masses, strengthening the centralism in order to 
defend, expand and strengthen the revolutionary idea, the 
socialist idea under the complicated internal and external 
situation and, at the same time, actively conducting the work of 
supporting and encouraging the Canadian people in their struggle 
against capital exploitation. 
  He noted: 
  "Our party is happy to have such true friends as you in 
North 
America. We believe that the Korean visit of your delegation 
will strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between 
the two parties and contribute to the strengthening and 
development of the international communist movement." 
  Hardial Bains in his speech said that his party was deeply 
moved to see the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has 
maintained a firm independent stand, is victoriously leading the 
Korean people along the road of socialism, and deeply respected 
him. 
  The struggle of the Korean people who have adhered to the 
steadfast anti-imperialist stand under the wise guidance of the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is greatly encouraging the 
world people for socialism and independence, he noted. 
  "Our party," he stated, "will stand firm on the side of the 
Workers' Party of Korea which is struggling in defence of 
socialism against U.S. imperialism under the leadership of the 
great leader." 
  He denounced all the manoeuvres of the imperialists to 
isolate and stifle Korea, Cuba and other socialist countries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- An enlarged meeting 
of the executive Committee of the International Liaison 
Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea [Cilreco] held in 
Paris on February 6 adopted an action programme for 1994. 
  The action programme manifested support to the proposal to 
reunify Korea in the form of confederacy which was advanced by 
the great leader President Kim Il-song and clarified its policy 
to dynamically conduct the international solidarity movement to 
realise the proposal for founding the democratic confederal 
republic of Koryo and the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. 
  It noted: 
  The primary task of the international liaison committee in 
its activities for 1994 is to check and frustrate the U.S. 
adventurous policy of strength against the DPRK and rouse 
widespread international opinion demanding a successful progress 
of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The formula of reunification through confederacy is the most 
realistic way of founding a unified state, independent and 
neutral, peaceful and non-aligned, leaving the two systems in 
the North and the South of Korea as they are, and achieving a 
genuine unity of the nation. 
  The international liaison committee will further strengthen 
the international solidarity movement with the Korean people in 
their struggle for the reunification of the country and rouse 
wide international opinion to urge the South Korean authorities 
to promote the great national unity with an independent stand. 
  It once again expresses full support to the proposal for 
founding the democratic confederal republic of Koryo and the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and 
decides it as its main task for its activities in 1994 to rouse 
widespread international opinion in favor of the proposal for 
reunification by means of confederacy. 
  With a view to making solidarity movement powerful in many 
countries of the world, it declares 1994 a "year of 
international solidarity for support to the reunification of 
Korea through confederacy". 
  While giving priority to the above-mentioned two points, it 
will dynamically conduct the solidarity movement for the final 
solution to the Korean issue. 
  It will make its utmost in its activities in 1994 to wage a 
powerful movement for demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. 
troops and nuclear weapons and other arms and equipment from 
South Korea, a perpetual end to all forms of provocative 
military exercises in the Korean peninsula, a termination of the 
U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the [words 
indistinct], replacement of the Korean armistice agreement of 
1953 with a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United 
States, urging the South Korean authorities to stop the 
suppression of the democratic figures fighting for independence, 
democracy and reunification, abrogate the notorious "national 
security law", release the imprisoned patriots and respect human 
rights, demanding the resumption of heart-to-heart North-South 
dialogue for the faithful implementation of the inter-Korean 
agreement and dismantlement of the concrete wall and supporting 
the establishment of a nuclear-free, peace zone on the Korean 
peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of 
Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Guy Dupre, 
secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for 
Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), delivered a report 
at an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of Cilreco 
which was held in Paris on February 6. 
  The reporter outlined immediate tasks to strengthen 
international solidarity movement for supporting the cause of 
Korea's reunification and peace under the acute situation 
prevailing in the Korean peninsula. 
  Analysing the situation of the Korean peninsula, he stressed 
the need to be cautious of the Western media reports 
categorically dismissing the proposals and initiatives of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and shunning the reality 
and, at the same time, to analyse the developments from an 
objective stand and correctly see through the essential stand of 
the parties involved in the Korean issue. 
  Noting that the tension on the Korean peninsula remains 
acute, though a joint statement was adopted between the DPRK and 
the U.S. in June 1993 at official talks between the two sides, 
he said: "This is because the United States went back on its 
promise to the DPRK for the solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  He recalled that the DPRK, on January 31, 1994, solemnly 
declared that if the U.S. reversed its promise to the DPRK, the 
DPRK would no longer be bound by its promise to the U.S., that 
if the United States refused to have any more talks with the 
DPRK, the DPRK would seek no further talks and that if the U.S. 
would choose any other way, the DPRK will choose a corresponding 
countermeasure. "If broad masses are to be roused in a campaign 
to force the United States to strictly observe the principle 
agreed upon in its joint statement with the DPRK under the 
critical present situation, it is important to bring home the 
developments on the Korean peninsula to the public," the 
reporter said. 
  He branded "suspected nuclear development of the North" as a 
variant of the fiction of "threat from the North" invented by 
the United States to justify its moves to stifle the DPRK. 
  He said "threat from the North" over which the United States 
and the South Korean authorities have hitherto raised terrific 
outcries is a sheer fabrication without any ground. 
  He pointed out that the United States and its followers made 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations 
adopt high-handed "resolutions" in a bid to inveigle the 
international community into the U.S. "policy of strength" 
against socialist Korea. 
  He charged that the South Korean authorities have run a 
gamut 
of plots to bar the solution of the nuclear issue through the 
medium of direct negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. and 
Japan has burst into the limelight in raising a hue and cry over 
the fictitious "suspected nuclear development by the North". 
  The reporter quoted President Kim Il-song as saying in his 
New Year address that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks under all circumstances 
and pressure and threat will have no effect on the Korean people 
and such method may invite a catastrophe, far from leading to a 
solution of the problem. 
  "We express full sympathy for the principled stand," 
declared 
the reporter. 
  He demanded that the Korean Armistice Agreement be replaced 
by a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. in compliance 
with the requirements of the resolution (3390 b) of the 30th 
U.N. General Assembly and, accordingly, the U.S. Forces be 
completely withdrawn from South Korea. 
  He said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation shows a way of an early realisation of Korea's 
reunification. 
  He further said: 
  "The 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunification of the country put forward by 
President Kim Il-song last year indicates detailed ways for 
founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK], an 
independent, peaceful and neutral unified state. We will make 
every effort to arouse louder voices supporting the proposal for 
founding the DCRK and the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation." 
  The reporter stressed the need to expand and strengthen the 
international solidarity movement for Korea's reunification and 
peace and proposed measures for this. 
  He said: 
  "Primary efforts should be directed to the following two 
points to bring about a decisive turn in creating an atmosphere 
of detente and reconciliation for hastening the process of 
Korea's reunification this year: 
  "What is important above all is to build up broad world 
opinion urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy 
to stifle the DPRK and abide by the principles of the joint 
statement agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States. 
  "What is important next is to put the question of 
reunification through confederacy on the agenda of inter-Korean 
talks and promote reunification-oriented dialogue. Of 
importance in this regard is to arouse broad world opinion 
supporting the proposal for founding the DCRK, the most 
realistic and fair way in the solution to the Korean issue. 
  "With a view to building up world opinion in favor of the 
settlement of the Korean issue, we propose declaring 1994 `a 
year of international solidarity supporting Korea's 
reunification through confederacy.'" 
  The reporter expressed the hope that the members of the 
leading body of Cilreco and leading officials of the regional 
and national committees of support to Korea's reunification and 
organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean 
people will actively turn out, with a high sense of 
responsibility, in the work to expand and strengthen 
international solidarity movement in keeping with the demands of 
the obtaining situation.

<F P=106> ["Report at International Seminar on Chuche Idea for </F>
Independent Development and Cooperation of World Peoples" -- 
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- Chango Macho, 
deputy national political commissar of the secretariat of the 
National Resistance Movement of Uganda, director of the board of 
the International Institute of the Chuche Idea and director of 
the board of the African Regional Committee for the Study of the 
Chuche Idea, made a report on the subject "The Chuche Idea Is a 
Revolutionary Doctrine Which Indicates the Road of Independent 
Development and Cooperation of the People" at the international 
seminar on the chuche idea for the independent development and 
cooperation of the world people which opened in Uganda on Feb. 
10., in the first part of the report he elaborated on the 
question of eliminating neo-colonialism, a new crafty method of 
aggression invented by the imperialists, feeling great threat 
from the rapid growth of the anti-imperialist independent forces 
after the Second World War. 
  "Forcing upon the developing countries market opening and 
liberalisation of foreign trade with the economic `aid' as the 
lever is an important feature of the neo-colonial method the 
imperialists are employing," he noted, adding: "Market opening 
and liberalisation of foreign trade are, in actuality, for the 
stronger to overpower the weaker." 
  "As the reality shows, in consequence of the neo-colonial 
policy of the imperialists, the developing countries are daily 
getting poorer and the bipolarization of `the rich gets richer 
and the poor poorer' is now expanding worldwide, and this deals 
a hard blow at the developed capitalist and imperialist 
countries, too", he stated. 
  He stressed the need to abolish the old international 
economic order based on neo-colonialism and establish a new fair 
one based on democratic principles. 
  "It is important," he said, "to democratise the 
international 
economic relations so that all the countries and all the nations 
may exercise the sovereignty, irrespective of their size and 
strength, and disparity in wealth. For this purpose, an end 
must be put to the unfair old international economic order such 
as unfair division of labour, dependent trading structure, 
non-equivalent exchange and predatory monetary and financial 
system which are forced by imperialism today. If a fair 
international economic order is to be established, the 
developing countries must be independent in economy. For this, 
the developing countries must, first of all, adhere to the 
principle of self-reliance. They must actively develop 
South-South cooperation on the principle of collective 
self-reliance." 
  In the second part of the report, he stressed the need to 
establish a fair international political order. "If the 
developing countries are to be freed from the neo-colonial yoke, 
it is important for them to have political sovereignty," the 
reporter noted, and added: 
  "What is essential to the establishment of political 
sovereignty is to unite the popular masses as an independent 
political motive force capable of shaping their destiny by their 
own efforts with an independent fighting target." 
  The reporter quoted His Excellency Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "The decisive guarantee of victory in the revolutionary 
struggle and constructive work is to strengthen the party, the 
general staff of the revolution, and closely unite the masses of 
people around the party and the leader and thus reinforce the 
driving force of the revolution." 
  He noted: 
  "Unity is the life and soul of an independent driving force 
and the source of its invincible strength. 
  "The imperialists who are seeking economic subjugation and 
political domination are most afraid of the unity of the popular 
masses into one independent motive force and resort to the 
splittist moves to obstruct it. One of such manoeuvres of the 
imperialists is the `multiparty parliamentary democracy' of 
Western style forced on the developing countries. 
  "The `multiparty parliamentary democracy' is the application 
of the principle of free competition to the political arena, 
which is aimed at setting up a political domination system 
commensurate with the economic domination system. 
  "What the people of the developing countries need is not 
`multiparty parliamentary democracy' of the West but an 
independent political system which can ensure the unity of 
patriotic forces under the banner of independence against 
imperialism. 
  "Therefore, the people of the African countries should 
develop by themselves a political formula conducive to the unity 
of all the patriotic forces in conformity with the specific 
conditions of their countries. What is important here is to 
reject the interference of all outside forces in their internal 
affairs and establish a democratic order strictly defending the 
sovereignty of each country in the international community. All 
the countries should reject any privilege and interference in 
other's internal affairs ignoring the principle of fairness and 
international justice in the international relations and develop 
friendship and unity and cooperation on the principle of 
equality and mutual benefit." 
  In the third part, the reporter said that all the victories 
and achievements of the Korean people in building a new 
independent society are results of the application of the chuche 
idea. 
  "The reality of Korea proves that the chuche idea which 
regards independence as the life and soul of the country and the 
nation and sets it as the basic way of building a new society to 
strengthen the motive force and enhance its role is, indeed, the 
guiding idea of the revolution and construction with invincible 
vitality," the reporter noted, and said: 
  "We should make sincere efforts for the building of a new 
independent society by creatively applying the universal truth 
of the chuche idea to the specific conditions of our countries 
and strengthen international cooperation among the peoples 
aspiring after independence. We should resolutely oppose the 
moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries who are 
obstructing the reunification of Korea and wage a more powerful 
international solidarity movement in support of the 
reunification of Korea."

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- A meeting of the 
political parties and forces in the Middle East region for 
solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was 
held in Syria on February 8. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives of more than 20 
political parties and forces. 
  The director of the International Affairs Department of the 
Communist Party of Syria who is member of the Political Bureau 
in his speech said international solidarity should be extended 
to Korea which stands with dignity against the United States 
which tries to force it to open its military sites. 
  Just is the stand of Korea that it can never concede its 
sovereignty and not open its military sites, he stressed. 
  He said the United States must come out again to talks with 
Korea and, by responding to the demand of Korea that the double 
standard be discarded and the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula be solved comprehensively, it should help to secure 
stability in this region and realise a peaceful reunification of 
Korea. 
  A solidarity message to the great leader President Kim 
Il-song was adopted at the meeting. 
  The meeting adopted letters to the U.S. president, the U.N. 
secretary general and the board of governors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

Package Deal'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- The head of the 
delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
speaking at the plenary session of the meeting for disarmament 
in the Asia-Pacific region held in Nepal on January 31, 
clarified the DPRK's principled stand and views on disarmament. 
  He said that in order to ensure peace, security and 
disarmament on the Korean peninsula, it is imperative to replace 
the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. 
  Noting that Korean reunification is a basic guarantee for 
peace and security on the peninsula, he said the way of national 
reunification is to establish a unified state through 
confederacy based on one nation, one state and two systems and 
two governments in accordance with the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  He outlined the essence of the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula the reason why it should be solved between the DPRK 
and the United States and the significance of the talks. 
  Pointing out that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
must be solved in a package deal, he stressed that the problem 
can not be solved by power politics and pressure and they may 
bring the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  He said that if the United States truly hope for a solution 
to the nuclear issue on the peninsula, it must discard its 
thinking- pattern of the Cold War.

Korean Peninsula'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- Twentyfour public 
organizations including the all India Indo-Korean Friendship 
Association, the Indian Committee for Supporting Korean 
Reunification and the All India Peace and Solidarity 
Organization and 31 parliamentarians including communist member 
of the parliament Indrajit Gupta and member of the parliament 
from the People's Party Shandrajeet Yadav made public a joint 
statement on February 8 reaffirming that there is not a single 
nuclear weapon in the North of the Korean peninsula and so, any 
kind of inspection is unnecessary. 
  Recalling that the United States, instead of seeking a 
negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, has unilaterally broken up dialogue and even sent an 
ultimatum to the DPRK threatening it with "sanctions," the 
statement said it is a scheme to stifle the socialist system of 
the DPRK and destroy its independent national economy. 
  Noting that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was 
caused by the United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in 
South Korea, it strongly urged the United States to immediately 
withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea. 
  The statement called upon the Indian and world peaceloving 
people to lift up louder voices of justice for thwarting the 
moves of the U.S. warmaniacs against the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- A resolution on 
Korea was adopted at a meeting of the presidential council of 
the World Federation of Trade Unions [WFTU] on February 4. 
  The resolution expressed deep concern over the fact that the

People's Republic of Korea under the pretext of the "nuclear 
problem." 
  It said: 
  "The meeting of the presidential council of the WFTU 
bitterly 
denounces all the moves of the imperialists against the DPRK and 
holds that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be 
solved peacefully through the DPRK-U.S. talks, not by pressure 
or threat. 
  "The meeting expresses full support and solidarity for the 
Korean workers and people in their struggle for reunifying the 
country through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two 
systems and two governments in accordance with the three

National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea and the 
Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association recently 
published a joint appeal on significantly celebrating the 
birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the common 
holiday of mankind. 
  The appeal noted that Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious 
leader who enjoys boundless respect and reverence not only of 
the Korean people but also of the revolutionary people of the 
world for the immortal exploits and contributions he made for 
the times and mankind. 
  The boundless reverence for Comrade Kim Chong-il can be seen 
in the fact that many units and objects of different countries 
were named after his august name. 
  In recent years alone, streets, libraries, classes at 
schools 
of different levels and other objects and units in India, 
Pakistan, Mongolia, Lebanon, Palestine, Madagascar, Zambia, 
Uganda, Peru, Ecuador, Guyana and other countries have been 
given his name. 
  Functions for naming them after Comrade Kim Chong-il were 
held grandly in those countries. 
  Members of the State Council of Guyana including the 
minister 
of health took part in the function for naming the Guaber Street 
in Corriverton City Kim Chong-il Street. 
  The minister of health at the naming ceremony said to have a 
street named after Comrade Kim Chong-il in Corriverton City was 
a highest honor for the Guyanese Government and people. 
  There is the "Dear Leader Kim Chong-il Library" at the Asian 
Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea in New Delhi, India. 
  The library is crowded everyday with Indian people of all 
strata who come to learn from the dear leader. 
  The Ali Ali School in Karachi, Pakistan, the Onike Primary 
School of Nigeria, the Kuds School of Palestine and many other 
schools have classes called by the august name of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The boundless feelings of reverence for the dear leader are 
associated with "Kimchongilia", an immortal flower. 
  "Kimchongilia" is a rare flower which was bred by Mototeru 
Kamo, a famous botanist of Japan, through his hard work for more 
than 20 years. 
  The flower named after the illustrious leader is now in full 
bloom in more than 50 countries. 
  Some time ago, the Mozambican president, praising the 
immortal flower "Kimchongilia", said the fact that a Japanese 
botanist bred and presented this flower to dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il well shows how deep the respect and reverence of the 
world people for him is.

people felt more keenly than anyone else the national pride and 
honor of making revolution under the guidance of great and 
illustrious leaders," he said, and continued: 
  "We express firm solidarity with the Cuban people, noting 
with high appreciation that they, rallied close around Comrade 
Fidel Castro, the supreme leader of their revolution, invariably 
abide by the revolutionary principle and advance along the road 
of socialism, courageously overcoming difficulties and trials. 
  "The Cuban people's cause of defending the motherland and 
revolution and socialism will certainly end in victory. 
  "We will make every effort to further deepen the bonds of 
friendship, solidarity and unity with the Cuban people, true to 
the instructions of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il that

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our People's Army Which Upholds the </F>
Great Commander at the Helm Is Ever-Victorious and Invincible"] 
  [Text] Our party strengthened and developed the People's 
Army into a one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary force under the 
wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme 
commander of the Korean People's Army and chairman of the DPRK 
National Defense Commission. Therefore, the People's Army is 
firmly defending socialism of our own style at the most acute 
confrontation place of the revolution and antirevolution, and 
socialism and imperialism, and is vigorously advancing for the 
ultimate completion of the fatherland's reunification and the 
chuche revolutionary cause. 
  Even amid the vortex of a complicated and severe situation 
as 
today, socialism of our own style is firmly standing deep in the 
core of the earth, and our party and the people are constructing 
socialism and communism with confidence. This is because they 
highly upheld the dear comrade leader, who strengthened and 
developed the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100 
revolutionary force, as the great commander at the helm. 
  More than anything else, the dear comrade leader provided a 
programmatic guideline which must be firmly adhered to and 
advanced to strengthen and develop the People's Army into an 
ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wholly elucidated the 
revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the 
slogan of one-a-match-for-100 which was presented by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Thus, he clearly clarified the road 
to strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100. 
  The dear comrade leader regulated that the basis in 
strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100 is to 
prepare the soldiers well, and he also regulated that preparing 
the soldiers is in essence a political, ideological, military, 
technical, and physical preparation. 
  A soldier is the most important element of military 
strength, 
and a decisive element of the armed struggle. Weapons are 
important in a war but the master using it are through and 
through the soldiers. The might of an army and victory or 
failure in a war are decided upon not by weapons but by men. 
When all soldiers are firmly prepared politically, 
ideologically, militarily, technically, and physically, can the 
army come to the fore as a group of fighters who move swiftly 
and as an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force 
that has an invincible commander who can cope with one-a- 
match-for-100. 
  The dear comrade leader also modernized the armed equipment 
of the People's Army, and elucidated that making the military 
camp into an impregnable fortress is a fundamental demand in 
implementing the slogan of one-a-match-for-100. The armed 
equipment must through and through be developed in a 
chuche-oriented way in conformity with the situation of their 
country, must be highly modernized, and the military camp must 
be maintained into an impregnable fortress. 
  As such, the dear comrade leader profoundly elucidated the 
revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the 
militant slogan of one-a-match-for-100. Thus, a programmatic 
guideline which must be adhered to permanently was provided in 
strengthening the militant strength of the People's Army. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened and 
developed the People's Army into an invincible party's army that 
is possessed with an absolutely perfect trait of an army of the 
leader, army of the party, and army of the people. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Amid 
the arduous trials of the revolution, our People's Army was 
trained into an iron-willed rank which is firmly possessed with 
the party's unitary ideology system. 
  Our party's greatest honor and pride is having the People's 
Army that resolutely advocates and defends the party and the 
leader and that implements to the end the party's order and 
instructions even through fire and water. 
  In accordance with the new high demand of the development of 
our revolution and army construction, the dear comrade leader 
presented the program of modeling the whole Army after the 
chuche idea and intensified the work of establishing the party's 
unitary ideology system in the People's Army. With the 
presentation of the program of modeling the whole Army after the 
chuche idea and by thoroughly implementing it, our revolutionary 
force created by the great leader has been strengthened and 
developed into an army of the leader forever, and it has been 
possible for the People's Army to fulfill its lofty mission of 
firmly advocating and defending through arms the ultimate 
victory of the chuche cause under the leadership of the dear 
comrade leader. 
  Today, a chuche-oriented leadership system in which the 
whole 
Army is moving as one person under the party's unitary 
leadership firmly stands within the People's Army, all the 
soldiers regard the slogan, "What the party decides, we will 
do," as their faith, they are willing to sacrifice their youth 
and lives if it is for the party and the leader, and they are 
living and struggling with the soldier spirit of jumping into 
water and fire if it is an order made by the party. 
  Thus, the party and the Army are linked as one today and 
the People's Army has been strengthened and developed into the 
ever-victorious invincible army of the party which shares 
destiny with the party forever on the single road of revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened the 
military might of the People's Army in every way and thus 
fostered our revolutionary armed forces into a unrivaled strong 
army. 
  The dear comrade leader, regarding intensification of combat 
training as a basic key to preparing the People's Army to be an 
one-match-for-a-100 army, energetically led so that soldiers are 
firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically through 
such training. 
  The dear comrade leader put forward the five-point training 
policies and training principles, as well as basic demands and 
tasks that should be resolved in training, so that combat 
training is intensified. He saw to it that all soldiers 
thoroughly implement the party's training policy with 
chuche-oriented outlook on training and establish the trait of 
anti-Japanese guerrilla-style training and that a revolutionary 
turn is registered in combat training. 
  By directing keen attention to the work pertaining to 
organization of training, the dear comrade leader had a thorough 
comprehension of the real condition in organization of training 
within the People's Army and a deep understanding of defects 
revealed from this condition. By establishing revolutionary 
measures, he saw to it that combat training is conducted in 
accordance with characteristics of each military branch and 
service and with the degree of soldiers' preparedness. Thus, he 
made combat training a course for soldiers to have practical 
knowledge useful for actual combat. 
  With a view to enhancing the qualitative standard of combat 
training, the dear comrade leader saw to it that various mass 
movements, including the movement to win the red banner of three 
revolutions, are carried out in close combination with combat 
training. In particular, he led soldiers so that they can better 
make military and technical preparations, as well as physical 
preparation. 
  Combat training has been vigorously carried out within the 
People's Army under the wise leadership of the dear comrade 
leader. As the result, all soldiers came to have smart and 
sagacious tactics, master marksmanship and iron-clad physical 
strength. Thus, they became reliably prepared as 
one-a-match-for-100 fighters capable of smashing any strong 
enemy at a stroke. 
  In addition to preparing soldiers to be one-a-match-for-100 
fighters, the dear comrade leader wisely led the work of 
constantly modernizing arms and equipment and of fortifying the 
military encampment. 
  The dear comrade leader put forward a wise policy for 
modernizing arms and equipment with our own strength and 
according to our practical situation, and energetically led so 
that the work is thoroughly implemented. 
  The dear comrade leader saw to it that the might of arms and 
equipment of the People's Army is increased many more times by 
modernizing them with our own strength and in our own style, and 
in accordance with practical situation in our country. He put 
forward a profound plan to simultaneously upgrade onto a modern 
standard arms and equipment of not only one specific branch and 
service but also of all branches and services including the 
army, air force, navy, artillery, tanks corps, and 
communications branch. Thus, he carried out a bold operation 
that cannot be found in any history of the building of the 
military in the world nations. 
  Under such a wise leadership by the dear comrade leader, our 
People's Army has been strengthened and developed into a 
powerful army equipped with modern arms and equipment. 
  Military delegations from foreign countries, who attended 
the 
military parade held to mark the 60th anniversary of the 
founding of the KPA, were struck with admiration for the fact 
that the People's Army is equipped with ultramodern weapons and 
all arms and equipment were domestic products. Head of a foreign 
military delegation said with admiration that even with armed 
forces mobilized in the military parade, one can carry out a 
large-scale war and win victory. 
  The dear comrade leader also wisely led the work of 
fortification of military encampment. The dear comrade leader 
saw to it that the work of fortification of military encampment 
is carried out not only as the work of the People's Army but 
also as that of entire party, the whole nation and all the 
people. Besides, he saw to it that the whole nation is firmly 
fortified so that manpower and firing positions not only in 
frontline area but also every place throughout the country can 
be reliably protected from any modern firing means and that any 
enemy who may sneak in with superior forces be smashed in all 
places in a one-a-match-for-100 manner. 
  As the result of this, all soldiers of the People's Army 
have 
been firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically; 
arms and equipment have been modernized at a high level, and 
military encampment has been fortified. Thus, the People's Army 
has been fostered to be an unrivaled indomitable army. All this 
is attributable to the fact that the People's Army is upholding 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at its van as the great 
sagacious commander. 
  Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, our 
People's Army has been strengthened and developed into 
one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary army with traits as the army 
of the leader, of the party and of the people both in name and 
reality and with indomitable military power. As the result, a 
reliable guarantee is provided for firmly defending our-style 
socialism and for expediting the historic cause of national 
reunification. 
  Indeed, by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as 
supreme commander of the KPA and as chairman of the nation's 
Defense Commission, our People's Army today has been 
strengthened and developed into invincible ever-victorious 
revolutionary armed forces.

<F P=106> ["Wealth Serves People in Korea" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- All the lines and 
policies shaped in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
wholly serve for defending the interests of the people. All the 
wealth of the nation is used solely for the promotion of the 
welfare and health of the people. 
  This is an eloquent proof of the politics of love for the 
people pursued by dear Comrade Kim Chong-il who put up the 
people as the most beautiful and excellent beings in the world 
and deeply worships them. 
  The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital called the cradle of 
happiness is associated with the great love of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il for the people. 
  One day when the construction of the hospital was 
progressing 
in the finishing stage, Comrade Kim Chong-il acquainted himself 
with the inventory of the equipment of the hospital and its 
interior designs. Learning that the floors of some corridors 
were designed to be covered with artificial stones, he gave 
instructions to pave all the corridors and stairways with 
marbles, saying that the hospital was a palace for the "king" of 
the country and marbles must not be spared for it. He earnestly 
said that, although its construction costed a great deal, we 
should spare nothing for the children and it should be decorated 
with jewels. 
  Under his loving care, the floor of the central hall of the 
hospital was adorned with a big "jewel carpet" with pictures of 
magnolia, camellia, broad bellflower and ginko leaves done with 
35 tons of rare natural jewels with a large chandelier with 
brilliant beads hanging over them. 
  He holds children dearer than jewels and places the 
happiness 
of the working people above money. 
  One of the legendary stories about the love of humanity on 
this land is that he blasted ten sintering furnaces at the Nampo 
smeltering complex years ago. While giving on-the-spot guidance 
to the complex, he found that a small amount of gas was leaking 
from the sintering furnaces for non-ferrous metal. Saying that 
although the sintering furnaces were valuable assets of the 
country, health of each worker is more precious than wealth, he 
gave instructions to blow up all of them. 
  Such politics of love has produced many legendary stories in 
Korea. To cite a few examples: A mine which held a big share 
in the nation's ore production, was closed for the environment 
of a workers' district, a school was set up for two children, 
military helicopters and special trains were sent for human 
lives and a large trading ship changed its course to save a 
crewman from a critical condition while sailing the ocean. 
  This is why the Korean people are sincerely following 
Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, looking up to him as the father of the nation.

policies for them. All the popular policies and measures taken 
in our country and deep concern and meticulous care of our party 
and state for all the households and population are a precious 
fruition of the great father's benevolent politics. 
  With the people's living standards rising, the dear leader 
has shown deep care to give them greater joy and happiness. 
Today our people are firmly convinced of a better future from 
our party's revolutionary economic strategy unfolded by the

Our society, which has formed a great family with Comrade Kim 
Chong-il as its father, is a land of worthy life of the people 
never known in history. 
  It is the unshakable faith and will of our people to remain

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- "Mupo Revolutionary 
Site," a monument marking a revolutionary site, was successfully 
built in Mupo, Yanggang Province, a historical place associated 
with the revolutionary history of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  In May 1939, during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, when 
President Kim Il-song was organising and commanding offensive 
operations in Musan area in the northern part of Korea, he 
bivouacked a night with the main unit of the Korean People's 
Revolutionary Army in Mupo and visited there again in August 
1963 and in June 1972, after the liberation of the country. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il who came there on September 4, 1971, 
elaborated on a far-reaching plan of proclaiming the modelling 
of the whole society on the chuche idea as the supreme platform 
of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] on the basis of a deep 
analysis of the historical position and significance of the 
great revolutionary idea of the respected leader President Kim 
Il-song and his revolutionary exploits. 
  In February, 1974, Comrade Kim Chong-il declared the 
programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea on 
the basis of a scientific penetration into the subjective and 
objective requirements of the development of revolution in Korea. 
  The monument marking the revolutionary site was unveiled 
with 
due ceremony on the spot Sunday. 
  Addressing the ceremony, Yi Kil-song, chief secretary of the 
Yanggang Provincial Committee of the WPK and chairman of the 
Yanggang Provincial People's Committee, said the immortal 
revolutionary exploits of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
who proclaimed the modelling of the whole society on the chuche 
idea as the supreme programme of the WPK and opened the road of 
a new historical march of the Korean revolution would be 
immortal and shine long the history of the country.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- U.S. officials warned 
of retaliation against Japan on Friday [11 February] following 
the collapse of talks on a new bilateral trade framework. The 
senior officials, speaking shortly after President Bill Clinton 
and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed regrets 
about the collapse of the talks, said Washington may act against 
Tokyo by July. 
  Meanwhile, Japan's Vice Trade Minister for International 
Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu said at a news briefing that if the 
U.S. takes unilateral punitive steps, Japan will bring the case 
to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). "We're 
reviewing all our options and will proceed promptly," a senior 
U.S. official said. 
  U.S. officials emphasized that the U.S. will act before the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes its annual 
summit meeting in Naples in early July. 
  The officials, briefing reporters on the Hosokawa-Clinton 
summit, declined to disclose the specific actions under 
consideration but said they range from unilateral to 
multilateral moves. 
  While refusing to comment on whether U.S. trade sanctions 
are 
included in the U.S. options, a senior U.S. administration 
official said the threat of trade sanctions has been effective 
in opening foreign markets. He cited examples such as the 
threat to impose trade sanctions that U.S. officials said 
resulted in the opening of the Japanese construction market to 
foreign firms. 
  The U.S. officials also said Washington will "reassess the 
viability" of the whole framework trade accord if Japan does not 
accept the types of "objective criteria" the U.S. has proposed 
to measure the progress of imports in Japan. 
  Clinton told reporters after the summit meeting with 
Hosokawa 
that indicators the United States has proposed for measuring 
that the Japanese market is receptive to foreign goods include 
the level of imports, the state of domestic demand in Japan, 
exchange rate movements and efforts of U.S. firms to compete in 
the Japanese market. 
  Japan has rejected the U.S. call for adoption of "objective 
criteria" as unacceptable, saying they amount to setting import 
targets and managed trade. 
  U.S. administration officials said Washington will not 
reopen 
the framework negotiations unless Tokyo changes its position. 
The U.S. is not prepared to continue the negotiations "under 
the present circumstances," one senior U.S. official said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 13 KYODO -- A senior White House 
official on Sunday [13 February] denied a newspaper report that 
the administration of President Bill Clinton has decided to 
retaliate against Japan with sanctions on some imports. No 
decision has been made, said the official, who declined to be 
identified, adding it will take some time to review the 
unsuccessful conclusion of bilateral framework trade talks. 
  The administration plans to hold an interagency meeting as 
early as Monday to discuss what to do following the talks, he 
said. 
  He was commenting on a WASHINGTON POST report Saturday. The 
paper quoted U.S. officials as saying one option would be to 
announce Tuesday an intention to impose penalty duties on 
selected Japanese products if it is decided that a 1989 
agreement to open the cellular telephone market to the U.S. firm 
Motorola Inc. has been violated.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe said Monday [14 February] the United States will 
take retaliatory action against Japan for the failure over the 
weekend to reach agreement on the bilateral trade "framework." 
  Watanabe, head of one of the major factions in the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said, "we cannot make such 
an easy-going remark that (U.S.-Japan) relations are mature ones 
between adults." 
  "The other side will surely take retaliatory action" against 
Japan, he said. 
  Watanabe, speaking at a lecture in a Tokyo hotel, said he is 
opposed to the setting of numerical targets as demanded by the 
U.S. to gauge the openness of Japanese markets. 
  He said Washington has been preoccupied with the idea that 
Japan will not give in to U.S. demands unless threatened. 
  Watanabe was deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign 
minister under Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa between 1991 and 
1993. 
  On Friday, trade ties between Japan and the U.S. suffered a 
sharp setback after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new 
"framework" to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the 
share of imports in its markets. 
  Japan has rejected a U.S. demand to set up numerical targets 
to measure the openness of Japanese markets of three sectors -- 
autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of 
telecommunication and medical equipment.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The U.S. Government is 
poised to cite Japan for breaching a 1989 accord meant to boost 
imports of U.S. cellular phones, a move that would result in 
punitive action unless a settlement is reached. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has scheduled a 
press 
conference at 2 P.M. Tuesday (4 A.M. Wednesday Japan time) to 
announce results of a U.S. probe into allegations by major U.S. 
cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. of unfair competition in the 
Japanese market. U.S. press reports said Kantor has decided to 
initiate sanctions. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama said he 
has told the United States that Japan would take the issue to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington 
took punitive action on the matter. The move, which is outside 
the so-called "framework" trade talks, marks Washington's first 
trade action against Japan following the collapse on Friday [11 
February] of trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's global 
trade surplus. 
  Washington has complained that sales in Japan of Motorola 
cellular phones have been markedly smaller than those made by 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
  The U.S. Government may levy higher tariffs on Japanese 
cellular phone imports in line with the 1974 Omnibus Trade Act. 
U.S. trade laws also allow the government to impose retaliatory 
tariffs in fields other than telecommunications, such as on 
autos and auto parts. 
  In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura warned 
Washington on Tuesday against "taking unilateral retaliatory 
action," saying such a move would close the door to dialogue 
between the two nations. 
  A senior official at the Japanese Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry said he believes sanctions by the U.S. would 
be counterproductive, arguing that would ultimately hurt U.S. 
manufacturers. 
  If the U.S. raises tariffs on Japanese auto parts, a move 
possible under U.S. trade law, it would affect U.S. automakers 
and even trigger possible layoffs in the U.S. auto industry, he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa downplayed concern Tuesday [15 February] over 
threatened retaliation by the United States against Japan over 
what is viewed as its closed mobile phone market. Hosokawa 
said, "the basic relationship between Japan and the U.S. will 
not be impaired if trade ties deteriorate a bit." 
  In the wake of the breakdown of the bilateral "framework" 
trade talks, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday he is 
weighing up the possibility of introducing sanctions against 
Japan, because of its restricted foreign entry in the cellular 
phone market.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The United States is 
likely to announce punitive steps against Japan on Tuesday [15 
February] for what it views as the closed nature of Japan's 
mobile phone market, a senior trade ministry official said. 
  Washington may put higher tariffs on Japanese imports in 
line 
with a telecommunications clause of the trade act, said the 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, 
who declined to be named. But the steps will eventually hurt 
U.S. manufacturers, the official said, by preventing their 
access to Japanese products. 
  The U.S. telecommunications clause allows the government to 
impose retaliatory tariffs in fields other than 
telecommunications, such as on autos and auto parts. Higher 
tariffs on Japanese-made auto components, for example, are more 
likely to affect the U.S. auto industry, increasing unemployment 
in the country, he said. 
  Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs 
and Trade if the U.S. takes retaliatory steps, said the official. 
  Washington has complained that sales in Japan of mobile 
phones developed by Motorola Inc. of the U.S. have been markedly 
smaller than those made by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The United States should 
refrain from taking retaliatory action against Japan's mobile 
phone market because Tokyo is willing to seriously tackle the 
issue, the top government spokesman said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  "We do not have an understanding yet that the U.S. 
Government 
officially approved such action," Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. But "I hope the U.S. 
side will refrain from taking unilateral action of retaliation." 
  He said such action would close the door to dialogue between 
the two nations. 
  The U.S. is considering taking retaliatory action against 
Japan's cellular phone market, saying full foreign participation 
in the market is restricted. The move comes after the breakdown 
of trade negotiations held under a bilateral framework trade 
accord concluded last July. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Monday Japan will make 
voluntary efforts to whittle down its trade surplus with the 
U.S. before the summit of the Group of Seven major economic 
powers in Naples, Italy, in July.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States agreed Friday [11 February] to cooperate on global issues 
in 15 fields, including AIDS and population problems, saving the 
bilateral framework talks from ending in a complete flunk. The 
two governments agreed on the global cooperation, one of three 
pillars in the trade framework negotiations along with 
macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, at the summit talks 
between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  Under the accord, Japan and the U.S. together will offer 12 
billion dollars over seven years to tackle issues involving AIDS 
and population problems. Of the total amount, the U.S. is to 
disburse 9 billion dollars and Japan will offer 3 billion 
dollars. 
  The two countries will also cooperate in developing 
environmental technologies and developing human resources. 
  Tokyo and Washington failed to strike a deal on the other 
areas of the framework talks to slash Japan's huge trade surplus 
and boost the share of imports in its markets. The two sides 
remain deadlocked over the definition of "objective criteria" in 
accessing foreign access to Japanese markets such as autos and 
auto parts, insurance and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japanese business 
leaders appealed Saturday [12 February] for continued dialogue 
between Japan and the U.S. while reacting with calm to the two 
sides' failure to reach agreement on a new trade framework. The 
appeal came after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton failed at their summit in Washington 
Friday to resolve a dispute over "objective criteria" demanded 
by the United States to measure progress in reducing Japan's 
trade surplus. 
  "They should continue their dialogue from a viewpoint that 
Japan-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral 
relationship for both countries," said Takeshi Nagano, president 
of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren). 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), described the failure to reach 
agreement over "objective criteria" unavoidable. "This is 
because Japan has stuck to its policy of rejecting the U.S. 
managed trade-like approach. It's unavoidable," Hiraiwa said in 
a statement. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, concerned about a possible U.S. move to take 
retaliatory action against Japan, expressed hope that the U.S. 
will use "good sense" in settling trade issues. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, meanwhile, 
praised the Japanese negotiators for refusing the U.S. demand 
that numerical targets be set to measure progress in the opening 
of Japan's auto and auto parts markets. 
  In a statement, it expressed regret that Japan has failed to 
obtain U.S. understanding of the industry group's position. 
  It also expressed the hope that the breakdown in the auto 
trade negotiations will not cause the U.S. to impose trade 
sanctions and take other unilateral action against Japan. Such 
action would contravene the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) for liberalizing world trade, the association said. 
  Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., also 
expressed regret over the failure of the talks and promised 
continued efforts to promote overseas production of Japanese 
automobiles and expand auto imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
President Yohei Kono voiced his regret Saturday [12 February] 
over the failure of Japan and the United States to reach accord 
on a "framework" agreement to slash Japan's trade surplus and 
open its markets. In his statement, the leader of the main 
opposition party blamed the failure on the government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, saying the cabinet relied on the 
bureaucracy to settle the trade talks and abandoned its 
political responsibility. 
  Kono, rejecting Hosokawa's tacit criticism against past LDP 
governments, said it was a denial of cooperative ties between 
Japan and the United States built up while the LDP was in power. 
  At a press conference with President Bill Clinton in 
Washington, Hosokawa said, "in the past, Japan and the U.S. 
sometimes have reached ambiguous agreements which can gloss 
over the problems at the time only to find them sources of later 
misunderstandings between our two countries." Kono said 
Hosokawa's remark "insults the Japan-U.S. relationship." 
  But the opposition leader also called it "natural" for Japan 
to reject the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to 
measure the openness of Japanese markets to imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has expressed doubts to Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa over Japan's one-year income and other tax cuts, 
Japanese Government sources said Saturday [12 February]. 
Clinton and Hosokawa met for three hours Friday at the White 
House in a formal summit for discussions focusing on economic 
issues, including the tax cuts for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1. 
  The sources told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Clinton expressed 
concern that the tax cuts might help boost savings by Japanese, 
instead of increasing consumer spending as intended. They said 
Clinton indicated that the one-year tax cuts were not enough. 
  The 20 percent income and residential tax cuts, totaling 
5.47 
trillion yen, were included in Japan's latest pump-priming 
package announced Tuesday, totaling a record 15.25 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister 
Saturday [12 February] stressed the need to resume at an early 
date Japan- U.S. trade framework negotiations that the two 
nations' leaders failed to clinch an agreement on in Washington 
the previous day. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
said at a hurriedly called press conference, "We should not 
leave the talks alone for a long time, despite the need for both 
sides to cool down." 
  "We want to resume (the talks) as soon as possible, keeping 
an eye on discussions on the U.S. side," Kumagai said. 
  Kumagai suggested he will start refining Japan's strategies 
for the bilateral negotiations, in the case that they are 
resumed, soon after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata return to Tokyo. 
  Asked about possible increased pressure on Japan as a result 
of the failure at the summit, Kumagai said, "We cannot tell how 
the U.S. Congress will react. For the time being, we will wait 
and see the movement of the U.S. administration." 
  Kumagai said Hosokawa's cabinet will try to keep the U.S. 
side from enacting tough policies against Japan, including 
revival of the so-called Super 301 trade retaliation clause 
imposed against countries considered to practice unfair trade. 
  "The Japanese side has to convey (to the U.S. Government) 
our efforts to correct the trade imbalance," Kumagai said. 
  On the outlook of Japan-U.S. relations, Kumagai said, "We 
have to make efforts to find a compromise after clarifying 
differences in opinion, not making conflicts in interest 
ambiguous as before."

  [Text] The business community supports Japan's position of 
rejecting the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to the 
last, but increasingly guards against growing tensions in the 
Japan-U.S. economic relations. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan, said: Japan has carried through its 
stance against the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets 
which could lead to managed trade. As a result, the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks failed to hammer out an accord and I 
think that it was inevitable. 
  Commenting on the future economic relations between Japan 
and 
the United States, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan 
Federation of Employers Association, said: I cannot help but 
say that the Japan-U.S. economic relations have entered a 
difficult situation. Mr. Nagano also expressed his caution 
against moves in the United States. 
  Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said: the U.S. Congress is moving toward imposing 
sanctions against Japan. We intend to use international trade 
rules to ask the U.S. Congress not to invoke sanctions against 
Japan. It is necessary for both Japan and the United States to 
make efforts to continue their discussions and build a firm 
cooperative relationship.

  [Text] Mamoru Makajima, chairman of the Policy Affairs 
Council of Secretaries of ruling coalition parties, has issued a 
statement. In the statement, Chairman Nakajima said: During the 
latest Japan-U.S. summit talks which were held in a friendly 
atmosphere, leaders of the two countries had a very sober 
exchange of their views and we would like to highly rate that. 
They affirmed the need for the two countries to maintain good 
relations in the future despite their failure to bridge their 
differences. We think their affirmation indicates that the 
Japan-U.S. relations are about to enter a new mature stage. 
  Commenting on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
Chairman Nakajima said: It is important for the two nations to 
have a cooling-off period and the governments of the two 
countries should discuss without haste ways to find areas of 
agreement. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Japan issued a statement in 
the name of Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the Policy Board. In 
the statement, Chairman Sekiyama said: We regret that the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which were high on the 
agenda of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, failed to hammer 
out an accord. Nonetheless, leaders of both Japan and the United 
States agreed to build a new relationship between the two 
countries under which the two countries frankly discuss what 
they can do and cannot do on the basis of their unwavering 
trust. We would like to highly rate that.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
business leaders exchanged words of complaint about U.S. access 
to Japan's markets as they met Monday [14 February] in 
preparation for a conference slated for this summer in Tokyo. 
  Japanese participants said U.S. businesspeople taking part 
in 
the closed-door session complained about slow progress in 
opening the Japanese markets for auto parts, insurance and 
electronics products. 
  On the other hand, the Japanese insisted that progress has 
been made in bilateral business cooperation to help U.S. firms 
do business in Japan, they said. 
  As for trade in autos, representatives from Japanese and 
U.S. 
automakers pointed accusing fingers at each other over why the 
U.S. share in Japan's auto market is so small. 
  Delegates from the "Big Three" U.S. Automakers said this is 
evidence of the closed nature of the Japanese market, but the 
Japanese pointed to the fact that the European share in Japan's 
auto market is the same as European makers have in the U.S. 
market. 
  Some 30 business leaders from the two countries are 
attending 
the two-day meeting, arranged by the Japan-U.S. Economic Council 
and the U.S.-Japan Economic Council and slated to end on Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa ordered members of his cabinet Tuesday [15 February] to 
come up with emergency plans to cut Japan's trade surplus with 
the United States, government officials said. 
  The order followed the yen's surge on the Tokyo foreign 
exchange market Tuesday to the 101 yen to 102 yen range against 
the dollar, stemming in part from the failure of Hosokawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton last week to reach accord on a 
bilateral trade framework. 
  Hosokawa issued the order at an informal meeting of cabinet 
ministers. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the meeting that Japan 
should take the initiative in reducing the surplus, regardless 
of the progress in the framework talks. Other cabinet ministers 
supported Hata's view, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 13 KYODO -- Nearly eight out of every 
10 people in Japan feel a sense of closeness to the United 
States, the Prime Minister's Office said in a report released 
Sunday [13 February]. 
  The results of the 1993 survey came just two days after 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton met 
in Washington but failed to find a breakthrough in stalled 
"framework" trade talks over a U.S. demand for setting 
"numerical targets" to assess the openness of Japan's markets. 
  The survey found 76.3 percent of respondents said they feel 
emotionally attached to the U.S., up 2.6 percentage points from 
a similar study two years ago. 
  The Prime Minister's Office conducted the nationwide survey 
from last September through October covering 3,000 people aged 
20 years or older, of which 2,134 or 71.1 percent responded. 
The poll has been taken annually since 1977. 
  An official of the government office attributed the slight 
rise in the figure to Clinton's pursuit of "change" in his 
nation and his fresh image, characteristics shared by Hosokawa. 
  The report also showed 68.6 percent see Japan-U.S. relations 
as favorable, up 6.1 points. 
  On the bilateral trade dispute, those believing the recent 
tough U.S. trade stance against Japan is understandable grew 
6.3 points to 36.8 percent. 
  In contrast, those who believe Washington has been acting 
emotionally on the trade row with Tokyo amounted to 35.2 
percent, down 7.2 points, according to the study. 
  The latest report said those feeling emotionally attached to 
Russia dropped 4.2 points to 11.0 percent, while those who do 
not feel close to Russia increased 5.2 points to 84.8 percent. 
  The survey also found that people's feelings of closeness to 
two major neighbors -- China and South Korea -- remained almost 
static. 
  On the other hand, those citing Asia as the region to which 
Tokyo should most channel its economic assistance leaped 4.9 
points to 54.5 percent, according to the report. 
  The study also revealed that 43.8 percent of the respondents 
believe Japan, as a member of the region, should promote 
economic cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries. 
  Those saying the current level of assistance to developing 
nations is sufficient, however, inched up 0.5 point to 45.6 
percent, while those seeking more active cooperation fell 2.6 
points to 32.6 percent. People seeing no need for such aid rose 
0.9 point to 12.1 percent. 
  The official of the Prime Minister's Office said the 
languishing economy was a major factor for the increasingly 
tight-fisted sentiment in Japan. 
  The report found 45.7 percent believe Japan should 
internationalize itself to fulfill its duty as a major global 
power, compared with the 44.1 percent posted in the last survey. 
  In response to a newly introduced question on which area 
Japan should internationalize itself most, 25.3 percent said the 
nation needs to pursue a greater political role -- through the 
expansion of its participation in the United Nations and 
disarmament efforts. 
  Concerning Japan's role in the international community, 48.4 
percent responded their country should contribute to resolving 
global problems such as environmental conservation. 
  Some 28.8 percent pointed to the need for personnel 
contribution and participation in U.N. peacekeeping activities, 
while 21.0 percent said economic assistance to developing 
nations is most needed.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Tuesday [15 February] issued a statement urging more than 60 
Japanese nationals residing in Serbia and Montenegro to evacuate 
in the wake of a possible air strike by NATO against Bosnian 
Serbs, Foreign Ministry officials said. The government issued 
the warning because of mounting tensions in the region following 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision last week to 
allow air strikes, the officials said. 
  According to the officials, there were 66 Japanese in Serbia 
as of December 1 last year. While there were no Japanese listed 
as residing in Montenegro, the area was included due to 
increased tensions there. 
  Those residing in Serbia include government officials, 
company officials and members of the press as well as their 
families, they said. 
  NATO warned the Serbs last week that its warplanes could 
bomb 
their heavy weapons supplies positioned around the besieged 
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo unless the weapons are withdrawn or 
put under U.N. command by February 21.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 13 KYODO -- It will be difficult for 
Japan to order a halt to remittances to North Korea from 
pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Sunday [13 February]. Takemura made the 
remark on a TV Asahi debate program, referring to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's comments on the issue in Washington in 
connection with possible sanctions against Pyongyang for 
refusing to accept international inspections of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  In a press conference in Washington on Saturday, after a 
breakfast meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Hosokawa 
expressed reservations in ordering a halt to the remittances, 
saying "I have not obtained a precise figure to show how much 
has been remitted from Japan." 
  "The government has to decide on its actions by taking into 
consideration the issue of human rights (of Korean residents)," 
Hosokawa said. 
  Takemura said, "the actual situation of remittances of 
Korean 
residents in Japan is not clear and thus (we) do not know what 
kind of steps are there (to halt them)." 
  "Hosokawa would have expressed the difficulty (in doing so) 
because (the matter) involves human right problems and money 
moves around the world," the chief government spokesman said. 
  Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy 
Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog, have been 
deadlocked because of Pyongyang's resistance to IAEA inspections 
of facilities suspected of developing nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan will donate 8.9 
million yen worth of relief assistance to Colombia to help it 
cope with the aftermath of mudslides and floods following heavy 
rains late last month, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday 
[10 February]. 
  The officials said the nation will donate blankets, sleeping 
mats and portable kerosene stoves for victims of the disaster, 
in which up to two dozen people died, many more went missing and 
thousands were left homeless. 
  Three days of heavy rains in the country's central Andean 
region caused the Fraile River to burst through its banks, 
sending forth a giant wave of mud and rocks that swept away 
hundreds of homes in such towns as Florida, Pradera and Tulua.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Supporters and opponents 
of national foundation day marked the national holiday Friday 
[11 February] with separate rallies feting national greatness or 
denouncing the country's inglorious military past. 
  Some 1,000 people including Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi 
Takemura attended a government-sponsored ceremony at the 
National Education Center in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward. 
  Takemura read out a congratulatory message from Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is currently in Washington for 
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  "To gain more trust from the international community, we 
have 
to go the limits to fulfill our responsibilities," the message 
said. 
  Also present at the ceremony were House of Councillors 
President Bumpei Hara and House of Representatives Vice Speaker 
Hyosuke Kujiraoka. 
  However, lower house Speaker Takako Doi, who has been 
criticizing the February 11 national holiday as an attempt to 
revive the Meiji- era empire day, celebrated until the end of 
World War II, missed the ceremonies due to other commitments. 
  A rally organized by the Social Democratic Party and 
citizens 
backing the country's pacifist Constitution criticized that 
Japan almost 50 years after the war has not "correctly" 
recognized its war responsibilities nor paid compensation to 
victims of Japanese occupation. 
  None of the six SDP cabinet members nor SDP Chairman 
Tomiichi 
Murayama was present at the meeting. 
  Some 450 people demonstrated in Shinjuku ward against the 
emperor and empress's use of a Self-Defense Forces aircraft to 
visit the Ogasawara islands from Saturday to pay respect to the 
souls of fallen Imperial Japanese Army troops.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The U.S. dollar opened 
at 102.32 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday [15 February], for its first 
fall below 103 yen in Tokyo since last August. [passage omitted 
on exchange rates] Some dealers reported the Bank of Japan was 
selling the yen to shore up the falling dollar. 
  The dollar's plunge follows the overnight trend in New York, 
where the U.S. currency plummeted to 101.10 yen at one point, 
nearing the record low in New York of 100.85 yen set on August 
17. 
  Dealers said market participants are betting on the yen 
rising further as the U.S. Government is likely to seek a 
stronger yen as a means of redressing the chronic trade 
imbalance between Japan and the United States. 
  Expectations of a stronger yen emerged after Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to 
resolve a trade row at their weekend summit in Washington. 
  Dealers said comments by Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the U.S. 
Council of Economic Advisers, also helped spark the 
dollar-selling.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday [15 February] he has a "serious concern" 
about the yen's advance against the U.S. dollar. Hosokawa was 
asked by reporters at his official residence for comment on 
exchange rates as the dollar fell below 103 yen in Tokyo Tuesday 
morning for the first time since last August. 
  Asked how the government plans to cope with the yen's rise, 
Hosokawa said he will make every effort to weather the adverse 
effects of the stronger yen on the economy. 
  The premier was asked whether he believes the yen's rise is 
the result of his failure to reach agreement with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton last week in Washington on a new framework for 
bilateral trade. "I believe it's not a question like that," 
Hosokawa said when asked whether he believes the yen's surge is 
a high price for saying "no" to Clinton over U.S. demands for 
numerical trade targets. 
  In a related development, a government source said the yen's 
surge is a concern and expressed hope that the dollar will stay 
at around 115 yen. 
  "I believe it (the stronger yen) will probably trouble the 
United States too. I believe they don't think it's OK to leave 
the situation as it is because it will lead to an erosion of 
confidence in the dollar," the source said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata predicted Tuesday [15 February] that foreign exchange 
markets, where the yen has been surging against the U.S. dollar, 
will naturally return to normal. 
  Hata told a press conference he thinks the currency markets 
will naturally return to normal as Japanese monetary authorities 
make close contacts with their counterparts in other countries. 
He said such a rapid surge in the yen against the dollar will 
greatly affect the lives of people in the United States. 
  Hata also criticized some comments by U.S. officials 
approving a higher yen against the dollar, saying those who have 
posts which could exert great influence on markets should be 
cautious in making comments.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Tuesday [15 February] termed the yen's recent rapid 
appreciation against the U.S. dollar undesirable for both the 
Japanese and global economy. 
  Japan will take suitable steps at the appropriate time, 
Fujii 
told a press conference after the day's cabinet meeting. But he 
denied that Tokyo has contacted other members of the Group of 
Seven leading nations to discuss the matter. 
  Fujii said the yen's sharp upswing reflects "speculative 
movements" by currency dealers. Any currency's exchange rate 
should mirror the country's economic fundamentals, he added. 
  The yen began soaring against the U.S. currency after the 
collapse of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks last Friday 
between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. It surged by 2.56 yen against the 
dollar in Tokyo on Monday and by a further 2.84 yen to finish 
Tuesday morning in Tokyo at 102.85 yen to the dollar. 
  Fujii said the government's latest 15.25 trillion yen 
stimulus package could not produce desired effects unless the 
yen-dollar rate stayed at levels reflecting each country's 
economic fundamentals. 
  The G-7 countries had agreed during their gathering last 
September that rapid exchange rate fluctuations are not 
desirable for the global economy, he said. 
  Fujii said he had heard nothing about possible U.S. 
sanctions 
against Japan in the field of autos and portable telephones. 
  Tokyo should do its utmost to dispel U.S. "misunderstanding" 
about Japan's trade stance, he said. 
  The finance minister confirmed a newspaper report that he 
received 10 million yen in political donations from a salt 
industry group last August. But he said a receipt was made 
following due accounting procedures.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Action should be taken to 
regain stability on the turbulent currency market, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  The top government spokesman told a news conference, "Sharp 
or unstable movements resulting from speculative transactions 
are not desirable." He said there is a need to make the yen's 
movements against the dollar stable through appropriate measures. 
  In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar fell momentarily below 102 
yen for the first time since last August, and ended the morning 
session at 102.85 yen, down 2.84 yen from Monday's close. 
  The dollar has been under strong downward pressure against 
the yen since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton failed last Friday to reach an accord on 
a new framework to slash Japan's bilateral trade surplus and 
boost the share of imports in its markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- A senior leader of the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesday [15 
February] slammed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for not 
holding talks with the United States on the yen's surge against 
the U.S. dollar. 
  "I cannot believe the premier and the foreign minister have 
not strongly conveyed Japan's stance on the yen's appreciation," 
LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. "If 
Japan-U.S. relations are really mature, they should have talked 
about how to deal with the yen's surge" with the U.S. side when 
they visited Washington last week, Mori added. 
  The U.S. currency dropped sharply against the yen in Tokyo 
on 
Tuesday, closing at 102.02 yen, down 3.67 yen from Monday's 
close. 
  The dollar has been under intense downward pressure against 
the yen since Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed 
last Friday to strike a deal on a new framework to reduce 
Japan's huge trade surplus and increase the share of imports in 
its markets.

Hosokawa said Tuesday night [15 February] he will carefully 
watch developments in the foreign exchange market before taking 
any measures concerning the rocketing yen. 
  Hosokawa said he has not yet directed the taking of concrete 
steps to arrest the yen, which closed at 102.02 yen to the 
dollar in Tokyo the same day, up 3.67 yen from Monday's close. 
  "It seems the yen is being bought on speculation. I want to 
deal with the problem after carefully watching further 
developments," he told reporters at his official residence.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The yen's current strength 
against the U.S. dollar will not last long, Japan's trade 
minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  The dollar fell Tuesday morning in Tokyo to a momentary low 
of 101.90 yen, finishing the morning at 102.85 yen, down 2.84 
yen from Monday's close. 
  The International Trade and Industry minister told reporters 
that the current level is untenable since it does not reflect 
Japan's economic fundamentals. 
  A level of 100 yen to the dollar would be a major 
psychological barrier, he said. 
  Kumagai said, however, that speculative moves in the market 
to take advantage of the yen's surge could put Japan in serious 
trouble, adding Japan's monetary authorities should try to 
prevent such moves.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry on 
Saturday [12 February] revived appropriations of some 2.8 
billion yen for the draft foreign aid budget for fiscal 1994, 
while tacking some 700 million yen onto the defense budget, 
ministry official said. 
  The agreements came amid annual bargaining between the 
ministry's budget drafters, the Defense Agency and the Foreign 
Ministry prior to government approval of the fiscal 1994 state 
budget, slated to come during a cabinet meeting Tuesday. 
  On Thursday, the ministry proposed fiscal 1994 Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) spending of 1.05 trillion yen, up 
by a record low 4.0 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 ODA 
budget. 
  The agreed-upon budgetary revival calls for adding 1.09 
billion yen for Japan's refugee assistance program and an 
additional 1.7 billion yen for grants to poor countries. 
  The agreements also authorize the Defense Agency to spend an 
additional 273 million yen to finance a noise abatement program 
to ease the troubles of residents in areas surrounding U.S. or 
Japanese military bases, the officials said. 
  The ministry earlier proposed a defense budget of 4.68 
trillion yen, up 0.8 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  It was the first time in 34 years that the growth of Japan's 
defense budget failed to rise above the 1-percent mark, the 
officials said. In fiscal 1960, Japan's defense budget eked out 
a tiny 0.6 percent rise. 
  The ministry also approved additional spending of 424 
million 
yen to finance a personnel training and recruitment program for 
the self-defense forces, they said. 
  The budget drafters have been in negotiations with officials 
from other ministries and agencies since Friday after the 
ministry Thursday proposed a 73.08 trillion yen draft budget for 
the next fiscal year that will start on April 1. 
  The draft budget projects a mere 1.0 percent growth but 
virtually shrinks from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. 
  In Saturday's negotiations, the Finance Ministry also 
approved the restoration of a 140 million yen budget request 
made by the environment agency for improving environmental 
information systems. 
  Among other restorations of budget requests, the ministry 
approved the Health and Welfare Ministry's request for a 1,150 
million yen budget for improving the infrastructure for the 
handicapped and the elderly.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japan's fiscal 1994 budget 
will incorporate 140.52 million yen for projects linked to the 
repatriation of ethnic Koreans who were left on Sakhalin after 
Japan's defeat in World War II, officials said Monday [14 
February]. 
  The amount represents an increase of some 15.15 million yen 
over fiscal 1993, the officials said. 
  At a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to adopt the 73.08 
trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1 and 
lasts through March 31, 1995. 
  The increase results mainly from 20.52 million yen earmarked 
for surveys about the number of Sakhalin Koreans willing to 
return to South Korea and prospective places of resettlement. 
The amount provided for "survey costs" is four times higher 
than in fiscal 1993. 
  In contrast, funds for temporary visits to South Korea will 
remain at 120 million yen as in fiscal 1993. 
  An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Koreans were left on Sakhalin 
island, the southern half of which was Japanese territory until 
the end of World War II. 
  In a joint survey with South Korea several thousand Sakhalin 
Koreans, mainly from the first generation, expressed hopes to 
return to South Korea. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, who is also secretary 
general of a legislators' group for Sakhalin Koreans, welcomed 
the government decision. 
  "The Hosokawa cabinet has been active in revising views on 
(unresolved) postwar issues but has not come much further than 
offering apologies. Such concrete results are rare," he said. 
  The Diet is expected to begin debate on the fiscal 1994 
budget in early March. 
  Japan, which ruled the whole Korean peninsula between 1910 
and 1945, took the Koreans to Sakhalin before the war as hard 
labor workers, mostly in mines, but left them behind when the 
island came under Soviet rule. 
  Repatriation talks have gained speed recently as Seoul, 
Tokyo 
and Moscow agreed to deal with the issue in trilateral 
negotiations. 
  During most of the Soviet era, the Sakhalin Koreans were not 
allowed to contact relatives in South Korea because Moscow only 
recognized North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The cabinet approved on 
Tuesday [15 February] a fiscal 1994 defense budget proposal of 
4,683.5 billion yen, up 0.9 percent over the initial fiscal 1993 
budget and the smallest rate of increase in 34 years. 
  In line with Japan's 1990-1995 defense buildup plan, the 
budget proposal sets aside 882 billion yen to acquire front-line 
weapons, including four F-15 jet fighters and two Boeing E-767 
AWACS reconnaissance planes, officials said. 
  The purchases will double the number of AWACS planes, which 
could be used to detect a possible firing of North Korean 
missiles or an intrusion by Russian jet bombers or missiles into 
Japanese airspace, the officials said. 
  In view of "still unstable security factors surrounding 
Japan," the government sanctioned a Defense Agency request to 
purchase new radar for its Patriot antimissile system and 
sophisticated computer software to enhance the intercepting 
capability of Japan's armory of 320 Patriot missiles, an 
official said. 
  Under the current five-year defense buildup plan, officials 
said, Japan is trying to expand the Patriot armory from 16 to 26 
firing units -- or a total of 520 Patriots to be fired from 130 
mobile launching vehicles. 
  The fresh Patriot radar and firing control system will cost 
33.5 billion yen, while a set of Patriot parts and computer 
software will cost 8.7 billion yen, they said. 
  The software will raise the capability of eight of Japan's 
Patriot units to the level of the PAC-2 Patriot missiles -- the 
same models used by U.S. troops during the 1991 Gulf war to 
knock out Iraqi SCUD missiles, they said. 
  One firing unit comprises five mobile launching vehicles, a 
phased array antenna, 20 missiles and another radar vehicle. 
  But unless Japan acquired the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) 
system -- an improved version of the PAC-2 Patriot -- it would 
not be able to shoot down North Korean Nodong-1 missiles, which 
are reportedly capable of delivering nuclear warheads, they said. 
  North Korea is now under international pressure to allow 
inspections of suspected nuclear weapons plants in Yongbyon, 
some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  Yoshiaki Hotsuki, special assistant for the defense buildup 
program of the agency's defense policy bureau, told reporters, 
"the PAC-2 Patriot system cannot repel the Nodong missile, so we 
are watching how far the United States has developed the TMD 
system." 
  The Defense Agency had originally pushed for purchases of 
the 
AWACS and Patriots to counter the threat of Russian jet bombers 
and missiles, whose longer ranges are seen placing a greater 
limit on Japan's intercepting time and capability, the officials 
said. 
  Now the agency says the North Korean missiles have given it 
another headache. The 1993 defense white paper warned, "the 
Nodong missile will be able to reach most parts of Japanese 
territory if Pyongyang deploys it to specific areas on its soil." 
  The fiscal 1994 defense budget accounts for 0.948 percent of 
Japan's estimated gross national product (GNP) for fiscal 1994. 
  Meanwhile, the budget boosts its allocations toward the 
costs 
of U.S. Forces in Japan by 8 percent to 432.4 billion yen. 
  Of this sum, 123.4 billion yen is to pay 75 percent of the 
labor costs of some 22,000 Japanese employees at U.S. bases in 
Japan, utilities and other costs.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government on Tuesday 
[15 February] proposed to spend 1,063 billion yen for Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) in fiscal 1994, a record low 
increase of 4.8 percent over the current fiscal year's initial 
budget. 
  The ODA or foreign aid budget, included in the government's 
draft proposal for the overall general account budget for fiscal 
1994, which starts April 1, was approved by the cabinet earlier 
in the day for submission to the Diet. 
  Finance Ministry officials said that despite the record low 
rise in yen terms, the Japanese currency's 13 percent 
appreciation against the dollar over the past year will mean a 
significantly higher ODA outlay in terms of the U.S. currency. 
  They estimated the dollar-denominated increase at 6.3 
percent 
or more, depending on the manner of calculation. In fiscal 
1993, the ODA budget posted a 6.5 percent increase, continuing a 
downward trend that began in 1990. 
  Officials said the proposed budget should provide sufficient 
momentum toward achieving Japan's fifth medium-term target of 
disbursing 70 billion to 75 billion dollars in ODA to the 
developing world between 1993 and 1997. 
  It is also expected that under the plan Japan will remain 
the 
world's largest ODA supplier, they said. 
  Officials said the proposed ODA outlay, which was allowed 
the 
highest increase rate among major expenditure categories in the 
overall budget, shows the government's resolve to strengthen 
Japan's international contributions despite severe fiscal 
constraints at home. 
  The various government ministries and agencies engaged in 
extension of foreign aid had initially asked the Finance 
Ministry to approve an 8.3 percent budgetary increase to 1.098 
trillion yen. 
  A top priority in the fiscal 1994 ODA budget is support for 
human resource development in developing countries, officials 
said. 
  They said that explains the relatively high 6.7 percent 
boost 
to 311.7 billion yen in funding for technical assistance 
programs implemented by the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency and other organizations. 
  The budget proposal earmarked an additional 207.9 billion 
yen 
for bilateral grant assistance, which amounts to a more modest 
3.2 percent increase over the figure in the current budget. 
  But officials pointed out that the bilateral grant figure 
includes a number of major hikes, such as 5.3 billion yen for 
relief assistance to disaster victims and refugees, up 37.5 
percent, and 1.5 billion yen in support for small-scale grant 
projects conducted largely by nongovernmental organizations, up 
50 percent. 
  According to the draft, cash contributions and donations to 
international organizations are to be increased by only 3.5 
percent in yen terms, but by a whopping 19 percent in dollar 
terms. 
  Officials said the beneficiaries will be organizations 
tackling such global issues as the environment, population and 
aids, as well as human rights protection and refugee relief. 
  For example, Japan's contribution to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which is headed by Japanese 
national Sadako Ogata, is set to rise by 20.5 percent to 100 
million dollars in the draft. 
  Another example is a 59.3 percent increase to 36 million 
dollars in Japan's contribution to a fund set up in the United 
Nations for protection of the environment. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata welcomed the budget, saying 
the 
fresh emphasis on such issues as the environment, aids and the 
status of women lends a needed "human touch" to Japan's ODA 
program. 
  Hata said it also reflects the transfer of power to the 
present coalition government. He credited coalition members 
with strongly promoting new allocations or vast increases in 
funding for the various "new tasks faced by international 
society." 
  The most massive increase posted in the budget was a 500 
percent increase to 15 million dollars in support for 
Palestinian development projects. It was also proposed to boost 
relief aid for refugees in the Middle East by 66.7 percent to 20 
million dollars. 
  The government's draft budget suggested that low-interest 
loans, a key component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 4.7 
percent to 368.3 billion yen. 
  Officials pointed out that the general account budget for 
ODA 
is only one indicator of the scale of Japan's overseas 
assistance program. 
  The ODA operating budget, which is normally used for that 
purpose, combines funds from the general account budget with 
funds from such sources as special account budgets of individual 
ministries and borrowings from the government's fiscal 
investment and loan program.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Business leaders reacted 
favorably Tuesday [15 February] to the 73.08 trillion yen 
national budget plan for fiscal 1994, saying it provides 
adequate stimulus for boosting the nation's ailing economy. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the influential Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "overall, the budget 
plan attaches importance to the need to stimulate the economy 
and improve social infrastructure." 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the budget is well balanced. "Although austere 
in general, it allows for more than 4.0 percent growth in 
expenses for public works projects," he said. 
  Inaba said, however, that the outlay for public works should 
have been weighted toward projects that improve citizens' 
livelihood. 
  "The administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
should have exercized more political leadership if it wanted to 
achieve the reforms it has pledged," he said. 
  Inaba called for early implementation of the budget, and 
said 
the government should also be prepared to respond to any 
volatile movement of the yen on foreign exchange markets or a 
slide in stock prices. 
  Hiraiwa also stressed that it is important for the 
government 
to introduce appropriate measures in a timely fashion. 
  He expressed concern that the sharp appreciation of the yen 
against the U.S. dollar in recent days may weaken the intended 
effects of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and 
the budget for fiscal 1994.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government launched a 
fiscal 1994 national budget Tuesday [15 February] featuring 
austere overall spending for the second straight year but tax 
cuts and relatively ample outlays to prop up the flagging 
economy. The budget plan, endorsed at a cabinet meeting for 
submission to the Diet in early March, earmarked 73,081.7 
billion yen for the year beginning April 1, up a scant 1 percent 
from the current year's initial budget. 
  This is higher than a 0.2 percent growth in the initial 1993 
budget, stemming largely from special accounting techniques such 
as advanced repayment of loans extended to local governments to 
boost the budget by some 4,520 billion yen. Without these 
measures, the overall program could have posted a contraction of 
some 5 percent, Finance Ministry officials said. 
  More clearly showing the constraints imposed by sluggish tax 
revenues amid the prolonged economic slump, general operating 
expenditures, the core of the budget, are limited to 40,854.8 
billion yen, up 2.3 percent or the lowest rise since fiscal 
1988. But in a bid to shore up the economy, the government 
maintains a growth rate in public works spending of 4 percent 
for the third straight year, with a figure of 8,984.6 billion 
yen, up 4.0 percent, and includes cuts in income tax and other 
taxes worth 4,377.0 billion yen. 
  As a result, the government is to issue deficit-covering 
bonds for the first time in five years to raise 3,133.8 billion 
yen. 
  Among other core outlays, the plan earmarks 4,683.5 billion 
yen for defense spending, an increase of 0.9 percent which is 
the lowest in 34 years, and 1,063.4 billion yen for Official 
Development Assistance (ODA), up 4.8 percent to mark a record 
low. 
  Outside the general operating expenditures, debt-service 
costs will shrink 7.0 percent to 14,360.2 billion yen, and tax 
grants to local governments will contract 18.3 percent to 
12,757.8 billion yen. 
  The plan also calls for repayment of 1,544.8 billion yen in 
funds borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund to 
cover revenue shortfalls in fiscal 1992. 
  On the revenue side, the government estimates tax revenues 
will amount to 53,665.0 billion yen, down 12.5 percent, and 
nontax revenues 5,601.1 billion yen, up 104.8 percent, and that 
it will get 172.5 billion yen, down 7.5 percent, in proceeds 
from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. 
  New bond issuances are to rise 67.8 percent to a record 
13,643.0 billion yen, including 10,509.2 billion yen in 
construction bonds, used primarily for public works, and 
deficit-financing bonds. 
  As a result, the debt dependency rate will rise to 18.7 
percent from this year's 11.2 percent, and the outstanding 
balance of bonds will top 200 trillion yen for the first time to 
reach some 201 trillion yen, up from 182 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government on Tuesday 
[15 February] adopted a fiscal investment and loan program for 
fiscal 1994 that gives higher priority to resuscitating the 
ailing economy and upgrading living standards. Ordinary "zaito" 
investment programs mainly to finance public works, housing 
projects and lending by government-affiliated financial organs 
were allocated 39,408.2 billion yen for the year beginning April 
1, up 7.7 percent from the initial fiscal 1993 zaito budget. 
  The Finance Ministry eventually agreed to add 260.3 billion 
yen to its draft ordinary zaito program worth 39,147.9 billion 
yen in negotiations with other government ministries and 
agencies on restoring cuts in their initial requests. 
  The upward revision focused on a record 630,000 home 
purchases covered by lending by the government-affiliated 
Housing Loan Corp. This compared with 550,000 homes in the 
initial fiscal 1993 budget and 560,000 in the fiscal 1994 draft 
budget. 
  In order to improve living standards in line with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's policy goal, the government secured 
a sharp 25.0 percent rise to 10,386.5 billion yen in 
housing-related projects. It earmarked 5,994.5 billion yen for 
lending and other programs for struggling small companies, up 
10.4 percent. 
  Outlays of 7,949.4 billion yen, up 12.2 percent, went to 
local public organizations and local public financial 
institutions to improve infrastructure related to living 
standards in regional areas. 
  Next year's zaito, often called the second national budget, 
was endorsed by a cabinet meeting Tuesday morning, and is 
expected to be submitted to the Diet in early March, together 
with the general-account budget. Overall zaito investment, or 
the sum including programs managed by the Finance Ministry's 
trust fund bureau, total 47,858.2 billion yen, up 4.6 percent. 
  The 7.7 percent growth in ordinary zaito investment compares 
with a 13.4 percent gain in fiscal 1993 and a 10.8 percent rise 
in fiscal 1992. But including fiscal investment newly approved 
under the economy-boosting third supplementary budget for the 
current year, ending March 31, ordinary zaito programs will 
total 40,403.1 billion yen for a marked growth of 10.4 percent. 
  The extra zaito program for this year should be combined 
with 
next year's program as a way to ensure continued implementation 
for 15 months from January 1994, an official at the Finance 
Ministry's budget bureau said. 
  The zaito program is intended to stimulate the economy for 
the fourth consecutive year, the official said. Of the parts of 
the program related to housing, the government budgeted a sharp 
29.8 percent increase to 8,963.2 billion yen for the Housing 
Loan Corp., compared with a 6.6 percent gain in the current year. 
  Housing investment for fiscal 1994 represents a record 33.51 
percent of the total ordinary zaito program, compared with the 
previous record rate of 32.6 percent in fiscal 1991. 
  Programs to assist financially squeezed small companies 
include a 10.6 percent gain to 3 trillion yen for the People's 
Finance Corp. and a 12.5 percent rise to 2,487 billion yen for 
the Japan Finance Corp. for Small Business. 
  A 15.6 percent growth to 156.0 billion yen was allocated for 
lending by the Japan Development Bank for manufacturers striving 
to create new businesses under restructuring efforts. 
  The Development Bank's lending quota was set at 620 billion 
yen for urban infrastructure improvement projects, up 9.9 
percent, and 277 billion yen for information and 
telecommunications infrastructure, up 20.4 percent. 
  The government earmarked outlays of 6.5 trillion yen for a 
growth of 14.0 percent in order to improve sewerage systems, 
waste disposal and health facilities. 
  Fiscal investment and loan programs for housing, health, 
culture, education and other matters designed to improve overall 
living standards account for a record 73.16 percent of the total 
ordinary zaito program, up from the current year's 68.8 percent 
and the previous high of 71.4 percent in fiscal 1991. 
  The zaito program contains 2 trillion yen in stock 
investment 
under new "shiteitan" accounts, a portfolio with no investment 
limits on stocks, down from 2.8 trillion yen. New shiteitan 
were created in 1992 as a means to bolster the stagnant stock 
market.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa met with a group of 
Japanese reporters who are accompanying him on his visit to 
Washington. During the meeting, the prime minister said he 
intends to set up a consultative body of the ruling coalition 
parties as soon as possible to discuss the issue of securing 
financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall arising 
from tax cuts. He also indicated that he hopes the consultative 
body will draw a conclusion on the issue before an extraordinary 
Diet session is convened in autumn. 
  As for the future realignment of political parties, the 
prime 
minister said: I think that the realignment of political parties 
will progress in parallel with progress in the demarcation of 
the single-seat constituency. I think that there will be some 
moves toward the realignment of political parties before the 
current ordinary Diet session ends. My frank feeling is that if 
the ruling coalition parties fail to hold themselves together, 
they would be unable to fight in elections. 
  With regard to the timing for the dissolution of the House 
of 
Representative and general elections, the prime minister said: I 
am not thinking of holding the general elections. Asked by one 
of the reporters about the relationship between the enactment of 
a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituency and the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives, the prime minister 
said: There will be three months of notice. I will have to think 
of dissolving the lower house based on that. It will be a 
question of political timing for the dissolution of the House of 
Representative after the passage of three months. 
  On the cabinet reshuffle, the prime minister said he is not 
considering it.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday [15 February] admitted that he sounded out 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on a cabinet reshuffle. But 
earlier in the day, Hosokawa told reporters that he is neutral 
on whether he should reshuffle his six-month-old cabinet within 
Tuesday. 
  Hosokawa said Monday he was considering an early cabinet 
reshuffle, which many political sources said may affect Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, the largest bloc 
in the seven-party coalition, on Monday denied there would be an 
early reshuffle. 
  Speculation surfaced Monday that Hosokawa might make changes 
in his cabinet after Tuesday's adoption by the government of a 
73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1. 
  The SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper, quoting sources close to 
Hosokawa, reported earlier Monday that Hosokawa is resolved to 
reshape the cabinet as early as Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa expressed his desire Tuesday [15 February] to reshuffle 
his six-month-old cabinet, a move which is likely to escalate a 
power struggle among the ruling parties. "I would like to 
contemplate the decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a 
comprehensive point of view," Hosokawa said at a ministerial 
meeting. 
  Speculation has been surfacing that Hosokawa might make 
changes to his cabinet following Tuesday's approval by the 
government of a 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which 
begins April 1. Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key 
strategist in the coalition government, also supported 
Hosokawa's policy, saying, "It is the premier's exclusive right 
(to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will follow his judgment 
entirely." 
  There have been increasing rumors that, if a new cabinet is 
formed, Hosokawa will replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, head of Sakigake, and six other cabinet ministers of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP). 
  Takemura, along with the six SDP ministers, expressed 
dissatisfaction earlier this month with Hosokawa's handling of 
the consumption tax issue as a quick solution to offset tax 
shortfalls created by income tax breaks. 
  Asked about the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle, Takemura 
told a regular press conference on Tuesday that "although it is 
the premier's prerogative it is still preferable to get people's 
understanding." 
  Fearing the dismissal of their party head Takemura, Sakigake 
held an emergency meeting of its Diet members Tuesday morning 
and decided to oppose the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this 
time. Sakigake officials also hinted the party might withdraw 
from the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the reshuffle. 
  Late Monday, Hosokawa urged SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
to 
cooperate with his plan for a cabinet shakeup that he is 
considering for early implementation, political sources said. 
  In his talks with Murayama, Hosokawa asked him to enter the 
cabinet in place of former SDP chairman Sadao Yamahana who is 
now in charge of political reform, the sources said. 
  Earlier on Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters that he was 
neutral on the question of reshuffling his six-month-old cabinet 
within the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesday [15 February] spurned 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's call for a summit with its 
chief Yohei Kono, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said. 
  The premier relayed his desire to meet on Tuesday afternoon 
with LDP President Kono through Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, Mori told a news conference. But Kono and 
Mori rejected the offer for an informal one-on-one session 
because they agreed this is not the time for such a meeting, 
Mori said. 
  The LDP secretary general cited as a reason for the party's 
refusal to comply with the request the start on Wednesday of 
Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993 ending March 31. "It may affect the morale of our party 
ranks if the two meet and talk secretively together on the eve 
of Diet debate at its plenary sessions," Mori said. 
  He said he conveyed to Takemura that the LDP may agree on a 
Kono-Hosokawa summit once the extra budget, intended to boost 
the languishing Japanese economy, clears the Diet. 
  Hosokawa and Kono met on February 2 along with their 
respective associates to exchange views mainly on the slumping 
economy and strained economic relations with the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The crack in the fragile 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa emerged 
again Tuesday [15 February] over Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle 
his six-month-old cabinet. 
  At the center of the expected reshuffle is Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger). 
Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ], the largest force in the seven-party coalition, oppose 
the removal of Takemura from the post. 
  The SDPJ fears that if Takemura is removed, Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), the key party in the coalition, and Komeito 
would take a decisive leadership in the coalition, political 
sources said. 
  Hosokawa said at a cabinet meeting this morning, "I would 
like to approach that decision (on a cabinet reshuffle) from a 
comprehensive point of view," according to government officials. 
  In the same meeting, Sadao Yamahana, an SDPJ minister in 
charge of political reform, expressed his opposition to the 
reshuffle, the officials said. 
  At a press conference SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
expressed his opposition to the reshuffling plan, saying "a 
reshuffle which smells of a power struggle should not be carried 
out." Murayama said Takemura has satisfactorily carried out his 
duties as "head clerk of the cabinet." 
  The SDPJ leader said a cabinet reshuffle should take place 
after the closure of the current regular Diet session in June. 
  Hosokawa telephoned Sakigake co-leader Hiroyuki Sonoda on 
Tuesday morning and urged him to take a cabinet post if Takemura 
could not remain in the cabinet. Sonoda rejected the proposal, 
political sources said. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura met for 50 minutes in the afternoon at 
the prime minister's official residence and discussed the 
possible reshuffling. 
  Takemura quoted Hosokawa as saying the timing and the scope 
of a cabinet reshuffle remains only on "blank paper." 
  Hosokawa reportedly told Takemura that after concluding 
political reform and the Washington meeting with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, a cabinet reshuffle is now on the horizon. 
  Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a key strategist in the 
coalition, supported Hosokawa's idea, saying, "it is the 
premier's exclusive right (to reshuffle the cabinet), so I will 
follow his judgment entirely." 
  Sakigake held an emergency meeting of its Diet members 
Tuesday morning. Some members insisted the party withdraw from 
the coalition government if Hosokawa forces the change. 
  Takemura and six SDPJ cabinet ministers earlier in the month 
disagreed with Hosokawa's controversial new tax plan to finance 
a 6 trillion yen tax cut. 
  The government faced collapse after the SDPJ threatened to 
withdraw from the coalition over the tax plan and Hosokawa was 
forced to scrap a proposed 7 percent "national welfare tax" to 
replace the 3 percent consumption tax. 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said his party is willing to 
take over the task of governing if the reshuffle leads to the 
collapse of the coalition government. The LDP surrendered its 
38-year grip on power to the coalition government last August. 
  Late last year when Takemura was at odds with Ozawa and 
Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, over the handling 
of political reform bills, Ozawa reportedly asked Hosokawa to 
sack Takemura. At the time, Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice, 
political sources said. 
  Takemura and Ozawa reportedly buried the hatchet when 
Takemura visited Ozawa's residence to extend greetings on New 
Year's day. Takemura and Ozawa differ over Japan's future 
political structure. 
  Takemura, who hopes to form a "liberal" force, including 
proreformers from the LDP, has said it is not easy to establish 
a two-party system, while Ozawa and Ichikawa want to set up a 
two-party system, political analysts said. 
  Hosokawa has said he favors a moderate multiparty system. 
Ozawa advocates making Japan an "ordinary nation," calling for 
a greater contribution by Japan to international peacekeeping 
missions, while Takemura calls for a more modest role in the 
international community.

  [Text] Gifu, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Rice discolored by mold has 
been discovered in rice imported from California and being 
retailed in stores in Gifu Prefecture, Food Agency officials 
said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  The discolored rice was found in six 50-kilogram bags of the 
rice with the tainted rice occupying only a small part of each 
bag, the agency's Gifu office said. 
  Officials suggested that the rice may have become wet during 
its transport to Japan, adding they plan to check the rest of 
the rice stored in Gifu. 
  It is the first case in Japan of mold being found in the 
imported California rice. 
  The rice is part of a shipment of 7,200 tons from California 
that arrived in Kobe last December 13. A total of 850 tons of 
that rice was delivered to Gifu and 238 tons was sold to 
wholesalers on February 10. 
  Denshiro Kugo of the agency office said that it is likely 
the 
mold developed during the shipping since the mold was already 
dried out. 
  "We want to do our best to check the quality of the rice in 
storage as soon as possible so consumers can feel at ease," Kugo 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
began selling rice from China and Thailand to wholesalers 
Tuesday [15 February] to cope with a shortfall caused by a poor 
harvest last year. 
  The Food Agency is selling an initial 14,000 tons of U.S. 
rice, 16,000 tons of Chinese rice and 20,000 tons of Thai rice 
for a trial period in February. 
  U.S. rice from California has already reached retail 
outlets. 
The government sold the Californian rice to wholesalers from 
February 8 at prices some 16 percent lower than the price of 
domestic rice. 
  The Thai and Chinese rice is likely to hit the supermarket 
shelves at different times around the country because of delays 
caused by inspections and snowfalls. In Tokyo it is likely to 
reach consumers by Friday. 
  The Chinese rice is similar to the medium short-grain 
Japanese staple, while the Thai rice is the long-grain type. 
  Wholesalers and retailers alike are striving to fit the rice 
into categories which might appeal to customers. Many rice 
outlets have indicated they will not blend the different types 
of rice and will market the imported rice separately in small 
bags. 
  Blended rice is likely to become more commonly available on 
the market after March when larger volumes of foreign rice are 
released for sale, according to Food Agency sources. 
  Japan began to import rice as an emergency measure after a 
poor harvest last year left the nation with a major shortfall of 
its main staple. 
  In December, Japan agreed at global trade talks to partially 
open its rice market, breaking a long-standing policy of barring 
most imports of rice. 
  Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of 
rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's 
worst postwar harvest.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Machinery orders placed by 
the Japanese private sector rose 5.3 percent in December from 
the previous month, showing signs of bottoming out, the Economic 
Planning Agency said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  The figure, excluding volatile orders for ships and from 
electric power firms, amounted to 895.9 billion yen, down 6.3 
percent from a year earlier. 
  Private sector machinery orders for the October-December 
period amounted to 2,438.5 billion yen, down 10.3 percent from 
the preceding three-month period and also down 8.7 percent from 
the same period of the previous year. 
  An agency official said the October-December performance was 
almost in line with a projection by the agency of a fall of 10.5 
percent from the previous quarter. 
  Orders for the period were the same as those for the 
April-June period and the scale of the fall was much smaller 
than in the past, the official said. 
  "We can regard it as an indication the downtrend in private 
machinery orders is coming to an end," he added. 
  The figure is a leading indicator for corporate investment 
in 
facility and equipment in near future, which has been depressed 
amid the prolonged recession. 
  The agency predicted that the figure for the January-March 
period will show a rise of 8.1 percent from the preceding 
three-month period to 2,636.3 billion yen. 
  The official said the 8.1 percent rise predicted for the 
first quarter of 1994 is not really a strong recovery as the 
value of orders is at about the same level as the last quarter 
of 1992. 
  In December, private sector machinery orders, including 
those 
for ships and from electric power firms, came to 1,154.4 billion 
yen, up 9.6 percent from November and up 7.5 percent from a year 
earlier. 
  Of those, orders from manufacturers amounted to 375.5 
billion 
yen, up 4.1 percent from the previous month but down 10.6 
percent from a year earlier. 
  Orders from nonmanufacturers totaled 476.2 billion yen, down 
3.8 percent on the previous month and down 1.5 percent from a 
year before. 
  On the other hand, public sector orders came to 312.7 
billion 
yen, up 14.5 percent from November and also up 20.0 percent from 
the previous year. 
  Overseas orders amounted to 412.1 billion yen, up 0.4 
percent 
from the previous month and down 9.2 percent from a year earlier. 
  Overall orders in December thus totaled 2,067.2 billion yen, 
up 11.2 percent from November and up 4.3 percent from a year 
earlier.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko on Saturday [12 February] visited two monuments 
to the war dead on Iwo Jima Island, site of one of the fiercest 
Pacific battles during World War II, and where 20,000 Japanese 
soldiers and 7,000 U.S. soldiers were killed. 
  They laid flowers and bowed in front of one of the 
monuments, 
where they met former island residents who were forced to leave 
during the war and representatives of bereaved families of the 
former Imperial Japanese Army. 
  Then they paid their respects at another monument built by 
the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. 
  The imperial couple had flown to Iwo Jima earlier in the 
day, 
to start a three-day visit to the Ogasawara Islands, to 
commemorate the 25th anniversary of the islands' return to Japan 
by the United States. 
  They arrived at the Self-Defense Forces' air station on the 
island, which is the only airfield available in the Ogasawara 
chain. 
  In the evening the emperor and the empress continued their 
trip aboard an aircraft carrier to Chichijima, the main island 
of the Ogasawara chain, where they will stay overnight. 
  On Sunday they will take a helicopter to neighboring 
Hahajima 
Island to attend a judo performance by local residents. 
  Following another stopover at Chichijima Island and meetings 
with islanders, the couple will return to Tokyo on Monday 
evening. 
  It is the couple's first trip to the islands in the western 
Pacific some 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo and follows their 
historic visit to Okinawa last April to pay respects to Japanese 
soldiers and civilians killed there during World War II. 
  The use of more than 20 Self-Defense Force planes, 10 
warships and 2,000 troops for their trip, however, has drawn 
criticism from civic groups. 
  The Ogasawara islands, which the U.S. calls the Bonin 
Islands, were taken by the U.S. toward the end of World War II 
and were returned to Japan in 1968.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Tuesday [15 February] his officially designated 
political bodies handled properly a 10 million yen donation 
which he said he accepted in August last year from an 
organization formed by Japanese salt wholesalers. 
  Fujii told reporters that he served as an adviser to the 
organization, Enyu-kai, when he was elected as a member of the 
House of Councillors in 1977. He left the post in August 1993 
when he became finance minister. 
  Fujii said his two designated political groups accepted the 
donation on August 11 as a bonus for his longtime service to the 
organization but dealt with the money properly. 
  Fujii said he has always tried not to confuse his 
ministerial 
position with accepting such donations, and "to avoid 
misunderstanding," he has paid back the money. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's leading national daily, 
said it questioned Fujii's office February 4 about the donation 
and later learned that the office returned the donation to the 
Enyu-kai on February 5. 
  The Enyu-kai has since returned all the money to the 
companies which donated it, the daily said. 
  Fujii, a longtime adviser to the Association of Salt Dealers 
Cooperatives and a former member of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, is a member of Shinseito, one of the ruling coalition 
parties. 
  The Enyu-kai office is located in the Tokyo headquarters of 
the association. 
  Salt is sold in Japan under a monopoly operation by the salt 
division of Japan Tobacco Inc. 
  A report from the Tobacco Industries Council has recommended 
that the salt monopoly be abolished but such a move would hurt 
many small wholesalers who are members of the Enyu-kai, the 
YOMIURI said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday [15 February] disclosed his intention to set 
up a private panel of advisers to review the current national 
defense program outline in the post-Cold War world, government 
officials said. Hosokawa announced his plan at the day's 
meeting of the National Security Council. 
  Sources close to the prime minister said the inaugural 
meeting of the new panel is scheduled to be held later this 
month. The panel is scheduled to compile a proposal by the 
summer in time for the Defense Agency to present a demand for 
fiscal 1995 budgetary appropriations, they said. 
  A senior Defense Agency official said the prime minister 
expects the new panel to mainly discuss ideas and objectives of 
defense policy based on the long-term view of the situation in 
the post-Cold War period. 
  In parallel with the premier's new private panel, the 
Defense 
Agency will set up an in-house committee headed by the agency's 
director general, also to review the defense program outline, 
according to agency officials. 
  The sources said the premier's planned eight-member panel 
will be headed by Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of Asahi Breweries 
Ltd. 
  The other members are former Defense Agency Vice Director 
General Seiki Nishihiro, former Joint Staff Council chairman 
Makoto Sakuma, former Ambassador to the United States Yoshio 
Okawara, Bank of Tokyo chairman Toyoo Gyohten, Kobe Steel vice 
president Shinji Fukukawa, Chichibu Cement chairman Ken Moroi 
and former University of Tokyo Prof. Akio Watanabe.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Tuesday [15 
February] the installation of Ecuador's United Nations 
Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso in the newly created post of UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a 
statement that the Japanese Government welcomes the fact that 
Ayala Lasso officially assumed the post Monday, with the 
approval of the UN General Assembly. 
  Japan has supported the creation of such a post since it was 
first discussed at the World Conference on Human Rights in 
Vienna last June, Terada said. 
  He said the Japanese Government will actively support the UN 
High Commissioner for Human Rights so he could fulfil his 
important role to promote respect for human rights in the world. 
  UN General Secretary [General] Butrus Butrus-Ghali on 
February 1 named Ayala Lasso to become the first UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, for a four-year term.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Japan and other fishing 
nations have agreed to sign a treaty to conserve alaska pollack 
resources in the international waters of the Bering Sea, 
Fisheries Agency officials said Saturday [12 February]. 
  They said the proposed treaty, agreed on in an international 
conference in Washington, calls for holding an annual convention 
among the signatory nations to set the total fish catches and 
national fishing quotas on the basis of a scientific resources 
survey. 
  In case the nations failed to agree on the total catches, 
the 
treaty would ban alaska pollack fishing if the resources were 
estimated at less than 1.67 million tons, the officials said. 
  The total catches would be set at 130,000 tons if the 
estimate ranged from 1.67 million to 2 million tons and at 
190,000 tons if the estimate ranged from 2 million tons to 2.5 
million tons. 
  Japan, China, South Korea, Poland, Russia and the United 
States suspended alaska pollack fishing in the waters in 1993 
and 1994 following a sharp decrease in catches.

  [Excerpts] Hanoi VNA Feb. 15 -- The private economy or 
non-state sector in Vietnam has developed vigorously since 1991 
following the promulgation of the country's company law and 
private business law. [passage omitted] 
  The privatization in agriculture has helped remarkedly 
increase the country's food output without depending on 
government's investment. In 1988, Vietnam's food output was 
only 19.5 million tonnes, and it had to import more than 450,000 
tonnes of rice. 
  By 1993, its food output had reached nearly 5 million 
tonnes, 
enough not only for domestic consumption and reserve, but also 
for export. [passage omitted] 
  By August 1993, there had been nearly 9,400 non-state 
businesses in sectors other than agriculture. They included 
limited liability companies, joint stock companies, private 
enterprises, co-operatives and production groups with a combined 
capital of 3,144 billion VN dong (roughly USD 300 million). 
  The non-state investment capital in 1993 made up 26 per cent 
of the country's total investment capital of 30,800 billion VN 
dong (roughly USD three billion). However, investment by 
private businesses accounted for only 40 per cent of the 
population's savings. 
  Thanks to the development of the private economic sector, 
400,000 jobs have been created each year. That means to 
generate one job, investment capital of six million VN dong 
(approximately USD 600) was needed, compared with the direct 
foreign investment capital of USD 110,000. 
  In 1991, the private economic sector remitted to the state 
budget through taxes VND 870 billion (nearly USD 87 million), 
accounting for 15 per cent of the total taxes collected in the 
whole country. The private sector's taxes increased to 1,746 
billion VN dong in 1992, and 2,600 billion VN dong in 1993.

  [Text] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
held a conference in Geneva on Monday to discuss the 
international aid program for the repatriation of Vietnamese 
refugees. The conference was attended by representatives from 31 
countries. We now provide you with a report on international 
assistance for Vietnamese repatriated as well our government's 
stance on this issue: 
  About 55,000 Vietnamese people who illegally emigrated to 
other countries have in recent years been repatriated to this 
country -- Vietnam -- and have received assistance for 
reintegration. 
  Programs funded by the European Community are the vivid 
example of the effective assistance in this field, which also 
come from many agencies and other countries. 
  The European Community Integration Program or the 
Reintegration of Vietnamese Refugees or ECIP has been deployed 
in Vietnam on the basis of an agreement signed between the 
European Community and the Vietnamese government. This is the 
first program of cooperation between Vietnam and the European 
Community. It started in June 1992 and will last 30 months with 
the total estimated cost of $130 million. The purpose of the 
program is to provide jobs and vocational training as well as to 
create opportunities to find jobs for Vietnamese returnees, thus 
helping them quickly stabilize their lives and reintegrate into 
the community. It also aims to contributing to consolidating 
and improving the lives of other people in Vietnam, especially 
in those places where the repatriation program is under way. 
  In the past phase, the ECIP's granted loans were $14 million 
and have been reimbursed $13.5 million. Programs have created 
34,000 jobs, 16,000 of these jobs for returnees. About 72 
vocational centers throughout the country have received 
financial assistance from the ECIP. At these centers, more than 
50,000 people received training for 44 different jobs and skills. 
  In addition, the ECIP funded 57 small-size projects with a 
total cost of $2.9 million in order to build and rehabilitate 
the infrastructure, thus contributing to socioeconomic 
development of Vietnamese people generally. 
  A number of healthcare projects have been carried out in 
many 
provinces in the central and southern Vietnam. The progressive 
efficiency of the ECIP have meant the number of people who 
illegally fled Vietnam has been reduced. And the program has 
also encouraged Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and some 
Southeast Asian countries to return home. 
  The Vietnamese Government is ready to negotiate bilaterally 
with countries concerned and to cooperate with the High 
Commissioner for Refugees. This will be done on the framework of 
the comprehensive program of action in order to receive those 
who cannot seek asylum in the third countries under the 
principle of respecting human dignity and insuring security, 
law, and order and the international financial assistance to 
help the returnees resettle in their homeland if necessary. 
  Any repatriation of Vietnamese refugees that runs counter to 
these principles will not receive support from the world 
community nor from Vietnam.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 10 -- The Vietnam Oil and Gas 
Corporation (Petrovietnam) is striving to pump up 20 million 
tonnes of crude oil per year by the year 2000, according to its 
General Director Ho Sy Thoang. 
  He added that in 1992, Petrovietnam struck production 
sharing 
contracts with foreign companies to explore and exploit oil and 
gas in the northern continental shelf and in the onshore basin 
of the northern Red River delta. In addition a number of other 
deals have been signed for the exploration and exploitation of 
oil and gas from oilfields on the southern continental shelf. 
As a result of this progress, oil and gas production in Vietnam 
may exceed 20 million tonnes a year by 2000. Petrovietnam in 
1994 expects to tap 7.1 million tonnes of crude oil, up 800,000 
tonnes over last year's level. This would include the first 
amount of 0.3 million tonnes pumped from the Rong (Dragon) and 
Dai Hung (Big Bear) Oilfields. The oil and gas industry has good 
prospect in the coming years as the operation and development in 
Dai Hung and Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) nearby Dai Hung Oilfields 
come into production. By then Vietnam would rank one of the 
world's biggest oil producers. According to foreign 
entrepreneurs, a well of the Dai Hung Oilfield which was 
successfully drilled recently could be put into operation in the 
third quarter of this year. It is expected that more than 1,000 
tonnes of crude oil could be tapped per day from this well. 
Petrovietnam also actively carries out a project to gas from 
Bach Ho into the mainland in 1994 for electricity generation, 
chemical fertilizers manufacture and other products processed 
from crude oil for export. The country's first oil refinery has 
been under construction since 1993 with a view of introducing 
its products refined from crude oil and the natural gas to the 
domestic market before 2000. To this end another project for 
building of the second oil refinery was carried out last month.

<F P=106> [Political report of the Seventh Communist Party of Vietnam </F>
Central Committee delivered by General Secretary Do Muoi at the 
opening of the Midterm National Party Conference at Ba Dinh 
Conference Hall in Hanoi on 20 January] 
  [Text] Dear comrade advisers to the party Central 
Committee, dear comrade delegates and dear comrades: 
  On behalf of the party Central Committee, I would like to 
present the committee's political report to the National Party 
Conference. 
  The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and 
created a turning point in socialist construction in our 
country. The seventh congress evaluated the results of five 
years of the renovation process for socioeconomic development 
platform and strategy. It also put forth the orientations and 
measures for conducting renovation in a far-reaching and uniform 
manner. 
  The international situation has developed quickly and become 
complicated since the seventh congress. Socialist regimes in 
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have collapsed. The 
independence and sovereignty of a number of countries have been 
challenged by policies based on power and imposition. Hostile 
forces are stepping up activities in a bid to undermine our 
people's national construction and defense. Once again, our 
revolutionary undertaking is facing harsh challenges. 
  The international situation presents new opportunities, 
however. The strength and determination to struggle for national 
independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends 
of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world 
community. Revolutionary forces have learned valuable lessons 
from temporary setbacks. The success of our renovation policy 
has further consolidated our people's strength and position, 
thus creating conditions for us to overcome difficulties and 
take advantage of good opportunities to serve national 
construction. 
  Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and 
people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of 
the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth 
Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set 
forth by the seventh congress, resolving a series of practical 
problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based on actual 
international developments and situations. We have persisted in 
renovation, accelerated socioeconomic development, broadened 
the process of democratization, firmly maintained political 
stability, consolidated national defense and security 
capabilities, diversified our diplomacy, and gradually overcome 
the impact of a blockade and an embargo. 
  The National Party Conference has the duty to assess 
implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and 
evaluate the actual results of renovation since the sixth 
congress. The objectives of this are to clarify further a 
number of issues relating to socialist construction in our 
country and define major policies and measures to implement the 
seventh party congress resolution successfully and lead the 
revolution in our country forward. 
<H6>  PART ONE </H6>
  The Situation on Implementing the Seventh Party 
Congress Resolution. 
I. Achievements 
1. The great achievement of primary importance is our 
success in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to a very 
important extent. 
  The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It 
lasted for many years and became most serious during 1986-88, 
when inflation ran at a gallop. Another menacing challenge 
occurred in 1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our 
party, state, and people, our economy not only held fast but 
recorded outstanding achievements and tided us over sluggishness 
and recession. Economic growth has remained very high and steady 
for the past three years. 
  The inflation rate was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5 
in 1992, and then to 5.2 in 1993. The GDP shows an average 
annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the target of 5.5 
to 6 percent set for the five-year period from 1991 to 1995. 
  Agricultural production has developed relatively 
comprehensively. The food grain issue has been resolved 
satisfactorily. Output of food grain in 1993 amounted to nearly 
25 million tons, exceeding the target set for 1995. Industrial 
production is growing at an average annual rate of 13 percent, 
higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the five-year plan 
for 1991-95. Productivity in a number of important sectors and 
products -- electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement -- has 
increased. The communications and liaison system has expanded 
rapidly using new equipment and technology. Many sectors -- 
building, transport, trade, travel, and other services -- have 
developed. The economy is undergoing structural changes. A 
number of production and business sectors have emerged. 
  Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more 
diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the unexpected 
drop in trade with our traditional market, broadened our 
exchanges with newer trade partners, and increased our annual 
export volume by nearly 20 percent. 
  By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had 
been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We 
have begun to attract more development aid and preferential 
capital loans from various governments, and have normalized 
relations with international financial and monetary institutions. 
  The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation. 
Although this is still small, a broad section of the population 
has seen their lives improve. A multisector economy is taking 
shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and 
re-registered. Those with long histories of operational losses 
have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of state 
firms with effective operations has increased. 
  In general, the state economic sector is continuing to 
develop. It controls key activities and is playing an essential 
role in the economy. The sector's share of GDP increased from 
34 percent in 1990 to 39.9 in 1992. 
  Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer 
orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's 
fifth plenum. The autonomy of peasant households has been 
affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation have 
emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants rights to 
long-term and stable use of land. This has helped the peasant 
household-based economy gain momentum. Individual economies and 
private capitalist economies have developed remarkably. 
Share-holding and partnership enterprises, which are attracting 
capital from various forms of ownership, have emerged in 
increasingly large numbers. 
  The market system, under state management along socialist 
lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy. 
  The amendment of laws and continued renovation of various 
systems and policies on planning, pricing, exchange rates, 
finance, banking, labor, wages, and land have created a more 
favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism, 
self-motivation, and a sense of responsibility in production and 
business. The state has accumulated more experience and made 
progress in the macromanagement of the economy. 
  Parallel to economic development, resolution of various 
social issues and implementation of social welfare policies have 
been given more attention. 
  Thanks to an increase in production and services, market 
prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in 
various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of 
rich households has increased while the number of needy 
households -- especially the number of underfed households -- 
has been reduced. Basic needs for food and clothing have been 
met in a more satisfactory way. Construction of houses, roads, 
electrical facilities, and health establishments has developed 
in various rural and urban areas. Democratic rights -- 
especially economic democracy -- have developed gradually. The 
people are free to work according to the law. They feel more 
secure about putting their money into production and business, 
and this has created more jobs. 
  Various policies -- tackling employment, eliminating hunger 
and poverty, war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and people 
who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution; 
providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and homeless people; 
and the policy of helping needy students return to school -- 
have been carried out satisfactorily. 
  Educational activities have made some progress in fighting 
degradation, diversifying various educational formats, 
rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of 
specialized schools and selective classes, and building general 
education schools for ethnic minority students. The 
popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily. 
Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and 
computer technology have developed in various cities. 
  Science and technology have started to develop as a driving 
force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked 
with social requirements. Many research and application projects 
-- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer goods, and 
export goods -- have developed practical value. They have 
helped increase economic results and improve technological 
knowledge. State-level scientific study programs have become 
more centralized, and for the first time include programs on 
social science and the humanities. 
  Cultural activities have become more lively. Exchanges with 
foreign countries have expanded. Literary and artistic works 
have become more copious in content and theme, and more 
diversified in form, category, and means of expression. The 
information system has developed with the expansion of radio and 
television coverage to various districts throughout the country, 
including a number of mountain areas and distant offshore 
islands. 
  Health care activities have shown great progress in various 
fields, such as preliminary care, expanded immunizations, and 
the control of epidemics and social diseases. The requirements 
for essential medicine have been partially met. Physical 
education and sports have achieved encouraging results. 
  Population and family planning work has been carried out 
correctly, leading to an increase in voluntary registrations for 
the birth control program. 
  2. The second important achievement is the 
continuation of political maintenance and consolidation. 
Because of our success in many areas of renovation -- 
especially socioeconomic achievements, the party's skillful 
leadership, and political awareness of the country's people and 
soldiers -- we have survived the recent international political 
shock. The party's leadership role has been strengthened, the 
state's management efficiency has been heightened, democracy has 
been broadened, and national defense and security have been 
guaranteed. The people's confidence in the party, state, and 
renovation undertaking has increased and public movements for 
socioeconomic improvement have developed. 
  After the seventh congress, our party -- especially the 
Central Committee, Political Bureau, and Secretariat -- 
accelerated party building, considering this to be of crucial 
importance to the entire revolutionary cause in our country and 
to our party. The third party plenum confirmed that economic 
development is the central duty and party building is the 
fundamental duty. It clarified conceptions on party building 
when the party is a ruling party, and defined principles for 
party organization and activities. It outlined the duties for 
consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It 
renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and 
consolidated the party organization. 
  After more than a year of party building, we have improved 
and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward party 
committees and members. We have rearranged the party 
organization and reestablished cadre committees to oversee party 
committees and youth unions in state organs and mass 
organizations. The function and role of grassroots party 
organizations, together with their procedures and personnel 
management regulations, have been established. Party principles 
-- especially democratic centralism for the restoration of order 
and principles -- have been executed. Party management and work 
attitudes have been revamped in a more democratic, collective, 
and appropriate manner to ensure close and efficient party 
leadership and expand the positive role of state organs and mass 
organizations. 
  We have concentrated more on training and admitting new 
party 
members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39 
percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over 
1992. 
  The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid 
more attention to logical and ideological work. It has 
clarified conceptions and principles for guiding renovation and 
has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre have become 
more mature and active, and have gradually grown accustomed to 
leadership and management work in renovation. 
  Our social democracy has made significant strides over the 
past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed 
state of, by, and for the people. Most prominent was the 
promulgation of the 1992 Constitution. That helped to 
institutionalize rapidly the party's line on national 
construction along socialist lines. Implementation of 
constitutional stipulations in politics, the economy, culture, 
education, industry, security and national defense, and the 
citizen's fundamental rights and obligations -- together with 
introducing many new legal documents and regulations -- have 
further accelerated democratization in our social activities. 
  The fatherland fronts and mass organizations have 
diversified 
activities to broaden the national great unity, motivate the 
public to carry out its political duties, accelerate social 
activities, provide good care for the people, and protect their 
interests. 
  Mass motivation has been given more attention by party 
committees at different levels. Coordination between state 
organs and the fatherland front and mass organizations has been 
strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take 
part in law-building; planning national policy; formation of 
local authorities; and the policy implementation relating to 
socioeconomy, security, and national defense. 
  The armed forces, together with the public, have made many 
efforts to accelerate renovation in national defense and 
security, and in developing their own strengths. They have 
executed their duty to protect the socialist fatherland; 
guarantee political stabilization; and safeguard national 
independence, sovereignty, and integrity satisfactorily. 
  We have successfully implemented the great strategic 
adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel, 
and the strengthening of universal defense. We have built 
regional defense networks in provinces and cities, adjusted the 
strategy for national security, revamped our military activities 
in the new situation, gained better knowledge regarding the 
current situation, and become more efficient in fighting the 
activities of hostile forces. 
  3. The third achievement involves our diplomatic 
activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries 
have expanded and its prestige and position in the international 
arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable international 
situation in which to build and defend the fatherland. 
  The seventh congress asserted Vietnam's foreign policy of 
firmly maintaining peace, expanding relations of friendship and 
cooperation, creating favorable international conditions for 
national construction and defense, and positively contributing 
to the world people's common struggle for peace, national 
independence, democracy, and social progress. 
  The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy 
of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for 
peace, independence, and progress. 
  The Central Committee's third plenum concretized and 
seriously implemented this policy against the background of new 
changes in the region and the world and following the seventh 
national party congress. 
  We positively expanded diplomatic activities and recorded 
very significant achievements. We restored normal relations 
with the People's Republic of China and further developed 
friendship and cooperation with them. We strengthened and 
enhanced the special solidarity with the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord on Cambodia. We 
struggled for its serious implementation, established friendly 
and neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and 
promoted and opened up a new stage of cooperation and friendship 
with ASEAN and its organizations. We also expanded relations 
with others in the Asia-Pacific Region and maintained and 
developed existing relations of cooperation with the Russian 
Federation, the states of the former Soviet Union, and East 
Europe. We preserved and developed our traditional relations 
with Cuba, India, and the DPRK; continued to support the 
legitimate causes of Palestinians, Asians, and South Africans; 
and expanded relations with developing countries in the Middle 
East, Africa, and Latin America. We positively contributed to 
consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role 
in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western 
and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, and a number of the newly 
industrialized. We restored normal relations with international 
financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the 
struggle to lift the U.S. embargo and for normalizing relations 
with the United States. 
  II. Shortcomings and New Problems 
  1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still 
backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly 
developed, material-technical bases are very few, accumulation 
from the internal economy are minimal, and investment and 
development are not great enough. Productivity and economic 
results are low, although growth is acceptable. Our production 
capability, developing for mobilization in the days ahead, is 
not up to par. This will affect adversely economic growth in 
the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation is not 
consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget 
overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due, 
are too immense to be settled because our annual exports are 
still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units, and 
leading and managerial cadres are not firmly maintaining 
awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby causing 
great losses to public property, while lavish spending is 
prevalent. 
  It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative 
economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national 
economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in 
production and circulation. The state-run business sector has 
missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas, 
and this has allowed a group of private traders to exploit these 
opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and 
consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the 
private economy. We have difficulties in production development 
and experience a lack of good management and guidance. 
Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent. 
  We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage 
with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management 
capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the 
strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many 
negative sides. Our legal system is not complete, while its 
implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and 
activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and 
are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution 
system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary 
fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance 
with labor has not been strictly observed. 
  2. In the cultural and social domains, many great and urgent 
issues are still not resolved, although we have recorded some 
achievements in these domains. Unemployment, especially for 
youth of working age, is still the pressing issue and is one of 
the fundamental factors causing negative practices in our 
society. 
  Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people 
legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through 
illegal business activities. At the same time, many families 
who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed 
lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing 
great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still 
accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's 
lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and 
ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute. 
  Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many 
issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been 
defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are 
degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research 
equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and 
teachers provide poor training and education service, which is 
causing great public concern. Education management cadres at 
all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual 
education expenses are too high, which affects the education of 
children from poor families. 
  Funding for scientific and technological research is higher 
than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only 
about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must 
be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level 
of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have 
not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest 
in this field. 
  Different scientific groups have not been formed. The 
organic relationship among scientific research establishments, 
training institutions, and production units has not been 
established. The import of foreign technologies has been poorly 
managed and has led to the import of outdated technologies and 
equipment at high prices. This causes long-term negative 
effects for the nation. 
  The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great 
concern. Running after money, unhealthy interests, bad habits, 
and superstitions is on the increase. Poisonous and dangerous 
cultural products are readily available in the market. 
Incorrect tendencies -- such as the rejection of our 
revolution's achievements and our revolutionary culture and 
arts, the detachment of arts from the party's political line, 
the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the spread of bad 
foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles -- are 
appearing in creative, logical, and critical works. These 
mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the fourth 
plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they are 
slowly being rectified. Guidance by party organs and the state 
management over the cultural and arts work is weak. 
  Our public health service is not meeting minimum 
requirements 
of society. Grassroots health care is weak. Hospitals are 
ill-equipped and provide low standards of service and care. The 
increase in population is still higher than 2.2 percent. This 
obstructs socioeconomic development and improvements to life, 
and affects the development of our race. 
  Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices are 
tending to increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling, 
prostitution, and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are 
prevalent, raising public indignation, and greatly affecting the 
people's confidence in the party and state. 
  3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated 
factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party 
and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political 
security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not 
safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been 
satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and 
bulky and its management and work attitudes slowly are being 
renovated. Leadership quality and performance of many party 
committees are still low. They are even sidestepping the party 
line in some places. 
  Cadre-related work is a weak link. Cadres, generally 
speaking, are not up to duties or requirements. In many places, 
difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when able cadres 
are needed for appointment to key leading positions. There are 
not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to take care 
of party work, state management, production and business, 
external economic relations, religion, ethnic communities, and 
women-related work. 
  Planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres are 
not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper 
attention to checking the observation of party regulations, 
lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow 
and lacks efficiency. Evil practices of authoritarianism, 
oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are 
prevalent in many places. 
  The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still 
facing 
difficulties in work and methods. The number of cadres working 
in mass organizations is not stable. They lack enthusiasm are 
not given appropriate care, training, and benefits. 
  Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among 
party cadres and people. They still have a low level of 
awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile 
forces, who always wish to scrap our party and socialism. Some 
party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints 
or activities aimed at stirring up social disorder. Others have 
deviated seriously from the socialist path, or are even inclined 
to choose another. 
  Ideological and theoretical work is still slow, not sharp 
enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond convincingly 
to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres, including core 
leaders, are still sluggish in self-education. They do not try 
to improve their character and understanding. Disunity among 
cadres at some party organizations is also very serious. 
  III. Generalizations 
  Despite shortcomings we need to overcome, our past important 
achievements are creating favorable conditions for the 
country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the 
stage of industrialization and modernization. These 
conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend, 
material and spiritual, economic, political, social and 
cultural, and domestic and foreign. The reality of past years 
allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of our 
party on renovation were correct and the steps taken 
appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party 
congresses are being absorbed into the life of our people. 
  Reviewing the reality of renovation brings up many useful 
lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first 
experiences learned through the renovation process and pointed 
out by the seventh party congress need to be developed and 
applied to our current reality. Those were the lessons of 
maintaining firmly the socialist path during renovation, 
combining the determination of revolutionary principles and 
strategies with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the 
changes. There were also the lessons of the necessity to 
renovate comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply 
appropriate steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons 
learned were to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and 
the state management in developing a multisector merchandise 
economy and socialist democracy as well as the need for the 
timely exposure and handling of problems, which arise during 
renovation. We also need to pay appropriate attention to the 
task of reviewing reality and continuously completing and 
perfecting theories to build the socialist path. 
  Renovation is a difficult process, and one which is 
unprecedented, but we have been bravely searching and learning, 
and achieving important progress. The most basic, decisive 
factor was the determination of our party to retain its 
leadership position; to reject pluralism and a multiparty 
system; to honor the spirit of independence, self-determination, 
and innovation; and to follow correct lines and policies, which 
are in good accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam. 
Our party has also been able to develop the total strength of 
the great all-people solidarity block and expand international 
cooperation. 
  The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for 
the socialist society our people are building. The congress 
also pointed out seven basic directions to make these 
characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that 
the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized 
into practical directives. 
  The building of socialism, however, is still new to us. It 
requires from us massive energy to research, study, and 
discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the 
socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our 
work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to 
figure out the concrete model for each domain of the economic, 
political, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage 
innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh 
Thought, especially Leninist thoughts, on a new economic policy 
and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new 
forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps suitable 
for our concrete historical circumstances and which will help 
our country advance firmly on the socialist path. 
<H6>  PART TWO 
Essential tasks to be carried out in the period ahead. </H6>
  Lying ahead of our people are major challenges and 
opportunities. These are: 
  -- The danger of being further left behind economically, 
compared with many countries in the region and the world, 
because we started from the lowest point and our growth rate is 
not high and steady enough; we have also had to struggle upward 
in a fiercely competitive environment. 
  -- The danger of straying from socialism if we fail to 
abide by the implementation guidelines. 
  -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills. 
  -- The peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of 
hostile forces. 
  Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages: 
  -- Our party has a correct policy line and is united and 
single-minded. 
  -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic. 
They have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and 
believe in the party leadership. 
  -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the 
revolutionary cause of our party and people. 
  -- The successes obtained in renovation are creating our 
new posture and strengths. 
  -- The development of the scientific and technological 
revolution and the trend toward broadening global and regional 
ties of cooperation and development have brought us 
opportunities for obtaining more important resources. 
  The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress 
up to 1995 will be to overcome difficulties and ordeals, 
stabilize and develop socioeconomic activities, strengthen 
political stability, dispel negativism and social injustices, 
and basically tiding the country over the current crisis. 
  Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a 
significant part of that target, especially the economic ones. 
For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the 
entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind; 
to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of 
independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden 
international relations; to practice the motto of industry, 
thrift, integrity and righteousness; to strive to exploit our 
advantages; to dispel dangers; to overcome ordeals; and to 
successfully achieve the general targets cited above. We must 
quicken our pace to achieve the various aims of the strategy for 
socioeconomic stability and development to the year 2000 to 
build a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and 
civilized society. 
  The following are essential: 
  1. To press for changes in the economic structure 
toward industrialization and modernization. 
  Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and 
strengthening of development cooperation with various countries 
and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead 
with our national industrialization and modernization to create 
more jobs, speed up economic growth, and further renovate the 
people's material and spiritual life. This is a central task of 
foremost importance for the period ahead. 
  Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid 
the 
danger of being further left behind compared with nearby 
countries; to maintain political and social stability; and to 
protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of 
socialist development. 
  At present, we have not followed the old pattern of 
industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness, 
and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized. 
Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical 
bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing 
the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy. 
Rather, it is a process of structural change linked with 
radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid 
growth and high and long-lasting efficiency for the entire 
economy. 
  Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and 
this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial 
development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our 
process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with 
scientific and technological progress in the world. 
  The orientation, scale, and steps of industrialization and 
modernization must be carefully thought out through a complete 
understanding of the following important points: 
  -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must 
go along with the broadening of international cooperation, 
building an open-door economy both at home and abroad, 
multilateral and diverse relations with other countries, 
combining economic activities with national defense and 
security, and linking economic growth with social progress and 
social justice, and with cultural development and environmental 
protection. 
  -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous 
efforts at exports while replacing imports that can be produced 
locally. 
  -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire 
country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given 
period. 
  -- Constantly improving competitiveness in local, 
regional, and international markets. 
  -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard 
for determining the course of development and for selecting 
investment and technological projects. 
  -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country, 
of each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources 
for various fields of activity and key areas to promptly produce 
high results while paying attention to meeting essential 
requirements; working out practical policies, systems, and 
measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up 
development cooperation; and ensuring that various regions and 
strata of people can benefit from economic growth. 
  -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size 
projects requiring small capital investments and capital that 
can be recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using 
short-term projects to finance long-term ones. 
  -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects. 
  -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the 
fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an 
emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. 
  -- Combining traditional technologies with modern 
technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment 
and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need 
small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs. 
  -- Until the end of this decade, great attention must be 
paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. 
We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and 
fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop 
processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine 
products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. 
  -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and 
rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities. 
  -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively 
building infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas 
where development is being hindered. 
  -- Selectively building heavy industry establishments in 
important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in 
which we have the capital, technologies, and marketplace to 
achieve rapid development and high results. 
  -- Developing scientific and technological studies and 
application, education and training, public health, and 
environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term 
development requirements. 
  While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor, 
resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read 
regional and world development trends, the strategies and 
policies of trading partners and rivals, and attempt to discover 
new opportunities and comparative advantages. We must foster 
and develop to the fullest our most decisive resource, namely, 
the Vietnamese population, for long-term development and to 
prepare the necessary conditions for development along this 
course. 
  To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must 
mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with 
effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic 
source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign 
source as important. 
  To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than 
eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of 
investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few 
years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with 
efforts to improve efficiency of capital management. This 
requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the 
entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption 
and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in 
material production. 
  Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is 
decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary 
to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted 
projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state 
budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest 
loans from various governments and international financial and 
monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely manage, 
distribute and effectively use public assets, and must guard 
against losses and wasteful spending. 
  The state's capital investment is designed mainly for 
building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key, 
spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries 
for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the 
manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services. 
Part of this must also be reserved for financing employment 
projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare hills and 
expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities. 
  The state will only allocate capital to socioeconomic 
infrastructure projects and to areas where capital is not likely 
to be recovered. Credit loans invested by the government must 
be returned by users. 
  We must renovate the managerial mechanism for capital 
construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation 
of state-owed capital, especially in project planning, 
construction price estimates, and the assessment of work 
performance. In this area, highly credible local and foreign 
companies must be used to verify the quality and price of 
imported equipment and materials and audit construction 
projects. Every project must have a concrete owner. If it is a 
project where capital must be recovered, it must be fully 
recovered by the state on schedule. 
  We must fully exploit the savings and investment potential 
of 
the public as well as businesses in different economic sectors. 
This must be done in different forms to ensure that all 
potentialities are mobilized and that every cent invested yields 
profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this 
source of capital within society's total capital investment. 
  In order to broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of 
investment, we must supplement and perfect the necessary 
macroeconomic policies. 
  First of all: 
  -- We must stabilize the macroeconomic environment, 
consistently implement the policy on the multisectorial economy, 
protect all forms of legal possession and business freedom, and 
introduce an internal investment law and other necessary laws 
and regulations to encourage and support efforts to develop 
investment. 
  -- We must renew the national finance policy, satisfactorily 
resolve the relationship between state finance and private 
finance, and correctly balance the demand for increasing budget 
revenues with the demand for self-investment by each business 
sector and residential region to guarantee profits for investors 
and create momentum for broadening business and production. 
  -- We must form and develop capital markets that consist 
mainly of investment banks, commercial banks, finance and 
insurance companies. We must continue to reform the banking 
system according to the principles of the market mechanism and 
international practice in order to mobilize sufficient capital, 
provide credit efficiently, and meet the high demand for 
development in the national economy. We must develop joint 
stock companies; gradually broaden the issuance and circulation 
of shares, credit notes, and bonds; and create conditions for a 
stock market. 
  -- We must supplement and amend structures and policies to 
observe strict regulations concerning the practice of frugality 
in developing investment in all activities of the party, 
government, Army, public security force, mass organizations, 
business, and people. 
  -- We must create favorable conditions to attract additional 
foreign capital and technology while simultaneously exploiting 
internal resources. We must widely apply policies to attract 
more foreign investment and set up regulations to define 
responsibilities in obtaining and repaying foreign loans, 
ensuring their proper use, and avoiding financial overcommitment. 
  We must start planning for different regions, beginning with 
key areas, processing zones, special economic zones, and 
industrial areas. We must outline investment projects and set 
priorities for projects that need foreign investment. We must 
ensure the scientific soundness of the deployment of important 
projects, avoiding mistakes that might cause long-term effects. 
And we must continue to improve the investment environment, 
including laws, regulations, and working and living conditions 
for foreign investors. 
  Encouragement of direct foreign investment must be part of a 
uniform development strategy and management structure to ensure 
state authority, control, and guidance over the socioeconomic 
development process. State management structures must be 
established over projects with foreign investment and those 
completed and in operation. Together with increasing of 
investment in different forms, we must increase our capital 
contributions toward joint ventures with foreign countries. 
  The science and technology sector must concentrate its 
research on quickly applying new findings to production and 
business in order to serve industrialization and modernization. 
It must meet the demands of new equipment in the national 
economy, improve existing technologies, modernize traditional 
technologies, and correctly adapt new ones. It must also help 
to manage and closely assess imported technologies and pay 
attention to the development of electronics, informatics, 
biology, and new materials. Through practical renovation, it 
must get close to real life, quickly discover and improve upon 
the public's inventions, accelerate its studies, and clarify 
issues relating to the strategy for industrialization and 
modernization. 
  2. We must strive to implement the policy on 
developing the multisectoral economy consistently and give 
various economic components and business establishments more 
headway to develop quickly and attain strong results. 
Efforts must be made to strengthen and improve state-run 
establishments to help them work effectively be active in the 
economy. This is very important and urgent because it will help 
encourage and support other economic sectors in their 
development while accelerating rapid and long- lasting growth. 
It is an apparatus with material strength that will help the 
state regulate and lead the market economy to develop further in 
accordance with the socialist orientation. 
  It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature 
of state ownership from that of state-run businesses. We must 
realize that state assets and capital are used in various forms 
to ensure strong socioeconomic results and enhance the state's 
ability to accelerate and control economic activities. 
Investment in state-run businesses should include those set up 
with a 100-percent state capital and those with the majority of 
shares held by the state, so as to allow the state to control 
them effectively. 
  Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to 
the 
people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide 
concessions for exploiting mines, to enter into joint ventures, 
and to buy shares from enterprises in other sectors. We must 
integrate efforts to strengthen state-run businesses in various 
sectors, areas, and socioeconomic infrastructure projects; in 
the financial, banking, and insurance establishments; and in a 
number of key production and service units so as to help the 
economy develop strongly. It is necessary to encourage other 
economic components to participate in different forms and 
degrees. 
  In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of 
inessential state-run businesses while consolidating, expanding, 
and building new and essential state-run enterprises. We must 
strive to strengthen and develop state-run businesses in 
agriculture, forestry, and fishery to cooperate with other 
business branches to build industrial and service centers, 
especially for the processing industry; scientific-technological 
centers; and cultural and social centers in localities 
throughout the country. 
  We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade 
system; to control firmly the export-import business and the 
trading of essential materials; to regulate wholesale and retail 
trade; and, together with other sectors, to stabilize and 
develop local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure smooth 
transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production 
development, to protect the interests of producers and 
consumers, and to make fundamental changes in organization and 
management of state-run businesses to ensure autonomous 
operation of businesses in the market economy while ensuring 
effective state control. 
  Fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations, 
negative practices, and waste at many state-run business 
establishments are caused by our not having certain people who 
act as direct owners of state assets and who take responsibility 
for and protect the interests of state properties. We have no 
attractive and firm motives to encourage personnel at state-run 
enterprises to devote their energies to the development of their 
establishments. We still lack the material and organizational 
strength to define decisively various methods to curb corruption 
and acts that inflict losses on public properties. We must find 
ways to overcome these shortcomings. 
  To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb 
negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run 
businesses, we must introduce various forms of shareholding 
enterprises in line with our production and business system and 
with the majority of shares held by the state. Step by step, we 
must apply the method of selling shares to enterprise personnel. 
Efforts must be made to distribute profits to personnel based 
on their base salary and their number of shares. We should 
conduct a pilot project to sell a number of shares in state-run 
businesses to private organizations and individuals. 
  On introducing a shareholding enterprise system, we will 
stipulate the organization of management boards comprising 
representatives of state shareholders, worker shareholders, and 
other shareholders. Regulations and selection criteria to help 
management boards select managing directors should be set up. 
Various forms of work contracts with workers should be applied 
in a widespread manner and be perfected continuously within 
state enterprises. The state will support and encourage -- in 
accordance with the development needs of the economy -- 
implementation and renovation of enterprise unions and general 
corporations into the organization of business conglomerates, 
thus avoiding intermediary authorities. The system of managing 
ministries, managing authorities, and distinctions between 
centrally- and locally-managed enterprises will be gradually 
discarded. 
  State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care 
of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially 
in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre 
training and deployment. For enterprises that serve the 
public's socioeconomic benefit but suffer low incomes or losses, 
the state will have a reasonable relief policy that discourages 
reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the 
state's inspection authority and stop as hoc inspection and 
control work, which is inconvenient to businesses. For state 
enterprises that do business in inessential areas, suffer 
extended losses, and lack the capacity to overcome these losses, 
the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum of the 
seventh Central Committee should be applied. 
  We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of 
cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative 
members. The state supports, assists, and guides the 
development of all cooperative economic establishments in 
various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial 
basis. Management of cooperatives should be democratic and 
should encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with 
the strength of each household member. 
  The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative 
economic 
establishments should be carried out in all sectors of 
agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the 
resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum. 
Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish 
cooperatives. Experimental renovation should continue in all 
forms of cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts, 
financial credit, trading, and services. Cooperatives can 
function on a larger scale, can perform various types of 
business, and are not restricted within any administrative 
boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by members and the 
assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor from outsiders 
should be motivated. Members of cooperatives receive incomes 
that are subject to contributed labor and shares. Cooperatives 
can exercise any of the various levels of collectivity of 
production supplies in accordance with the business necessity, 
aspirations, and benefit of the members. 
  The individual and small business economic sector -- which 
comprises mostly family business establishments -- is speedily 
growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an 
important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help 
this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information, 
and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective, 
thus creating more employment and more opportunities for 
individuals to contribute to national construction. We must 
also guide and encourage individual business establishments to 
join cooperative economic establishments gradually and on a 
voluntary basis. 
  The private capital economic sector, both overseas and 
domestic, is growing fast and making positive contributions to 
national construction. The state continues to encourage private 
capital economic activities in those sectors and areas allowed 
by law. The state also protects the legal rights and benefits 
of private businessmen, joins development and investment funds 
with these businessmen on a consensus basis, and encourages them 
to sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps 
and guides them to overcome difficulties and do business 
according to state laws and regulations. Concrete regulations 
will be promulgated to stipulate the state's management role 
toward business establishments with capital invested directly by 
outsiders. 
  In combination with the state's inspection and control 
functions, we need to develop grassroots organizations in the 
party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations 
within the private business enterprises and joint business 
enterprises, either domestically or with overseas partners. 
These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity, 
protect the legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal 
deeds. We should create conditions and a legal environment for 
lawful competition activities and for developing collective 
businesses on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, 
regardless of the disparity between these businesses in a sector 
or locality. 
  Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form 
business corporations with a significant ability to compete in 
the domestic as well as the international market. 
  3. We must build a uniform market mechanism under 
state management and in accordance with socialist 
orientations. 
  Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic 
structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition 
to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the 
efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect 
apparatuses and policies to create the necessary conditions for 
the market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to 
guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should 
be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very 
important factors for allocating resources to production and 
business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive 
measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and 
wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly. 
Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate 
way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods 
and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic 
significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case, 
prices must all be set within the limits of the market 
mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transportation costs 
and the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must 
be taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for 
losses. It is important to regulate income distribution in a 
rational way and create conditions for expanding production 
facilities and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary 
to abide by the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests, 
closely monitor the rate of inflation, and create favorable 
conditions for both savings and loans. It is important to 
regulate currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner, 
bearing in mind the need to see to it that the actual rates 
remain relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help 
promote exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out 
to determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is 
necessary to formulate a selective subsidy policy for 
agricultural and export products. Appropriate measures must be 
taken to protect local products and the interests of both 
producers and consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form 
various types of markets, products, services, labor resources, 
capital, technology, real estate, and so forth. 
  It is necessary to step up state macromanagement to direct 
and guide the overall performance of the national economy. 
Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and 
legal boundaries for production and business activities. 
Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or 
contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions, 
and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism. 
Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really 
important instrument for distributing and making better use of 
all sources of strength as well as for distributing or 
redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium 
between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the 
various economic sectors and people of all walks of life, 
meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social 
justice. 
  The state macromanagement system must cover all areas of the 
national economy and economic sectors instead of the state 
business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the 
concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it 
comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it 
is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of 
sectors and localities in case they can work out better 
solutions to the various problems involved. 
  It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of 
business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should 
devote efforts to carry out their functions as development 
project planners for economic and technological sectors under 
their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide 
direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of 
business establishments belonging to different economic sectors 
and in different areas of activity as specified under their 
state management functions. It is important to strengthen the 
role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall 
performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting 
all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective 
macromanagement system. 
  Administrative organs at all levels should perform their 
state management functions in areas under their charge by 
overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging 
to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to 
distinguish between central and local economic organizations. 
  Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure 
strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be 
made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning 
agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to 
serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced 
macromanagement system, adjust investment structures, effect 
economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating 
efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and 
make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development 
goals. 
  We must continue to reform the financial and monetary 
system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily 
promoting economic activities to increase investment and 
development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the 
national financial system, savings, and expenditure; and improve 
the financial work of the state, enterprises, and population. 
Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the 
central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for 
normal expenditure, investment development, and national 
defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to 
meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote 
investment development for long-term interest. 
  We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out 
autonomous financial management under the close supervision and 
control of the state. 
  We must strive to keep the budget deficit at less than 5 
percent of GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue to 
pay for expenditures, refrain from issuing banknotes to resolve 
the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and 
expenditures. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting 
system and improve auditing in the state and private sectors. 
  The central state bank must formulate and implement the 
monetary policy to ensure the effective allotment, transfer, and 
remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial, 
trade, and price agencies to maintain an average annual price 
increase in the single digits only; and strive to balance 
international debt while increasing foreign currency reserves. 
The financial and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out 
their functions of establishing funds, effectively use and 
provide credits, and strive to meet the requirements of economic 
development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the 
settlement and circulation of money within society. They must 
strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to 
create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively 
circulated and become the sole currency for the settlement of 
debt nationwide. 
  4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues. 
  Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out 
cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the 
human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary 
objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current 
issues and ensure social justice, enhance the people's 
intellect, promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect 
and develop our national cultural traits. In order to create 
sufficient jobs for workers in an effective way, the state and 
people must save money for investment development while 
satisfactorily implementing the socioeconomic strategy. They 
must encourage all economic components, citizens, and investors 
at home and abroad to expand branches and occupations to create 
more jobs for the laborers and reduce the number of unemployed 
workers, expand foreign trade, and promote the export of 
laborers. Efforts must be made to organize vocational training 
for youths to enhance their professional skills. For personnel 
and workers laid off by administrative agencies and economic 
units, we must reorganize them and provide vocational training 
as well as loans to help them become involved in production and 
business or find other jobs, while striving to set up 
consultative agencies to introduce new jobs. 
  We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests 
of 
both employees and employers at private capitalist business 
establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes 
have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment 
promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition 
to illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and 
discipline for workers formulated by business establishments 
must not violate state laws. 
  It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should 
be parallel to social progress and justice at each stage of 
development. Social justice should cover areas such as the 
distribution of the means of production, income in accordance 
with results in production, and equal opportunity for each 
member of the production force to develop his ability. We must 
implement the principle of distributing more income to those who 
work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to 
oppose mediocrity and dependence on others. We must ensure that 
income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must 
encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately, 
and ensure a fair income for investment projects, especially in 
production and business. We should encourage the people to 
amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and 
hunger; motivate the rich to participate in economic 
development; formulate rational policies to promote credit, 
taxation, and vocational training in order to create conditions 
for the poor to be able to progress and earn enough to become 
rich. Various former wealthy areas should, together with the 
state, assist poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize 
rich people to contribute to helping the poor by providing 
loans, equipment, and materials and transferring experience and 
work methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have 
rendered meritorious service to the state; formulate appropriate 
policies for the rich; and mobilize business enterprises and 
private organizations to participate in humanitarian and 
charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural 
calamities, as well as the disabled, the elderly, and the 
homeless who can no longer work. 
  The responsibility of each citizen in solving individual 
and family problems should be heightened. At the same time, the 
common sharing of responsibilities in society in general should 
be intensified to develop our people's humanitarian tradition. 
  The goals and measures set forth in the resolution of the 
seventh party Central Committee's fourth plenum regarding 
education and training, culture, the arts, public health care, 
and population and family planning work must be continued, so 
that in a few years significant achievements can be recorded in 
our education service, thereby helping the education service 
fulfill its role in upgrading the people's mental abilities, 
creating the people's labor force, and improving the people's 
skills. 
  First, compulsory elementary education must be implemented. 
If possible, universal secondary education should be introduced 
in some localities. Policies to exempt and reduce school fees 
and provide suitable financial assistance must be applied to 
guarantee the education of children from poor families, 
especially those living in isolated, high altitude, and former 
revolutionary base areas. 
  Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and 
additional ones must be built. We must reorganize the 
vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by 
teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system 
by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with 
practice, and training and research with production. 
  National university centers must be built with improved 
goals, curricula, and education methods to meet national 
development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining 
the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to 
grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and 
state management of the education and training service must be 
strengthened. 
  Steps must be taken to build a modern culture, but one that 
is imbued with national traits. Educational activities must be 
organized to make everyone aware of the need to adopt a morally 
correct lifestyle and culturally appropriate behavior. Efforts 
to develop national culture must be linked with endeavors to 
promote cultural exchanges with foreign countries, bearing in 
mind the need to preserve and develop national traits while 
simultaneously learning from the cultural quintessence of other 
countries. Resolute measures must be taken against all acts of 
violence and miscellaneous cultural practices that are immoral 
or culturally unfit and contrary to human nature. Along with 
inheriting and carrying on the traditions of human compassion, 
mutual love and assistance, and other fine customs, efforts must 
be made to eliminate outdated practices, superstitions, and 
other social vices. 
  Steps must be taken to improve the quality of and guarantee 
democracy and freedom for cultural and artistic activities. At 
the same time, it is necessary to uphold the sense of 
responsibility of writers and artists toward the nation and 
people. Plans must be worked out to cultivate talent and 
encourage writers and artists to produce wholesome works with a 
high ideological and artistic value. Efforts must be made to 
turn out fine works to serve the goals of national renovation. 
It is necessary to take positive factors into account while 
simultaneously adopting resolute measures to deal with negative 
phenomena, erratic tendencies, and hostile arguments or 
maneuvers. It is important to promote nonprofessional cultural 
activities and accelerate the mass movement for cultural 
activities at the grassroots level. Steps must be taken to 
strengthen the mass media to disseminate lines, policies, and 
laws in a timely manner so as to make everyone understand 
cultural, literary, and artistic values and appreciate things 
that are genuine, good, and beautiful. Plans must be worked out 
to contain the venom of bad cultural practices and reactionary 
or decadent printed materials. 
  It is important to strengthen the party's leadership; revamp 
the state management mechanism and enhance the efficiency of its 
control over cultural and artistic activities; and supplement 
necessary policies and laws and see that they are strictly 
enforced. 
  Due efforts must be made to look after the people's health, 
bearing in mind the need to give first priority to primary 
health care and take positive measures to fight disease. Plans 
must be worked out to restore, consolidate, and expand 
grassroots medical facilities in populated areas as well as set 
up mobile medical teams in those localities where dispensaries 
are nonexistent. Steps must be taken to upgrade hospitals and 
provide them with better equipment. Plans must be worked out to 
build a number of major medical centers and special medical 
facilities. Adequate measures are needed to implement the 
medical insurance program and apply the policy on hospital fee 
exemptions or reductions to social welfare recipients and needy 
people. It is necessary to stop malnutrition, malaria, goiter, 
and leprosy in children. It is imperative to try every possible 
means to contain drug addiction, prostitution, and AIDS. 
Effective measures must be adopted to ensure that within the 
next few years we will be able to reduce the country's average 
population growth rate to less than 2 percent, with first 
priority being given to localities with high population growth 
rates. 
  Efforts must be made to develop a large-scale movement for 
physical education and sports activities among people 
nationwide, especially among youths and students, and take steps 
to form special physical education and sports organizations and 
encourage athletes to break their own records. 
  The struggle against corruption constitutes a burning and 
pressing current task. Resolute and full measures must be taken 
to launch an anticorruption campaign in the entire working 
apparatus, at all echelons, and in all sectors from the central 
down to the grassroots organizations. The following key 
measures must be applied uniformly: 
  -- It is necessary to review, amend, or supplement 
mechanisms, policies, laws, and procedures governing the 
activities of state agencies and government employees. It is 
important to try every means to overcome loopholes in the 
management system and clearly define the responsibilities of 
those in charge of state property protection, utilization, and 
development. This will help to discover and deal with 
corruption cases quickly. 
  Efforts must be made to renovate and consolidate financial 
management and bookkeeping. It is necessary to make full use of 
consultancy, assessment, and auditing services. 
  It is important to streamline the mechanism, cut unnecessary 
expenditures, and guarantee sufficient salaries for wage earners. 
  -- Consolidate education and training for cadres and party 
members to heighten their revolutionary morality. Leaders of 
sectors, localities, and agencies have to bear the 
responsibility for corruption within their respective areas. 
The responsibility of leaders in grassroots party organizations 
should be enhanced, and party members and the masses should be 
actively motivated to fight corruption. 
  -- Strictly carry out inspection, investigation, and 
supervision by agencies in charge and by mass organizations, so 
that corruption can be detected early. Defendants in corruption 
cases, especially in serious ones, should be handled in a timely 
and strict manner in accordance with state laws, regardless of 
the defendant's position or rank. 
  In the fight against social ills, coordination between the 
suppression and prevention of crimes must be heightened. The 
focus should always be on prevention, and a national program on 
crime prevention should be set up with an adequate budget. 
Sanctions and punishment stipulated by state laws should be 
strictly followed in association with an active education 
program, including both occupational training and production 
labor, coupled with improvement of detention and re-education 
facilities, in order to rebuild the defendants and give them 
opportunities to rebuild an honest life. We should prevent and 
punish all forms of mistreatment of prison inmates. 
  5. National defense and security. 
  While carrying out national construction, we must never 
neglect the important task of safeguarding our fatherland, 
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national 
security, socio-political stability, and our determination to 
protect socialism. 
  We need to thoroughly understand and properly carry out our 
national defense and security duties and stick firmly to the 
guiding viewpoint set up by the party Central Committee's third 
plenum. We have to motivate a comprehensive and universal 
movement to defeat all "peaceful evolution" schemes and 
activities and subversive violence. 
  In the next few years, we have to carry out following 
successfully: 
  -- Heighten revolutionary vigilance, intensify political and 
national defense movements, and cohesively combine the people's 
security task with the national defense task. 
  -- Build steadfast defense areas and the people's 
security; and intensify defense forces in major areas in order 
to safeguard firmly territorial integrity, sovereignty, and 
national security. 
  -- Safeguard firmly internal security, the party, and the 
state; and quickly detect and suppress all sabotage activities. 
  -- Strengthen state management in social order and 
suppression of crimes; build up a people's movement to safeguard 
national security, social safety, and order. 
  -- Build the people's army and the people's security 
forces politically, ideologically, and organizationally. 
Maintain all technical equipment well and make an effort to 
attain the gradual modernization of major equipment. Increase 
investment in national defense industries. Improve the cultural 
and physical life of the troops to ensure a strong people's 
armed force that can fulfill its tasks effectively. 
  -- Strengthen the party's leadership role and the state's 
management role in national defense and security; bring into 
reality all state lines and policies regarding national defense 
and security; and quickly organize, consolidate, or improve the 
quality of agencies and cadres in charge of helping other 
sectors and echelons carry out national defense and security 
tasks. The Ministries of National Defense and the Interior 
should perform their management role in national defense and 
security well in accordance with their assigned authority and 
responsibilities. 
  -- Perfect legal documents regarding national defense 
(laws on national defense and security, borders, and the sea; 
the supplementary law on military service; and other laws and 
regulations), and ensure the effective implementation of these 
laws. 
  6. Continuing to broaden external relations. 
  To expand our foreign affairs achievements even further, we 
must continue our policy of independence, self-determination, 
open doors, diversification, and multilateralization. We must 
strive to increase unanimity; limit disagreement; create 
favorable conditions for our national construction and 
protection; and contribute to the common struggle of the world 
population for peace, national independence, democracy, and 
social progress. 
  We must broaden our friendship and cooperation with all 
nations on the principle of equality; mutual benefit; peaceful 
coexistence; respect for one another's independence, 
sovereignty, and national integrity; and settlement of 
disagreements through negotiations to ensure stability, 
security, and development. 
  We must increase relations with international organizations 
and positively partake in world activities to protect the 
environment, fight dangerous diseases, eliminate poverty and 
starvation... 
  The external activities of the party and people must be 
broadened to win the wide support of world organizations and 
people for our national construction and protection undertaking. 
  We must clearly realize our difficulties and challenges as 
well as advantages and opportunities, and closely follow 
complicated changes in the world in order to apply suitable 
policies. These must be in conformity with our principles but 
also be flexible and active. We must strengthen party 
leadership and state management and sufficiently coordinate with 
all sectors in our external relations. We must pay attention to 
providing education and training for more cadres with good 
qualification and abilities. 
  7. Building a Vietnamese Government of, by, and for the 
people. 
  We must build and gradually perfect a Vietnamese Government 
that is governed by law; that is, a government of, by, and for 
the people. It should govern all aspects of social life 
according to law and lead the country toward development under 
the socialist direction. A law-governed Vietnamese Government 
should be built on the foundations of strengthening and 
broadening the people's unity and based on the 
worker-peasant-intellectual alliance under the party's 
leadership. 
  Implementing a socialist democracy and expanding the 
people's 
right to mastery are the first duties and the fine nature of our 
government. We must follow President Ho Chi Minh's instruction: 
"Government organs from the central level down to the villages 
should serve the people. That means carrying out the people's 
common work, not oppressing the people." The government must be 
closely linked with the people, must respect and listen to their 
opinions, and must be under their supervision. It must 
resolutely fight against bureaucratism, authoritarianism, 
corruption, waste, and special privileges and benefits. 
  We must protect the people's rights and the basic rights of 
citizens as stipulated in the Constitution, such as the right to 
possessions, the right to use production equipment, the right to 
legal trading, the right to freedom of discussion and expression 
of opinions for national construction, and the right to freedom 
of religion and non-religion. 
  We must promptly examine and settle complaints and 
accusations lodged by the public. We must create opportunities 
for the people to contribute to the national work and offer 
opinions regarding construction of the party's lines and 
policies and the state's important bills. We must improve 
elections, and through elections, we must elect able people with 
good morals as people's deputies as well as place them in state 
mechanisms. 
  We must restore social order and discipline, oppose any 
manifestations of extreme democracy, and implement dictatorship 
over elements who carry out activities against the fatherland 
and the people's interests. 
  We must accelerate and heighten the quality of law-building 
work to build a uniform legal system and institutionalize the 
party's renovation line in all aspects of social life. 
Education on the law must be strengthened to improve legal 
knowledge, law-abiding consciousness, and the people's respect 
for the Constitution and law in their work and social lives. We 
must ensure that the law is carried out in a correct, uniform, 
and just manner. 
  We must continue to improve and reform the state mechanism 
and ensure the unity of power. We must clearly define and 
expand the power of the administration, legislature, and 
judiciary. And we must work according to the principle of 
democratic centralism. 
  The National Assembly's work quality must be heightened so 
that it can perform its legislation and supervision functions 
better. The number of National Assembly deputies working in 
specialized areas must be increased. 
  We must reform and strengthen the administrative system's 
organization, personnel, and working structure. The 
administration's management role must be developed. The role 
and responsibilities of local authorities must be defined on the 
basis of the law and the guidance of the central government. 
  We must continue to strengthen and reform the judicial 
system. The power of different judicial organs must be correctly 
defined. We must gradually establish new judicial organs to meet 
new demands arising from socioeconomic development and ensure 
fair trials for all law violations. 
  We must set up civil service regulations and public work 
responsibilities and retrain government cadres and officials to 
ensure uniformity in the administration. 
  8. Renovating and reorganizing the party and 
strengthening the relationship between it and the people. 
  We must continue to understand concepts thoroughly and 
implement the lines and measures set forth by the party third 
plenum. We must concentrate on political and ideological work 
to ensure political and ideological unity in the entire party. 
Cadres and party members must be given regular training on the 
party's concepts and lines to upgrade their knowledge; confirm 
their commitment in the socialist path; and help them creatively 
apply and develop Maxism-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh Thought, and the 
advanced ideas of our times and grasp the new thinking to 
resolve problems that arise from real situations correctly. 
  Ideological work must first concentrate on pressing problems 
that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical research 
and review, problems arising from the renovation process must be 
scientifically clarified together with measures to solve them. 
Mistaken concepts and vague and unsure ideologies must be 
corrected. We must fight all opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, 
and conservative manifestations. 
  Party cadres and members must strictly observe party 
resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not 
disseminate concepts that contradict the party's line. 
  Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles 
related to party organization and activity -- foremost, the 
principle of democratic centralism and the principle of 
collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be 
implemented. 
  Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must be 
maintained to fight waste, corruption, and illegal businesses. 
We must fight personalism, lack of discipline, arbitrariness, 
authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness. 
  Party protection work and the work to ensure internal and 
national secrecy must be given particular attention. All 
conspiracies and tricks to degenerate party cadres must be 
eliminated. Control over the implementation of the party's 
lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened. 
  The national unity block must be broadened, and the close 
relationship between the party and the public must be 
consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly 
unite the Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause 
for national independence and striving to extricate ourselves 
from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward 
the goal of a rich population, a strong nation, and a just and 
civilized society. 
  We must consider the national interests as our common goal. 
At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as 
they do not run counter to the national interests. We should 
eliminate obsessions and hatreds and look forward to the future. 
The ideology of unity must be manifested in all state guidance, 
policies, and laws. 
  We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and 
roles 
of the workers, peasants, and intelligencia. Women and youth 
must be fostered and developed. The party and state policies 
regarding ethnic and religious people, industrialists, 
businessmen, and the overseas Vietnamese community must be 
supplemented and satisfactorily implemented. 
  Party echelons and committees must hold study workshops 
before implementing party Central Committee and Political Bureau 
resolutions on work relating to fatherland fronts and mass 
organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to coordinate the 
activities of state organs and mass organizations. The work 
content, method, and attitude of the fatherland fronts and mass 
organizations must be revamped. 
  We have to reform cadre-related work. First, we must renew 
the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in assessing, 
selecting, employing, and deploying; especially key cadres. 
Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed. We have 
to create favorable conditions for good people -- both inside 
and outside of the party and inside and outside of the country 
-- to contribute their best efforts for the nation. 
  The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and 
ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight 
narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination. 
The evaluation, choice, and assignment of leading cadres at all 
levels must follow fundamental standards outlined in the third 
Central Committee plenum resolution. We must pay particular 
attention to their political knowledge, determination regarding 
the party's goals and ideals, and morality and lifestyle to 
ensure that they always exercise diligence, practice frugality, 
instill honesty, and uphold righteousness. They must not be 
corrupt; they must be determined to fight corruption. They must 
be aware of organization and discipline, stay close to the 
masses, and obtain a capacity and quality on par with their 
duties. 
  We will bring about the democratization of party member 
work. Evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the 
party committee directly managing the cadres, together with 
relevant agencies. It must be done in accordance with the 
proper process in a democratic, conscientious, and fair manner. 
Every cadre has the right to be informed and to give opinions 
on their evaluation by the party committee and agency leaders. 
  All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the 
existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they 
will make plans for party member work from now until the year 
2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the 
quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. 
  We will provide training to cadres according to plan. The 
training content must be specific for each task and requirement 
of each position concerned. Renovation must be carried out in 
both teaching and studying methods, while adequate funds must be 
provided for the training. Party members -- especially cadres 
at all levels -- must regularly study, enrich their knowledge, 
heighten their level of understanding, and improve their 
revolutionary characteristics. 
  We must urgently prepare the human force for the eighth 
party 
congress and subsequent years. We have to improve the policies 
and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten the 
scientific characteristic of the organization task, and continue 
to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a light and 
effective party mechanism with high efficiency. 
  We have to boost research on organizational models and 
discern the party's function, duty, and leadership style in 
every sector and echelon. From there, we must set up plans to 
perfect the organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the 
party, state, and other organizations. 
  We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is 
a ruling party that sets policies and lines for national 
construction and protection. The successful implementation of 
party policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the 
organization and cadre work. The party takes the lead in 
applying the principle of democratic centralism and the 
principle of collective leadership with individual 
responsibility. The leadership task is fulfilled through the 
party organization, not through individual party cadres. The 
leader executes collective decisions, follows up on and guides 
the implementation, encourages good deeds, and corrects 
deviations to develop the role and efficacy of the state, not 
replace it. 
  We must heighten the militancy of party members regarding 
the 
consolidation of grassroots party organizations. Political 
determination and loyalty to the party's ideals, the working 
people's interests, and the interests of the people as a whole 
are essential characteristics for a party member. Party 
regulations clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party 
member. Every member must abide by these regulations and serve 
as a model in striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or 
manager who fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to 
improve their knowledge and work ability, respects 
organizational discipline, fosters party unity, and strictly 
obeys state laws. 
  We have to handle degenerate and deviant party members in a 
timely and strict manner, as well as those who breach party 
discipline and state laws. We will continue to expel from our 
party those who are no longer eligible for membership. We must 
perform the party development task well, especially among youth 
and women and in organizations where grassroots party 
organizations do not exist or have few members. 
  We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of 
the party's 65th anniversary and other important festivities in 
1994, we will launch education and training campaigns regarding 
party development -- with particular attention focused on youth 
-- in preparation for the eighth party congress. 
  A new era is before us, full of promising potential, 
challenges that we are determined to overcome, and favorable 
opportunities we must exploit. Our entire party, Army, and 
people must stick together, remain unified in the struggle to 
implement the seventh party congress resolution successfully, 
and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever greater 
victories.

<F P=106> [Summary of interview with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general </F>
of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), by Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo 
University professor, on 13 February, moderated by Shoichi 
Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN political editor; place not given; first 
paragraph is YOMIURI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Excerpts] After the passage of the political reform laws, 
as vigorous moves toward the realignment of the political world 
become apparent, YOMIURI SHIMBUN invited Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito, on 13 February to talk for about two hours 
on the possible course of political realignment, foreign policy 
and security, international contribution, and his assessment of 
postwar politics. The following is a summary of his remarks. A 
more detailed report of the interview will appear in the April 
issue of the monthly THIS IS YOMIURI (on sale on 9 March). 
<H5>  Future of Japan-U.S. Relations </H5>
  [Oikawa] Japan and the United States failed to reach an 
agreement at the latest summit talks due to a dispute over the 
issue of numerical targets. For the first time, Japan clearly 
said "no." How do you assess this unprecedented development? 
  [Ozawa] Changes in Japanese-U.S. relations are inevitable 
amid the historical trend of searching for a new world order 
after the collapse of the Cold War structure. As a nation which 
has grown more independent, Japan finds itself in a difficult 
position. From a position where it once enjoyed the safety and 
comforts of the cradle, Japan must now act with responsibility 
as a mature nation. I believe it was proper, in that sense, for 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to say that this cannot be 
done, this is wrong, or that things are not yet ready. 
  However, this does not mean that saying "no" is all that 
matters, although the popular sentiment seems to be that it 
feels good to do so. 
  I am most concerned not about what happens to the economic 
framework talks, but that it will be terrible if the 
relationship of trust between Japan and the United States 
disintegrates. If we are asked whether Japan, as a member of 
the international community, is handling various issues, 
including the domestic market and security, competently, the 
truth is, we still cannot say with confidence that "Everything 
is under control; we do not have to be told." 
  If the Americans think of us as saying "no" only when it 
suits our purpose, and relying on others when we want to, then 
the relationship of trust between the two countries will be 
bankrupt. 
  [Sasaki] I think we have come to take on very heavy 
responsibilities. Particularly economic issues. On the 
surface, current issues resemble those during the bubble 
economic boom in the 1980's, but actually, the position of both 
countries and the environment have changed. I believe we were 
able to negotiate in such a manner because the political regime 
has changed. 
  [Ozawa] Although the coalition government has been termed a 
precarious mosaic or glass work, it has more breadth than the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] administrations. The most 
effective means to revitalize the economy is deregulation. It 
is not good that we should be told by the United States to open 
up our market. (This is) Japan's own problem. While there is a 
need for regulations to protect the weak, too many regulations 
dampen the sense of self-reliance on the part of both 
enterprises and individuals, and there can be no notion of 
taking responsibility for one's own actions. 
  [Oikawa] When it comes to deregulation, there is the problem 
of the bureaucratic system. The bureaucrats were also an 
obstacle during the time of (former) Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone. How will the exercise of political power change this? 
  [Ozawa] It is only natural for people to resist when what 
they are used to doing is going to be changed. So my point is, 
the resistance of bureaucrats is not a problem. If there is a 
problem, this has to do with the people who live by the 
regulations we have just mentioned. In the past, the 
bureaucrats, and even the politicians, did not have to make 
political decisions in the real sense under the Cold War 
structure. Their only job was to draw up the budget, and 
distribute the revenues equally. 
  On the whole, we followed the decision of the United States, 
and it was enough just to agree. In that sense, it was not true 
politics. The same was true for the bureaucrats, they 
concentrated on trivial things like regulations and subsidies. 
We would like the bureaucrats to use their heads for greater 
political issues, such as Japan's role in the international 
community. 
  [Sasaki] How do you look at the issue of the DPRK's 
suspected development of nuclear arms taken up during the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks? 
  [Ozawa] It is very significant that the leaders of Japan and 
the United States reached basic agreement on the North Korean 
issue. This might be the first time a Japanese prime minister 
has made a clear statement. So far, we had remained ambiguous. 
Japan should act properly in line with the agreement reached at 
the summit meeting. 
  Pictures of Political Reorganization 
  [Oikawa] How would you reorganize the political world? 
Prime Minister Hosokawa has pointed out the possibility of 
reorganizing the political world during the current Diet session. 
  [Ozawa] I have the same view as the prime minister. I 
somehow understand it because the plan to introduce 300 
(single-seat constituencies) was proposed by the government 
before. In this sense, I think (political reorganization) will 
be made at considerably faster speed than what the mass media 
are saying. I do not mean to say it is going to be a merger 
only among the coalition parties or a course of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] alone. I have a feeling that the 
coalition parties and the LDP will be involved in the 
realignment. 
  [Sasaki] To some degree, the 1955 regime of Japanese 
politics and the economic structure were inseparable. I would 
like to ask you how we should change Japan's economic structure 
and what kind of impact will the difference between those, who 
are trying to keep the existing system, and others, who are 
trying to make major changes to the existing system and thereby 
allowing political power to take leadership, have on realignment 
of the political world. 
  [Ozawa] I think the difference between those, who think the 
current system should not be changed, and others, who think 
changes are needed, boils down to the differences of opinions 
regarding periodic recognition and historical views. 
  We should actively buckle down to technological development. 
Another thing the government has to deal with is wide-ranging 
environmental issues. The government should not introduce 
measures for maintaining total demand or opening up a new 
industrial field. Instead, the government should launch visions 
or guidance. 
  The government should do these two things. At the same time, 
the government should also study an ideal form of welfare state 
or welfare system and deal with the issue of how much burden the 
people should bear. I think these three points will be major 
pillars of political realignment. 
  [Oikawa] How will the things you have just said be related 
to images of the parties? Can you explain it in concrete terms? 
  [Ozawa] The LDP and opposition parties feel at peace in a 
society with many regulations. 
  Originally, the regulations were made to ensure the people 
would get fair and equal chances. But, regulations have 
negative aspects. Regulations can be easily linked to corruption 
when abused by people in power. Political reform can correct 
this point. 
  [Oikawa] Can you explain how the progress or process of 
political realignment is being promoted? 
  [Ozawa] I still cannot foresee visible phenomenons. 
However, the revised political reform bills will be approved in 
mid-February. I think people's attention will shift to political 
reform as soon as the bills are passed. 
  [Oikawa] Do you think that such a thing as the course of 
government, or the government's role in international society 
will be one of the issues of political realignment? 
  [Ozawa] Yes, I do. I think differences of opinions 
regarding policies, what a nation should be or what politics 
should be like will become major factors. We should introduce a 
fundamental security act and thereby clearly spell out the 
ideals of a peaceloving and UN-centered nation. 
  [Oikawa] Can you comment on elections, including the issue 
of nominating joint candidates, under the new electoral system? 
  [Ozawa] Many lawmakers do not have a thorough understanding 
of the new electoral system, and neither does the general 
public. Parties will nominate candidates. The proportional 
representation also applies to single-seat constituencies too. 
Because of these, they still understand that the words 
"cooperation in elections" and "joint candidate" apply to 
organizations which confirmed things during elections in the 
past. However, (under the new electoral system) political 
parties and groups are not required to be confirmed as 
organizations that are allowed to conduct election campaigns. I 
think the coalition parties will have to compete in the next 
election as a single party. 
  [Oikawa] How will coalition parties handle their policy 
differences? 
  [Ozawa] It is absolutely unnecessary to think which party is 
good and which party is not, or who is good and who is not. For 
example, I think Mr. Hosokawa should remain as prime minister. 
Those who have the same opinion should gather together. I do 
not know how other politicians (think), but I think that when 
the coalition parties merge into a new party, they will do so 
without confrontation over basic policies. 
  [Sasaki] Political reform will necessitate a personnel 
reshuffle at the final stage. What are your opinions? 
  [Ozawa] (Shinseito) would invite those who seek candidacy 
and select candidates from them. I am a second-generation 
politician. Second-generation politicians tend to be criticized 
because of their advantageous positions to win candidacy. Such 
criticism will disappear if candidates are selected through a 
strict test. But I sincerely hope that incumbent Diet members 
will be exempted from the test because if they all fail the 
test, that would be very embarrassing (laughter). 
<H5>  Future Policy Tasks </H5>
  [Sasaki] Following the legislation of the bills connected 
with political reform, there will arise many problems on the 
mechanism of making political decisions. One of them concerns 
reform at the Diet, and I would like to hear your views on this 
issue. 
  [Ozawa] Under the current situation, you can still see the 
influence of the 1955 system. For example, the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is undergoing a very serious 
agony. In handling the issues on the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (at the Uruguay Round), on bills connected with 
political reform, and on the tax cut, they would have voiced 
their opposition without giving any thought if it were still an 
opposition party. However, they have now come to feel that they 
must fulfill their political responsibilities. On the other 
hand, if the 1955 system had continued, all these three issues 
would never have been settled. 
  As for the issue on how deliberations should be actually 
carried out at the Diet, I think opposition parties should be 
mainly held responsible for checking the government. Therefore, 
the Diet's functions should be strengthened. For example, the 
Diet should be more sufficiently staffed. And the system of 
appointing government delegates [to assist cabinet members in 
Diet deliberations] should be abolished. Deliberations at the 
Diet should be conducted among politicians. These plans must be 
put into effect. Then, the people will think that a new Diet 
has started, and politicians will be able to carry out more 
intensive study. When politicians come to have accurate 
knowledge, bureaucrats will listen to them. Bureaucrats may 
have a low opinion of politicians when they talk incoherently. 
In the past, politicians have spent an overwhelming part of 
their energy on election campaigning. In the future, we should 
make political parties take responsibility for 20 to 30 percent 
of campaigning so politicians will have enough energy to study 
issues and debate with bureaucrats, and so deliberations can be 
conducted among the ruling and opposition parties at the Diet. 
  [Oikawa] You have advocated the system of assigning Dietmen 
from ruling parties to the government by creating posts for two 
to three deputy ministers [fuku daijin] and four to six 
political councillors [seimu shingi-kan] at each individual 
agency and ministry. How would you explain this point? 
  [Ozawa] Politicians, particularly politicians from ruling 
parties, should be held responsible for administration. At the 
Diet sessions, those politicians from ruling parties who are 
assigned to official posts should be asked to engage in 
deliberations with Dietmen from opposition parties. 
  [Oikawa] In concrete terms, when and how will this system be 
introduced? 
  [Ozawa] Since this issue has been brought up for discussions 
at a meeting of senior leaders of ruling parties, I hope the 
system will be put into effect at the current Diet session. 
  [Sasaki] It seems that opinions are divided among the ruling 
coalition parties on the issue of whether an organ for 
monitoring the development of political reform should be set up 
at the Diet or in the cabinet. What do you think of this? 
  [Ozawa] If politicians have become genuinely mature, I think 
it will be desirable to set up this organ at the Diet. However, 
under the current atmosphere involving both ruling and 
opposition parties, it will be very difficult for the government 
to carry out its administration if such an organ should be set 
up at the Diet and entrusted with the task of administrative 
reform and supervision. It is because the organ is bound to 
concentrate on faultfinding. 
  [Sasaki] Deliberations at the Japanese Diet are known for 
being extremely detailed. 
  [Ozawa] Discussions are usually held on insignificant 
issues. Originally, the opposition should be responsible for 
monitoring ruling parties. However, the Japanese, including 
members of both ruling and opposition parties, have normally 
kept in mind that bureaucrats imply the government [o-kami]. At 
Diet sessions, even Dietmembers from ruling parties are asking 
bureaucrats questions. Dietmembers from both ruling and 
opposition parties prefer listening to answers given by 
bureaucrats. And I am arguing that it will not do to have such 
an awareness. 
  [Sasaki] At what forums do you plan to bring up the issue on 
power decentralization for discussion? In my opinion, unless 
local governments make moves, there will be no changes in the 
overall political trend no matter how the central government 
tries to make moves. What do you say? 
  [Ozawa] Many Japanese speak of "deregulation." However, 
there is hardly anyone who truly hopes for deregulation because 
it is comfortable to live in a regulated society, and this 
argument also holds true with localities. While complaining 
that "it is very troublesome to make petitions to the 
authorities," local government officials get scared when "they 
are given funds and authority and asked to carry out some 
policies by themselves." Speaking of power decentralization in 
the true sense of the words, however, there are cases where 
central government offices may refuse to surrender their 
authority but there are also cases where the other side is not 
keen on decentralization. 
  [Oikawa] How would you actually implement Diet reform 
and decentralization of power? 
  [Ozawa] When things are doing just fine, it is difficult to 
start something new. For instance, the national welfare tax has 
been termed abrupt. However, the aging society is gradually 
becoming visible, and the people are beginning to think 
seriously. From now on, many things will need political 
decisions. The political authorities should take the 
responsibility and make decisions on such issues as the problem 
of the Korean peninsula. Things will not turn out as planned 
even if you write a time schedule during peace time. 
  Basically, the international community has become volatile. 
We need to build a system able to cope with this. In a sense, 
this constitutes political reform. This means the political 
authorities should take the responsibility to make and implement 
their decisions. At least, we need to create two groups capable 
of taking the reins of government. Three would also be alright. 
The international situation and domestic affairs may become 
explosive. The question is whether we will be able to respond 
promptly. As to what should be the priority and how decisions 
should be made, the regime in power can decide about that. 
[passage omitted on Ozawa's assessment of postwar politics] 
<H5>  What Kind of Person Is "Ichiro Ozawa"? </H5>
  [Oikawa] Some people are accusing you of forming a dual 
power structure in the ruling coalition in the same way as 
Kakuei Tanaka and Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] did in the past. What do you think of this? 
  [Ozawa] The head of the administration needs leadership. He 
can fully exercise the leadership only when he is accepted by 
the people of the time. In this context, I think Mr. Hosokawa 
should remain as leader for the present. I do not think I am 
the right person to be leader. Besides that, I have no 
intention of obtaining that highest post. 
  My position is different from those of Messrs. Tanaka and 
Takeshita. I am not a behind-the-scenes strong man. In LDP 
style, I am a secretary general. My title is the chief 
secretary of Shinseito. If a new party is formed and I am asked 
to assume an executive post, I will accept the offer as long as 
I am a member of the House of Representatives. I think it is 
not right to compare myself with Messrs. Tanaka and Takeshita. 
  [Oikawa] Some criticize you by saying that you act 
"high-handedly" and have "fascistic ideas." 
  [Ozawa] I am responsible for my remarks and behavior. In 
Japan's village-like society, people do not clearly state their 
opinions. Also, responsible leaders do not make clear their 
views and behavior. So far, Japanese politicians have tried to 
form consensus and do what others agree to. In this regard, my 
remarks and behavior are different from those of other 
politicians. I have not chosen to become the target of 
criticism. But I am responsible for what I have to say so long 
as I am elected as a politician. 
  [Oikawa] While you sometimes disappear from the public eye, 
you are calling for "pursuing open-door politics." Don't you 
think you contradict yourself? 
  [Ozawa] That is what the mass media has said. I do not 
disappear like a mole. Since I got ill, I have tried to take a 
rest. That is all. I go shopping with my wife and go to the 
movies. I do not want (my private life) to be disturbed by the 
media. 
  [Oikawa] When you were questioned about the political 
donations you received from major construction companies, you 
just said: "The donations were handled in accordance with law." 
You did not explain exactly how the donations were handled. 
  [Ozawa] They were handled properly in accordance with the 
current judicial order. Other politicians also handle their 
political donations in the same way. Some people have said that 
"the political funds control law has many loopholes," and that 
"Ozawa has clearly evaded the law." I have heard the criticism 
of this kind. There are many special cases provided by the 
current tax law in which political donations are treated as 
legal. Also, the tax authorities may in their discretion decide 
whether they are legal or not. If you say this system is bad, 
that is tantamount to saying that those who handle political 
donations in accordance with this system are also bad.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The South Korean Puppet Army Is a </F>
Colonial, Hired Mercenary Army;" from the "Hour for South Korean 
Soldiers" program] 
  [Text] Officers and men of the South Korean Army: The 
South Korean Army has been invariably a colonial, hired 
mercenary army for outside forces. After the military dictators 
came to their doom a so-called civilian-led regime emerged. The 
so-called civilian-led regime has babbled about so-called 
military reform and the like. However, the so-called military 
reform is nothing but an ostentatious slogan, and the puppet 
army still remains a colonial, hired mercenary army for outside 
forces. 
  The prerogative of supreme command of the puppet army is 
still in the hands of the United States, and even the puppet 
army officers' manual books stipulate that the puppet army's 
imaginary enemy is precisely the North, following the U.S. 
strategy of aggression against Korea. 
  There are many armies in the world. However, there is no 
army 
in the world, the prerogative of supreme command of which has 
been completely divested of by outside forces and the nation of 
which has been prescribed as an enemy. 
  A newspaper published by the Korean residents in a foreign 
country wrote: The South Korean puppet army is not a national 
army but an antinational army because it is the army which does 
not serve the interests of the nation but exists only for 
outside forces. 
  Even a former commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea 
himself confessed that the South Korean Army is a hired 
mercenary army of the United States, that it is an army 
protecting U.S. investments in South Korea, and that it is an 
army which can bear maximum effectiveness with minimum expenses. 
The South Korean puppets themselves admit that their 
prerogative of supreme command has been divested of and that 
their army is nothing but a hired mercenary army controlled by 
outside forces. 
  That the South Korean puppet army is aiming its rifle at 
fellow countrymen is because it has become cheap cannon fodder 
for outside forces. The South Korean puppet Army was used and is 
being used as a shock brigade for outside forces' aggression 
overseas because it is a colonial, hired mercenary army. 
  According to a recent report of the South Korean Munhwa 
Broadcasting System, the South Korean puppets dispatched as many 
as 312,850 South Korean puppet troops to Vietnam during the 
Vietnam War as demanded by the United States, and among them 
over 4,600 troops were killed in vain. Of course, this was the 
figure reduced to the minimum by the puppets. How can these 
hired mercenary troops which opposed fellow countrymen and took 
part in slaughtering another nation according to the aggression 
policy of outside forces be regarded as an army for the country, 
for the nation, and for the people? 
  The South Korean puppets are propagating that although it 
had 
the disgrace of being the plunderer of power in the past the 
army will not meddle in politics in the future nor will it be 
used as riot- quelling troops [chinapkun] for political 
purposes. However, the people never believe this. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring clamored that the puppet army should 
not become riot-quelling troops. However, this is, in fact, an 
out-and-out lie. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is brutally suppressing those people 
calling for reunification and, because of this, has been branded 
as a civilian-led fascist ring. The civilian-led dictatorial 
elements have gone so far as to designate the people calling for 
the right of survival as the target of their suppression. Today 
the people still vividly remember the fact that the previous 
South Korean dictators barbarously murdered thousands of Kwangju 
citizens by mobilizing the puppet army troops when the United 
States issued them directives to brutally suppress the Kwangju 
resistance in a bid to rescue the colonial fascist ruling system 
from a crisis and to prevent civilians from attacking its 
(?nuclear) base in Kwangju. 
  As his predecessors did, traitor Kim Yong-sam is playing the 
role as a running dog and a guard protecting the colonial rule 
by outside and nuclear weapons storehouses. 
  The puppet traitor committed the treacherous crime of 
selling 
the rice market, which is closely related to the destiny of the 
six million South Korean farmers, to his U.S. boss in return for 
his so-called international cooperative system formed to do harm 
to fellow countrymen. He is now brutally suppressing the 
struggle of farmers and young students against the opening of 
the rice market. There is no guarantee that this pro-U.S. 
flunkyist and national traitor will not trigger a war against 
fellow countrymen by mobilizing the puppet army. There is also 
no guarantee that he will not impose again such a bloody tragedy 
as the Kwangju incident on the South Korean people. 
  Officers and men of the South Korean Army: You cannot escape 
the digraceful destiny of being the colonial, hired mercenary 
troops as long as a pro-U.S. flunkyist traitor and a 
nation-seller such as traitor Kim Yong-sam keep hold on power in 
South Korea. 
  Officers and men of the South Korean Army should not be 
treated contemptuously as colonial, hired mercenary troops for 
outside forces, being forced to endure a disgraceful destiny, 
but should struggle against [pandae haeso ssawoya] outside 
forces and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, their running dog, to 
regain the divested national sovereignty and to seek the kind of 
life a human being should lead.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Denuclearization of Northeast Asia </F>
Is an Urgent Demand"] 
  [Text] The need for the denuclearization of Northeast Asia 
is now increasing more than ever. International opinion 
interested in peace calls for the denuclearization of Northeast 
Asia, regarding it as an important issue for peace and security 
in Asia and the world at present. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To abolish 
nuclear weapons and prevent nuclear war, nonnuclear, peace zones 
should be established in various parts of the world and should 
be continuously expanded. 
  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an urgent demand 
for the situation prevailing in this region which includes the 
Korean peninsula. Northeast Asia is an area where the danger of 
nuclear war is greater than any other in the world. Today with 
the end of nuclear confrontation between superpowers, nuclear 
disarmament is an international trend. In contrast, however, in 
Northeast Asia, factors increasing the danger of nuclear war 
remain and constantly threaten the peace and security of this 
region and Asia as a whole. 
  Above all else, numerous nuclear bases and nuclear means are 
concentrated in the Northeast Asian region. Nuclear weapons and 
nuclear bases that exist in the Northeast Asian region are the 
remnants of the Cold War era. Under the pretext of deterring 
someone's attack and of preparing for nuclear retaliation, the 
United States built numerous nuclear bases in Northeast Asia, 
such as in South Korea and Japan in the Cold War era, and 
deployed enormous quantities of nuclear weapons and their 
delivery vehicles in forward positions. Under the U.S. nuclear 
umbrella protection strategy, South Korea has turned into the 
largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the Far East, and Japan has 
become an unsinkable U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier. 
  Today, with the Cold War over and with nuclear disarmament a 
prevalent trend, there is no reason why nuclear weapons and 
nuclear bases should remain any longer in Northeast Asia. 
Although the United States declared a few years ago that there 
were no nuclear weapons in South Korea, no convincing practical 
steps have been taken for this [kugosul naptuk sikilmanhan 
silchejok chochiduri chwihaejiji anko issumnida]. Numerous 
nuclear war means are deployed on U.S. military bases in Japan, 
such as those in Misawa and Okinawa. These bases are basic 
factors increasing military confrontation and the danger of 
nuclear war in this region. 
  The danger of nuclear war in Northeast Asia is increasing 
all 
the more because nuclear war commotions continue in this region. 
It is a well-known fact that the United States has frequently 
conducted nuclear war exercises, mobilizing its nuclear weapons 
in the Asia-Pacific region and its mainland as well as into the 
Northeast Asian region. The Team Spirit test nuclear war is a 
typical example of it. The United States is going against its 
own promise in attempting to enforce large-scale nuclear war 
exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
referring to the possibility of someone's nuclear development 
and war provocation. As long as nuclear armed forces exist in 
Northeast Asia and as long as nuclear fire games continue there, 
the danger of nuclear war cannot be removed, nor can the people 
of Asia free themselves from the constant nuclear threat. 
  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia becomes an even more 
serious and urgent problem particularly because a new hotbed of 
nuclear war is rapidly growing in this region. This new nuclear 
war force growing in Northeast Asia today is Japan. The 
possibility of Japan's nuclear armament has now surfaced as an 
international concern, with increasing worries about it. This 
is far from surprising. In fact, Japan's nuclear armament has 
reached a dangerous point. It is a well-known fact that the 
Japanese reactionaries are dashing toward becoming a military 
and nuclear power, raving that Japan lost the war in the past 
because it was not strong enough. 
  Japan will soon be operating [monju], its first fast breeder 
reactor in its nuclear power plant with the largest-scale 
reprocessing capacity in the world. Needless to say, this 
emerges from Japan's dangerous attempts to produce nuclear 
weapons in a fullfledged manner at any time by securing large 
quantities of plutonium on its own. Japan apparently plans to 
maintain a large stock of plutonium from which it can produce 
some 6,200 nuclear bombs by the year 2010. 
  Japan has all the factors and the technology, including an 
electronic explosion device, that enables it to immediately 
produce nuclear weapons at this time. Moreover, Japan has 
already manufactured nuclear warheads, which will operate only 
if the required amount of plutonium is loaded. Japan recently 
fired a satellite delivery rocket. Thus, in actuality it came to 
possess a long-range missile system. This means that Japan's 
nuclear armament has become a reality before the people's eyes. 
It is not an imaginary thing. 
  Experts in nuclear issues believe that it is simply a matter 
of time for Japan to develop nuclear weapons. With the opening 
of the door for dispatching troops overseas, Japan's nuclear 
armament maneuvers take even a more grave and dangerous hue. 
Japan's acceleration of its nuclear armament lays obstacles on 
the course of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In 
addition to the United States, Japan is attempting to become our 
other nuclear offender [haek kahaeja]. We absolutely cannot 
become the nuclear victim of Japan. 
  Under the circumstances that Japan is accelerating its 
nuclear armament program, we, its neighbor, are forced to cope 
with this situation with vigilance [pudukbuk kaksongul kajigo ie 
taechohajianulsu optta]. Because Japan's nuclear armament has 
reached a dangerous stage, the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula became meaningless. The denuclearization of Northeast 
Asia must be realized to check Japan's nuclear armaments. 
  It is necessary that the world, not to mention Asia, should 
direct due attention to Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers, and 
should wage an international movement to check them. It is also 
necessary that the international community raises its voices for 
realizing the denuclearization of Northeast Asia, including the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an important 
demand 
for building a nuclear-free world. To realize the 
denuclearization of the entire world, the district which has 
become a most dangerous nuclear spot should first be made a 
nuclear-free zone. If the denuclearization of Northeast Asia is 
realized, the most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war will be 
removed and a nuclear war can be prevented in Asia, thus 
effecting a remarkable advance in building a nuclear-free world. 
The denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be linked to the 
overall abolishment of nuclear weapons throughout the world. 
Only when this is achieved, can an overall and complete 
abolishment of nuclear arms be realized throughout the world and 
can a new era be opened in guaranteeing durable peace and 
security in the world.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- Japan's Emperor 
Akihito will pay a visit to the United States this year, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [11 February]. 
  Hosokawa told President Bill Clinton of the emperor's 
intention to make the trip during their summit meeting Friday, 
Japanese officials said. 
  Clinton expressed his pleasure at the visit and said the 
U.S. 
Government will do everything it can to make the emperor feel 
welcome, a Japanese spokesman said. 
  Hosokawa did not say when the Japanese monarch is expected 
to 
make the trip, but government sources in Tokyo have said it is 
likely to be in June. 
  Empress Michiko is expected to accompany the emperor. It 
will be the first visit by a Japanese emperor to the U.S. since 
the late Emperor Hirohito, posthumously called Emperor Showa, 
went there in September 1975.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Japan's Foreign Ministry 
has not yet confirmed a reported visit to Japan by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher for next month, a ministry 
spokesman said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada said he is aware 
of some reports saying Christopher is considering an Asian trip 
in March, but that the ministry has not yet been informed about 
the tour by the U.S. Government. 
  Christopher is reportedly planning to visit several Asian 
countries, including Indonesia, China, Japan and Vietnam, after 
a scheduled trip to Australia on March 8 to 9.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner Monday [14 February] welcomed the government's budget 
for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as placing emphasis on 
outlays to shore up the flagging economy. 
  The economy remains broadly sluggish and is expected to 
continue to face rough going for a while, said Manae Kubota, 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). She was 
speaking at a press meeting after negotiating on revisions to 
the budget, due out Tuesday, with Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii. 
  Kubota said her agency has requested the government to focus 
on the economy, and stressed, "we cannot move freely unless the 
economy recovers." 
  In this sense, she pinned hopes on the government's budget 
along with the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched last 
week. 
  Despite tight revenues, the Finance Ministry maintained 
growth at the 4 percent level in public works spending in its 
budget draft announced Thursday. 
  The government is to decide on a budget package at a cabinet 
meeting Tuesday after ministers negotiate separately throughout 
Monday with Fujii in a final bid to revive items that the 
Finance Ministry cut.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 12 -- Goods exchange along 
Sino-Vietnamese borders looking from the outside seems to be 
less active now than that some years ago, but it does not mean 
the quantity of exchanged goods is on the decline, according to 
market specialists. 
  Chinese buyers are mainly interested in Vietnam's foodstuff 
for preparing specialities such as trionychil turtles, frogs, 
tortoises, eels, snakes, dogs, cats, chicken, illicium, green 
bananas and cashew nuts, and raw materials such as rubber, 
natural silk yarn. Meanwhile there is a wide range of consumer 
goods flowing from China to Vietnam. They include mechanical 
goods, processed foodstuffs, fresh fruits, motors, electric 
fans, hot water vacuum bottles, beer, mineral water, 
confectionery, medicinal herbs, garments, cosmetics, bicycles 
and so on. 
  Goods were exchanged through official border gates as well 
as 
footpaths. 
  Taking the lead in the cross-border goods exchange among the 
six northern border provinces is Lang Son. 
  A market managing official in Lang Son revealed that 
Vietnamese and Chinese traders and transporters are seen 
everywhere along the 253 km of the provincial border line. The 
two-way flow of goods across the border is uncontrollable. In 
1993 the province could collect import-exported taxes on only 
one-third of the volume of goods exchanged, namely VND 
[Vietnamese dong] 170 billion (roughly USD 17 million). 
  At the small border gate of Tan Thanh, the quantity of 
exchanged goods every day is worth half a VND billion nearly USD 
50,000, and there are about a hundred of such border gates in 
Lang Son Province. 
  Opposite to Vietnam's border gates, it has been reported 
that 
there are big markets and export-import centres springing up on 
Chinese border areas specially in service of the cross-border 
trade.

  [Excerpts] RANGOON, Feb 15 (AFP) -- A senior Burmese said 
Tuesday that dissident Aung San Suu Kyi would remain under house 
arrest until 1995, ending speculation the Nobel laureate would 
soon be freed from nearly five years' detention. 
  Deputy intelligence chief Colonel Kyaw Win told visiting 
Japanese reporters the security act under which Aung San Suu Kyi 
was held came into effect in July 1990, and the previous year of 
detention was considered an "arrest period." 
  His remarks came amid mounting speculation that the 
diminutive dissident might be released on or around the fifth 
anniversary of her detention, next July, because Burmese law 
permits house arrest for a maximum of five years. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kyaw Win, meanwhile, said the military government was 
willing 
to talk with Aung San Suu Kyi if she makes an official request 
for a dialog, and the only question was at what level the 
meeting should be held. The Japanese journalists quoted him as 
saying that the dissident's "rudeness and arrogance" in dealing 
with the ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC), was one factor in deciding whether she should 
meet SLORC leaders or lower officials. 
  The colonel said the junta had let Richardson meet with Aung 
San Suu Kyi because he had asked for the meeting "as her 
personal friend" and she had agreed to it. Kyaw Win added that 
the SLORC was totally unconcerned about international pressure 
to release the dissident and would continue to act as it sees 
fit. 
  Richardson and Raheem on Tuesday visited Insein jail, where 
Burma holds a number of political prisoners, eyewitnesses said, 
before Richardson paid a second call on Aung San Suu Kyi. There 
has been no official word on the substance of the meetings. 
Terse reports in the Burmese state media said only that Monday's 
meeting [words indistinct] place. But informed sources said 
Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, handed a personal letter 
to Aung San Suu Kyi From US President Bill Clinton on Monday, 
and that she had vowed to continue to champion the cause of 
democracy. No Burmese government officials attended the Monday 
meeting, but a US Embassy representative and US journalist were 
present, reportedly at the request of the dissident herself. 
[passage omitted] A source present at the Monday meeting told 
AFP that Aung San Suu Kyi looked well: "She is fine. She was 
smiling, but she looked a little sad, too." She was wearing a 
plain brown Burmese dress when she met with her visitors. She 
appeared much thinner, but otherwise in good health, the source 
said. [passage omitted] 
  Richardson met Burma's powerful intelligence chief, 
Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, on Monday and was to have met 
senior SLORC officials again Tuesday before leaving for Bangkok 
in the evening. Richardson is a member of the Congressional 
committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement 
and is said to be a close friend of President Clinton.

  [Text] The political trend in the region as well as the 
rest of the world now favors our national development and 
construction. It has resulted in good cooperation in 
implementing the market-oriented economy mechanism. Noteworthy 
is the present trend in economic relations, which continues to 
brighten. In light of this atmosphere, a PASASON newspaper 
correspondent had the honor of interviewing Himmakon Manotham, 
deputy minister of communications, transport, posts, and 
construction. In the interview, Himmakon talked about the 
construction of roads to link northern Laos with foreign 
countries, a subject of great interest to the masses. 
  Asked about progress in developing this system of 
communications lines and postal service, Himmakon said: 
Following the second meeting of Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, 
Cambodia, Myanmar [Burma], and China on economic development in 
the subregion, which was held in Manila, capital of the 
Philippines, in 1993, the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR] Government has sought funds for development projects. It 
has also held bilateral consultative meetings with friendly, 
neighboring countries to find ways and means to improve 
communication lines, border transit transportation, and 
intercommunication service in order to enable the countries in 
this region to cooperate in building infrastructure with a view 
to creating favorable conditions for economic and trade 
development, and the development of human resources. 
  Lately, we have participated in a meeting including 
Thailand, 
Myanmar, and China in Bangkok and a high-level technical meeting 
of the four countries in Kunming to discuss the possibility of 
building regional communications lines (both overland and 
waterborne) to link the four countries. 
  For its part, the LPDR Government has authorized the (Vicno) 
Company of Thailand to invest in exploiting coal in Viang 
Phoukha, Bokeo Province, and building a road linking Houai Sai 
and Viang Phoukha. In addition, it has granted an authorization 
for the (Usafamily) Company of Thailand to conduct surveys and 
plan a design for the construction of a road linking Houai Sai 
and Luang Namtha Province and to find funds for the construction 
of a road linking Viang Phoukha and Namtha. Regarding this, the 
LPDR Government has received cooperation from the World Bank 
which has granted loans to the LPDR for implementation of 
comprehensive development projects in Luang Namtha Province. 
The projects include repairing two roads to provide 
conveniences for vehicles to travel during the dry season -- one 
is the road linking Viang Phoukha and Namtha and another is the 
road linking Sing District and Siangkok which is an area 
bordering Myanmar. 
  With regard to the development of waterborne communication 
lines, in 1993 our government granted authorization to a 
technical team from Yunnan Province in the PRC to make surveys 
and collect technical data along the Mekong River, from the 
Chinese border to Luang Prabang. The survey work is complete 
and various courses of action are under consideration. 
  The deputy minister added in conclusion: Regarding the 
development of Routes 1, 2, 3 and 4 which involve various 
countries in this region, the LPDR Government invested in 
repairing them regularly. The loans used for these repairs have 
been obtained from the Asia Development Bank. All these are to 
create favorable conditions for the expansion of economic 
relations and the exchanges of visits between the peoples of 
Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, and the PRC in the future. 
  Regarding the use of the Mekong River as the primary 
waterborne communication route among these countries, 
appropriate methods and principles are being studied for 
implementation. As the Mekong does not belong to any particular 
country in the region, to make use of this significant river it 
is necessary for the countries to discuss details on utilization 
of the river. The International Mekong Organization may take an 
important role in making this river significant in the economic 
development of the region.

  [Text] A top military official said yesterday he sees no 
direct links between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) 
and the Abu Sayaff, a breakaway group of the MNLF. "There is no 
sufficient proof to show of a tie-up between the Abu Sayaff and 
the MNLF. On the contrary, the Abu Sayaff is bent on sabotaging 
the ongoing peace talks between the MNLF and the government," 
Brigadier General Rene S. Dado, AFP [Armed Forces of the 
Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) chief, said. 
  He urged the MNLF to stop giving refuge to Abu Sayaff 
members 
in their camps to express the MNLF disapproval of their acts of 
terrorism. "By doing so, the Abu Sayaff will be completely 
isolated and makes peace-loving and enlightened Muslims 
happier," Dado added. The CRS chief traced the MNLF's generosity 
to Abu Sayaff members to old ties among leaders of the two 
groups. Dado said the Abu Sayaff has only 120 full-time members, 
not 1,000 as earlier reported. 
  He denied reports on the guns smuggled in by the Abu Sayaff 
"which could not be confirmed by military units in the area 
where the arms landing was supposed to have taken place." He 
said the Abu Sayaff has adopted a guerrilla strategy.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of reports 
of Philippine rebel activities from Philippine media monitored 
by Bangkok Bureau between 5-11 February. Source information is 
given in parentheses at the end of each item. 
  5-9 February 
  No fileworthy items monitored. 
  10 February 
  A member of the Mariano Garcia Brigade (MGB), the local 
New People's Army [NPA] liquidation unit based in Pampanga and 
operating in Central Luzon was killed during a gunbattle with 
policemen that lasted for about 15 minutes. A newly-recruited 
companion was also slain, and three other rebels were wounded. 
MGB was responsible for the killing of American servicemen in 
1987 at the former Clark Air Base. (Manila MANILA STANDARD p 4) 
  11 February 
  Twenty communist rebels from Cotabato surrendered to 
military authorities out of frustration over the turbulent 
quarrels plaguing the communist movement. The leader of those 
who surrendered assured the military that he will lead a

  [Text] Washington, 13 Feb -- On 13 February, a White House 
spokesman accompanying U.S. President Bill Clinton in Hot 
Springs, Arkansas, said "The President has not yet made any 
decision" concerning an embargo against Japan. 
  His remark contradicted THE WASHINGTON POST's 13 February 
report that "the U.S. Government has decided to impose economic 
sanctions against Japan" following the breakup of the economic 
framework talks over the objective criteria issue.

  [Text] The U.S. Government is highly likely to impose 
sanctions on Japan over the issue of opening the Japanese mobile 
phone market to U.S. phone makers. Commenting on the U.S. move 
at a news conference on 15 February, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister 
of international trade and industry, said: "Perhaps the U.S. 
Government is considering various options. I hope that the U.S. 
Government will not deal emotionally with the issue. If the 
reasons for the United States to slap sanctions on Japan are 
deemed to be unfair, Japan will have to argue fearlessly with 
the United States at the GATT." In this way, the minister 
indicated that Japan would take its case to the GATT depending 
on how the United States handles the issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Establish a True `Mature Relationship' </F>
Between Japan and the United States"] 
  [Text] While President Clinton stated that "it is better 
to have reached no agreement than to have reached an empty 
agreement," Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said that "an 
ambiguous agreement is a source of misunderstandings." Thus, 
the Japan-U.S. summit talks ended in a rupture over the pending 
economic framework talks. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: "A 
mature relationship between the two nations should be one in 
which both say frankly what they are unable to do." There is no 
choice but to coolly accept this unusual situation and seek a 
way for building a true "mature relationship" between Japan and 
the United States. 
  During the joint news conference after the summit talks, 
both 
Japanese and U.S. leaders seemed to be cautious as much as 
possible not to make the situation worse. While President 
Clinton stressed that "the Japan-U.S. relationship is the most 
important bilateral relationship," Prime Minister Hosokawa 
pointed out that "the results of the talks should not damage the 
close and friendly relations between the two nations." Although 
a breakdown in a summit meeting is not unusual among European 
nations, as well as between the United States and European 
nations, past Japan-U.S. summit meetings always ended 
successfully. For this reason, both leaders were anxious to 
minimize the shock of the rupture in their talks. 
  It is certain that Japan and the United States are in a 
state 
of economic cold war in the wake of the breakdown in the 
economic framework talks. The President refrained from 
mentioning the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan 
following the breakdown in the talks. However, the U.S. 
Congress has begun to move to impose sanctions against Japan. 
For example, Senator Baucus stressed the need for revival of 
the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act. The President himself referred to 
"fluctuations in exchange rates" as a concrete indicator to 
measure Japan's progress in opening markets, and the exchange 
market is moving toward the yen appreciation. 
<H5>  Cool-Headed Action Is Required </H5>
  Amid the situation in which the economic framework talks 
will 
be frozen for the time being and there will be no way out to 
break the deadlock in economic relations between Japan and the 
United States, what is of most concern is that emotional 
confrontation will spread between the two countries. To avoid 
such a situation, it is important that Japan and the United 
States try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means. 
Although it goes without saying that the economic relations are 
important, the Japan-U.S. relationship does not consist only of 
those. What is important is to consider the depth of mutual 
dependence between Japan and the United States and to take a 
calm attitude. 
  It seems that despite the breakdown in the summit talks, 
there is no tremor in the foundation of personal relationship 
between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, both of 
whom seek reform. Nevertheless, it is dangerous that the two 
countries should rely on the relationship between the two 
leaders to prevent a decisive confrontation in Japanese-U.S. 
relations. There is no other adjusting mechanism than a summit 
between the two countries, and the situation is quite dangerous. 
It is understandable that trade negotiators of both countries 
confront each other. However, it is undesirable that the 
foreign minister and the secretary of state discuss issues in 
the same way as the negotiators. 
  Why did Japan and the United States make a mistake? It can 
be said that now that they do not have to be united as a 
liberalism camp following the end of the Cold War, economic 
confrontation between Japan and the United States has come to 
the fore. Nevertheless, this is not the only reason. 
  The Clinton administration, concluding that the post-Cold 
War 
era would become an era of the economy, has worked out its 
economic strategy at the National Economic Council (NEC). 
However, the administration has forgotten the fact that, in the 
era of the economy, the leading role is not for the government 
but companies and consumers, and that decisions are made not at 
the White House but on the market. It is obvious that numerical 
targets demanded by the United States will surely lead to 
"managed trade." 
  The reason why Japan has insisted on this view is not 
because its bureaucrats are obstinate but because it is common 
sense in the world. Influential American economists as well as 
major mass media in Japan, the United States, the UK, and Canada 
share the Japanese view. The conspicuous view is that "Prime 
Minister Hosokawa should say `no'" to the U.S. demand, 
(according to an editorial in the British FINANCIAL TIMES). 
  Although the Clinton administration has strengthened its 
information strategy toward Japan, it failed to figure out 
Japan's reform thoroughly because it has stuck to the view of 
Japan revisionism [nihon ishitsuron]. This indicates that 
experts on Japanese affairs who think that Japan is a peculiar 
nation should not be involved in the current Japan-U.S. ties. 
To secure numerical targets, administrative instructions by 
Japanese bureaucrats are necessary. Nevertheless, deregulation 
efforts being promoted by the Hosokawa administration are aimed 
at decreasing such intervention by the government. 
  Japan also made a mistake. It was busy saying only "no" to 
the U.S. demand, and did not act on opening its markets, 
seriously delaying the economic pump-priming measures. Its 
current account surplus remains large. The trade imbalance 
between Japan and the United States is widening due to the 
current economic gap between the two countries. The Japanese 
Government should have indicated its understanding of the U.S. 
irritation, with the off-year election near at hand. Japan has 
been making efforts to open its markets, and the situation of 
market opening has largely changed. Nevertheless, we cannot help 
but say that Japan is still protectionist among the industrial 
nations in the area of opening markets. 
  The biggest mistake is that both Japan and the United 
States, 
which should be models for world trade, took a narrow view. The 
two countries faced off without taking into account the chaotic 
post-Cold War world. 
  Although it seems that the Clinton administration took the 
initiative in concluding the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round, it did so mainly for the sake of 
improving the employment situation in the United States. Japan 
did not take the lead in the Uruguay Round but rather played a 
role of a victim. The situation in which Japan and the United 
States are snarling at each other in a manner of pursuing only 
their own interest will negatively effect not only both sides 
but also the world economy as a whole. 
<H5>  Same Value Should Be Sought </H5>
  The manner of frankly talking is not a way to prevent the 
economic cold war from expanding and to build a true mature 
relationship. Although it is said that the Japan-U.S. 
relationship is maturing, it is different from the relationship 
between the United States and European nations. This does not 
refer only to the difference in military structures -- namely, a 
difference between the Japan-U.S. security system and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Because the same value has 
rooted in the U.S.- European relationship, a residue of hard 
feeling would not be left between them even after they quarrel 
with each other heatedly. 
  During a cooling-off period, Japan and the United States, at 
first, need to think why the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
have been in an impasse, from each other's standpoint. After 
that, they need to rebuild a new adjusting framework. This 
should be a trade framework which will be open to the world and 
be based on the GATT system. 
  Japan and the United States should not only concentrate on 
the bilateral negotiations but also become cosponsors of a 
proposal for a new multilateral trade negotiation after the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round. There are many tasks which the 
two countries have to tackle immediately, such as working out 
international rules for trade, environment, and competitive 
policies. Now is the time to study a new international monetary 
system in which monetary authorities do not take an action of 
verbal intervention and in which economic conditions of each 
country are reflected. 
  This may be a good idea that Japan and the United States 
will 
jointly tackle the "Global New Deal" policy which some quarters, 
including U.S. labor unions, are discussing to solve the 
employment issue, a world's common issue. 
  Japan and the United States will not reach a true mature 
relationship until they find the same value through such efforts 
in the post-Cold War era.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry on 14 February disclosed its 
plan to reemphasize at the 26 February meeting of finance 
ministers and central bankers of the seven major industrialized 
nations (G-7) in Frankfurt, Germany, Japan's efforts to boost 
domestic demand primarily by implementing a 6-trillion-yen tax 
cut program. The ministry also plans to seek the understanding 
of member nations regarding such efforts. 
  At the G-7 meeting, the ministry also plans to express its 
concern that should the yen be left to rise sharply in the 
foreign exchange market at the current pace, it would diminish 
the effects of Japan's pump-priming package. Adjustment of the 
currency exchange rate is expected to be a major topic on the 
agenda at the G-7 meeting, and member nations are likely to ask 
Japan to make further efforts to boost domestic demand. 
  A senior Finance Ministry official has said: "On a number of 
occasions we have made large-scale public works investments, and 
the scale of tax cuts is a drastic 20 percent of the nation's 
total revenue. From the monetary aspect, the official discount 
rate is at the extremely low level of 1.75 percent per annum." 
He thus stressed Japan is doing all it can. In addition to 
this political strategy, Japan will oppose demands by other 
members of the G-7 on the basis of the existence of such 
negative economic factors as the sharp appreciation of the yen, 
and an unusually cool summer. 
  It has been reported that at the recent Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton said: "The currency 
exchange rate is one of the objective criteria." However, a 
senior Finance Ministry official has expressed the view that 
"Japan's domestic demand and its domestic prices, and U.S. 
efforts to increase exports and its competitiveness, were cited 
among numerous factors that have a bearing on U.S. exports to 
Japan. The currency exchange rate was simply cited as one of 
these factors." 
  Meanwhile, concerning the sharp yen appreciation, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii has said: "Since the yen rate has been 
moving due to speculative factors, we will take appropriate 
measures to deal with it." He thus hinted he intends to respond 
to sharp yen appreciation via market intervention.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference on 15 February, Akira 
Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation] commented on the current appreciation of the yen 
compared to the exchange rate before the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks, and the sharp drop in stock prices. He said, "We look at 
the situation as very serious. To find a way out from this 
crisis as soon as possible, the government should do whatever is 
in its power." Yamagishi also indicated he would ask the 
government to formulate Japan's own action program containing 
market liberalization measures, and measures to expand domestic 
demand to reduce the trade surplus in March as a measure to 
effect a new turn in Japan-U.S. economic negotiations. 
  Regarding the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, Yamagishi said, "I respect the fact that Japan said no to 
the United States (its demand for setting numerical targets), 
but we need measures to reconcile Japan and the United States as 
soon as possible. We certainly hope the government will 
continue to work on this."

  [Text] It has been revealed that the United States has 
indicated to Japan that it intends to partially withdraw its 
proposed plan to lower tariffs on electronic equipment as agreed 
last December at GATT's Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks on market access. The United States apparently plans to 
put pressure on Japan because Japan has rejected U.S. demands to 
abolish or reduce tariffs on forest products and other items. 
The Japanese Government has raised objections, charging that 
"the United States is breaking its promises." 
  The Uruguay Round of trade talks came to a successful 
conclusion on 15 December 1993 when GATT member nations agreed 
on abolishing or reducing tariffs. Since then, the United 
States has demanded that Japan further reduce or abolish tariffs 
on such items as forest products and nonferrous metal products. 
Japan, however, has rejected such demands, asserting that 
agreements have already been reached. During trade negotiations 
at the Uruguay Round talks, Japan had staunchly demanded that 
tariffs on electronic equipment be abolished. In this 
connection, the U.S. plan to withdraw its proposed tariff cuts 
could be considered a retaliatory move against Japan.

<F P=106> [Editorial] </F>
  [Text] According to a public opinion survey reported 
recently, just 1 percent of the American people can identify 
Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister of Japan. 
  But that is no reason to be discouraged. Prime ministers 
under the Liberal Democratic Party government did not fare much 
better either. If Japanese were asked to name the prime 
minister of Norway, the country where the winter Olympics is to 
be held, what percentage of them could give the correct answer? 
  U.S. understanding of Japan, particularly with respect to 
politics, is of about that degree. But that is where Prime 
Minister Hosokawa is going today, 10 February, to attend the 
third summit meeting. 
  The eastern United States are currently suffering from a 
cold 
wave. However, the atmosphere in Washington, where the prime 
minister will be received, is said to be colder still. The 
reason, almost needless to say, is because of deadlocked 
negotiations over the question of setting numerical targets on 
imports of U.S. automobiles and auto parts into Japan. 
  Japan insists it can never accept such targets, the United 
States counters with, "It would be better to have no agreement 
than to have one without numbers in it." Battles at the working 
level are continuing with no end in sight, like parallel lines 
that will never meet. 
  This is the fourth Japan-U.S. summit meeting in less than a 
year since the Clinton government came to power. It was in 
April last year that both sides agreed to hold new economic 
framework talks. Subsequently it was agreed in July that the 
forum of the comprehensive economic consultations should be 
instituted and that progress on consultations should be 
announced at the summit meeting to be held six months later. 
  It was an agreement made by the Miyazawa government. 
However, since then Prime Minister Hosokawa has met President 
Clinton twice, and has declared that his administration will try 
to fulfill the agreement. That being the given condition, the 
economy-oriented President has tried his best not to put the 
prime minister in a difficult position, and to back him up 
openly displaying his friendliness. There is no doubt that this 
time the President will ask the prime minister to return the 
favor. 
  As far as we can see, news media in the United States have 
conspicuously encouraged the President on the issue of setting 
numerical targets. THE NEW YORK TIMES said: "The President is 
about to take appropriate action." 
  U.S. public opinion is right now boiling on the question of 
bombing former Yugoslavia. If there is any topic of concern as 
far as Asia is concerned, it might be nuclear development in the 
DPRK (North Korea). That being the case, there are, among 
Japanese working-level officials, some who feel that a serious 
situation can be avoided somehow by putting off a decision on 
the matter. 
  That would not be a wise choice. Postponing matters is an 
old trick used by Japan in previous negotiations with the United 
States. As Washington sees it, the issue boils down to a trade 
deficit with Japan running to more than $50 billion a year. 
President Clinton thinks there is no more room for compromise 
and no choice but to force numbers on Japan. 
  Kunihiko Saito, vice minister of foreign affairs, said: 
"Expectations of the Hosokawa government having been so great, 
the impact of betrayal by it will be enormous." 
  He also warned: "If we bungle this, Japan-U.S. relations 
could become the worst they have been since the end of the war." 
  Confrontations between the bureaucrats of Japan and the 
United States now are such that there appears to be no way out. 
There is no other way but for the President and the prime 
minister to make a political decision. 
  The prime minister keeps talking about making "a decision at 
the last moment." That was what happened on the rice issue, the 
political reform bills, and reform of the taxation system. It 
looks certain now that he will have to make another "decision at 
the last moment." 
  This time, however, the issue is how far he can go over the 
heads of the bureaucrats. But this is what the Clinton 
administration and the U.S. news media are hoping will happen. 
  We are concerned lest his 1-percent recognition in the 
United 
States shoot up as a result of him becoming notorious.

  [Text] Business circles exhibited mixed reactions to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's standing firm on his rejection of 
U.S. demands at the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks. Certain 
business leaders who are concerned that the rapid appreciation 
of the yen on foreign exchange markets on 14 and 15 February may 
further harm corporate business results and economic conditions 
are beginning to express the criticism that "it is wrong to just 
say no to numerical targets and not come up with any measures to 
reduce the surplus." 
  Other economic leaders, such as Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of 
Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], express 
support, saying "The breakdown in the summit talks was 
inevitable as a result of our opposition to managed trade 
methods." The situation is such that future developments in the 
yen exchange rate and U.S. retaliation against Japan may 
adversely affect "support for Hosokawa." 
  Discussions at the meeting of Nikkeiren's [Japan Federation 
of Employers Associations] policy committee on 15 February 
concentrated on how to deal with the yen's appreciation. Some 
members lamented, "We have to prepare for 85 yen to the dollar" 
or "We cannot continue if the exchange rate goes beyond 110 yen 
to a dollar." 
  Tadao Suzuki, president of the Mercian Corporation, who 
attended the meeting, criticized the helpless government and 
prime minister: "It is said that Japan and the United States 
will have a `mature relationship.' Yet, to merely say no to 
numerical targets is acting like a spoiled child. We need to 
come up with certain concrete measures, such as accepting 
numerical targets for government procurement, or we must work on 
the various industrial sectors to indicate voluntary targets for 
market liberalization." 
  Hiroshi Hamada, president of the Ricoh Company, Ltd., also 
expressed his misgivings, saying: "It is easy for anybody to 
say no and to make the relationship bad. But making the 
relationship better is what diplomacy is all about, isn't it?" 
  Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., pointed out that 
"Japanese politicians for more than 10 years have paid too 
little attention to the task of reducing the current accounts 
surplus. An exchange rate level like this one will deal a fatal 
blow to Japan's manufacturing industries." 
  On the other hand, many business leaders voice their support 
for the prime minister. Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the NEC 
Corporation, said, "Rejecting the numerical targets, which were 
plagued with contradictions, at the Japanese-U.S. meeting was 
the right thing to do. The ongoing `unwarranted yen 
appreciation' will not help reduce Japan's surplus." 
  Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Inc., 
argued for the need for self-help efforts. He said: "It is 
true that we are suffering from the yen's appreciation. 
However, it is wrong for business operators to blame the prime 
minister or the government without doing what they need to do."

  [Text] Industrial circles have basically approved of the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks being virtually broken off, 
saying "this was unavoidable." As stated by a source concerned 
with a major automaker, the automobile industry appreciates the 
Japanese Government's attitude, saying: "Establishing numerical 
targets, which was our concern, has been avoided." However, 
according to the same source, while observing that "the U.S. 
stance of not understanding Japan's position has not changed," 
the industry is concerned the U.S. Government and Congress may 
stiffen their attitude. 
  What the automobile industry is afraid of is the government 
will ask it to work out a voluntary purchase plan for U.S.-made 
automobiles and auto parts in order to break the deadlock in 
negotiations, just as the government did when (then) President 
Bush visited Japan in 1992. Although the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] actually sounded out the 
auto industry concerning the purchase plan, every automaker 
expressed opposition, saying: "(Since business activities have 
now been aggravated,) the situation is different from in 1992." 
Eventually, MITI's goal was not achieved. 
  The electrical appliance industry also highly approves of 
the 
government stance on the telecommunications issue, a focal point 
within the government procurement sector under the framework 
talks. According to Tadashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu Ltd., 
the industry stated: "The government has consistently 
maintained that establishing numerical targets would lead to 
managed trade, and as a result, the failure to reach an 
agreement was unavoidable." Life insurance and nonlife 
insurance circles issued statements approving of the breakdown 
in the framework talks. According to Takashi Onoda, chairman of 
the Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Association of Japan, 
Incorporated, 
they said "the failure to reach an agreement was inevitable." 
In negotiations in the insurance sector, the United States 
demanded that the share of business of foreign-affiliated 
companies on the Japanese market be increased to a two-digit 
percent to reach the same level as other members of the G-7 
(Group of Seven). Meanwhile, according to a top executive of a 
major nonlife insurance company, Japan opposed the U.S. demand, 
maintaining "the attitude of shutting their eyes to the lack of 
their own efforts has proved to be managed trade." Therefore, 
as stated by a top executive of a major life insurance company, 
the industry is relieved, saying that "failure is better than an 
agreement which includes numerical targets."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's indication of a 
desire to reshuffle the cabinet at an early period on 14 
February has also created a stir in the administration. On the 
morning of 14 February, the prime minister told reporters "I 
will think about (the cabinet reshuffle) after the formulation 
of the fiscal 1994 budget comes to an end." He then went into 
his office without confirming or denying the reports on the 
reshuffle, and has since continued behind-the-scenes 
coordination with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
and other parties. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, contrary to what the prime minister said, expressed a 
negative view on an early reshuffle at a news conference. The 
issue of the reshuffle inadvertently revealed the differences 
between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary. 
While the reshuffle, originally planned by the prime minister 
for 15 February, has been postponed due to the SDPJ's 
opposition, sources close to the prime minister claim that "this 
will create serious ill feeling in the cabinet." 
  At a news conference on the evening of 14 February, Takemura 
said "there is no indication at all" that a cabinet reshuffle 
"is forthcoming," denying the reports. However, he also stated, 
"(Whether or not to reshuffle the cabinet) is the prime 
minster's problem. Please ask him directly." 
  Such a comment at the chief cabinet secretary's news 
conference was very unusual. It seems that Takemura's attitude 
was due to the fact that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito's attempt to "remove Takemura" was allegedly behind the 
talk of reshuffle, and he was irritated with the fact that the 
prime minister had not conveyed his thinking directly. 
  Meanwhile, the prime minister stayed in his office all day 
on 
14 February, although he attended a meeting of leaders of the 
government and the ruling parties at noon. Queries from 
reporters were met with the same reply over and over again: "I 
am not thinking about it before the budget is finished." 
However, he nodded to the question "are you thinking about a 
reshuffle at all?" He even stressed that he was "giving 
consideration" to a reshuffle on 15 February, all along taking 
an ambiguous attitude in public. The prevailing view among 
sources close to the prime minister is that "the prime minister 
himself strongly desires to reshuffle the cabinet at an early 
period; he has floated a `trial balloon' to see the reaction of 
members of the administration and the ruling parties."

<F P=106> [Discussion between Tokiwa University Professor Tomoaki Iwai </F>
and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, moderated by 
Meiji Gakuin University Professor Minoru Nakano, on 17 January 
1994; place not given] 
  [Text] [Nakano] Let us start with the trend toward 
political re-realignment. 
  [Iwai] Without the combination of the movements toward 
splitting and unity, realignment will not occur. For the time 
being, the trend toward splitting will not stop. I think a 
"survival game" will continue for awhile. 
  [Nakano] I agree that the tendency to split is strong, and 
integration will occur after the next general election. But I 
also feel that if discussion on the division of election 
districts occurs and the cabinet is reshuffled, then some 
integration could take place. 
  [Kobayashi] My reading is different from Mr. Iwai's. I 
think things will head in the direction of integration. Under 
the single-seat election district system, one cannot win unless 
he comes in first. Therefore, victory will be determined by 
what the catchup [who against whom] is. There will be people, 
in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and in the coalition 
government parties, who will lose their seats [be unable to 
secure a candidacy] in the single seat electoral districts. [In 
that sense] we can say that realignment has already begun in a 
different direction, away from the previous framework. Take the 
"Democrats," for instance. The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
and the Japan New Party will be heading in the direction of 
merger. It is also a fact that the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party 
and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] have been meeting. 
  [Nakano] There are also some external factors: the 
corruption scandals involving the major construction companies 
have produced a ripple effect on the central political world. 
  [Kobayashi] That effect is significant. If the LDP receives 
a great blow [from the scandals], the coalition government 
parties may split into two groups. If the blow is not too 
great, however, the coalition government parties will be obliged 
to stick together. Under the single-seat electoral district 
system, by next year at the earliest, in the fall of 1996 at the 
latest, realignment will take place. This realignment will take 
place before the general election rather than after. With 
single-seat electoral districts, the result will be clear before 
the election. With the single-seat districts, since everyone 
wants to be on the winning side, they will go over to the more 
advantageous side, regardless of its virtues. 
  [Iwai] Realignment will certainly be triggered by the 
single-seat electoral district system, but I do not think the 
parties will suddenly become integrated. In the provinces, 
head-on fights of one against one may not be avoided, but in the 
urban areas, each party will have an equal chance to fight. So 
even under the single-seat electoral system, three to five 
parties will emerge. 
  [Kobayashi] Splits will occur only on the premise that 
integration will follow. It means that they will not just 
temporarily disintegrate. I also do not think that there will 
be a nationwide, unified integration right from the beginning. 
  [Nakano] We three have three different ideas, but they are 
not all that far apart. I think, as Mr. Kobayashi said, that 
splits and integration will occur in tandem. But still, it will 
take some time before a permanent new "system" will be 
established. It will not be clear after only one general 
election. It is questionable if a system for political funding 
and support will come into place in a year or so. Also, it is 
unclear who the "top leader" will be. 
  [Kobayashi] As you say, a "structure" such as the 1955 one 
will not be created in 1994. That will have to wait until after 
the upper house election of July next year and the following 
general election. It will become clear in a decade or so 
whether that happened in 1996 or 1997. 
  [Iwai] The key will be whether they can tie a support 
association-backed election race to the local political party 
branch. They are still groping for [a way to secure] political 
funds. But it is not certain whether political party 
[financial] assistance can be an important factor for 
integration. Still, overlapping candidacy is permitted, so 90 
percent of those elected will come from single-seat electoral 
districts. Therefore, basically, representatives from 
single-seat electoral districts, as a system, will act as a 
unifying force. The bulk of the struggle will be over the 
single-seat constituencies. 
  [Kobayashi] The support associations will [make the 
transition] smoothly. Political party subsidies will be 
received, not by the party headquarters, but by the branch units 
in each city, town, and village. Moreover, there will be 
multiple regional branches, such as the youth and women's 
divisions. Therefore, there will be as many as 120,000 
recipient organizations. Hence, in contrast, the 
representative's existing support organizations will continue to 
exist. I think that a "division of labor" is quite possible. 
What the problem is, rather, is whether this will lead to 
regulations which will govern political funding or political 
reform. 
<H5>  Combinations for Political World Realignment </H5>
  [Nakano] What do you think about combinations [of parties] 
for realignment of the political world? 
  [Iwai] The simulations in every newspaper are based on 
ideology. But the situation is more complex, including among 
other things the existence of study groups. There are cases, 
when adjustment of candidates is carried out skillfully, where 
the situation is more advantageous without integration. The 
Shinseito-Komeito relationship is a good example. Elections are 
fought not by two major parties but by multiple parties. Yet, 
when it comes to forming a government, the composition of LDP 
against non-LDP will not change as long as the LDP is the 
largest force. However, when it comes to policy decisions, 
things can move beyond the framework of the parties. The 
combining [of parties] is not simple. It has become clear that 
the restraint [on members] by party decisions is an illusion. 
This kind of trend will not be reversed. In [forming] a 
government, some [party] combining will emerge, but combining 
policies will be another matter. 
  [Kobayashi] As for the Heiritsu system [a combination of 
single-seat districts and proportional representation], it is 
possible for some parties to allocate candidates for both 
single-seat districts and the proportional representation list. 
But for other parties, it is not possible. A representative of 
one of the coalition government parties said that "the 
proportional district will be sufficient. Do not make me battle 
the LDP in a single-seat election district." Unlike Mr. Iwai, I 
do think that Shinseito and Komeito would have difficulty 
pursuing their own courses. When Komeito runs a candidate in a 
single-seat district, I am not sure if the Shinseito supporters 
will vote for him without hesitation. It is easier to make an 
allocation whereby Shinseito competes in the single-seat 
election districts, and Komeito competes in the proportional 
contest. Combinations will be determined by what the voters 
want. Regrettably, political ideology will not likely be a key 
factor. 
  [Iwai] The Japanese people feel that realignment of the 
political world is mainly a subject of concern for Nagata-cho. 
The newspapers wrote that "there will be a second act in the 
new year," but nothing has fundamentally changed. It is more 
like "act one, scene two." 
  [Kobayashi] On the contrary, restraint by party decision 
will become more strict. That is the difference between the 
Heiritsu system and the medium-sized election district system. 
Victory in an election is only possible through cooperation 
between parties. Independent activities cannot be permitted. 
The [electorate] votes for a party in the proportional 
competition. So here, subsidies to the parties will work as 
shackles [on individual members]. 
  [Iwai] As for funding, it cannot help but become tighter. 
Because of the emergence of the multiple parties, it has become 
a seller's market for candidates. For the next year or two we 
do not know what will happen. 
  [Nakano] To begin with, the incentive for combining forces 
is the election, and there are two "levels," namely, the 
individual and party levels. The question is what is going to 
happen so far as forming the government is concerned. First, 
everyone wants to get reelected and, if possible, wants to gain 
government power for the party he belongs to. That is the 
representatives' true intention. What is deficient is that 
policy is put forth only as a means or as a matter of 
expediency, though sooner or later policy will become an issue. 
That is where the voters are betrayed. 
<H5>  Lack of Ideology/Ideas </H5>
  [Nakano] Ideology and ideas are lacking in today's political 
world. The important subjects today are countercyclical 
measures and political reform. How should they be dealt with? 
  [Kobayashi] A political party should make its opinions clear 
and should be bound by them. But in reality, this has not been 
the practice. There is a saying that "for political parties and 
politicians, election victory is an end in itself, and policy is 
formulated to facilitate election victory." If one says 
anything too radical, he cannot receive votes. So everyone's 
policy becomes similar. Just as there is hardly any difference 
between the Democratic and Republican Parties in the United 
States, everyone becomes similarly moderate in each election 
district. [The similarity of viewpoints is shown by the 
following examples:] The rice issue has already been settled and 
is at the stage to hand over subsidy money to the farmers. And 
the UN issue is one everyone feels important. No one has an 
answer for the countercyclical measure. I wonder if a more 
clear-cut confrontation will occur not among the political 
parties but, rather, between regions. 
  [Nakano] The Thatcher government in Great Britain tried 
drastically to change the Labor Party's policy. But looking at 
the budget, it was not all that different where welfare was 
concerned. It was clear that policy was contracting in a 
converging manner. Confrontation between political parties, 
except with the Japan Communist Party [JCP], will not come up. 
  [Kobayashi] Opinion surveys, with relevance to political 
realignment, have dealt with: first, the economic issue, whether 
to emphasize national interests and eliminate monopolies or to 
pursue deregulation and a free economy; second, the welfare 
issue, whether to support the great burden of a high level of 
welfare or a low level of welfare; and third, the constitutional 
issue which includes the UN and Self-Defense Forces questions. 
As for the first two issues, there are no clear differences of 
view. In the single-seat electoral district in the United 
states, the Democrats and Republicans say the same thing, so 
elections are perfunctory. In Japan also, it is questionable 
how much choice the voters have. Will democracy function [under 
such circumstances]? 
  [Nakano] In three aspects -- between generations, between 
regions, and against external pressures -- confrontations will 
necessarily emerge. But none will arise from within the 
political parties. 
  [Iwai] Japanese society prefers inclusive political 
parties. In addition, everyone wants to appear agreeable in the 
single-seat district system. So party positions will become 
very similar. How much unity can they have when the trend is 
that each Diet member will act on his own in making policy 
decisions. When I analyze the United States, where there is 
absolutely no party discipline, I find that there is party unity 
for Congressional activities when it comes to issues on the tax 
system, government versus private business, countercyclical 
measures, and welfare. There is the issue of the 
Constitution/Security Treaty that places special conditions on 
Japan. The current realignment contains an excessively strong 
personal element. Just as Shigeru Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama 
united in the 1955 structure, logic which transcends [personal 
differences] is needed. When elections, political power, and 
actual parliamentary activities are not coherent, the voters 
will be confused. It is a question as to what kind of verdict 
the voters will hand out on the convenience of the politicians. 
Ideals are important, but the question is how will they judge 
achievements. 
  [Kobayashi] I am more pessimistic about Japan than about the 
United States. There are hardly any national or local 
referendums in Japan. In the United States, the regional and 
class gap in society is coming to the surface. But in the 
Japanese framework, very little regulatory power for dealing 
with regional differences and economic classes is found in the 
LDP or in the coalition government parties. Each party has its 
own party constraints, but I think they are heading in the 
direction of not absorbing the differences in the ideals held by 
the voters, more so than in the United States. Moreover, from 
the beginning, they have abandoned the framework of direct 
democracy which could compensate for this deficiency. 
  [Nakano] If party politics cannot deal with such a 
discrepancy, what can? 
  [Kobayashi] It is difficult under the single-seat district 
system, because they cannot win an election unless the oppressed 
class reaches the 51 percent line. It means that minority 
opinion will be excluded more than ever. 
  [Nakano] What about the bureaucratic system? 
  [Kobayashi] The bureaucratic system will be strengthened. I 
do not know whether two or three major parties will emerge. But 
in the situation of a power struggle, the bureaucratic presence 
will grow. When MITI opposes, political power will be stalled. 
Bureaucratic power will keep growing, and the bureaucrats and 
vocal people, rather than the voters, will have their way. 
  [Nakano] I agree. Under a bureaucratic system, the minority 
will have an easier time riding the tyranny of the special 
interests. Under the current political reform, the ideals of 
party politics will go further away. 
  [Iwai] The bureaucratic system has been fiercely seeking 
legitimacy under the imperial system, the GHQ [General 
Headquarters of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan after World 
War II], and the LDP. Now Mr. Ichiro Ozawa intervenes in 
bureaucratic personnel matters, and tries to increase the number 
of parliamentary vice ministers. The bureaucrats' keiretsu 
phenomenon will probably occur too, and conflict between the 
bureaucracy and politicians will arise. The bureaucrats will 
emerge representing the interests of the silent majority, whom 
the political party can not rescue. The composition of 
bureaucratic control will become more and more ingenious with 
the support of the public opinion. 
<H5>  The Future of Japanese-Style Democracy </H5>
  [Nakano] What do we think about the future of Japanese-style 
democracy? As for the party political system, last year, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa predicted that "it would be a moderate 
multiple-party system." Will it be a two-major-party system or 
a multiple-party system? Will it be like the American system 
where slogans are just words and the important factor is the 
individual politician himself, or will it be like the British 
system where the party plays the greatest role? Or will it be 
satisfactory to continue with the current bureaucracy-dependent 
style? Absolutely no discussion has been made on these points. 
What worries me the most is that every party talks about, yet, 
in actuality, has nothing to do with, an international 
perspective. 
  [Kobayashi] As for the ideal form, it should be one placing 
priority on the people, rather than on party, politics, or 
bureaucracy. Whether it be two major parties or three, the 
choices of parties would be only three or four that have a 
policy on every issue. As for the "moderate multiple-party 
system," what constitutes a multiparty system? In reality, it 
will be two plus the JCP or three plus the JCP. Whichever it 
is, it will inevitably be a party-oriented rather than 
politician-oriented system. Unlike in the United States, we do 
not have primary elections. So the party, rather then the 
electorate will determine the candidates. If one opposes the 
party leadership, one cannot become a candidate. 
  [Nakano] What about the central and regional relationship? 
  [Kobayashi] There would not be much change in the central 
versus regional relationship. The regional governments have no 
autonomous authority to levy taxes. Only Tokyo, Osaka, 
Kanagawa, and Aichi could have fiscal independence. 
  [Iwai] The Ministry of Finance will not let go of their 
authority to levy taxes. And the regional governments will not 
want to involve themselves because they have neither the human 
resources nor the know-how. 
  [Nakano] It would be different if the system were 
changed from the current one of local municipalities to a 
broader area block system such as the Do-Shu system [similar to 
a state system]. 
  [Kobayashi] Even if Shikoku is made into a block, for 
instance, it will have a much smaller tax base when compared to 
the capital region. 
  [Iwai] I think it would be easier to obtain a national 
consensus on securing equality rather than admitting inequity 
among regions. What kind of equality do we want to secure? 
Would it be better to switch to the American/European type 
right away? We must grope for a form of regional autonomy 
different from the current one and must secure vitality and 
equality. 
  [Kobayashi] I agree. We can tolerate private enterprises 
going bankrupt, but not the local regions, because the whole 
premise is that if that happens equal competition can not be 
possible. 
  [Iwai] When we disperse authority, the concentration of 
power in one place occurs in reverse. As for the fields of 
transportation and communications alone, the cost is higher in 
the local areas. We should have bold ideas, such as adopting a 
flat fee throughout Japan. 
  [Nakano] Still, the centralization of power is too strong. 
I think we could have a little more diversification of power. 
  [Iwai] It is not clear how we can define Japanese-style 
democracy. The slogan came first, but no definition has been 
made. 
<H5>  Will People's Political Consciousness Change? </H5>
  [Nakano] Will the Japanese people's political consciousness 
change through electoral system reform? 
  [Kobayashi] I think affirmatively about the point that the 
people can choose the governing authority under the Heiritsu 
system. The opposition parties have no choice but to unite. The 
kind of irresponsible policies we have experienced in the past 
will not be established, in the sense that people can choose a 
governing authority which submits achievable policies. In this 
sense, the people's consciousness will change. What I want to 
ask, rather, is if the politician's consciousness will change by 
this reform. 
  [Iwai] In last year's general election, the voting rate was 
really low. We can also say that it has become a theatrical 
style. If the people who participate in exercising their choice 
become a minority, the voice of the silent majority will be 
heard even less. If there is no party the people can choose, the 
distance between the Japanese people and society will develop 
further. Every party will try to please everybody and will 
become the interest-induction type. 
  [Kobayashi] Responsibility lies on the side of the parties. 
Even if there are voters who do not want to choose a party and 
the rate of voter abstention goes up, there is no damaging 
effect for the parties or for the politicians. Unless we set a 
minimum number of votes one must obtain to get elected, no 
politician will suffer. 
  [Nakano] When I look at the years when a change of 
government took place, namely 1976, 1979, 1983, 1986, and 1993, 
the inconsistencies contained in Japanese style democracy gushed 
to the surface, triggered by the tax hike and the large scale 
political corruption. What would be the points that will surely 
emerge under the new system? 
  [Iwai] The fact that we can choose the governing power is a 
great factor, so the politicians will have to be serious and 
tense. If it is to be party-dominated politics, I think it would 
be better that the interest distribution should be left to the 
greater discretion [for the party]. For instance, give them 
power over personnel in the bureaucracy. 
  [Kobayashi] Under the position-seeking system in the United 
States, those who gave in the election campaign openly join the 
administration. 
  [Nakano] What do you think about having the Ministry of 
Finance's budget making authority handed over to the parties? 
  [Kobayashi] It would be different if we are to adopt the 
presidential system, but then, what would we do with the 
imperial system? Coexistence would be difficult. Japanese 
politics would improve if we placed greater expectations on the 
electorate rather than on the political parties, through the 
introduction of national referendums and so on. 
  [Iwai] Anyway, such a supplemental system is necessary. 
  [Nakano] Only the problem is that those who decide that are 
also the politicians.

the Economy 
  [Tahara] It has been four months since you resigned your 
post 
as prime minister, has not it? 
  [Miyazawa] Yes, it has been. 
  [Tahara] You had been in a position to view the nation from 
a 
broader point of view. First of all, I want to ask your opinion 
about the economy. If the present situation continues as it is, 
Japan's business conditions will become worse than the serious 
Heisei depression [as published], and some people are even 
afraid that the Japanese economy might collapse. People used to 
say that "Miyazawa is the economic expert." What is your 
opinion about the current economic situation? 
  [Miyazawa] I understand the situation is so serious as to 
require government intervention. In the spring of 1993, when I 
was prime minister, I was expecting that a sign of the business 
recovery might be seen around the beginning of fall, when the 
inventory adjustment would be completed. To my regret, however, 
the situation did not change for the better as I had expected. 
  Besides, although I myself was involved, there was 
unexpected 
political confusion. Although I thought that the confusion 
would not have so much influence on the economy, it turned out 
that the new government that was born to deal with the confusion 
was a cabinet which places importance on political reform. The 
new cabinet was not necessarily good with economic matters. 
That is why the problem of the economy tends to be neglected. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean that the Hosokawa government is not 
concerned about the economic problems? 
  [Miyazawa] As far as results are concerned, we should say 
that the economic problems are being neglected. Because so many 
different parties are allied together, it is natural that the 
economy cannot be managed effectively. Besides, although we 
experienced the cold summer and the strong-yen situation last 
year, the government could not, after all, deal with the 
situation effectively. In my opinion, this fact has created 
distrust, which further created the violent fluctuations in the 
stock market. I still believe in the persevering strength of 
the Japanese economy. Honestly speaking, however, as far as the 
present situation is concerned, it is not possible for me to 
foresee when the situation will take a turn for the better. 
  [Tahara] I think I myself should be held responsible in that 
the new government has given primary attention to political 
reform. What measures do you think should have been taken? 
  [Miyazawa] Originally, it should have been possible to carry 
out political reform and to grapple with the economic problems 
at the same time. If there were indications that cold-weather 
damage is likely to occur, the government should have taken 
prompt action to meet the situation by preparing for the 
disbursement of mutual aid funds and by making available 
low-interest loans, etc. As to the strong-yen situation, 
although there will be no quick remedy, the government at least 
should have demonstrated its positive attitude in dealing with 
the situation. 
  [Tahara] Speaking concretely, what do you think should be 
done? 
  [Miyazawa] One of the measures that the government should 
take now is drastic reduction of the income tax. The government 
should by all means reduce the income tax, whether by 6 trillion 
yen or 10 trillion yen. However, it is wrong to try to cover 
the reduction with a consumption tax. 
  The change in tax revenues depends on the state of the 
economy. After the Plaza Accord was reached in September 1985, 
because of the sharp rise of the yen, Japan's economy 
encountered never-before-experienced difficulties. This 
situation occurred soon after I became finance minister, and I 
thought the only way [to escape the difficulties] was to first 
effect a tax cut, and then to cover the decrease in revenue by 
issuing deficit-covering bonds. It took me two months to 
persuade the executive officials of the Ministry of Finance, and 
it also took another two months for the executive officials to 
obtain the preliminary informal consent from within and outside 
of the Ministry of Finance. Opposition against my idea was so 
strong that we had to spend great amounts of time in persuading 
persons. Consequently, there was a natural increase in tax 
revenue -- 51 trillion yen -- in the six-year period from the 
second year of the Plaza Accord to 1991, which means that 
economy had been normalized to that extent. In other words, if 
the economy starts to run well with a tax cut, this enables 
corporations to go into the black and to pay corporate taxes. 
Income taxes withheld at the source also will increase because 
of the increase in hours worked and the resulting increase in 
overtime pay. If the stock market becomes active, then 
securities transaction taxes will increase. This is the natural 
course. It is too hasty an idea to think that the consumption 
tax should be increased by this many trillion yen because the 
income tax was reduced by this many trillion yen. While this 
should be an easy type of logic for an expert to understand, it 
may be difficult for a person in a responsible post to make a 
practical decision about. 
<H5>  What Should Be Done With the Bad Bank Loans? </H5>
  [Tahara] As you noted before, Hajime Funada, then director 
general of the Economic Planning Agency, expressed his personal 
belief in the spring of last year that "from now on [business 
conditions] will show an upturn". Does this mean that you also 
thought the same thing? 
  [Miyazawa] Yes. To my regret, however, there was no 
business recovery, although we had taken urgent economic 
measures in the amounts of 10 billion yen and 13 billion yen. 
  [Tahara] I understand that the urgent measures were taken in 
the form of public investment. As to the depression that we are 
presently experiencing, not only the government but also many 
economists and executives have expressed incorrect predictions 
again and again. Why do you think they have been wrong? 
  [Miyazawa] I think the major reason is that they did not 
fully recognize the influence that the bubble economy had on 
business enterprises, and particularly its influence on 
financial institutions. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean that they underestimated the 
consequences of the bubble economy? 
  [Miyazawa] Yes. 
  [Tahara] If that is the case, I should ask you what on earth 
the bubble economy was. You were the finance minister when the 
bubble economy began. 
  [Miyazawa] That was at the initial stage of the bubble 
economy. 
  [Tahara] There are some indiscreet people who say that 
Miyazawa is to blame for creating the bubble economy. What on 
earth was the cause of the bubble economy? 
  [Miyazawa] When the Plaza Accord was concluded in September 
1985, one dollar was equivalent to 240 yen. The exchange rate 
rose to 200 yen at the end of the same year, and further rose to 
150 yen in the summer of the next year when I assumed the post 
of finance minister. It was really a sharp rise. 
  [Tahara] The exchange rate rose by 90 yen in less than one 
year. 
  [Miyazawa] People thought this rate was by all means 
unbearable to Japanese companies, so I effected urgent economic 
measures, including the tax cut. I also had the official 
discount rate reduced. Also, to moderate the strong-yen 
tendency to the extent possible, I even bought dollars on the 
open market at the rate of $1 billion per day. To buy dollars 
means to sell yen, which means that so much amount of yen is 
supplied to the public. In other words, with the supply of yen 
becoming excessive, enterprises gradually became accustomed to 
the strong-yen trend, and the surplus purchasing power created 
under this situation was used to purchase stocks and land. Such 
behavior seems to have brought about the unfavorable results. 
  I still wonder whether there was no better way to absorb the 
surplus purchasing power. I suppose the Bank of Japan was also 
trying to decide when to raise the official discount rate. 
First of all, however, the anxiety that the strong-yen trend 
caused to enterprises and the people was too serious. At that 
time, the business world was in an extremely confused state, 
with there being 10 job seekers for every two job openings. 
Because the most important duty of politics is not to cause the 
people anxiety, I believe that I should have applied a brake to 
the situation. But, I still cannot clearly see what the best 
point would have been [to apply a brake]. 
  [Tahara] There is an opinion that [the authorities 
concerned] 
may have become excessively eager to control the bubble economy 
and, as a result, may have destroyed the economy itself, thus 
creating the present depression. In short, people are thinking 
that [the authorities concerned] have frozen the flow of money 
by making land transactions virtually impossible or by 
unreasonably raising the official rate. 
  [Miyazawa] In the present situation wherein the Japanese 
economy has become large and the people now realize how the 
economy works, it seems difficult for the government and the 
Bank of Japan alone to change the direction of the economy. In 
such a situation, the authorities concerned are supposed to be 
taking drastic measures to direct the economy. Although it may 
be desirable if moderate measures can be found, it does not seem 
so easy for this to be done. 
  [Tahara] Supposing you again became finance minister or 
prime 
minister at the time when the bubble economy collapsed, do not 
you think you could find a better way to manage the economy? 
  [Miyazawa] I was asked the same question at the Diet, too, 
and I asked myself that question again and again. To my regret, 
however, I cannot think of any better policy which I might have 
adopted in a certain situation. This might be a limit of my 
ability. 
  [Tahara] At the beginning of this interview, you mentioned 
that "risk management" would be necessary. At that point, there 
was an idea of establishing a public organization to purchase 
the unsalable lands held by banks as mortgaged properties. What 
has become of that idea? 
  [Miyazawa] It was in August 1992 [that the idea was proposed 
by the government]. At that time, with the slump in stocks, I 
believed that if the situation worsened, the government should 
then carry out risk management; I felt that something should be 
done to avert the crisis, even if this meant the stock market's 
being closed for one day. I consulted with some of the 
officials concerned about my idea, including the idea you just 
referred to.... I expressed my opinion that the government may 
be officially involved in dealing with the bad loans held by 
banks, that the banks may be allowed to write off part of their 
bad loans as tax deductions, and that a special loan may be made 
to the purchasing organization. I thought that the government's 
intervention to that extent might be necessary to protect the 
financial system itself. 
  [Tahara] Did you carry out your plan? 
  [Miyazawa] No, my idea was not realized as I intended. There 
was strong opposition which claimed that the plan was intended 
to save the banks. 
  [Tahara] Was there opposition? 
  [Miyazawa] The industrial circles asked, "Why should the 
government help the banks to such an extent?" Also, as for 
financial institutions, there were certain banks with less 
exposure and certain banks with serious exposure. The banks 
with less exposure felt that "While we can solve the problem 
ourselves, it is regrettable to receive so much criticism from 
the public", or "The government's policy is to save that and 
that bank, and not to save us. It is ridiculous." It turned 
out after all that the financial institutions improved the 
situation by themselves. 
  [Tahara] I see. 
  [Miyazawa] This problem has not been solved yet. The problem 
of bad loans held by financial institutions remains a big 
problem at the base of the current depression. I still think 
that public aid to a certain degree may be necessary to 
normalize the present situation, which is excessively 
constrained. There are examples of this in the advanced 
countries. 
  [Tahara] There is an opinion that the current depression 
might be pressing Japan to change its economic structure. 
Drastic deregulation is considered necessary to establish an 
economic structure guaranteeing free competition. Although I am 
afraid I may be preaching Buddhism to Buddha, most of the 
industries in which 50 million workers out of the 60 million 
workers in Japan are employed are not related to exports and are 
more or less affected by regulation. People think that while 
the yen remains strong, domestic commodity prices remain 
excessively high because regulations on these enterprises have 
not been removed. 
  Also, it is considered necessary to convert the so-called 
Japanese-type management to the U.S.-type management. There is 
a strong opinion that under Japanese-type management, business 
enterprises are holding onto too many unprofitable divisions and 
unnecessary workers, which should be totally slashed. Voices 
are increasing that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] may also 
be held partly responsible in this respect. What is your 
opinion on this point? 
  [Miyazawa] It is really a problem of the Japanese 
distribution system that consumers do not benefit from the 
strong-yen trend. It is also true that the natural operation of 
an economy based on the supply-and-demand relationship is being 
disturbed by the delay in removing the regulations. I think the 
present cabinet was correct in grappling with the problem by 
setting up the Hiraiwa Commission, although I do not think that 
this has produced an immediate effect. 
  It is also true that the economic situation in the United 
States has been improved by what we in Japan call restructuring 
or by what they call downsizing in the United States -- that is, 
by carrying out a drastic cutback in employees. In his recent 
book titled "The Postcapitalist Society," Peter F. Drucker 
expresses the opinion that the future society will be a 
thoroughly knowledge-oriented society and that those elements 
other than knowledge should be excluded from enterprises. He 
means that the excluded corporate units should be used in 
medium-sized and small enterprises which specialize in such 
fields. In fact, downsizing is rapidly being carried out in the 
United States in line with his philosophy. 
  [Tahara] Japanese capitalism has been a capitalism based on 
the production of goods. There are prevailing opinions that 
such a type of capitalism is outdated and therefore should be 
changed to a structure aiming at knowledge-intensive industries. 
Furthermore, there is an opinion that Japanese-type management, 
meaning the lifetime-employment system, is merely an illusion 
and that the original capitalism means slashing unnecessary 
workers, just as we slash unnecessary things. 
  [Miyazawa] We should note, however, that Drucker himself is 
of the opinion that what is meant by "a drastic intellectual 
society" is still unknown. I think it means "human beings." 
  [Tahara] You think intelligence is symbolized by human 
beings. 
  [Miyazawa] In the case of our country, the 
lifetime-employment system makes it possible to give advanced 
training to employees. It is not worthwhile to spend money on 
them if they move to other enterprises. 
  [Tahara] Then your opinion is that although the terms 
"lifetime employment" and "seniority" may sound old-fashioned 
today, what they really mean is that "human being should be 
respected," is that not it? 
  [Miyazawa] That is right. 
  [Tahara] Under U.S.-type management, although capable 
persons 
are promoted to responsible posts, incapable persons are not 
promoted and tend to fall behind. Do you think that is a wrong 
system? 
  [Miyazawa] No, I do not think so. Each country has its own 
tradition. Perhaps it would be impossible for Americans to live 
in Japanese society, where the rule of seniority and the 
lifetime-employment system apply. In the United States, a 
success story is created by a capable person making a sudden 
rise from obscurity and earning a high salary while moving 
freely from company to company. 
  However, the same principle does not apply in our country. 
For Japanese enterprises, teamwork has been supposed to be the 
best way to operate in the business world, and, in the case of 
Japan, I suppose it will also be the best way in the future. 
<H3>  Participation in the United Nations Force Is Also Not 
Permissible </H3>
  [Tahara] Let me change the subject. If there were things 
you left undone as prime minister, what would they be? 
  [Miyazawa] Though I am afraid my reply may sound haughty, I 
am very confident that, except for political reform, I was, in 
general, able to show ideal guidelines in carrying out domestic 
and foreign affairs. First, it was my philosophy that Japan 
should not become a military superpower. Also, I made it a 
fundamental policy in carrying out internal affairs that an 
affluent community and a quality-of-life superpower should be 
created before the aging society emerges. My fundamental policy 
in carrying out diplomatic relations was to make contributions 
to the extent possible in order to build up a new order of peace 
after the Cold War. 
  [Tahara] Let me ask a question on this point. What type of 
country are you thinking of when you talk about a military 
superpower? 
  [Miyazawa] ... [ellipses as published] 
  [Tahara] For instance, in his book titled "A Plan To Rebuild 
Japan [Nihon Kaizo Ron]" Ichiro Ozawa says that "Japan should 
become an ordinary country." Perhaps, by the expression `an 
ordinary country' Ozawa must be referring to the United Kingdom 
and France, and not the United States. In case the order of 
world peace is disturbed somewhere, Japan should contribute to 
restoring order. It seems to be his idea that, if the existing 
Self-Defense Forces are not to be mobilized, it may be necessary 
to organize a United Nations Force and to have the Self-Defense 
Forces join it. Do you think this is a military superpower? 
  [Miyazawa] In my opinion, the only thing Japan should not do 
is to use military power outside the country. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean Japan should not participate in the 
United Nations Force? 
  [Miyazawa] My fundamental philosophy is that, under any 
circumstances, and even if requested by the United Nations, 
Japan should not exercise its military power abroad. 
  [Tahara] If, for instance, an incident similar to the 
Persian Gulf crisis takes place, the world might again request 
that "Japan contribute not only with money, but also shed 
blood." Do you still think Japan should not participate in the 
United Nations Force in such a situation? 
  [Miyazawa] No, that is not permissible. I also discussed 
the matter with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in February 
last year, and he expressed his opinion that "the role of the 
United Nations is not only to maintain peace which, as was the 
case in Cambodia, has already been secured, but it should also 
create peace through intervention in the area where disputes are 
taking place." To his opinion, I replied that "in the past, 
Japan committed errors under the flag of absolute justice. It 
will require considerable time before we are convinced that all 
the judgments made by the United Nations are correct." 
  Later, the Somalian incident took place. Though the action 
of the United Nations might have been based on good intentions, 
it turned out that, after all, the United Nations became the 
enemy of all the Somalian people. The U.S. forces also have to 
withdraw in March. An even more severe situation is being 
created in Yugoslavia. I feel, therefore, that the people are 
beginning to realize that they should not easily agree with the 
opinion that Japan may also take part in such an activity so 
long as it is carried out under the UN flag. 
  [Tahara] Yet, is it not possible that, as was the case in 
the Persian Gulf war, Japan may be despised by the world, or 
treated as an outsider, for not taking part in the UN activities? 
  [Miyazawa] It is true the Japanese people are beginning to 
regret that Japan only contributed money without shedding blood. 
It was under such a situation that the PKO [Peacekeeping 
Operations] Law was enacted to show the limit of Japan's 
contribution. Though I sincerely feel sorry that two Japanese 
people died in Cambodia, I take pride in myself that, by playing 
Japan's role to its limit, I clearly showed that Japan could not 
go beyond this limit. 
  We have our own way of thinking, and we have our own 
philosophy contained in the Constitution. I do not want to let 
the United Nations make decisions for us. 
  [Tahara] The call for Japan to carry out concrete 
operations to help maintain international order, even if it 
means revising the Constitution, is growing louder. However, 
you are opposed to this, and perhaps Gotoda is also of the same 
opinion. Why are you so strongly opposed to the idea? 
  [Miyazawa] In the past, we exercised military power abroad 
in the name of humanity. The people also believed it. Today, 
however, the reason for our action seems doubtful. There is 
even a prime minister who says we should apologize for our 
action as it was an act of invasion. In such a situation it is 
not easy to determine whether or not our action can be 
justified. The United Nations made the same mistake in Somalia, 
did it not? Secretary General Butrus-Ghali himself has 
virtually admitted "it was a mistake." 
  [Tahara] In short, were you against the Persian Gulf war? 
  [Miyazawa] No, I think the war was justifiable in itself. 
  [Tahara] If you admit that the war was justifiable in 
itself, does it not mean that it was alright for other countries 
to take part in the war, but that Japan did not want to be 
involved in it? 
  [Miyazawa] In the case of the Persian Gulf war, it was 
apparent that Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the war was ended at an 
early stage because of the decisive difference between the 
powers involved. However, the disputes in Yugoslavia and 
Somalia that took place later have not been, despite the United 
Nations trying to help the situation. Therefore, we should 
realize that it is not so easy to help other countries. 
  [Tahara] Then, suppose a second Persian Gulf war breaks out, 
what do you think Japan should do? 
  [Miyazawa] That will be the very opportunity for us to take 
action within the limit we are allowed under existing laws. 
  [Tahara] Yet, when the Persian Gulf war broke out, the Cold 
War structure was in its last stage, with the United States and 
the USSR playing the role of world police. Therefore, it was 
possible to repel Iraq under the leadership of the United 
States. However, if such a situation takes place in the future, 
which country do you think can take the responsibility in the 
post-Cold War world? Are we to totally leave [that country] in 
the lurch? 
  [Miyazawa] As you mentioned, it is very clear that the 
United Nations is not able to fully deal with the disputes which 
are frequently taking place here and there throughout the world. 
If your question is about what should be done in such 
situations, I say that the only way for us is to help the United 
Nations grow to be an organization capable of dealing with such 
situations. 
  [Tahara] The disputes you are referring to -- the situations 
in Somalia and Yugoslavia -- are what we may call civil wars. 
However, if an apparent act of invasion takes place, as was the 
case when Iraq occupied Kuwait, by which country and in what 
form do you think the situation should be dealt with? 
  [Miyazawa] The ideal form is for the United Nations to be 
equipped with its own military forces to suppress disputes. 
That seems to be the fundamental way of dealing with disputes. 
  [Tahara] How do you think Japan should take part in such UN 
activities? 
  [Miyazawa] I think it is quite alright for the Japanese 
people to voluntarily take part in UN activities as 
international public officers. In such a case, they should, by 
all means, work as international public officers, and their 
activities should not be regarded as use of force by Japan. 
  [Tahara] Is it not permissible to take part in UN activities 
by forming an organization separate from the Self-Defense Forces? 
  [Miyazawa] I do not think it is permissible, since such 
activities bring about the same responsibility to the nation. 
  [Tahara] During the Cold War era, both the West and the East 
were respectively conscious they had a strong enemy in the other 
side. Such an age has come to an end, and we should establish a 
new world order after the Cold War. What kind of a vision do 
you think the world should have? I think a more concrete vision 
might have been presented if the Miyazawa government continued 
for a slightly longer period. 
  [Miyazawa] It may be that the whole world is in agony 
without knowing which direction to take. Basically, it is 
important for every country in the world to be convinced that it 
should not resort to war to benefit itself. Also, it is 
important that, based on the interpretation of the respective 
countries, each country places importance on democracy, a 
commonly shared sense of value, on human rights, and on freedom. 
It is desirable to exert ourselves to take such a direction. 
<H5>  Comments on "A Plan To Rebuild Japan" Written by Ichiro Ozawa </H5>
  [Tahara] By the way, referring to the LDP, I think that in 
the past Japanese politics was carried out in the form of a sumo 
match between the LDP as a grown-up man and the nongovernment 
parties as a child. Whether it was the consumption tax or the 
PKO issue, the nongovernment parties opposed everything, and the 
LDP steered Japan by coaxing, persuading and intimidating them. 
However, it seems the LDP has become a child the moment it left 
power. Looking at the discussions involving the election system 
reform, we do not quite understand what the LDP wants to say. 
The party seems just like a fretful child. 
  It is not very clear what kind of an identity the LDP is 
going to create, and what action the party is going to take. 
  [Miyazawa] I think the existing coalition cabinet is the 
cabinet to realize political reform. To attain this purpose, 
each party has shelved its own fundamental policies and public 
promises, claiming that, as long as important matters are 
concerned, it is going to succeed LDP policies. Though it is 
important to carry out political reform, there are many other 
things assigned to everyday politics. Therefore, should 
everyday politics be neglected, problems tend to take place such 
as the problem involving Nakanishi, ex-director-general of the 
Defense Agency, and the confusion concerning the liberalization 
of rice, and it seems natural that the people criticize the 
government for totally neglecting the economic problems. 
  In this situation, it seems the duty of our party, as a 
nongovernment party, to meet the needs of the people by pointing 
out [the problems of the government]. Though, in certain cases, 
it is inevitable for us to criticize the government parties, I 
believe it is our duty to do so. 
  [Tahara] When I interviewed you while you were in the post 
of prime minister, you referred to the 15 May incident [a coup 
that took place on 15 May 1932 with young radical Navy officers 
taking the initiative], and said that it was not a desirable 
phenomenon for the country that such an incident should take 
place. I vividly remember your comment. In the world today, 
there is an increasing number of people who are beginning to 
feel that the economic situation is not good; that the political 
situation is unstable; and that the world situation surrounding 
Japan is unstable; and that, under these circumstances, Japan is 
going to enter a dark age similar to that of the beginning of 
Showa [from the mid-1920's]. What is your opinion on this point? 
  [Miyazawa] It may be partly because I am an optimist by 
nature, but I think it an important factor for social stability 
that freedom is being guaranteed. It is also important that the 
standard of living and the level of income do not differ so 
much. As such fundamental conditions are being satisfied in 
Japan today, it is not likely that a furious social anger will 
explode, taking the form of the 15 May incident. 
  [Tahara] Yet, reading "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" written by 
Ichiro Ozawa, we realize that he is concerned about Japan. 
Ozawa repeatedly emphasizes the significance of leadership. He 
believes that stronger leadership should be exercised in making 
decisions. What do you think of Ozawa's patriotism? 
  [Miyazawa] I think his is also a free opinion. In short, he 
is warning that Japan is not an "ordinary nation". 
  [Tahara] We may call it his irritation. 
  [Miyazawa] Yes, I agree. In my case, as I have lived a 
little longer, the period of 50 years does not appear to be so 
long a period. I rather strongly feel that we should not make 
the same mistake again. Reischauer is of the opinion that the 
country named Japan tends to be led in the wrong direction 
whenever a leader with strong power emerges. In a world with 
developed mass media such as we see today, it will be relatively 
easy to control the people through the media if there is someone 
who intends to do so. I feel it is dangerous to create such a 
situation as the Japanese nation is, in a sense, very uniform. 
  It is true that, 50 years from now, an opinion similar to 
that of Ozawa may be considered sensible. As for me, however, I 
would like to say that, in the case of Germany, the country has 
committed the same mistake twice.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Radio Free Asia Constitutes Gross Interference </F>
in the Internal Affairs of the Asian Countries"] 
  [Text] According to foreign sources, the U.S. Senate on 26 
January voted in favor of a decision to establish the so-called 
Radio Free Asia. This decision still needs the approval of the 
House of Representatives before becoming effective. The BBC held 
that this is the policy of certain rightist and extremist U.S. 
circles who wish to use Radio Free Asia to propagate American 
thinking and lifestyle and carry out the peaceful evolution 
strategy. 
  This decision of the U.S. Senate has resulted in strong 
protests in Asia and even in the United States. On 28 January, 
when interviewed by a ITAR-TASS correspondent on this issue, the 
spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said: The news 
about the U.S. Senate decision to set up Radio Free Asia has not 
been welcomed in Asia. The Asian people are aware that the 
purpose of this move is to impose the political views of a 
foreign country on them and this amounts to interference into 
the internal affairs of Asian countries. Not only will this move 
harm the socioeconomic development of Asian countries, but it 
will also adversely affect the relations between the United 
States and these countries. This is an erroneous decision that 
runs counter to the current trend of development in the 
international situation. 
  A Chinese Government spokesman stated that by deciding to 
set 
up Radio Free Asia, the U.S. Senate has trampled on the 
standards of international relations and interfered in the 
internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This 
decision must be overturned. The DPRK's KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS 
AGENCY issued a statement condemning the U.S. Senate decision to 
set up Radio Free Asia. Myanmar [Burma] also expressed its 
indignation at this move by the U.S. Senate. Even the American 
people have protested this action. Many people believed that 
the establishment of Radio Free Asia in the Cold War format is 
no longer useful and suitable, especially when economic 
relations between the United States and Asia are on the rise. 
  During the Cold War period, the United States used Radio 
Free 
Asia, Radio Freedom, and Jose Marti Radio and Telvision Stations 
as lethal ideological weapons against East European social 
countries, the (former) Soviet Union, and Cuba by disseminating 
distorted propaganda and inciting antagonistic feelings, thus 
grossly interfering in the internal affairs of these countries 
and causing tension in the relations between the United States 
and these countries. The people in these countries and in the 
rest of the world have protested strongly against this U.S. act 
of interference. Cuba was noted for its success in jamming the 
vicious U.S. radio broadcast signals. 
  Since the Cold War, the situation in Asia and the rest of 
the 
world has experienced substantial changes. Asia has emerged as a 
region of relative peace, stability, cooperation, and dynamic 
development. 
  It is the general desire of the people in the region to 
broaden their multilateral and diversified relations with the 
goals of protecting peace, security and socioeconomic 
development on the basis of mutual respect for independence and 
sovereignty, without interference into each other's affairs, and 
cooperation for equal benefit. Looking at the prospect of Asian 
development, many developed, industrialized countries, including 
the United States, are attaching importance to its relations 
with countries in the region. Therefore, the U.S. Senate 
decision to set up Radio Free Asia runs entirely against the 
trend toward peace, stability, and cooperation, violates 
international law, and therefore amounts to gross interference 
into the internal affairs of Asian countries.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Last week, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh 
Cam met and talked with Russian Vice Premier Yarov in Moscow. 
Mr. Yarov is also president of the Russian subcommitte in the 
Russia-Vietnam intergovernmental committee on economic, trade, 
scientific, and technological cooperation. Here is our radio 
editor's opinion: 
  Throughout the meeting, the two sides informed each other of 
the situation in each country, compared notes on bilateral 
issues, and affirmed their wish to develop the traditional 
friendly relations between Vietnam and Russia. Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam and Vice Premier Yarov reaffirmed that they will 
quickly promote and broaden the cooperation for mutual interest 
between Vietnam and Russia in the field of energy, planting, and 
prospecting of tropical farm products, mining, and mine 
industry. The two sides are determined to strengthen relations 
between Vietnamese localities and those in the (?Far East) of 
Russia and promote the trade relations between the business 
enterprises between the two countries. On this occasion, 
Vietnam and Russia observed positive developments in recent 
relations between the two countries and maintained that these 
relations will further develop in the future. 
  Their statements are correct. Over the last six months, the 
two countries held repeated meetings at high level. Vietnamese 
Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong last year paid a working visit to 
Russia. Over the last five months, the Vietnamese foreign 
minister paid two working visits to this country. 
  Despite many difficulties confronting Russia, Russian 
leaders 
spent much time to contact and discuss with the Vietnamese 
leaders in order to strengthen the close relations between the 
two countries. Particularly, Russia agreed to let Vietnam pay 
its debt within its capacity. Russia also agreed with Vietnam's 
proposal to have measures to ensure safety and security for 
Vietnamese people working and studying in Russia. 
  The relations between Vietnam and Russia have undergone many 
years of fine development. Now there is a ground to believe 
that these relations will develop as those in the past on the 
basis of equality and mutual benefit.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 16 February editorial: "Invincible Is Our </F>
Single-Hearted Unity Rallied Around the Great Leader (yongdoja)"] 
  [Text] Today, our people are vigorously pressing ahead 
with the historic onward march to consummate the chuche-oriented 
socialist cause, overflowing with optimism and confidence in 
victory. While the grand struggle has been carried out, the 
blood ties between the great leader [yongdoja] and our people 
has become all the more cemented as an invincible one which none 
can break. 
  At a time when the single-hearted unity of the leader 
[suryong], the party, and the people is being tightened beyond 
measure and the socialism of our own style is triumphantly 
marching ahead, we meaningfully mark the birthday of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great leader [yongdoja] of our 
party and our people and the supreme commander of our 
revolutionary forces. 
  The revolutionary holiday of February is the greatest 
holiday 
for our nation in which the glorious chuche lineage has been 
firmly inherited, and the firm guarantee has been prepared to 
ensure the endless prosperity for the fatherland and the 
happiness for all the generations to come. 
  Observing the historic day, all the party members and 
working 
people are gripped by boundless reverence for the great leader 
[yongdoja] and are recalling with great pride the proud history 
of having marched ahead under the leadership of the party and 
the leader [suryong]. 
  The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
revolutionary activities is the most glorious history of the 
great revolutionary and the great leader [yongdoja] who has 
devoted his all for the noble cause for the fatherland, the 
people, and the revolution. 
  Embarking on the road of the revolution with the firm will 
to 
succeed to and consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary 
cause pioneered by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim 
il-song in the early days, the dear comrade leader has led our 
people's struggle for the socialist construction and the 
fatherland reunification into the ever-victorious road, standing 
at the fore of our party, the people, and the revolutionary 
forces. 
  Today, the era of the Workers' Party of Korea has met the 
golden age, and the status and dignity of our party and the 
fatherland has reached its zenith. Upholding the great leader 
[yongdoja], who has created the most glorious history of 
struggle for the revolution and the people, comes as the honor 
for Korea and the greatest pride of our times. 
  Recalling our party's history of struggle adorned with 
inflamed events and feats, we feel the greatest pride because 
the single- hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary 
ranks uniting around the great leader [yongdoja] has been firmly 
achieved. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: Our single- 
hearted unity is the most firm revolutionary unity and 
invincible unity with limitless power in which we are firmly 
united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and fidelity 
based on one center and one ideology. 
  Unity is power and a fundamental source of triumph in the 
revolution. At a time when the generation of the revolution has 
been changed and is carrying out its tasks to inherit and 
complete the socialist cause, the question on how to unite 
around the leader [yongdoja] is a vital question connected with 
the destiny of the revolution. 
  The single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary 
ranks has a long history and tradition. The tradition of our 
unity rallying around the leader [yongdoja], which was created 
amid the stern flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, has been 
brilliantly inherited along with the advancement of the 
revolutionary cause. 
  Today, in our country, the single-hearted unity of all the 
party members and all the people centering on the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il has been firmly achieved. As the result, 
the problem in inheriting the tradition of unity has been 
brilliantly solved. 
  Never has there been a time like today in which all the 
party 
members, working people, and officers and men of the People's 
Army, with absolute loyalty for the leader [yongdoja], are 
firmly united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and 
fidelity. The achievement of the great single-hearted unity is 
the most biggest triumph for our revolution. 
  The might of our single-hearted unity rallied around the 
dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been clearly proved in our 
arduous practical revolution. 
  The single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the 
most powerful weapon that enables them to brilliantly carry out 
any difficult and massive task in revolution and construction 
and vigorously accelerate the general onward march of socialism 
of our own style. The history of our socialist construction is 
decorated with proud courses in cultivating roads and creating 
miracles with the might of unity. 
  Upon inheriting the long tradition of struggle, our people 
were able to create the speeds of march admired by the people of 
the world and to run like the wind in the seventies, eighties, 
and nineties because they waged struggles after strongly uniting 
around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Everything that casts its ray on the fatherland -- the 
strong 
foundation for a self-reliant national economy, the powerful 
national defense capability, and the great monumental edifices 
erected everywhere -- is the brilliant fruition of the might of 
single-hearted unity. If it had not been for the weapon of 
single-hearted unity, we would not have been able to endlessly 
develop our economy during the period of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan, when the situation at home and abroad was difficult. And, 
if it were not for the might of single-hearted unity, all of us 
would not be able to march to highly display the superiority of 
socialism of our own style as boldly as we are doing today. 
  Our single-hearted unity is a source of invincible might 
that 
enables us to defeat any antirevolutionary offensive of the 
imperialists and strongly defend achievements in reunification. 
  For the past few years, imperialists and reactionaries of 
all 
sorts have maneuvered more viciously than ever to isolate and 
stifle [korip chilsik] socialism of our own style. However, 
they were no match for the might of our people single-heartedly 
united around the dear comrade leader. Because there was 
single-hearted unity, our party and people could defeat the 
enemy's reactionary ideological offensives and crush [kyokpa] 
any maneuver by the enemy to politically and militarily threaten 
us and bring us under its control [che-ap]. 
  During last year's semi-war period, the entire country, all 
the people, and the entire Army, cherishing our supreme 
commander's iron will deep in their hearts, rose up unanimously 
to launch revolutionary offensives to crush [patan] the enemy's 
attempt. This is a graphic example of how powerful the might of 
our single-hearted unity is. 
  Today our party and people are responding to the enemy's 
threats, blackmail, and vicious appeasement tactics with a 
strong revolutionary stand and fighting with a bold offensive 
spirit and indomitable spirit [taedamhan konggyok chongsingwa 
pulgurui kijiro]. The source of this might is the invincible 
unity of revolutionary ranks. As long as there are iron-willed 
revolutionary ranks that rise up unanimously in concert with the 
great leader [widaehan yongdojawa hanmaum handdussidoeyo], our 
fatherland will cast its ray as an invincible fortress of 
socialism. 
  Today the single-hearted unity of our party and 
revolutionary 
ranks is unity with the greatest vitality. A fundamental reason 
for this is the greatness of the leader [yongdoja]. 
  The solidity of unity depends on how firm the center of such 
unity is. Only when one upholds the people's leader [chidoja] 
who wins unswerving trust and support from the entire party and 
all the people, can there be firm unity that is unshakable in 
any storm. The might of our single-hearted unity comes from the 
fact that the dear comrade leader's ideas and theories are great 
and that those ideas and theories are the ideological basis of 
our unity. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and 
enriched the great leader's [widaehan suryong] revolutionary 
idea, the chuche idea, and provided a powerful ideological and 
theoretical asset for the long and arduous revolutionary course 
that can defeat the imperialists and complete the socialist 
cause to the end. 
  Today Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories are firm 
guiding principles for our party and revolutionary cause and 
banners that can achieve complete and unconditional ideological 
and theoretical unity in the revolutionary ranks. Because we 
have these great ideas, the political and ideological purity 
[sungyolsong] of our party and revolutionary ranks is firmly 
ensured generation after generation. 
  Cherishing our party's ideas and theories, which are 
associated with the dignified name of the dear comrade leader, 
in their hearts as their bone, flesh, and belief, our party 
members and workers live and fight according to the requirements 
of those ideas and theories today. 
  No alien [isaekjogin] ideological elements whatsoever can 
set foot in our revolutionary ranks, which are firmly armed with 
the great leader's [yongdoja] ideology and will. As our party's 
ideology and theory is infinite, our single-hearted unity which 
regards it as the water of life will never change. 
  The single-hearted unity of our party and the revolutionary 
ranks is becoming an ever-victorious and invincible unity. This 
is because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is 
great and the authority of his leadership is incomparably high. 
  The dear comrade leader's leadership art is a 
chuche-oriented 
leadership art which makes it possible to display the popular 
masses' infinite strength to the utmost. It is also an 
ever-victorious leadership art that finds a breakthrough in 
solving problems in whatever situation and turns an adverse 
situation into a favorable one. Through his extraordinary 
leadership capabilities, the dear comrade leader brilliantly 
fulfilled many difficult and complicated tasks presented in 
carrying out the socialist cause of our era. He also achieved 
immortal achievements before the era and revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made countless 
accomplishments in the revolution and the construction. They 
include achievements in strengthening the party, the staff of 
the revolution; enhancing our party's leading role in every way; 
bringing in fundamental upturn in the construction of the 
people's armed forces; and filling the superiority of the 
socialism of our own style in every domains of politics, 
economy, and culture. For these great achievements, the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being highly praised as a genius 
of creation and construction and a great strategist, and has 
come to grip the absolute authority over the people. 
  Our people, through their lifetime experiences shared with 
the party, came to cherish deep in their hearts the steadfast 
conviction and will that they can surely conquer any fortress of 
the socialist construction as long as the dear comrade leader 
leads them. Our single-hearted unity is so strong as the entire 
society is overflowing with such unshakable faith and will. 
  The great ethos of single-hearted unity in our society is a 
brilliant crystal of politics of benevolence and politics of 
love and trust afforded by the dear comrade leader. The dear 
comrade leader's warm love for the working people and his 
unfaltering trust for the revolutionary fighters are his natural 
gifts and basic characters of politics afforded by him. 
  Our party, with its limitless magnanimity, has taken care of 
the people from all walks of life, including the working people, 
the peasants, and the intellectuals, by holding them in its 
broad bosom and led them to fruitful life and struggle. In 
addition, it made all the people who follow the party to proudly 
stand for members of the revolutionary ranks. 
  Our party's politics of great love and trust has given birth 
to loyalty and filial duty among our party members and working 
people, and made the beautiful communist traits to bloom fully 
in our society. 
  Thanks to the dear comrade leader's great noble traits, our 
society has become a big family under which the great father and 
the people are connected in blood; a harmonious society where 
the people help and pull each other along in accordance with the 
communist principle of one for all and all for one; and a united 
society in which the great flower garden of the civilian-army 
unity is being unfolded. 
  Because we uphold the dear comrade leader, who is the center 
of unity, the great ideological theoretician, the excelled 
politician, and the father of the people, our single-hearted 
unity will display full its infinite might and vitality in the 
future. Before us lie the heavy tasks of brilliantly completing 
the chuche-oriented socialist cause by further strengthening the 
single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All of the 
working people should inherit the tradition of our revolution's 
single-hearted unity, and direct big efforts to further 
strengthen the single-hearted unity of the party and the 
revolutionary ranks uniting around Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Single-hearted unity is an eternal slogan for our people's 
struggles and an immortal banner that provides the Korean 
revolution with bright prospects. In the course of upholding 
the dear comrade leader, we must more brilliantly inherit the 
proud tradition of the Korean communist movement in which we 
have considered unity to be the most precious and defended it at 
the risk of our lives. If we are to strengthen the might of 
single-hearted unity by all means, it is more important than 
anything else to possess absolute admiration of the leader 
[yongdoja] and uphold the leadership of the party and the leader 
[suryong] with loyalty. 
  The most important among the traits of revolutionaries who 
boundless treasure unity is to have a firm attitude and position 
with which they uphold the leader [yongdoja]. Revolutionary 
warriors must single-heartedly uphold their leader [yongdoja] 
with loyalty. Warm loyalty with which one follows one's leader 
[yongdoja] and considers him to be a person to whom one owes 
one's life and who defends one's destiny is a basic trait that 
our revolutionaries must possess. 
  All party members and workers must resolutely walk along a 
single road of loyalty, always cherishing deep in their hearts 
the notion that it is very fortunate that they have the great 
leader of the people [widaehan inminui chidoja], who shoulders 
the destinies of the fatherland and people and who leads the 
chuche-oriented socialist cause to a single road of 
invincibility. 
  Our people's eternal spiritual pillar and center of belief 
[yongwonhan maumui kidung sinnyomui kidung] is the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The more openly the imperialists and reactionaries launch 
antirevolutionary offensives and the heavier revolutionary tasks 
face us, the more deeply we must cherish the belief that our 
socialist cause will win victory without fail as long as the 
dear comrade leader leads us. For all party members and workers 
to loudly sing the song of loyalty and song of belief entitled 
"We Will Win as Long as You Are There" and to meet face to face 
with difficulties and archenemies [taejok] is a way to fully 
demonstrate the might of our single- hearted unity. 
  If single-hearted unity is to be strengthened in the party 
and revolutionary ranks and functionaries, among other people, 
must take the lead to uphold the leadership of the party and the 
leader [suryong]. Functionaries are essential people in the 
party and revolutionary ranks and the leading officials of the 
revolution. Our functionaries are those who must become flag 
bearers as well as hands [sonbal] in upholding the party and the 
leader [suryong]. All functionaries must thoroughly imbue 
themselves with the revolutionary doctrine and prepare 
themselves as genuine loyalists who eternally share the same 
life and destiny with the party and determined revolutionaries 
who strongly defend the revolutionary guardposts, to which the 
party assigned them, and boundlessly glorify our party's 
revolutionary achievements until they die. 
  Those who always share the same will with the leader 
[yongdoja], who consider the party's policies to be their belief 
and devotedly implement them to the end, and who resolutely 
struggle to defend our single-hearted unity by all means: They 
are genuine revolutionary warriors. 
  Our functionaries must always compare Comrade Yi In-mo's 
party spirit with their own and persistently make efforts to 
learn from his spiritual world. To our functionaries who cannot 
live even for a moment without the people's trust and love, 
nothing is more important than possessing the spirit of 
devotedly serving the people. The functionaries must never 
forget their role in establishing blood ties between the party 
and people, go among the popular masses, and make brisk efforts 
to better extend the dear comrade leader's favors to our people. 
  If our single-hearted unity is to be strengthened by all 
means, we must substantially and continuously carry out the work 
to unite the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from 
all other walks of life around the party. 
  The solidity of our revolutionary unity is guaranteed by the 
ideological solidity of the popular masses who absolutely 
support and follow the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  We must further strengthen the indoctrination work to make 
the party members and workers accept loyalty to the party and 
the leader [suryong] as their faith, conscience, morality, and 
daily life and, in particular, the work to propagandize the dear 
comrade leader's greatness. In this way, we must make the entire 
society the crystallization of loyalty, devotion, and single- 
heartedness. In particular, our intellectuals must have a 
revolutionary awareness and communist conscience and defend and 
uphold the party with knowledge and technology. 
  All intellectuals must cherish deep in their hearts the 
great 
honor of being the party's eternal companions, sincere 
supporters, and excellent advisers, an honor that the dear 
comrade leader has given them. They must also become 
forerunners who give the people a belief in sure victory and 
must become bugles in the socialist march. 
  The young people are the inheritors [kyesungja] of the 
revolution who must glorify the party's cause, the dear comrade 
leader's cause, generation after generation. They are also the 
most vigorous group of people in our society. With a firm 
resolve to become guns and bombs [chongpoktan] that defend and 
protect the party and the leader [suryong], all young people 
must live and struggle in a revolutionary manner and must always 
rush to difficult guardposts to which the party calls them and 
create miracles and feats. 
  Giving fuller play to the traditional ethos of army-people 
harmony is of important significance in solidifying the 
wholehearted unity of our society as firm as a rock. Today, the 
soldiers of our People's Army have the revolutionary soldier's 
spirit of laying down their youth and lives willingly for the 
comrade supreme commander and are carrying out their honorable 
mission as revolutionary fighters with guns. Because we have 
the People's Army which is boundlessly loyal to the iron-willed 
brilliant commander General Kim Chong-il, our party is strong, 
and the security of our fatherland is firmly ensured. 
  All party members and working people should always attach 
importance to military affairs, love the soldiers of our 
People's Army like their real brothers and sisters and real sons 
and daughters, and help them wholeheartedly. All the officers 
and men of the People's Army should love the people and wage a 
struggle devoting everything they have to it to defend the 
people's lives and properties. 
  As long as the army and the people uphold the party's cause 
with loyalty in firm unity between them, the wholehearted unity 
of our revolutionary ranks will be as strong as a fortress. 
  Upholding the great leader's New Year's address and the 
decision adopted at the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, our people are 
vigorously pushing ahead with a new onward movement to fully 
display the superiority of socialism of our own style. 
  We should fully display the might of single-hearted unity in 
today's struggle to implement the revolutionary economic 
strategy set forth by the party. 
  All party members and working people should staunchly strive 
to carry out our party's grand socialist construction plan by 
highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
hard struggle. In doing so, they should adorn this year, the 
first year of the adjustment period, with brilliant feats and 
triumphs. 
  Today when some 50 years have passed since the great guiding 
star rose from the sacred Mt. Paektu, our revolution has a 
bright future. The great leader [yongdoja] stands at the fore; 
the invincible party leads us to victory; and single-hearted 
unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses is 
pressing hard on our revolution's march. 
  Victory is on our people's side who are firmly united around 
the leader [yongdoja] with conviction and fidelity. 
  Everyone should consolidate the single-hearted unity among 
all party members, working people, and officers and men of the 
People's Army centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
as firm as a rock, and staunchly fight for the ultimate victory 
of the chuche cause.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Kim Myong and No </F>
Myong-hwa: "Confrontation and War Are the Road to Destruction" 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [No Myong-hwa] Today the South Korean people are 
raising their voices to overthrow the civilian government of the 
Kim Yong-sam clique. I believe that this is an explosion of 
their indignation against traitor Kim Yong-sam, the worst 
betrayer of the nation, who is flagrantly running amok to pursue 
confrontation and war maneuvers. Therefore, I would like to 
talk about the maneuvers of traitor Kim Yong-sam who pursues 
confrontation and war by running counter to the national demand 
for reunification. 
  [Kim Myong] Speaking of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, 
originally, he was the most heinous anti-reunification element 
and separatist who used to make absurd remarks that there will 
be neither freedom nor prosperity if this country is reunified, 
and that it will be more painful to live in the state of 
reunification without freedom nor prosperity than to live in the 
state of division. Such attitude of the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
clique's shows that he is more persistently clinging to the 
skirt of outside forces and is running amok to pursue the 
criminal North-South confrontation and the Northward invasion 
maneuvers. Such act would put the previous warmongers to shame. 
  [No] As is known, last year we proposed a 10-point program 
for a great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of 
the fatherland and urged the South Korean rulers to suspend 
their confrontation and war maneuvers and to return to the road 
of the national reconciliation and unity and the national 
independence. However, they refused our friendly proposal and 
walked the road against us. In order words, the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam clique has viciously inspired a spirit of confrontation 
between the fellow countrymen by saying at every opportunity in 
a so-called meeting of the Army commanders or in his New Year's 
address that South Korea must be ready for an emergency 
situation. Some time ago, they kicked up another provocative 
commotion at a meeting of the so- called Emergency Planning 
Committee, talking about the resumption of a posture to prepare 
for an emergency situation. 
  [Kim] You are right. We cannot forgive him today because of 
the fact that the Kim Yong-sam clique is attempting to carry out 
the so-called international cooperation system and international 
sanctions in order to crush [apsal] our Republic by relying on 
the might of outside forces. Some time ago, he announced that 
he would make efforts to improve relations with the North based 
on view of the fact that it is the same nation, but he behaved 
himself disgracefully by begging the United States to exercise a 
powerful influence against us and to carry out the international 
cooperation system with South Korea, while even providing South 
Korean rice markets to the United States. He even visited the 
United States for this. 
  [No] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique has made 
warmanic and absurd remarks by saying that he is ready to take 
military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] against us under the 
pretext of the nuclear issue. He does everything to inspire the 
spirit of the North-South confrontation and has created the 
spirit of northward invasion by touring the puppet military 
units. 
  [Kim] You are right. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has not 
only pursued the North-South confrontation but has also been 
frantic to bring the flame of war to the heads of our nation. 
The Kim Yong- sam clique, who responded to our proposal for 
exchange of special envoys of the top authorities of the two 
sides by resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise with 
outside forces, has conducted a great number of aggressive war 
exercises up to date. According to a military source, a few 
days ago, the Kim Yong-sam puppets conducted war exercises in 
the areas of Kyonggi Province and South Korea's Kangwon Province 
-- areas near the Demilitarized Zone -- by firing guns against 
us. The Kim Yong-sam puppets, who are running amok to the 
spirit of war, have designed plots to conduct another 
large-scale war exercise in collusion with outside forces if 
they fail to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise. 
Also, they have maneuvered to introduce Patriot missiles to 
South Korea. 
  [No] The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has viciously committed 
a grave military provocation in the Demilitarized Zone. In 
fact, their new war provocation plots have been formidable. 
Because of the confrontation and war maneuvers by the Kim 
Yong-sam puppets in South Korea, all dialogues between the North 
and South have broken. Also, big obstacles are being created in 
the future road of the national reunification with each passing 
day. The Kim Yong-sam puppets infringe upon even the basic and 
democratic rights of the South Korean people. On 1 February, 
they indiscriminately cracked down with their rifles, knives, 
and tear gas, the struggle of farmers, youths, and students who 
rose up to wage demonstrations against the opening of the 
agricultural market. They arrested approximately 400 farmers, 
youths, and students there. Even now, they are putting the 
whole area of South Korea into a warlike atmosphere of terror. 
  [Kim] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique is the worst 
traitor of the nation, as well as the vicious fascist warmonger. 
The fact that the South Korean people from all walks of life are 
fighting against the Kim Yong-sam clique under the slogan "Let 
Us Overthrow the Civilian Government" is very just. Therefore, 
the Kim Yong-sam clique must receive national punishment. 
  He is running amok to pursue the North-South confrontation 
and the war plot for the northward invasion under the cloak of a 
civilian government. I can say that this is to extend his dirty 
life even one more day by persistently relying on outside 
forces. However, this is a miscalculation. 
  As shown by history, confrontation and war maneuvers are the 
shameful road to destruction. The Kim Yong-sam clique must be 
aware of the masses' aspiration and historical lessons and act 
with discretion. 
  [No] Army officers and soldiers in South Korea will clearly 
see the last days of the Kim Yong-sam clique, who is hastily 
running amok to the road of destruction, while standing on the 
side of the masses and making efforts for the national harmony 
and unity. 
  [Kim] You are right.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of the regular weekly </F>
"Discussion" program, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, Shinseito's Kozo Watanabe, the Liberal Democratic 
Party's Masasjuro Shiokawa and Kabun Muto; moderated by NHK 
commentator Takashi Yamamoto -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted on Takemura commenting on the 
Japan-U.S. summit in Washington] 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Muto, you were foreign minister last summer 
when the agreement was made on the objective criteria. What was 
the story at the time? 
  [Muto] We opposed setting such numbers. We felt the same as 
the chief cabinet secretary, and we stuck to the position that 
we would not accept any measure which would lead to managed 
trade. What is now happening is an extension of that position. 
Government officials have persisted with that line, and I would 
like to praise Prime Minister Hosokawa for doing the same. I 
think it was good the talks broke off in failure. What is 
wrong, after all, is wrong. I think Mr. Hosokawa said the same. 
Both countries believe in free trade. I think the 
semiconductor agreement was wrong -- I mean the fact such an 
agreement should have been made. Once you have such an 
agreement it becomes a precedent. So it would have been better 
never to have concluded such an agreement. 
  Government procurement is done by the government, but 
workings of the automobile industry belongs entirely to the 
private sector. I think it would, indeed, be wrong indeed to 
set numbers that deal with this industry. Besides, the U.S. 
auto industry has become more competitive than the Japanese 
internationally. I think it was good he spoke against setting 
target numbers. [passage omitted on Takemura commenting further 
on the summit and Japan-U.S. relations] 
  [Yamamoto] Minister Takemura, I understand you have another 
appointment. Shall we conclude our discussions here? Thank you 
so much for having been with us here today. [Takemura leaves] 
Mr. Shiokawa, we have heard the government's point of view. 
What is your view of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting? 
  [Shiokawa] I am very concerned. Just now the chief cabinet 
secretary said every effort should be taken to ensure the matter 
does not affect basic elements in relations between the two 
countries. The government must do everything toward that. 
  Another point is that the general public is not clear about 
why the Japan-U.S. talks ended this way. If we look at what the 
government has done recently, it is obvious that the process by 
which it decides on important matters is far from clear. Things 
happen suddenly. Take taxes as an example, while people were 
asleep, the government, out of the blue, announced it was 
instituting a national welfare tax. It is only natural that 
people became angry as a result. As I said, the process is 
unclear. 
  Even in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the government 
has 
known from the beginning about the numerical targets demand. 
The government should have been able to say it had made a 
counter- proposal to the United States but that talks broke down 
because this counter-proposal had not been accepted. The 
problem is that the United States does not know what Japan 
wants. I think we should explain to the United States what we 
want and this will be the best way to restore the trust 
relationship between the two sides. 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Watanabe, Mr. Shiokawa has criticized as 
confused the way the government makes decisions, even those 
connected with the Japan-U.S. talks. What is your response? 
  [Watanabe] There is no basis at all for such criticism. Mr. 
Muto, who has experience as international trade and industry and 
foreign minister, made a fair comment a little earlier. While 
serving as minister of international trade and industry, I also 
had hard time because of U.S. demands on numerical targets. 
Each time there was pressure, I told them the United States had 
the world's most liberalized economy and that if it and Japan 
agreed to doing something that led to managed trade, there would 
be reaction in Asia and Europe as well. I told them that when 
the overall world economy is taken into consideration numerical 
trade targets were not acceptable. 
  The outcome of the recent summit is not a rupture in 
relations, but an agreement not to have an agreement. A 
Japan-U.S. relationship in which the United States does as it 
pleases because Japan has a trade surplus exceeding $100 billion 
cannot be said to be a truly friendly relationship. Even though 
the government must make every possible effort to reduce the 
surplus by deregulation or expanding domestic demand, what 
cannot be done cannot be done. Each country must work together 
in areas where government can legitimately act. The recent 
Clinton-Hosokawa meeting was unsuccessful, but I think it marks 
the start of a process in which relations become more mature and 
warmer. I am sure people in Japan understand this. There are 
many who tell me they find the outcome of the summit acceptable. 
[passage omitted on comments by Dietmen from the Japan 
Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan] 
  [Yamamoto] Mr. Muto, in the wake of the Japan-U.S. talks, 
what do you think the future Japan-U.S. relationship should be 
like? 
  [Muto] As you, Mr. Yamamoto, noted earlier, I had a chance 
to serve as minister of international trade and industry during 
the Bush administration and also as foreign minister after the 
Clinton administration was inaugurated. I see a difference 
between these two administrations. I think Mr. Bush was an 
excellent politician, even in the area of diplomatic affairs, 
who thought about the United States while also thinking about 
the world. I receive the impression, even though I have not had 
close contacts with him personally, that Mr. Clinton thinks more 
about the United States and less about the world. I have met 
people around him such as Mr. Kantor and Mr. Christopher. I 
think it would benefit Japan if the government takes note of 
this in its future actions. I think Japan should strongly 
propose that the United States consider the rest of the world as 
well. Europe would welcome such an attitude, and so would 
people in Asia. There was criticism, even, of the Seattle 
conference of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] 
which said that all Clinton did in bringing together the Asian 
leaders was to use them to make himself look good. I think 
Japan should strongly advise the United States it should think 
globally. 
  Another point. What I want to say to the government is that 
if the yen value went up suddenly while we were in power, we 
used to ask the G-7 to intervene in the market. The current 
government has not taken such actions, even though the yen has 
risen sharply in value since last July. I think the government 
should have taken some action. I have a feeling a high yen will 
be the result of the current dispute. [passage omitted on 
discussion of tax issues]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [16 February] his failed trade talks 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton represented the outset of new 
Japan-U.S. relations reflecting a stronger sense of trust. 
  Hosokawa, reporting on the negotiations at a session of the 
House of Representatives, said he and Clinton held "good" talks 
in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on 
various issues, including the international situation. 
  Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral 
relations 
though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to 
slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in 
its markets, the premier said. 
  He called the talks the beginning of new bilateral relations 
with greater mutual confidence, in which both countries will 
make clear what they cannot do. 
  Hosokawa's remarks came after the United States on Tuesday 
unveiled steps to impose hundreds of million dollars in trade 
sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular 
phone market. 
  The prime minister pledged further deregulation to make 
foreign access to Japanese markets easier, in spite of the 
failed trade talks. 
  He hailed the talks saying that he and Clinton agreed to 
promote bilateral cooperation on global issues such as the 
environment, population and AIDS. 
  Hosokawa told Clinton that Japan would do what it could if 
the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on north korea over 
its suspected nuclear arms development program, he said. 
  After Hosokawa reported on the trade talks, the lower house 
session commenced interpellation. 
  In response to a question from Ryutaro Hashimoto of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Hosokawa said he 
would search for a breakthrough on Japan-U.S. trade issues. 
  He said Japan would improve access to its markets and 
government procurement procedures. 
  Hosokawa also reiterated his pledge to enact laws by the end 
of the year for financing a planned tax reduction. 
  The ruling coalition on February 8 agreed to implement from 
April a one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for fiscal 1994 
as a means of economic pump-priming. At the same time Hosokawa 
was forced to abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent 
consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to 
offset the loss of revenue from the tax cut.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
business leaders on Tuesday [15 February] ruled out a trade war 
between the two countries in the wake of a U.S. ruling that 
Japan violated a trade agreement on cellular telephones. 
  "I don't believe this will lead to a trade war," said Yotaro 
Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-U.S. Business Council and also 
chairman of Japan's Fuji Xerox Co. 
  Kobayashi was speaking at a joint press conference with 
Joseph Gorman, chairman of the U.S.-Japan Business Council, to 
wind up a three-day meeting of the two business groups. 
  Gorman, also chairman of TRW Inc., said that retaliation 
must 
be a last resort. 
  Gorman made the remark as U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor announced Tuesday that Japan's violation of an agreement 
on cellular phones may lead to retaliatory measures in coming 
days. 
  The councils met for three days from Sunday in preparation 
for an annual joint conference slated for July in Tokyo 
following the collapse of the weekend Japan-U.S. summit meeting 
over a new trade agreement. 
  The councils issued a joint statement appealing for private- 
sector efforts to resolve trade issues. 
  Noting that Japan and the United States share a bilateral 
relationship of the greatest importance, the statement called 
for pursuing a shared goal of open markets. 
  But the statement alluded to differences between the two 
sides over U.S. demands for "numerical targets" to measure 
progress in opening Japan's markets. 
  The statement said that maintaining and enhancing a positive 
environment for Japan-U.S. relations can best be done by 
"continuing to explore effective means of assessing progress in 
the opening of market sectors and the correction of the 
excessive trade imbalance."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Japan's postal minister 
Takenori Kanzaki expressed regrets Wednesday [16 February] over 
the U.S. finding that Japan has breached a 1989 bilateral 
agreement designed to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones. In 
a written statement, the posts and telecommunications minister 
said the finding, a move that could result in punitive action 
unless a settlement is reached, was "unilateral." 
  Kanzaki said his ministry has taken necessary action to 
boost 
imports under the accord. He said Japan would deal with 
possible U.S. punitive action against Japanese imports under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other 
international trade rules.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The latest U.S. step to pry 
open Japan's cellular phone market may lead to escalation of 
U.S. trade sanctions against Japan, a trade ministry official 
said Wednesday [16 February]. 
  Washington's hard-line stance against Japan has become clear 
following the collapse of trade framework talks last week, said 
an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who asked for anonymity. 
  The remark came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor 
on Tuesday announced that Japan was in violation of a 1989 
accord on cellular phone trade and unveiled a plan to raise 
tariffs on Japanese telecommunication products. 
  Bilateral talks are usually held before such a step is 
actually taken. 
  Japan should work out some measures before the United States 
takes action, said the official. 
  A source at the Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said it was 
possible that Washington would take one punitive step after 
another against Japan, such as revival of the "Super 301" 
retaliation clause of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. 
  The source also said Washington may resort to sanctions in a 
bid to increase sales of U.S.-made microchips in the Japanese 
market.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [16 February] he will closely watch 
developments in the United States following a U.S. announcement 
to take sanctions against Japan on mobile phones. 
  Hosokawa made the comment to reporters who asked how Japan 
will react to the U.S. decision. 
  In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
Tuesday unveiled steps to impose hundreds of millions of dollars 
in trade sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese 
celluar phone market. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Japan has 
not 
breached a 1989 trade accord with the U.S., which was meant to 
increase imports of U.S. cellular phones. 
  "We are concerned about the latest U.S. decision," the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect them to 
act sensibly." 
  Takemura also said the Japanese Government will examine the 
content of the U.S. announcement and decide on what action it 
will take. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to call a meeting Thursday afternoon 
of 
subcabinet-level officials who negotiated with the U.S. In 
bilateral trade talks to discuss increasingly strained ties with 
the U.S. 
  The trade negotiations broke down last week when Hosokawa 
and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new 
framework to slash Japan's vast trade surplus and increase the 
share of imports in its markets. 
  The mobile phone sector is not included in the framework 
talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa suggested Wednesday [16 February] Tokyo will file a 
complaint to the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
if the United States imposes trade sanctions on Japan. 
  "We will seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in 
accordance with international rules," said Hosokawa, during a

  He said Japan has not violated trade rules, and expressed 
concern about U.S. threats of sanctions. 
  Hosokawa's remarks came after the U.S. on Tuesday unveiled 
steps to impose sanctions worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. 
  The prime minister said Japan will "voluntarily" improve 
government procurement procedures and foreign access to its 
markets, but did not elaborate. 
  Hosokawa hailed his failed trade negotiations with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, saying the talks represented the outset 
of new Japan- U.S. relations reflecting a stronger sense of 
trust, in which both countries will make clear what they cannot 
do. 
  Hosokawa told the lower house he and Clinton held "good" 
talks in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on 
various issues, including the international situation. 
  Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral 
relations 
though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to 
slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in 
its markets, he said. 
  The premier said he and Clinton agreed to promote bilateral 
cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population 
and AIDS. 
  Hosokawa said he told Clinton that Japan would "do what it 
could" if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on North 
Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  He also called the planned one-time tax reduction an 
"emergency measure," saying permanent reductions of income and 
residence taxes will be included in the comprehensive tax reform 
he has pledged to carry out by the end of the year. 
  The ruling coalition agreed February 8 to implement a 
one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for 1994 as a means of 
stimulating the sluggish economy. 
  The tax reform package will include financing of the tax cut 
because, at the time of the agreement, Hosokawa was forced to 
abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 
7 percent "national welfare tax" mainly to finance the reduction.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The United States plans to 
scrap a global trade accord proposal on electronic components in 
response to what it views as Tokyo's insufficient efforts to 
open its lumber market, Japanese trade officials said Wednesday 
[16 February]. 
  The U.S. has notified the secretariat of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that it will retract a 60 
to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as proposed 
under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the 
officials said. 
  Washington is frustrated over Tokyo's failure to meet 
repeated U.S. calls for removal of wood product tariffs in 
Japan, the officials said. 
  The latest U.S. action prompted rescheduling from the 
originally set deadline of Tuesday for each GATT member country 
to show an item-by-item plan for reducing tariff rates, the 
officials said. 
  In the Uruguay Round talks concluded last December, Japan 
agreed to halve lumber tariffs. But the step did not fully 
satisfy the U.S., which called for total abolition in order to 
improve American access to Japan's lumber market. 
  The latest move is apparently targeted at Japanese exports 
as 
part of trade sanctions following the collapse of trade 
framework talks last week. 
  The U.S. is likely to exclude from the tariff cut plan 
electronic components which serve as Japan's mainstay export 
items, the officials said. 
  The Japanese side, dismissing the U.S. move as against the 
GATT accord, is expected to form an alliance with South Korea 
and other Asian countries in seeking the tariff reductions on 
electronic parts, the officials said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at 
0100 GMT on 13 February, during its weekly "Sunday Project" 
panel discussion program, carries a 36-minute live interview 
with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura by Soichiro 
Tahara, freelance political commentator and moderator of the 
program. In the interview, Takemura comments on such issues as 
the 11 February Hosokawa-Clinton talks, prospects for Japan-U.S. 
relations, tax reform, and the current political situation. 
Other participants in the panel discussion program -- Kyoto 
University Professor Masaaki Kosaka, New York City University 
Professor Yoshihiro Tsuyumi, Tokai Research Institute Director 
Kenji Mizutani, INSIDER magazine chief editor Hajime Takano, and 
co-moderator of the program Shinsuke Shimada -- occasionally 
join the interview. 
  In connection with the Washington summit, Takemura says 
Hosokawa was pessimistic about the results of the talks even 
before his departure for Washington, saying: "I think he rather 
thought it is difficult to narrow the gap between Japan and the 
United States over the numerical target issue." In describing 
Japan's stance toward the numerical target issue, Takemura says: 
"Both Japan and the United States are market economy nations 
and enjoy the free trade and market systems. So, we thought it 
was totally impossible for the government to set up detailed 
target figures for the private sector and exercise public 
control over the market, because such a policy threatens the 
very foundation of the nation's economic system. Since we had a 
bitter experience from the semiconductor talks, we thought we 
must clearly convey our position this time." 
  When asked about the Japanese Government's immediate tasks 
to 
redress worsening relations with the United States, Takemura 
says: "Japan should not only adhere to its position. From the 
viewpoint of the United States, Japan's trade surplus of over 
$130 billion is actually a huge amount. The United States is 
angry because the trade surplus is constantly growing. We must 
take some action concerning the issue, and we should be fully 
aware of Japan's responsibility. Fortunately, the rate of 
Japan's trade surplus showed a slight decrease in the third 
quarter of 1993. The rate was over 3 percent of Japan's gross 
domestic product at its peak, but it is currently declining to 
below 3 percent. According to the government's latest economic 
forecast, the rate is expected to drop to 2.8 percent in fiscal 
1995. So, we should continue all efforts to lower it through 
such measures as market liberalization, expansion of the 
domestic market, and deregulation. I think it is important to 
keep telling the United States that the Japanese Government 
intends to lower the trade surplus, and it is actually being 
lowered." 
  In response to a question asking how long the two nations 
need to cool down in preparation for the next round of the 
framework talks, Takemura says it would take "six months, at the 
longest," because Hosokawa and Clinton will see each other at 
the Group-of-Seven summit in July, and the two nations have an 
accord to carry on the summit talks biannually. He says Japan 
will prepare its own action plan by then to obtain U.S. 
understanding of Japan's efforts for reducing the trade surplus. 
  Turning to the tax reform issue, Takemura describes the 
reason for his negative attitude toward Hosokawa's proposal for 
raising the consumption tax. He states: "I think everyone, 
including members of the Liberal Democratic Party, generally 
agrees on the need for tax reform. However, the proposal was 
made as a surprise announcement." He thus notes that the 
Hosokawa proposal was made with inadequate consideration for the 
current economic situation and for the position of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan, the largest group in the coalition 
government. 
  Regarding Japan-U.S. policy coordination on a possible 
embargo against the DPRK, Takemura notes he thinks Hosokawa is 
well aware of the legal difficulties in preparing effective 
sanctions. He says: "The prime minister is being careful about 
this issue as he said Japan's action would be determined within 
the limitations of the law. I think that means Japan will 
follow the decisions of the international community within the 
limitation of laws and the Constitution."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Japan's merchandise trade 
surplus in January rose for the second straight month, growing 
17.0 percent from a year earlier to 6,105.6 million dollars, the 
Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report Wednesday [16 
February]. 
  The unadjusted customs-cleared trade surplus was a 
double-digit climb for the second straight month following a 
15.5 percent rise in December, and was the highest since a 28.1 
percent jump last July. 
  Exports increased 7.5 percent for the 11th consecutive 
month, 
up 7.5 percent to 25,929.9 million dollars. 
  Imports also rose for the 11th month in a row, up 4.8 
percent 
to 19,824.3 million dollars. 
  A ministry official said that in terms of volume, exports 
are 
little changed while imports are growing strongly. 
  This is not yet apparent in the figures, however. This is 
because the strength of the yen against the dollar is probably 
causing a temporary rise in the value of overall surplus in what 
is known as the "J-curve effect." 
  The dollar averaged 111.94 yen in January, up 11.5 percent 
from the same month the previous year when it averaged 124.86 
yen. 
  The rise in surplus comes at a time when the yen is being 
propped higher against the dollar as a consequence of the lack 
of agreement on trade issues at the weekend summit between the 
leaders of the United States and Japan. 
  Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. 
rose 7.0 percent to 3.13 billion dollars, going uphill for the 
eighth consecutive month, and accounting for 51.3 percent of the 
overall surplus. 
  A ministry official pointed out, however, that the notable 
characteristic of the month was a big rise in surplus with other 
Asian nations, which almost doubled from the previous year, 
surging 98.8 percent to 2.99 billion dollars. 
  It was the 21st straight month for the surplus with Asian 
countries to grow. 
  The surplus with Asian nations was driven by a three-fold 
increase in ship exports from a year earlier, the ministry 
official said, noting that Japan exported huge container vessels. 
  Japan's surplus with the European Union returned to the 
downtrend after the abrupt rise the previous month, declining 
36.1 percent to 1.75 billion dollars. 
  Exports of motor engines rose 27.1 percent, and 
semiconductors and other electronic parts grew 39.2 percent, 
while automobile exports fell 16.3 percent, down for the eighth 
month in a row. 
  Imports of crude oil dropped 29.9 percent, while oil 
products 
fell 18.3 percent. 
  Although the volume in crude oil remained almost unchanged, 
the export value of crude oil fell due to the drop in prices, 
the official said. 
  Crude oil prices averaged 14.57 dollars per barrel, down 
21.7 
percent from 18.61 dollars in January the previous year. 
  Imports of semiconductors and other electronic parts jumped 
50.5 percent and that of automobiles rose 42.9 percent. 
  The official said it is difficult to predict future trends. 
"It will all depend on factors such as yen-dollar exchange 
rates and the economic situation in Japan and overseas," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa plans to draft new measures to improve foreign access 
to the Japanese market in a bid to take the pressure off the 
strained trade ties with the United States, government sources 
said Wednesday [16 February]. 
  Hosokawa will call top bureaucrats to his official residence 
Thursday afternoon to discuss the market-opening measures, 
including those to boost government procurements and further 
relax government regulations. 
  Earlier this week, the premier expressed readiness to do 
more 
to balance bilateral trade, 50 billion dollars in favor of 
Japan, after talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton over the 
"framework" trade talks broke down last week. 
  Apparently frustrated with the stalemate in the framework 
talks, the U.S. Government announced steps to impose sanctions 
against Japan for what it sees as a closed market for foreign 
cellular phones. 
  Koichiro Matsuura, vice foreign minister for international 
affairs, Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and 
industry minister for international affairs, and Kosuke 
Nakahira, vice finance minister for international affairs, will 
attend the meeting Thursday. 
  The sources said the measures to be worked out by the 
meeting 
will include a step to make the procedures required for 
government procurements of telecommunications and medical 
equipment faster and more transparent. 
  Government procurements are one of the focuses covered by 
the 
framework trade talks. A pact has almost been completed over 
the issue, except for a disagreement over a U.S. demand that 
"objective criteria" be set to gauge Japan's efforts to slim its 
trade surplus. 
  The government plans to implement what the two countries 
have 
so far agreed upon on the matter. 
  Also envisaged are further deregulations aimed at narrowing 
the price gap between home and abroad and a quick enactment of 
the budget plan for fiscal 1994, starting in April. 
  The government is also likely to ask the car and other key 
industries to voluntarily make efforts to open their markets to 
foreign products. 
  The sources said Japan will explain its efforts at the 
upcoming meeting in Germany on February 26 of finance ministers 
and central bank governors of the Group of Seven economic powers. 
  The government will also have consultations with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, due to visit Tokyo 
shortly, over how to unblock the bilateral trade negotiations. 
  On the U.S. sanctions, the sources said the government plans 
to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade if the U.S. actually imposes them. 
  Hosokawa said earlier in the day that the government "will 
seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in accordance with 
international rules." 
  The government will also protest a U.S. decision to withdraw 
its offer to lower tariffs on electronics parts. 
  In addition, Tokyo will tell Washington to refrain from 
making remarks alluding to its tolerance of a higher yen. 
  Speculation that the U.S. desires a stronger yen to help cut 
the bilateral trade gap has driven the Japanese currency above 5 
yen in the last three sessions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The top policymaker of 
Japan's main opposition party on Wednesday [16 February] blasted 
as insufficient North Korea's acceptance of inspections of its 
seven nuclear facilities and urged it to allow checks on the two 
most controversial sites. 
  "I'm disgruntled at the fact that the latest agreement 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) has not cleared up all the ambiguities," said Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy 
Affairs Research council. 
  Addressing a news conference at the Japan National Press 
Club, Hashimoto said, "there are still some murky points, as 
North Korea has not agreed to accept inspection of its two 
nuclear waste reprocessing facilities." 
  The IAEA has said the two facilities, located in a nuclear 
complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang, might yield evidence of 
how much plutonium North Korea has produced in the past. 
  The IAEA and the United States have said they are keen to 
check the discrepancies between the actual amount of plutonium 
North Korea has produced and a much smaller amount of plutonium 
the nation has admitted manufacturing in the past. 
  They have expressed concern that missing plutonium from the 
Yongbyon nuclear reactors might have been diverted to produce 
nuclear bombs. 
  Hashimoto's comment came a day after North Korea told the 
IAEA it will allow IAEA monitors to inspect the seven nuclear 
sites, while keeping out them out of the two critical facilities. 
  Hashimoto, a former Finance Minister, said the LDP will take 
up the issue of these ambiguities during question-and-answer 
sessions at the House of Representatives Budget Committee in a 
regular Diet session that reconvened Wednesday. 
  He urged the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to take a firmer stand in responding to a proposal -- 
now before the UN Security Council -- to slap trade sanctions on 
North Korea if it fails to allow full inspection of all the 
facilities the IAEA is demanding to see. 
  "The LDP's own study indicates that the Hosokawa 
administration has not compiled any crisis management program" 
to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, he said. 
  Hashimoto said the LDP "will not consider exchanges" between 
party officials and the North Korean Government following the 
1993 fall from grace of former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru 
who had kept ties with the Pyongyang authorities. 
  "Although it is true that Mr. Kanemaru held talks with the 
North Korean Government, he did so as a mere individual," he 
said. He said the LDP had never sought to build ties with the 
North Korean leadership as a party policy. 
  He was speaking about a suprapartisan delegation to 
Pyongyang 
in September 1990 led by Kanemaru and then Social Democratic 
Party chairman Makoto Tanabe. Their talks with North Korean 
leader Kim Il-song later led to the start of diplomatic 
normalization talks between the two countries. 
  The normalization talks broke down after Pyongyang refused 
to 
comply with the IAEA's demands to inspect its nuclear facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Japan on Wednesday [16 
February] welcomed North Korea's agreement to allow 
international inspection into part of its nuclear facilities. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the Japanese 
Government hails Pyongyang's decision on Tuesday as a move that 
enables the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to confirm 
North Korea is not using its nuclear sites for military purposes. 
  "We believe it is important that the IAEA's inspection will 
be implemented in line with the latest accord" between Pyongyang 
and the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, the top 
government spokesman said at a news conference. 
  Takemura also expressed hope North Korea will take positive 
steps in clearing itself of allegations that Pyongyang has been 
secretly developing nuclear weapons at its facilities in 
Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital. 
  Tokyo wants Pyongyang to open a dialogue with Seoul and 
resume talks with Washington on the matter, according to the 
chief cabinet secretary. 
  North Korea agreed Tuesday to open seven of its nuclear 
facilities to inspections by the IAEA in a move to avert 
possible economic sanctions by the United Nations Security 
Council. 
  The accord, however, does not allow the IAEA access to two 
sites at Yongbyon where North Korea is suspected of developing 
nuclear weapons. 
  Takemura spoke of the need for North Korea to open the two 
facilities to international inspectors. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed a qualified 
appreciation for North Korea's decision, saying it was fine for 
the moment. But Hosokawa said there remain two more nuclear 
sites that must undergo checks. 
  A Foreign Ministry source said, however, it will not be 
clear 
whether North Korea will really accept IAEA inspections until 
they are implemented. 
  Japan must cautiously watch the development of the issue as 
Pyongyang may have agreed to open its nuclear facilities in an 
effort to buy time before the possible imposition of economic 
sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, the source 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [16 February] the excessive volatility 
of foreign exchange rates is "undesirable." 
  Speaking at the House of Representatives plenary session, 
Hosokawa said, "it is a common view among the G-7 (Group of 
Seven) nations that foreign exchange rates should reflect the 
economic fundamentals of nations and that excessive exchange 
volatility is undesirable." 
  "We will act appropriately to ensure stability in the 
market," he said. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also dismissed market 
speculation that the United States seeks to guide the yen higher 
to cut its trade surplus with Japan. 
  "The U.S. believes that currency markets should not be 
artificially manipulated. Their attitude has not changed," he 
said. 
  In the wake of the breakdown of bilateral "framework" trade 
talks, which fueled the speculation, the yen zoomed up by more 
than 6 yen during the first two days of the week, though caution 
over the high pace of the yen's advance pulled it back somewhat 
during Wednesday dealing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by NHK </F>
commentator Takehiko Mizuki at the NHK studios in Tokyo; date of 
interview not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mizuki] Minister, thank you for coming to our 
studio. The coalition government has compiled the fiscal 1994 
budget for the first time since it was inaugurated. What sort 
of priorities have been made within the compilation of the 
budget? 
  [Fujii] Ever since his cabinet was formed, the prime 
minister has continued to stress that the coalition government 
should build Japan into a fruitful and high-quality nation, and 
the coalition government should have the people understand that 
policy. I have worked to compile the budget, taking into 
account what the prime minister has stressed. At the same time, 
the coalition government is faced with the issue of spurring the 
stagnant economy. When the fiscal 1994 budget was compiled, I 
gave consideration to stimulating the economy. I also gave 
consideration to curbing special national bonds, and I intend to 
concentrate the allocation of funds on public works projects. 
These are what I bore in mind while the 1994 fiscal budget was 
being compiled. 
  [Mizuki] The government's debts will grow again; this is the 
most important issue. The coalition government will issue 20 
trillion yen in national bonds. How will the coalition 
government put the brakes on national bonds? This is an 
important matter. Minister, how are you going to deal with this 
issue? 
  [Fujii] A substantial portion of the 200 trillion yen in 
national bonds are bonds to finance construction projects. The 
bonds will leave our nation with assets worth that much. In 
that respect, it is beneficial to ask the people to assume the 
burden of some of the bonds. Faced with stimulating the 
economy, the coalition government intends to issue national 
bonds to spur the economy. The coalition government also 
intends to bring about a recovery of the economy. I think the 
coalition government should make every effort to curb the 
so-called special national bonds. 
  [Mizuki] Representatives of the ruling coalition parties 
have agreed to settle the issue of securing financial resources 
in order to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from tax 
cuts. Raising the consumption tax is the only way to secure the 
financial resources; the ruling coalition parties will thus 
focus their debate on whether or not to raise the consumption 
tax. When and how will the representatives of the ruling 
coalition parties settle the issue? 
  [Fujii] The representative of the ruling coalition parties 
have agreed to settle the issue within this year; this is their 
best choice. As you said a while ago, it is a natural for them 
to discuss ways to address unfair taxes and to streamline the 
administration. They will also discuss ways to reform the 
current tax system -- taking into account the balance of income, 
assets, and consumption -- and to create new taxes. They have 
agreed to do all these things this year. I value the agreement 
and think the representatives will resolve the issue as they 
have agreed upon. 
  [Mizuki] As I mentioned a while ago, I would like to ask 
about the public works projects. It is said the coalition 
government will concentrate the allocation of funds for the 
projects on improving the standard of living. The people are 
placing high hopes on them. 
  [Fujii] The budget for public works projects will grow 
substantially. While public works projects for natural parks 
will grow by 20 percent, those for agriculture will increase by 
14 percent. Public works projects for sewage and housing will 
also be greatly increased. I believe this allocation of public 
works projects reflects Prime Minister Hosokawa's policy. The 
growth is quite bold. Public works projects grew by 0.5 percent 
in 1993. Given the growth in public works projects for 1994, I 
believe the coalition government has made its utmost efforts. 
  [Mizuki] Looking at the compilation of the fiscal 1994 
budget, this time the so-called zokugiin [Diet members who 
champion special interests] were not as active as they were 
during the era of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, my 
impression is that moves by government ministries and agencies 
to protect their vested rights and interests are still 
deep-rooted. Minister, how do you plan to deal with those moves? 
  [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have provided all 
those concerned with the opportunity to put forth their views on 
the budget. The ruling coalition parties have presented the 
government, especially the Ministry of Finance, with their 
views. From our standpoint I feel the process has drastically 
changed. 
  [Mizuki] This question concerns the future management of the 
economy. The compilation of the budget has been delayed for 
more than a month. Minister, how do you plan to manage the 
economy as you fill the vacuum? 
  [Fujii] The budget should have been compiled in 1993; 
psychologically this would have been correct. However, we have 
compiled the third supplementary budget, and the budget will 
certainly give a boost to the economy. The coalition government 
will stimulate the economy through the third supplementary and 
fiscal 1994 budgets. The coalition government will also 
implement a package of stimulus measures totalling 15.25 
trillion yen. The package is the largest ever. It will serve 
to reinvigorate land transactions, agriculture, and small 
businesses. It is very important for the coalition government 
to implement the package without delay. 
  [Mizuki] The coalition government has decided on a package 
of stimulus measures totalling 15 trillion yen, as well as a 
budget bill, both of which are expected to spur Japan's economy. 
However, at this moment the yen is substantially appreciating 
against the U.S. dollar following the breakdown in the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. Minister, what do you think about this? 
  [Fujii] I cannot help saying that the current exchange 
markets are affected by speculative moves. The currency's 
exchange rate must reflect the country's economic fundamentals. 
It is undesirable for the exchange rate to move dramatically 
for short periods. This is an agreement reached among the G-7 
industrialized nations. I feel these are speculative moves 
which will probably last a day or so. 
  [Mizuki] Various remarks by high-ranking U.S. Government 
officials have affected the speculative moves. The G-7 
industrialized nations have agreed to cooperate with each other 
in dealing with severe fluctuations of the exchange rate. How 
do Japanese and U.S. financial authorities see the current sharp 
increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar? 
  [Fujii] A responsible U.S. Government official has said 
there is no change in the U.S. Government's policy on the 
exchange rate. I agree with that. 
  [Mizuki] Over the past few days, there has been no change in 
economic fundamentals. The breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks over the opening of the Japanese market is responsible for 
the drastic appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. It 
is important for the coalition government to settle the issue at 
the earliest date. 
  [Fujii] I have said the drastic appreciation of the yen has 
been caused by speculative moves. There are various reasons for 
these speculative moves. It cannot be denied that the breakdown 
of the summit talks is responsible for it. Although the leaders 
of Japan and the United States failed to reach an agreement on 
various bilateral issues, they agreed there will be no change in 
friendly relations between the two countries. It is necessary 
for the leaders to have opportunities to understand each other. 
  [Mizuki] If the appreciated yen sets back Japan's economy, 
this would adversely affect the world economy. The G-7 
industrialized nations will meet later this month. Minister, 
how are you going to deal with the appreciated yen? 
  [Fujii] Financial authorities in the G-7 industrialized 
nations have agreed that the exchange rate must mirror the 
economic fundamentals. Drastic fluctuations in the exchange 
rate have an adverse impact not only on the country concerned 
but on the world economy. Japan should try to reaffairm the 
agreement at the meeting to be held by the G-7 industrialized 
nations. 
  [Mizuki] Then, Minister, do you think the current sharp 
increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is 
temporary, and thus does not reflect Japan's economic 
fundamentals? 
  [Fujii] Yes. I believe the drastic appreciation of the yen 
has been caused by speculative moves. 
  [Mizuki] This is my last question. It is unclear why the 
yen has appreciated so drastically. Minister, when will Japan's 
economy recover? 
  [Fujii] The government has agreed to put the economy back on 
the path of recovery at the earliest possible time during fiscal 
year 1994, and to make certain it will continue its stable 
growth in the fiscal year 1995. I am and will manage the 
economy based on the government agreement. 
  [Mizuki] Banks are overloaded with bad loans, and there are 
other issues. It is not easy to resolve those issues. 
Minister, when do you think these issues will be resolved? 
  [Fujii] I intend to resolve them at the earliest possible 
date in 1994. 
  [Mizuki] Minister, thank you for being interviewed.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The Japanese economy is 
ready to pick up and enter a "full-fledged" recovery phase on 
the heels of a record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package 
launched last week, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said 
Wednesday [16 February]. 
  His comments came in a fiscal address to a plenary session 
of 
the Diet's House of Representatives following Tuesday's 
submission of the government's plan for the third fiscal 1993 
supplementary budget that finances a large chunk of the 
pump-priming measures. 
  "The economy remains in a tough situation, but the time is 
ripening toward a recovery with inventory and capital stock 
adjustments progressing under support from buoyant housing 
construction and public-works spending," Fujii said. 
  He stressed that the government has unveiled the stimulus 
program to spread "such recovery buds" in a bid to move the 
economy toward "a full-fledged recovery phase as early as 
possible in fiscal 1994 and to ensure stable growth in and after 
fiscal 1995." 
  Fujii expressed his "confidence" that the pump-primer would 
combine with the third extra budget and economy-oriented fiscal 
1994 budget to "wipe out uncertainties ahead and make a great 
contribution" to the economy's full-scale recovery. 
  The government on Tuesday adopted a fiscal 1994 budget worth 
73,081.7 billion yen which it will submit to the Diet in early 
March. 
  Explaining the third extra budget, Fujii said it boosts 
overall fiscal 1993 spending by 2,185.2 billion yen to 77,437.5 
billion yen, including 1,500 billion yen in additional spending 
on public works. 
  The new budget also calls for issuing 2,182.0 billion yen in 
contruction bonds to finance the additional outlays. 
  Referring to the increased debt, Fujii said the fiscal 
position has become increasingly tough with the huge outstanding 
balance of bonds and debt-servicing costs squeezing funds for 
allocations to policy expenditures. 
  Against this backdrop, Fujii indicated his intention to push 
forward tax reforms in connection to income tax and other tax 
cuts worth some 6 trillion yen included in the stimulus package, 
saying he will "strongly promote fiscal reform." 
  Under the fiscal 1994 budget, the government plans to issue 
deficit-financing bonds for the first time in five years to 
cover the tax cuts. The red-ink bonds are to total 3,133.8 
billion yen. 
  According to an agreement on the tax issue by the ruling 
coalition parties, a forum will be set up to decide on ways to 
finance the tax breaks by the end of the year.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa told a parliamentary session Wednesday [16 February] he 
has yet to decide whether to reshuffle his cabinet, but failed 
to rule out such a move. 
  "The issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am not 
working on the assumption that I should conduct it immediately," 
the premier said in reply to a coalition lawmaker at the House 
of Councillors plenary session. 
  Hosokawa said he will focus provisionally on seeking Diet 
approval of the third pump-primer supplementary budget for 
fiscal 1993 and revisions of a political reform package that 
passed the Diet on January 29. 
  Hosokawa made the remarks in response to a question from 
Kazuo Oikawa, a lawmaker of the Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan] [SDPJ], the biggest force in his coalition, which 
responded sharply to his proposal to reshape his six-month-old 
cabinet. 
  His remarks came at a moment time when some leaders of the 
ruling coalition traded sharp exchanges over the reshuffle 
proposal. 
  Speaking at the foreign correspondents club of Japan, SDPJ 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo urged Hosokawa not to reshuffle 
his cabinet to fire his spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. 
  "If the reshuffle is designed to oust a specific cabinet 
minister, the administration will lose its solidarity," he 
warned. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies, but 
their relationship is now reportedly at odds. 
  Hosokawa said Tuesday that he intends to reshape the cabinet 
that has been in place since he assumed power last August. He 
also sounded out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a key figure in Sakigake, on 
whether he is ready to take over the post. 
  Takemura heads Sakigake, one of the partners in the 
coalition. He is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the 
premier's proposal to impose a new 7-percent indirect levy on 
goods and services. 
  Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito 
co-leader 
Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, 
over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly 
asked Hosokawa to dismiss takemura. 
  Ichikawa told a meeting of Komeito lawmakers, "it is high 
time for us to seek to ensure that the cabinet can work smoothly 
by eliminating differences within the cabinet." 
  Democratic Socialist Party Chairman Keigo Ouchi balked at 
the 
idea of the reshuffle, but the No.2 man in the party, Takashi 
Yonezawa, another ally of Ozawa, has remained mum on the issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] leader Wataru Kubo urged Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa Wednesday [16 February] not to reshuffle his 
six-month-old cabinet in order to dismiss his right-hand man, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  The SDPJ is the largest force in the seven-party coalition 
and Kubo is the party's secretary general. He did not directly 
refer to Takemura during an address at the Foreign 
Correspondents Club of Japan but it was clear he had Takemura in 
mind. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies but 
their relationship has deteriorated to the point that they do 
not speak to each other unless they have to. 
  Hosokawa told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that he intends to 
reshuffle the cabinet that has been in place since he took power 
in August. He said he would discuss the matter with other 
leaders in his coalition administration. 
  Takemura heads Sakigake (Harbinger), one of the partners in 
the coalition. Well-placed sources said it was possible that 
Takemura could be offered another cabinet position. 
  Kubo, one of the coalition's chief policymakers, told 
reporters that Takemura's removal would weaken the makeup of the 
cabinet. 
  He urged Hosokawa to be "very persuasive" in demonstrating 
the need for a reshuffle of the 21-member cabinet during the 
current Diet session. 
  Kubo, who became SDPJ secretary general last September, 
cited 
deliberations for the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 
ending in March and the national budget for fiscal 1994 starting 
April 1994 as examples of the busy Diet schedule. 
  Kubo said he could not understand why Hosokawa intends to 
reshuffle the cabinet and he urged the coalition parties to 
unite in tackling tricky issues facing the government. 
  Takemura is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the prime 
minister's proposal for a new national welfare tax. 
  Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito 
co-leader 
Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, 
over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly 
asked Hosokawa to dismiss Takemura. 
  Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice at the time, political 
sources said. Ozawa and Ichikawa are the chief strategists in 
the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The top opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party vowed Wednesday [16 February] to press Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii to account on the Diet floor for his 
alleged acceptance of a 10 million yen donation from an industry 
body under his jurisdiction. 
  "Suspicions (on this issue) are extremely serious from the 
standpoint of the public," said Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party's Diet Affairs Committee at a news 
conference in the Diet building. 
  Ozato was speaking about the donation allegedly received 
last 
August by two of Fujii's officially registered political fund- 
raising organizations from the Enyu-kai, an industry association 
of salt wholesalers. 
  The Enyu-kai is affiliated with the Association of Salt 
Dealers Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a long-time 
adviser. 
  Fujii, now a House of Representatives member of Shinseito, 
was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and dozens of 
other LDP lawmakers bolted from the scandal-marred LDP to form 
Shinseito. 
  Ozato expressed the LDP's readiness to bring up the fact 
that 
Fujii returned the money a day after the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the 
nation's leading daily, reported the industry group made the 
donation to congratulate him on assuming the post of finance 
minister last August. 
  Japan's law on political funding bars a politician from 
accepting a donation of more than 1.5 million yen a year from a 
single source. 
  Shinseito secured a huge electoral success and came under 
the 
national spotlight at the 1993 general election by concentrating 
on the theme of cleaning up the Japanese political system.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang on Wednesday welcomed North Korea's acceptance of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) request for 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The government will continue to cooperate with friendly 
nations and international organizations in solving the issue, he 
said in a state of the administration speech delivered at a 
plenary session of parliament. 
  The government expects North Korea not only to permit IAEA 
nuclear inspections, but also to come to the dialogue table as 
soon as possible to take up the inter-Korean nuclear issue, he 
added. He also expressed hope that a humanitarian program would 
be launched to ease the pain of separated Korean families by 
arranging for reunions. 
  Stressing that government must be based on law and order, Yi 
said the administration would carry out all reform programs on 
this basis. 
  Calling on parliament to enact new electoral legislation 
during its current session, he said the government would manage 
local elections slated for next year strictly according to the 
new law. 
  To attain peaceful reunification of Korea, the government 
will pursue a foreign policy which creates an international 
environment conducive to that end, he said. 
  The government's economic policy will focus on increasing 
the 
international competitiveness of Korean products to spark a new 
economic takeoff. 
  To cope with the new world trade order established under the 
Uruguay Round accord, the government will reform Korea's trade 
system and practices so that they suit the new order. 
  For price stabilization, the government will continue 
controlling the prices of 30 basic items, while placing under 
surveillance the prices of 140 monopoly and oligopoly items, he 
said. 
  In addition to the 42 trillion won earmarked for investment 
in rural industries, 1.5 trillion won will be poured into 
agricultural restructuring programs every year over the next 
decade to revitalize the sector, which will likely suffer from 
farm market opening under the Uruguay Round accord, the prime 
minister said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu confirmed today that 
North Korea accepted the demand by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] to accept nuclear inspection and revealed 
that the government welcomes it. 
  In a meeting with reporters at dawn today, our time, Foreign 
Minister Han, who is currently on an official visit to Canada, 
said that North Korean representatives stationed at the IAEA 
notified the IAEA that North Korea is willing to accept 
inspection of seven nuclear facilities which the IAEA is 
demanding for the continuity of nuclear safety measures. 
Foreign Minister Han also said that the government welcomes the 
move and that he hopes the nuclear inspection on North Korea 
will be carried out as agreed upon between the IAEA and North 
Korea. 
  Foreign Minister Han said that it is unclear whether the 
nuclear inspection on North Korea will be carried out the day 
after tomorrow but said that there is a high possibility that 
the inspection will start within a week. 
  Foreign Minister Han said that since the North Korean side 
is 
showing a developing attitude regarding nuclear inspection, he 
will meet with high-ranking U.S. working-level officials 
including Secretary of State Warren Christopher and National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake when he revisits Washington on 17 
February to hold full-scale discussions with the United States 
on reaching an agreement on dealing with the upcoming 
three-stage contact.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean dialogue 
may soon open without having to wait for results of 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection on North 
Korea, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said Wednesday. Hong 
indicated a decision soon on canceling South Korea-U.S. joint 
military exercise "Team Spirit," saying the two countries will 
consult on the matter. 
  Widespread speculation is that the two countries will 
announce the cancellation around the time the IAEA inspection 
team begins activities in North Korea. 
  "This is only a beginning," said Hong after welcoming North 
Korea's decision to accept IAEA inspections after nearly a 
one-year break. "But to completely resolve the situation, North 
Korea must accept special inspection on its two undeclared 
facilities, fully return to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT), and implement inter-Korean agreement on 
denuclearization," he said. 
  Hong repeated earlier position by Seoul and Washington that 
North Korea must reopen inter-Korean dialogue before the United 
States will hold next round of high-level talks with it. 
  "There are many issues to be settled through South-North 
Korea dialogue," the vice foreign minister said. The dialogue 
is not necessarily linked to the outcome of IAEA inspections, to 
begin as early as this week, he said, "the talks can be held 
before or after the results are out."

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The compromise between 
North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is 
just enough to ride out the immediate crisis with both sides 
purposefully skirting the key questions. 
  Seoul officials unanimously welcomed North Korea's decision 
to reallow IAEA inspections but agreed it marks only a 
beginning, with even tougher negotiations than before probably 
still ahead. 
  It's progress since the IAEA can at least resume safegaurds 
activities in North Korea and reload batteries and film in 
inspection cameras that stopped functioning months ago. 
  The chief aim is to check whether nuclear materials at North 
Korea's seven declared facilities have been diverted for 
non-peaceful purposes since the last full-scale inspection in 
February last year. 
  Just verifying that there have been no covert nuclear 
activities in North Korea will significantly ease international 
concern for the present. 
  North Korea and the United States are now closer to holding 
the next round of high-level talks, an event that should defuse 
the threat of war and give peace a chance. But the situation 
has only returned to that of before last March 12, when North 
Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non- 
proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  In fact, the situation is in deeper limbo since North Korea 
and the IAEA intentionally haven't settled whether Pyongyang has 
fully returned to the NPT. 
  The wording of the North Korea-IAEA agreement leaves this 
issue in a vague state. North Korea claims it isn't party to 
the NPT and thus not obligated to permit routine IAEA 
inspections. Its decision to accept IAEA checks is purely 
voluntary, it maintains. 
  The agency insists otherwise, asserting that inspections are 
part of NPT obligations. 
  The compromise was not reached to settle this dispute. The 
IAEA is simply going into North Korea to reload the inspection 
cameras and to check on possible nuclear materials diversion. 
  Under the compromise, the IAEA got the scope of inspection 
it 
demanded. North Korea, in return, saved face by not admitting 
to having NPT obligations. 
  While the agreement on inspection breaks the present 
impasse, 
North Korea can always refuse further inspections because it 
never admitted to the obligations. 
  Once talks get underway for full-scale inspections, North 
Korea and the agency will have to tackle this dispute once again. 
  It has been Seoul and Washington's policy to take one step 
at 
a time. The immediate goal was to re-enter North Korea to find 
out if there is cause for concern about its suspected covert 
nuclear weapons program. The North Korea-IAEA agreement assures 
just that. But officials here see higher mountains to climb -- 
special inspections of North Korea's undeclared sites and 
inter-Korean talks that must reopen before the United States 
will hold high-level contacts with North Korea, for starters.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of an 
editorial and articles published on the moderate vernacular 
daily CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 16 February on North Korea's 
"lightning acceptance" of nuclear inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The paper publishes on page 3 a 2,300-word article by 
Vienna-based correspondent Yu Chae-sik, entitled "Strategic 
Concession Fearing International Pressure--Also Can Be 
Intentional Delay Tactic To Gain `a Lot.'" Noting that North 
Korea on 15 February informed the IAEA of its decision to 
"accept nuclear inspections" in a "lightning manner," the 
article says that with this, tensions regarding "the crisis of a 
war breaking," which has been openly talked about by the people, 
have now been "calmed down for a while." 
  The article points out several observations made by relevant 
IAEA officials in Vienna concerning the background of "North 
Korea's abrupt turnaround" from the position of refusal of 
inspections. First, North Korea "yielded to the tough pressure" 
of the international community, of the United States, in 
particular. Explaining the process of the past contacts between 
the United States and North Korea on the inspection issue, the 
article says that an agreement was reached between the two sides 
but there was no "progress" in the six contacts held between 
North Korea and IAEA owing to differences in positions on the 
scope of the inspections. The IAEA declared that if normal 
inspections of "seven nuclear facilities" are not accepted, it 
will not dispatch an inspection team to North Korea. Prompted by 
this, "voices for sanctions on North Korea" and "criticism" of 
the Clinton Administration's "moderate policy" began to "surge." 
Pointing to the U.S. Defense Department's announcement of its 
operational plan to "occupy Pyongyang" and to the U.S. "final 
notice" on referring the issue to the UN Security Council, the 
article notes that this situation has driven North Korea to 
keenly realize that it can "no longer endure" the situation and 
that it may "loose" even what it has already gained. North Korea 
is also clearly aware that the United States has become the only 
"superpower" of the world which will "put its decision into 
practice without fail" once it decides to do so. 
  Second, the acceptance of inspections at the "final stage" 
is 
North Korea's "original strategy." In other words, even after 
North Korea agreed to accept inspections of "seven facilities," 
it is attempting to "gain some more" during negotiations with 
the United States. Judging that nothing can be obtained from 
"seven declared facilities," North Korea made a "strategic 
concession" in order to prepare itself for high-level talks with 
the United States while continuing the dialogue. 
  The article says that another observation which should not 
be 
overlooked is that North Korea agreed on inspections because the 
IAEA made "a certain concession," as revealed by North Korean 
Councilor Yun Ho-chin. If this is true, the article says, the 
IAEA might have decided to apply special regulations only to 
North Korea, not the "general regulation" which is applied to 
all IAEA members, thus leaving room for "making an issue" among 
its member states. 
  The article stresses that North Korea's acceptance of 
inspections is significant because it "halted the two trains 
dashing toward each other" but it is only the "beginning" of the 
North Korean nuclear issue because more thoroughgoing 
negotiations should be held between North Korea and the United 
States and between North Korea and the IAEA in order to ensure 
"transparency" of the North Korean nuclear issue through 
"special inspections" of two undeclared facilities in Yongbyon. 
  The paper publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk entitled "The 
United States Is Embarrassed by the Entanglement of Its Policy 
on North Korea." The article says that although the United 
States "immediately" announced a statement on 15 February 
"welcoming" North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections, it 
cannot conceal its "embarrassment" for the "abrupt entanglement" 
of its policies on North Korea, noting that the United States, 
judging that North Korea would not accept inspections until the 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 February, worked out 
"concrete measures" for economic sanctions against North Korea 
by referring the inspection issue to the UN Security Council. 
  The article says that the U.S. embarrassment is shown by its 
difficulty in deciding whether it would deploy Patriot missiles 
to the ROK or not and it has stated that an "urgent revision to 
the plan" to stage the 1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise 
is "necessary" in the event that the IAEA inspection team visits 
North Korea in the future. The article says that the United 
States should also make a "difficult diplomatic reversal" of its 
discussions with permanent member states of the UN Security 
Council because it had already discussed with them "sanctions 
against North Korea." 
  On the other hand, the article goes on to say that the U.S. 
Government believes that a series of such "hardline measures" 
have had the effect of making North Korea accept nuclear 
inspections. However, it also thinks that a "drastic revision" 
in the direction of its policies toward North Korea will be 
necessary. The article notes that it is likely that the United 
States will strongly demand that North Korea accept the 
inspection of "two undeclared nuclear facilities" in addition to 
the issue of exchanging special envoys between North and South 
Korea. The article says that whether the United States will 
deploy Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula or not, even 
after North Korea accepts nuclear inspection, will become "a 
point of contention" between the United States and North Korea. 
  The paper published on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial 
entitled 
"The North's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection Is Only the 
Beginning." Noting North Korea's acceptance of inspections as 
"fortunate," the editorial says that this is only a "clue" to 
the solution of the problem and that North Korea will demand 
discussions of "economic assistance and improved relations" by 
holding the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks. 
The paper stresses that a "satisfactory result" should be 
brought about by the IAEA inspection and "peaceful use" of North 
Korean nuclear facilities must be "confirmed." The editorial 
also emphasizes that "practical dialogue" between the North and 
the South should be held before the issues of suspending the 
Team Spirit exercise and of holding high-level U.S.-North Korea 
talks are discussed.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- With North Korea's 
acceptance of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), Pyongyang and Washington on Tuesday began 
to discuss holding a third round of high-level talks in March. 
  Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for 
Asian and Pacific affairs, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of the 
North Korean mission to the United Nations, met at UN 
headquarters in New York Tuesday shortly after North Korea's 
acceptance of inspections was announced. Their discussion 
focused mainly on possible suspension of "Team Spirit," the 
annual South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise, and holding the 
third round of high-level talks, but details of their talks were 
not immediately known. 
  Diplomatic sources here said that North Korea notified the 
United States of its willingness to cooperate in allowing access 
to an IAEA inspection team, and that Pyongyang urged Washington 
to suspend Team Spirit and push ahead with the third round of 
high-level talks. 
  Washington clarified that it would suspend this year's Team 
Spirit and hold further talks with Pyongyang on condition that 
inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging special envoys be resumed, 
according to the sources. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said 
at a regular briefing on Tuesday that the third round of 
high-level talks between the United States and North Korea would 
be held if satisfactory IAEA inspections were completed and if 
inter-Korean dialogue on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula was resumed at an early date. He added that it is 
impossible to say exactly what caused North Korea to change its 
stance on nuclear inspections.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States met at the conference room of the United Nations 
headquarters here Tuesday to discuss the exact content of 
Pyongyang's agreement with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) on nuclear inspections, and holding a third round 
of high-level talks. 
  Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the 
United Nations, explained Pyongyang and the IAEA's agreement to 
Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian 
and Pacific affairs, who welcomed the accord. 
  C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the State 
Department, and Han Song-yol, councilor of the North Korean 
mission to the world body, accompanied Hubbard and Ho. 
  Details of the working-level talks were not known 
immediately, but diplomatic sources here said that the two sides 
agreed to continue meeting to negotiate the third round of 
high-level talks. The U.S. side emphasized, however, that a key 
precondition of the high-level talks is the IAEA's satisfaction 
with the results of its inspection of North Korean nuclear 
sites, according to the sources. After the talks on Tuesday, Ho 
said, "We will continue meeting (with the United States)." 
  Sources expected the two sides to discuss the agenda, dates 
and preconditions of the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
high-level talks through frequent meetings in New York. 
  Hubbard said he welcomed North Korea's acceptance of the 
IAEA 
inspections, but added that Tuesday's working-level talks are no 
more than a small departure. 
  Ho said, "Today's talks were held in a friendly and 
productive atmosphere. I don't think there is any tension 
caused by the nuclear problem. The tension has been created by 
the United States and press of the West."

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Ronald 
Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, left 
for North Korea on Tuesday (EST) as Pyongyang offered to accept 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities, a 
congressional source said. Dellums "left for North Korea 
today," said the source, who is well versed in Korean affairs. 
Asked over the phone if the congressman had left for Pyongyang, 
his press secretary said, "I can neither confirm nor deny it." 
  The secretary said he had been told to refrain from making 
any comments on news reports of Dellums' visit to North Korea, 
adding that the congressman would not comment on the reports 
now. The congressional source said the schedule for Dellums' 
visit was delayed somewhat because North Korea was late in 
advising him of the date of arrival in Pyongyang, seemingly 
because of preparations for Kim Chong-il's birthday celebration. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES reported Tuesday that Dellums would fly 
to 
Seoul first and then proceed to Pyongyang through Panmunjom, 
quoting a State Department source.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- A visit by U.S. 
House Armed Services Committee chairman Ronald Dellums to North 
Korea should be viewed as a stride toward solution of the 
nuclear issue, as well as toward eventual arms reduction on the 
Korean peninsula, congressional security analysts say. North 
Korea could use the U.S. congressman's visit as an opportunity 
to renew its demand that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea, 
according to the analysts. Because Dellums' visit has been 
delayed, some within the government have expressed doubt that 
the trip would take place at all, they said. 
  It was North Korea, however, that invited Dellums to visit, 
and preparations for party secretary Kim Chong-il's birthday 
celebration must have caused Pyongyang's lateness in advising 
the congressmen when to come, they stressed. 
  Noting that Washington and Pyongyang had met recently in New 
York and elsewhere with the deadline in the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's (IAEA) standoff with North Korea just a week 
away, they said the North Koreans and Dellums would make a final 
decision on the latter's visit if the contacts produced a 
favorable result. Therefore, they did not rule out the 
possibility that Rep. Dellums would cancel his visit if the 
Washington-Pyongyang contacts proceeded unfavorably. But they 
predicted he would make the visit, though somewhat later than 
scheduled, in view of Washington and Pyongyang's present 
relations. 
  One of the congressional security analysts said the Seoul 
Government should watch a visit by Dellums closely because he is 
a congressional dove in dealing with North Korea. 
  In Pyongyang, he said, House Armed Services Committee 
chairman Dellums would meet President Kim Il-song, Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam and People's Armed Forces Minister O 
Chin-u, with Seoul needing to take special note of these 
meetings. It is highly likely that if these meetings are held, 
both sides will raise the issue of arms reduction on the Korean 
peninsula, including the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea 
that North Korea has so determinedly pursued on the strength of 
its nuclear arms development program. In that case, the focus 
of Washington-Pyongyang contacts would shift from Pyongyang's 
nuclear program to more fundamental issues related to the future 
of the Korean peninsula. This scenario would require a smooth 
solution to the nuclear issue and improved U.S.-North Korea 
relations as prerequisites. 
  If Seoul felt alienated by an improved U.S.-North Korean 
relationship, problems would emerge in its ties with Washington, 
the congressional analyst said, voicing doubt that Seoul could 
cope effectively with such a change. 
  A recent U.S. General Accounting Office report on the North 
Korean nuclear problem says that if South Korean military 
leaders have doubts about President Kim Yong-sam's policy on 
this issue, South Korea could be plunged into political unrest. 
  South Korea is concerned that it could be alienated by 
American diplomacy toward North Korea on the nuclear issue, 
dealing a blow to its North Korea policy, according to the 
report. 
  A visit by Dellums should be viewed as important not only to 
the nuclear issue, but also to the far-reaching issue of 
security on the Korean peninsula, the congressional analysts 
said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 16 
February carry articles speculating on the purpose and 
background of the purported visit to Pyongyang by Representative 
Ronald V. Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 16 February carries on page 
3 
a 1,200-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim 
Sung-yong entitled "To Play a Messenger's Role To Ascertain `the 
North's Intent' First-Hand." The article notes that Dellums' 
visit is made with 21 February, the supposed deadline for North 
Korea to accept IAEA inspections, only a few days away, and 
adds: "Many hold expectations that he will play the role of 
messenger to make a first-hand ascertainment of the North Korean 
leadership and to precisely convey the U.S. position, though his 
visit may not directly offer a key to resolving the issue." The 
article then notes: "There is a possibility that North Korea 
may try to use Dellums' visit as a propaganda opportunity to 
stress its rationale for its present position." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 16 February carries on page 3 a 
1,300-word article by New York-based correspondent Kim Su-chong 
entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services 
Committee Visiting Pyongyang?." The article notes optimistic 
expectations held by some that "Chairman Dellums' visit to 
Pyongyang could contribute to the resolution of the North Korean 
nuclear issue." The article then notes: "The United States 
could send a letter from President Clinton to Kim Il-song or 
explain the atmosphere of the U.S. Government and Congress to 
the North Korean ruler." The article then observes that 
"Dellums likes to utter the theme `peace is my passion,' and 
Pyongyang might have interpreted it to represent a personal 
trait, making it easier for him to generously appreciate 
Pyongyang's position, according to one analysis." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 16 February carries on 
page 
3 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim 
Hak-sun entitled "Why Is the Chairman of the U.S. House Armed 
Services Committee Visiting Pyongyang?--The `Final Mediator' for 
the North Korean Nuclear Issue--`In-Depth Dialogue' May Be 
Possible as a Dove." The article begins by noting the 
significance of Chairman Dellums' visit to Pyongyang in light of 
the possibility that he is carrying a personal letter from 
President Clinton and in light of his position in Congress and 
his capacity to precisely convey the U.S. position to the North 
Korean authorities. The article then notes, "The fact that he 
is one of the most moderate doves in the U.S. Congress might 
give North Korea credibility." The article then notes: "It is 
not certain whom Chairman Dellums will meet when he goes to 
Pyongyang, but because he will probably be carrying a letter 
from President Clinton, he may well be meeting President Kim 
Il-song. President Kim Il-song will probably make extra efforts 
to heartily welcome him, according to Washington's North Korean 
experts."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Assistant Foreign 
Minister Choe Tong-chin said Wednesday there has been no talk of 
resuming inter-Korean dialogue, but he expected action by 
Pyongyang shortly as it is a prerequisite to a third round of 
high-level North Korea-U.S. talks. Choe cautiously predicted 
resumption of inter-Korean dialogue, while elaborating on the 
surprise news that Pyongyang had agreed to full-scale nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
a government-party meeting at the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) 
headquarters. 
  An IAEA inspection team may leave for Pyongyang as soon as 
this weekend, Choe reported to party policy-makers. 
  Under a previous agreement worked out at talks in New York 
last December, North Korea can begin the third round of 
high-level talks with the United States only when it makes 
significant progress in inter-Korean relations such as an 
exchange of envoys, Choe explained. 
  The third Pyongyang-Washington talks will touch on a wide 
range of issues including North Korea's complete return to the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, sincere implementation of the 
declaration on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and improvement 
of bilateral relations in the political, economic and security 
areas, he said. 
  With its acceptance of IAEA inspections, Pyongyang is 
expected to open dialogue channels with the United States, South 
Korea and the UN nuclear watchdog, he added. 
  Choe declined to comment on whether North Korea has agreed 
to 
the special inspections repeatedly requested by the IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The government on 
Wednesday embarked on preparing a concrete strategy to promote 
the South-North dialogue now that North Korea has disclosed the 
willingness to accept inspections of its nuclear facilities by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). An initial 
strategy meeting was held at the office of South-North dialogue 
under the chair of Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae on 
Wednesday afternoon. 
  No contents of the talks were formally disclosed. But, a 
government source said the attendees decided to try to resume 
the deadlocked working-level talks at the earliest possible date 
with an aim to materialize the exchange of special envoys next 
month. 
  The strategy will be further reviewed by a 
unification-related ministers meeting to be presided over by 
Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday, the source said. 
  At Wednesday's meeting, the source said, it was decided that 
the South would propose to resume the working-level talks if 
North Korea does not offer it first within next week. 
  The Seoul government hopes to resume the working-level talks 
suspended since last October toward the close of this month or 
early next month, he said. 
  If North Korea proposes the resumption of the talks first, 
the South plans to cope with it flexibly even if North Korea 
offers a meeting other than the exchange of special envoys, the 
source said. 
  At the moment, however, there is no change in the government 
policy to materialize the exchange of special envoys at the 
earliest possible date, the source said. 
  "We plan to promote South-North working-level contacts early 
so as to facilitate the first-round exchange of special envoys 
next month if possible," a government official said. 
  Saying that officials of related government offices like the 
National Unification Board have begun to work out a strategy for 
the resumption of the South-North dialogue, he said the Seoul 
government may be the first to propose the exchange of special 
envoys depending on the attitude of North Korea. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
secretary for foreign affairs and national security, said, "We 
expect working-level talks will be resumed to discuss the 
proposed exchange of special envoys soon after the International 
Atomic Energy Agency began inspection of North Korean 
facilities." 
  It has already been agreed that when IAEA begins inspection, 
an inter-Korean working-level contact would take place before 
long, Chong said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
studying suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military 
exercise "Team Spirit" this year in the wake of North Korea's 
acceptance of outside inspection of its nuclear facilities. One 
Defense Ministry source said Wednesday that the government had 
decided earlier to hold Team Spirit if the North Korean nuclear 
issue was not resolved. Since Pyongyang has said it will allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct 
inspections, however, the government can consider suspending the 
exercise, he said. 
  Team Spirit could be suspended if it contributed to 
resolution of the nuclear issue and stability on the Korean 
peninsula, the official said, requesting anonymity. But there 
is still a possibility that North Korea is employing delaying 
tactics in its negotiations with the IAEA to force postponement 
of Team Spirit beyond March, when the exercise was originally 
scheduled, he said. The government, therefore, will make a 
final decision on Team Spirit after watching developments in the 
North Korean-IAEA negotiations, the official said. 
  In other words, the government will wait until the IAEA 
concludes that it can maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards 
in North Korea before making a final decision on the exercise, 
he said. South Korea and the United States are expected to make 
a joint announcement on Team Spirit at the end of this month or 
in early March, the official added.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Myong-hwa] </F>
  [Text] North Korea is celebrating the cloistered country's 
No. 2 man's birthday, Feb. 16, in a less flamboyant manner 
compared with his previous birthday parties, a development 
raising speculation about his position and future. The 
Stalinist country's newspapers, radio stations and televisions 
are still engaged in the campaign to inculcate loyalty in the 
people toward Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of the North's 
supreme leader Kim Il-song. It is reported, however, that 
various celebrations this year are being held mostly on a 
domestic basis and on a smaller scale. 
  The small scale of the celebration has surprised many South 
Korean experts on North Korea affairs. After no clear step was 
taken for a power transfer from the aging leader Kim Il-song to 
Chong-il at the Workers' (Communist) Party central committee 
meeting and the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1993, 
many analysts in Seoul said that Pyongyang was highly likely to 
announce a final power transfer schedule around Kim Chong-il's 
birthday this year. 
  Their predictions were based on the North Korean news 
media's 
sudden spate of reports beginning late last year that the junior 
Kim had joined the party central committee in 1964 and was 
designation on his father's heir in early 1974. 
  Churning out those reports, the North's media announced that 
the junior Kim would mark the 30th anniversary of his political 
debut as well as the 20th anniversary of his heir-designation on 
his 52nd birthday in February 1994. 
  The gist of the so-called "February final power transfer 
schedule" is that an important turning point for the resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear issue will be issued in the name of 
Kim Chong-il and that concrete plans for Kim Il-song to hand 
over the presidency or party general secretaryship to his son 
will be made public on that day, according to North Korea 
observers here. 
  Recently, however, the thorny North Korean nuclear problem 
seems to be dragging on with no signs of easing tensions on the 
Korean Peninsula. Also, there are no clear-cut indications that 
the junior Kim will consolidate his position around his birthday. 
  Under these circumstances, some analysts even wonder if the 
junior Kim may be facing a crisis. 
  In North Korea, the period from Feb. 16 to April 15, Kim 
Il-song's birthday, has been designated the "Loyalty Festival 
Period" since 1976, when the junior Kim's birthday joined his 
father's as a national holiday. During this period, all North 
Koreans are mobilized to participate in various congratulatory 
events across the country. Among major events held or now under 
way are the fourth 2.16 [February 16] Arts Award, the Athletic 
Championship for the Mt. Paektu Award, and the third National 
Exhibition on Youth Science and Technology. 
  As a prelude to the celebrations, the 2.16 Arts Award opened 
Jan. 18 and its preliminary contests are under way. Korean 
musicians in the instrumental and vocal music fields from at 
home and abroad usually compete with one another. This year, 
however, overseas Koreans were barred from attending, thereby 
remarkably downsizing the congratulatory event. 
  "Annual events are being held there as scheduled, but on a 
noticeably smaller scale," a high-ranking official at the 
National Unification Board (NUB) said early this week. He 
added, however, that he would not jump to the conclusion that 
the downscaling has some political implications related to Kim 
Chong-il's status. 
  In 1993, with Pyongyang heavily bent on escalating the cult 
of the junior Kim, the streets of Pyongyang were bedecked with 
2,160,000 flowers of various kinds to represent his birthday, 
Feb. 16. Radio Pyongyang reported at the time that the city 
authorities had been busy cultivating these flowers for the past 
several months. All gardeners in the country were mobilized to 
prepare for the birthday festivity. 
  In sharp contrast, the Administration Council, the North's 
cabinet, simply ordered flower gardens to be trimmed and ditches 
to be cleared in downtown Pyongyang late last month. 
  As of Monday morning,the northern side of the South-North 
Liaison Office at the truce village of Panmunjom had not 
informed its southern counterpart of any decision to close its 
operation for the Kim Chong-il birthday celebration. It has 
been customary for the North to inform the South liaison 
officials of a closure two days before the birthday, the NUB 
official said, adding that the lack of an announcement suggests 
this year's celebration of the junior Kim's birthday has been 
scaled down.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports from the vernacular press published on 16 February 
pertaining to U.S. Defense Department's long-range plan to 
reduce U.S. Forces in the ROK. 
  The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean carries a 
600-word report by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun 
under the headline, "50 Percent of U.S. Ground Forces in the ROK 
Are To Be Reduced Under Long-Range Plan--Research and 
Development Expenses for F-16 Included in U.S. Defense Budget." 
  The report writes that in an annual defense report to 
Congress, the U.S. Defense Department revealed that the U.S. 
ground forces in the ROK consisting of two brigades will be 
reduced to one brigade. However, the Defense Department is also 
reviewing "a possibility of deploying more military equipment in 
the ROK in order to promote capabilities of coping with a U.S. 
crisis." 
  The report stresses that "the research and development 
expenses" for F-16 fighters, which the ROK decided to introduce 
as "the next-generation fighters" will be increased every year 
until fiscal year 1996. The report then gives details of the 
amounts of these expenses to be increased each year. 
  The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean 
publishes 
on page 3 a 500-word article by Washington-based correspondent 
Chong Yon-chu, with the headline "Additional Deployment of 
Weapons Reviewed--the U.S. Defense Report." 
  Noting that the United States is planning to reduce the 
scale 
of U.S. ground forces in the ROK from two brigades to one 
brigade on a long-range basis, the article says that the U.S. 
Defense Department pointed out in its annual report to the 
President and the Congress that "because of North Korea's 
continued threat, the United States has frozen the withdrawal of 
U.S. Forces from the ROK, and is modernizing military power of 
the ROK and U.S. Forces in the ROK." The report also reveals 
that "the U.S. Defense Department is reviewing a possibility of 
deploying more military equipment in the ROK in a bid to enhance 
its capabilities of dealing with the crisis situation." 
  The article says that according to the report, the budget 
for 
purchase of F-16 fighters will be "reduced" each year except 
1996 but the "budget for modernization of fighters will be 
somewhat increased beginning in 1994." The article then gives a 
detailed amount of the budget for the purchase of F-16 fighters 
and for their modernization each year.

  [Text] The 120 updated F-16 fighter aircraft South Korea 
is to introduce under the Korean Fighter Program (KFP) has no 
connection with the used F-16s the Pentagon is reportedly 
planning to sell to allied countries including South Korea, the 
Defense Ministry said yesterday. 
  Commenting on a WALL STREET JOURNAL report that the Pentagon 
is to export various used aircraft and warships to save defense 
costs, a ranking Defense Ministry official said that Seoul has 
at present no plan or intention to buy the used U.S. weaponry. 
  "Especially, the F-16s we are going to buy or co-produce 
under the KFP are the latest model and quite different from the 
old models involved in the report," said the official. 
  The JOURNAL reported in its Monday edition that the U.S. 
government is considering selling 400 F-16s at about $4.8 
billion, an amount that covers the whole KFP project. Also 
included on the sell-off list are C-130 transport aircraft made 
by Lockheed, Boeing KC-135 in-flight tankers, warships, armored 
vehicles and tankers, the JOURNAL said. 
  "The F-16 Fighting Falcons we are going to introduce belong 
to the block/50 category, the latest model which began to be 
manufactured only in 1991, and I hope our people will not 
confuse the F-16s under the KFP with those reportedly in the 
U.S. sell-off list," said the official. 
  Under the KFP to upgrade the Air Force, South Korea is to 
buy 
12 finished F-16s by April 1995, assemble 36 and produce 72 
others under license from Lockheed by 1999.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO in 
Korean on 16 February publishes on page 5 a 1,500-word article 
by reporter Yun Sun-hwan, entitled "U.S.-Japan Trade Friction 
and Its Affect on ROK--Yen Value Is Soaring...`A Green Signal' 
for ROK Export." 
  Explaining that the skyrocketing of the value of the yen in 
foreign exchange markets in Tokyo and in New York is an 
"aftereffect" of the U.S.-Japan "trade war," the article says 
that the trade conflict between the two nations increases 
"tension" and thus people pay attention to what "aftereffects" 
will be brought to our country's exports to the United States 
and to our "overall economy." Predicting that the United States 
will maintain the current high-yen-value foreign exchange policy 
until Japan guarantees its policy to reduce its "black figures" 
in trade with the United States, the article says that the "high 
value of the yen" will likely give "benefits" to our enterprises 
in the export of their products to the United States. The 
article points out that with a high yen value, the sale of 
Japanese automobiles in U.S. markets has been "reduced" and 
taking advantage of this, the ROK automobiles are "encroaching 
upon" Japan's markets to "a considerable extent." When the 
United States actually takes "concrete trade retaliation" 
against Japan, exports of our "major export items" including 
automobiles, semiconductors and computers, to the United States 
are expected to "expand." 
  The article stresses that U.S.-Japan trade conflict may also 
result in "great burdens" that our country can hardly endure 
because the United States regards the ROK as "a second Japan," 
and points to "differences" claimed by the United States and our 
country in calculating black figures in trade last year between 
the two countries. 
  The article adds that our enterprises pay the "keenest 
attention" to whether the U.S. Trade Law Super 301, which makes 
"indiscriminate trade retaliation" possible, will be "revived" 
or not, noting that if this is revived, not only Japan but also 
our country will suffer "great damages." The article notes that 
if our country is designated as an "unfair trade state," the 
United States will "drastically increase" tariffs on automobiles 
and other items manufactured by our country and, thus, will take 
"retaliatory action" as freely as it wants. 
  The article notes that major domestic business groups and 
relevant organizations began to analyze the "effects" resulting 
from U.S. "sanctions" against Japan and from the "skyrocketing 
yen value" to our "export front," believing that the U.S. trade 
retaliation against Japan is "imminent."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The government and the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party have agreed on the need to 
prepare the country for an inflow of Japanese cultural products 
in the face of internationalization and market opening, though 
these trends are not the critical factor in light of the present 
national sentiment against Japan. The agreement, reached at a 
joint government-party meeting held on Tuesday, is considered a 
change from Seoul's policy against imports of Japanese culture, 
especially music and films. 
  Culture and Sports Minister Yi Min-sop represented the 
government at the joint meeting, while Rep. Paek Nam-chi spoke 
for the party in his capacity as chief policy coordinator. 
Emerging from the meeting, Paek said President Kim Yong-sam 
would not say anything about opening the arts market to Japan 
during his summit with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo 
next month. Opening the arts market to Japan is not a matter of 
consideration in view of the national sentiment against the 
Japanese today, he added. 
  "But we've agreed that the nation should make all necessary 
preparations for the inflow of Japanese arts to ride the 
internationalization and market opening trends," he said. 
  The government and the ruling party also agreed to demolish 
the former Japanese colonial government building in Seoul as 
scheduled, though this has drawn both praise and criticism from 
the public.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The northern sea routes 
between South Korea and China as well as South Korea and Russia 
will be opened to all shipping companies next year, the Maritime 
and Port Administration (MAPA) said on Tuesday. At present, the 
route between Korea and Russia is open only to Far Eastern 
Shipping Corp. (FESCO) of Russia and Hyundai Merchant Marine 
Corp. of Korea. FESCO operates one ship on the route and 
Hyundai runs two vessels. The route between Korea and China is 
open only to joint-venture shipping companies between the two 
countries. 
  MAPA has barred other shipping companies from using the 
routes because Russian and Chinese shipping companies collect 
far lower charges than Korean lines. With the decision, 
shipping companies from any country that meet certain 
qualifications will be permitted to operate between Korea and 
China and between Korea and Russia next year. They will also be 
allowed to transport cargo or containers from Russia or China to 
the United States or Europe via Korea. 
  Charges are expected to drop considerably as many shipping 
companies start plying the routes, and transportation of cargo 
will become easier. The move is aimed at activating sea 
transportation in Northeast Asia, a MAPA official said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Sang-hun] </F>
  [Text] Tunisia is seeking South Korean expertise in the 
high-tech fields of biotechnology, nuclear research techniques 
and computer and information technology, said a top science 
administrator from the North African country. 
  "South Korea has done a lot in acquiring advanced Western 
technologies and we want to learn from their experience and see 
what Koreans could do for our high-tech efforts," said Monji 
Safra in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD yesterday. 
  The Tunisian secretary of state to the prime minister in 
charge of scientific research and technology is here on a 
three-day visit to prepare a general agreement on science and 
technological cooperation with South Korea. He met with Science 
and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and other South Korean 
officials and heads of research institutes to discuss such an 
agreement yesterday. 
  Safra named biotechnology, nuclear research and computers as 
potential sectors for bilateral technological cooperation. 
  "We want to see what our biotechnology centers could do in 
joint efforts with their South Korean counterparts to improve 
seeds and increase agricultural productivity," he said. 
  Tunisia also has an ambition of becoming the chief provider 
of computer software for Arab and African countries, especially 
software adopted for the needs of small businesses. The country 
is investing heavily in telecommunications. For example, it is 
interested in developing software needed to monitor satellites 
because one of the Arabsats is monitored from Tunis, Safra said. 
The Tunisian official also said his country is planning its 
first nuclear research center to promote the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology for medical, agricultural and industrial 
purposes. 
  "And we hope South Korea will help us by sending experts to 
give us advice on building nuclear laboratories, which are 
urgently needed," he said. 
  Although some private South Korean companies are already 
operating in Tunisia, Safra's visit marks the first big 
commitment to establish bilateral technological ties at an 
official level. 
  During his stay here, Safra visited Taedok Science Town and 
six research institutes, including the Korea Institute of 
Science and Technology, to discuss an exchange of researchers. 
  Korea International Cooperation Agency has agreed to offer 
three scholarships for Tunisian researchers to attend seminars 
and study in research institutes here. 
  "This cooperation on the official level will certainly help 
lay the foundation for more cooperation in the private sector," 
Safra said. 
  Samsung is already in Tunisia assembling microcomputers and 
Goldstar is producing household electric appliances there. 
  For foreign investors, there could be little doubt about the 
importance of Tunisia's geographical location, Safra said. The 
North African region has 60 million people and Europe is 
directly across the Mediterranean Sea. 
  "By being in Tunisia, foreign companies will be in a 
position 
not only to expand into the North African market but also to use 
it as a gateway to the European market," Safra said. 
  Tunisia plans to open two free trade zones this year where 
foreign investors can work without any taxes and use cheap local 
labor on a contract basis so that they will not have to pay 
social taxes or comply with local labor regulations. As long as 
the local value added is more than 40 percent of the value of a 
product, the product is considered Tunisian, and almost all 
Tunisian products get free access to the European market except 
for a few agricultural products. 
  Safra leaves the country today. His visit here included a 
meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, where he said 
he made clear his country's position that every country in the 
world, including North Korea, must allow nuclear inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tunisia is a 
member of the board of IAEA.

  [Text] The government has decided to retain the right to 
levy tariffs on 250 import items, including textiles, footwear 
and glass, either in proportion to their value or volume, the 
Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
  The option to impose ad valorem rates or special rates in 
proportion to volume on the 250 imports will be contained in the 
country schedule of tariffs the government is scheduled to 
submit to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today, the 
ministry said. 
  Special rates applied in proportion to volume can be applied 
to control imports of low-priced textiles, footwear and other 
products from developing countries in particular. 
  Currently, the government applies special rates on 21 types 
of film for movie production in proportion to import volume. 
  In the tariff schedule on the trade of agricultural 
products, 
industrial products and services, the government will commit 
itself to the reduction of agricultural subsidies from 1,718.6 
billion won in what is called the total aggregate measurement of 
support to 1,490 billion won in 2004, said the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 
  During the 1989-91 base years, the total aggregate 
measurement of support amounted to 1,568.4 billion won for rice 
production, 52.3 billion won for barley production, 72.9 billion 
won for soybean production, 22.6 billion won for corn production 
and 2.4 million for rape seed production. 
  In the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, which 
were concluded Dec. 15 last year, the government committed 
itself to the opening of the domestic agricultural market to 
imports and tariff cuts. Under the Uruguay Round, Korea will 
have to increase its rice imports from 1 percent of its needs in 
1995 to 4 percent in 2004. The government is required to open 
the domestic market wider for other agricultural products, beef, 
pork and chicken through tariffication, quota increases and 
liberalization. 
  During the 10 years from next year, the government will have 
to cut the average concessionary tariff rates on industrial and 
fishery products from 17.9 percent in the 1986 base year to 8.1 
percent in 2004. 
  With applied rates standing 7.9 percent now, the Ministry of 
Finance said, the scheduled concessionary tariff cut will have 
little impact on Korea's imports. 
  Applied rates on only 10 nonferrous metals are now higher 
than concessionary rates, or rates the government will commit 
itself to in its country schedule of tariffs to be submitted to 
the GATT, the ministry said. 
  The government will also commit itself to reducing tariffs 
on 
128 items in 10 sectors, including steel, construction equipment 
and agricultural machinery, to zero rate during the next 15 
years. 
  As a result of tariff cuts and removal, the ministry said, 
revenues from import duties will begin to decline in 1998.

<F P=106> [By Kim Chun-pom] </F>
  [Text] The military has undergone painful changes and 
reforms since the new government was inaugurated and it is 
getting a new look. 
  The following are the major changes made in the military 
over 
the past year: The establishment of an atmosphere for 
discussions in military camps; the disbanding of the officers 
wives associations; the increase of personnel driving their cars 
as opposed to using chauffeurs; the establishment of a 
self-regulating leave system; the removal of unnecessary 
paperwork; proper guidance for environmental protection; and the 
reduction of the military office of protocol at Kimpo Airport. 
  Among these changes, the new system for the smooth 
communication between officers and enlisted men in military 
camps presents a striking contrast to the past authoritarianism. 
The Army, Navy, and Air Force frequently hold various 
get-togethers and forums ranging from staff officers meetings to 
soldiers free discussions, with an unprecedented activeness in 
helping facilitate smooth verbal communication between officers 
and enlisted men. 
  Participants of these meetings freely express their own 
opinions, in contrast to the past when both officers and 
enlisted men could hardly put their thoughts into words because 
they were studying their officers' faces. Soldiers came to 
often sharply point out their commanders' merits and demerits. 
  The military authorities explain: An atmosphere for free 
discussions has been vitalized mainly because most soldiers were 
born in or after the seventies, when the country was rapidly 
growing, and belong to the new generation and because over 80 
percent of them are high school or upper secondary school 
graduates. 
  As the officers wives associations, which had played the 
role 
of channel for asking personnel favors among military officers, 
has completely been disbanded over the past year, the phrase in 
vogue "A colonel's wife is a general" has become an archaic 
saying. 
  Activities of the wives associations led by the wives of the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force chiefs of staff included some positive 
ones. They supported helpless people and paid visits of inquiry 
to soldiers. The associations, however, were disbanded and 
their official activities have been completed forbidden since 
last year when it was revealed that they influenced military 
reshuffles. At present, the Navy and Air Force strictly control 
all visits to the chief of staff office by the officers and 
their wives. As the system of assigning some soldiers as 
chauffeurs for generals was removed last year, their families 
and even generals drive their cars when they are using them for 
unofficial purposes, creating an increase of personnel driving 
their cars instead of using chauffeurs. 
  Despite the military service regulations' guarantee for 
leave, officers and soldiers could not take their leave in the 
past, because they had to read their commanders' mind. "Taking 
leave by reading their commanders' mind" has became 
old-fashioned these days, because most officers and soldiers 
seems to believe that taking their leave is a kind of the 
continuity their work performance. 
  For an example, Cho Kun-hae, chief of the Air Force, could 
not take his summer leave last year, but most of his staff 
members enjoyed their leave without reading their chief's mind. 
  Red tape, which has been regarded as a traditional bad habit 
of the administrative organization, has been gradually improved. 
The Army, Air Force, and Navy have set up computer networks and 
computer terminals in their military units to reduce 
inefficiency of their administrative activities caused by the 
excessive work needed to prepare many documents. They have 
decided to gradually expand the method of approval through 
computers. 
  The Army's understanding of the environmental pollution 
issue, which was neglected by people over the past years, has 
been largely changed. As a result, the Army has recently set up 
a new section, which will mainly deal with environmental issues, 
to actively participate in preparing for the prevention of air 
pollution. It has set up space to separately collect garbage 
and to recycle the used resources and has established a sewage 
disposal plant. 
  Moreover, the Defense Ministry has largely cut the size of 
the military protocol office at Kimpo Airport. This office has 
created the social disharmony between the people and the Army by 
giving priority seating in airplanes to military personnel and 
in clearing customs at Kimpo Airport. Accordingly, it has 
closed the VIP room in the domestic airline waiting room. The 
VIP room at the international airline waiting room is being 
operated by a small number of military personnel.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] will strengthen its 
monitoring of inspectors of the three financial supervisory 
organizations to root out irregularities alleged to be prevalent 
between auditors and financial services companies. The MOF also 
asked the Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory 
Board and the Insurance Supervisory Board to regularly gather 
opinions from financial institutions on the attitude of 
inspectors. 
  If inspectors are found to have been engaged in such 
irregularities as receiving kickbacks, influence-peddling and 
favoritism, they will be subject to disciplinary action, the MOF 
said. 
  Heads of the three supervisory organizations will be 
directly 
involved in weeding out unethical and rule-breaking inspectors, 
the MOF said. Auditing departments will be under the direct 
control of the heads of these regulatory organizations. 
  The MOF yesterday unveiled a program to reform financial 
market supervisory system as complaints have been growing over 
the attitude of financial inspectors. The action also follows a 
directive from Chongwadae last year, which called on the MOF to 
come up with ways of reforming the nation's financial 
supervisory organizations. But many analysts said the reform 
move may discourage inspectors from safeguarding the soundness 
of the financial system. 
  When inspectors show an arrogant and high-handed attitude in 
their inspection of financial institutions, they will face 
reprimands, it said. 
  To root out irregularities, the MOF has called on the 
supervisory organizations to stop engaging in "inspections for 
revelation or demonstration purposes," it said. The focus of 
the supervision will be placed on helping financial institutions 
improve their managerial performance or to take preventive 
action, the MOF said. 
  Regulators will limit their inspections mostly to head 
offices and inspection of branches will be made on an 
exceptional basis. Inspectors will be discouraged from making 
personal visits to financial institutions and instead they will 
devote their auditing to combing through documents the MOF said. 
  The three supervisory organizations will develop computer 
systems to expand document-oriented inspections of financial 
institutions, the MOF said. Regulators will no longer specify 
the degree of punitive action against junior staffers who are 
found to have violated rules. Instead, they will notify 
financial institutions of staffers who violate rules and permit 
financial institutions to take their action at them. 
  The regulatory agencies will be told to bolster the function 
of units which solve complaints from consumers. For scientific 
and rational audits, inspectors will be given the opportunity to 
go overseas to observe practices in foreign supervisory 
organizations, the MOF said. 
  The three supervisory organizations will soon initiate 
revamping of their units and structures for raising the degree 
of efficiency and modernization the supervisory system. 
  The MOF's assistant finance minister will meet each month 
with heads of the three financial supervisory organizations.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
semiconductor industry began this year with an unprecendented 
increase in exports, the Korean Semiconductor Industry 
Association and other business sources said on Tuesday. Global 
demand for semiconductors continued to rise early this year and 
exports of South Korean semiconductors soared last month. 
Exports are expected to increase further in the second half of 
this year when full-fledged exports of 16 mega DRAMs [dynamic 
random access memory] begin. 
  Samsung Electronics Co. exported 248 million U.S. dollars 
worth of semiconductors in January, up 82.3 percent from a year 
ago. The figure marks Samsung's biggest export rate increase on 
a monthly comparison basis since 1990. 
  Semiconductor exports by Goldstar Electron Co. increased 
48.6 
percent from 74 million dollars in January last year to 110 
million dollars last month. 
  Hyundai Electronic Co., which produces semiconductors mainly 
by assembling parts on already designed wafers, expanded its 
integrated processing production system which includes design, 
wafer processing and assembly this year to increase the added 
value of its exports. Hyundai exported 83 million dollars worth 
of semiconductors in January this year, up 73 percent from 48 
million dollars a year earlier. Hyundai's proportion of 
integrated processing exports to exports of assembled 
semiconductors was one to two last year, but last month the 
proportion changed to three to one. 
  Anam Electronics Co., which assembles only semiconductors, 
exported 155 million dollars worth last month, up 35.6 percent 
from the same month last year. 
  Korean semiconductor makers plan to invest three trillion 
won 
(about 3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in facility investment this 
year. 
  A business source said, "demand for 4 mega-DRAMs will soar 
to 
the peak this year, and demand for 16 mega-DRAMs will begin to 
increase rapidly from the second half of this year. South 
Korea's semiconductor exports are thus expected to easily 
surpass 10 billion dollars this year."

  [Text] MANILA, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Philippine President Fidel 
Ramos will not apologize to China for meeting President Li 
Teng-hui during the Taiwan leader's four-hour stopover north of 
the capital last week, his spokesman said Tuesday. 
  "Whoever said or recommended that should review the 
One-China 
policy," Press Secretary Jesus Sison said when asked by 
reporters whether Ramos should offer an apology. [sentence as 
received] 
  "President Ramos and the Philippine government have not done 
anything to violate the provision of the One-China policy. The 
president of Taiwan came here only for four hours and it was all 
about trade and investment. We see nothing wrong there," he 
added. 
  The Chinese foreign ministry and the local embassy here have 
strongly protested Li's low-profile visit on Wednesday at Subic 
Bay Freeport en route to Indonesia and Thailand, saying it was a 
breach of the policy. 
  Ramos, whose late father was a longtime ambassador to 
Taipei, 
secretly slipped out of Manila to welcome Li in Subic. He also 
hosted a luncheon for him and his 40-member delegation of senior 
officials and business leaders. The Philippines has recognized 
the mainland as the ruler of all China since establishing 
diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1975, but has recently 
increased trade contacts with Taipei for economic reasons. 
  Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo on Monday also defended 
Li's 
visit and his meeting with Ramos, saying Beijing should 
understand that the Philippines needs investments from Taiwan at 
a crucial stage when it's economy is taking off. 
  Opposition Senator Francisco Tatad on Monday, however, said 
that even though only economic issues were discussed, Ramos's 
meeting with Li was a "political act" and a violation of the 
One-China policy. 
  Federico Pascual, a columnist with the mass circulation 
Philippine Daily Inquirer, described the visit as a "deliberate 
assault on cordial relations between Manila and Beijing" and 
suggested the two leaders could have discussed economic issues 
without meeting personally. 
  "The two presidents cannot rendezvous in that scandalous 
manner and, when caught in flagrante delicto, insist that they 
do not recognize each other," he wrote. But the TODAY newspaper 
defended Ramos, pointing out in an editorial that the 
Philippines did not give full planeside honors to Li as it 
accords to other visiting foreign leaders. 
  "The surreptitiousness (of the meeting) belies a sovereign 
intent to accord Taiwan a wider diplomatic recognition beyond 
the bare essentials of an economic relationship, that, surely, 
Beijing will not deny us since it enjoys far more of it in 
southern China," the editorial said. "If anyone should feel 
offended, it is Taiwan -- for a meeting that went more like a 
liaison than anything else."

  [Text] Washington, 9 Feb -- The U.S. Government has told 
the Japanese Government that it will not impose sanctions 
against Japan even if it fails to attain the U.S.-proposed 
numerical targets, which are a focal point in the ongoing 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. This was revealed by a

  [Text] Talks to settle outstanding financial claims from 
the Vietnam war days between Hanoi and Washington have been 
postponed until the end of this month. Senior officials of the 
two governments were scheduled to start discussing the claims 
totalling more than 500 million U.S. dollars in Hanoi on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. One reason for postponing the talks was to 
consider whether details of establishing the liaison offices in 
each other's capital should be considered at the same forum.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 16 (KCNA) -- A congratulatory 
message came to the dear leader Marshal Kim Chong-il from the 
Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on his birthday. 
  The message says the dear leader, who was born as the 
lodestar followed by all the people in the battle site in the 
period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle with the soul of Mt. 
Paektu, has performed undying feats for the country and the 
nation, for the history and era with brilliant ideological and 
theoretical activities and outstanding leadership. 
  "Guided by you Marshal Kim Chong-il, genius of the 
revolution 
and construction, our country has demonstrated its might as an 
invincible socialist country and a model of best socialism 
centred on the popular masses," it says, and continues: 
  "Marshal Kim Chong-il with unexcelled grit and iron will 
defended the dignity and security of the socialist homeland of 
chuche and won one great victory after another in political and 
military confrontation with the enemy by declaring a semi-war 
state and taking a decisive step of withdrawing from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty to cope with the moves of the 
imperialists and the reactionaries for isolating and stifling 
our republic." 
  The message notes that the glory and happiness of Chongnyon 
and Koreans in Japan are unthinkable apart from the wise 
guidance and paternal affection of the sagacious leader Marshal 
Kim Chong-il, who is leading them to victory by successfully 
embodying the great leader President Kim Il-song's chuche-based 
idea of the movement of Koreans overseas. 
  It expresses the resolution to vigorously promote the 
modelling of Chongnyon on the chuche idea, strengthen it 
organizationally and ideologically and register greater 
achievements in the efforts for national reunification and all 
other patriotic work, thus making this a year of a new victory 
in the history of the movement of Koreans in Japan. 
  The message wishes Marshal Kim Chong-il good health and long 
life.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The relations between 
Japan and the United States have not yet become matured as 
evidenced by last week's failure to reach a bilateral trade 
agreement, the Japanese ambassador to Washington said Tuesday 
[15 February]. 
  Takakazu Kuriyama told a press conference that mutual 
distrust over setting objective criteria to measure progress in 
opening Japan's markets led to the collapse of the Japan-U.S. 
trade talks last Friday in Washington. 
  "As long as we could not reach an agreement due to a lack of 
trust, it cannot be said that (the relationship) has become one 
of adults," Kuriyama said. 
  Kuriyama said Japan needs to make its markets more open and 
transparent to raise the level of trust in trade "to the same as 
that of politics and securities." 
  Asked what course the two nations are likely to take on the 
trade problems, he said "both sides should make efforts to sit 
down at the negotiating table seriously." 
  Kuriyama also said it is "not appropriate" for the U.S. to 
think of imposing sanctions against Japan only because Japan 
does not make a compromise. 
  The two nations have remained at loggerheads over the 
interpretation of the application of "objective criteria." 
  Washington says such criteria are necessary to measure how 
much Japan's markets will be actually opened to U.S. products. 
  Japan, whose huge trade surplus has long frustrated U.S. 
Governments, rejects setting numerical targets, on the grounds 
that it would go against the principle of free trade and result 
in managed trade. 
  Although the trade talks broke down without agreement on the 
criteria, some Japanese media praised Japan's government's 
stance of rejecting the U.S. demand, saying the two nations' 
relations had "matured" because Japan could finally say "no." 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said at a press 
conference after the talks with President Bill Clinton that "I 
believe and hope that (the U.S.) will not resort to unilateral 
actions that would contravene GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade) rules." 
  U.S. officials have warned, however, of retaliation against 
Japan, such as reviving the "Super 301" provision, before the 
Group of Seven industrial countries convenes its annual summit 
in Naples in early July.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] On 15 February, North Korea officially notified 
that it will accept full-scope [chonmyon] inspection of seven 
nuclear facilities as demanded by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. Therefore, full-scope inspection on North 
Korea is expected to be resumed from early next week at the 
earliest. 
  North Korea held working-level contacts with the IAEA on two 
occasions on the afternoon of 15 February, and officially 
notified that it will accept the IAEA's full-scope inspection of 
its seven nuclear facilities. 
  The IAEA revealed that the resumption of the full-scope 
inspection on North Korea is to closely examine whether North 
Korea diverted the nuclear material of its seven nuclear 
facilities for military purposes since normal [chongsang] 
inspection on North Korea has been suspended since February 
1993. The inspection team plans to carry out a series of 
inspection activities including the overall replacement of 
monitoring devices and replacement of sealing devices to 
safeguard the continuity of the inspection which has been 
damaged. 
  With the acceptance of the full-scope inspection by North 
Korea, the IAEA notified the North Korean side by letter that it 
will dispatch the inspection team as soon as procedures are 
completed for the team to visit North Korea. If North Korea 
actively cooperates in the inspection team's preparations to 
visit North Korea, the inspection team consisting of six or 
seven people will be able to go to Pyongyang sometime this 
weekend and thus carry out inspection activities in Yongbyon 
from early next week when the IAEA Board of Governor's meeting 
takes place. 
  Counselor Yun Ho-chin, the working-level delegate of the 
North Korean side, said that the decision to accept the 
full-scope inspection was made with utmost flexibility by the 
North Korean side to achieve denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula and was achieved by making concessions with the IAEA.

  [Text] Berlin, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has agreed 
to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
conduct inspection on all seven reported nuclear facilities, the 
IAEA announced Tuesday. At a working-level contact in Vienna 
Tuesday, North Korea informed the IAEA that it will accept all 
IAEA conditions for inspection, the announcement said. 
  Meanwhile in New York, North Korea and the United States 
resumed their working-level meeting Tuesday to negotiate 
followup measures on IAEA inspection. 
  At the Vienna meeting, the IAEA told North Korea it plans to 
send a team of inspectors as soon as possible. It was reported 
that the team would be able to leave before Feb. 21 when the 
IAEA convenes a Board of Governors meeting. The team would 
probably leave Vienna for Pyongyang over the weekend if airline 
flight arrangements are made before that, sources said. 
  The IAEA said the purpose of the upcoming inspection is to 
see whether the nuclear materials in the seven reported 
facilities had been converted for other uses since February last 
year when the IAEA last conducted inspection. In addition, the 
IAEA plans to replace films and batteries for surveillance 
cameras after checking them to see if the IAEA seals were 
intact, IAEA officials said. These works will be conducted 
along with other basic inspection activities, the officials 
added. 
  The main point of the agreement was North Korea's acceptance 
of all the conditions the IAEA had laid out for the forthcoming 
inspection, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said. He declined, 
however, to disclose the details of inspection activities. 
  Meyer also explained that the agreement does not mean that 
there was a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Tuesday's agreement covers the upcoming inspection only, he 
said. The IAEA would not characterize the forthcoming 
inspection as being ad hoc or routine. 
  The inspection team, comprising six to seven experts, is 
expected to stay in North Korea for two to three weeks, IAEA 
officials said. 
  Councilor Yun Ho-chin of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna 
said that the agreement was reached in order to maintain 
continuity in nuclear safeguards. "We are satisfied with the 
outcome (of the negotiations)," he said. 
  In another development, North Korea is reportedly sending a 
high-level delegation to the IAEA board meeting Feb. 21. It was 
not immediately known, however, who would lead the delegation. 
The IAEA-North Korean agreement came after six rounds of talks 
since Pyongyang and Washington reached an accord in New York on 
Jan. 7. Despite Tuesday's agreement, the question of inspecting 
two unreported nuclear sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex is 
still pending, presumably for the two sides to discuss later.

yesterday and described the meeting as a private one without 
political implications. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he spoke briefly with

says his planned meeting with Li is an informal one to discuss 
business matters," Prasong said. 
  He said he yesterday also reiterated Thailand's one-China 
policy with China's Ambassador to Thailand Jin Quihua when they 
were seeing off Czech President Vaclav Havel at the airport. 
"China should understand Thailand's foreign policy and accept my 
explanation via its ambassador," Prasong said. [passage omitted] 
  Prasong said it did not matter if Amnuai received Li or 
hosted a dinner for him and his entourage on personal level. "I 
don't believe Amnuai will go to the airport to greet Li on his 
arrival," Prasong said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui will make a 7-hour 
stopover in Bangkok today before departing for Taiwan at 1800 
[1100 GMT]. Parliament President Marut Bunnak, who led a 
delegation to Taiwan last month, will host a luncheon for Li's 
delegation. 
  According to a Taiwan official source, Li Teng-hui hopes to 
drink "coffee" and meet informally with Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai after the luncheon. 
  Taiwan authorities tried to ask the Thai side to arrange for 
President Li to have an audience with His Majesty the King 
before concluding his 3-day "holiday trip" to Thailand. The Thai 
side has not replied to the request. Their Majesties the King 
and Queen visited Taiwan 31 years ago. Several royal projects 
in Northern Thailand have received technical assistance from 
Taiwan. 
  Li Teng-hui will leave Phuket for Bangkok at 0900 today. 
Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan -- Lin Riguang 
-- played another round of golf with Li Teng-hui and accompanied 
him on a sightseeing tour to Phangnga Bay aboard a cruise 
vessel. The deputy prime minister and Li Teng-hui also had an 
informal luncheon meeting on the boat. Last night Li Teng-hui 
held a return banquet in Phuket. 
  Li invited correspondents to join him on the cruise. After 
his talks with Amnuai, Li told reporters that his visit to the 
ASEAN countries of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand 
achieved great success and enabled him to get a deeper 
understanding of the Southeast Asian region. 
  A golf enthusiast, Li said: "my trip has significance. I am 
not on this trip to play golf. If I want to play golf, I can do 
that in Taiwan. It is not necessary for me to come this far." 
The Taiwan president declined to give details of his talks with 
the Thai deputy prime minister. He only said: "I will hold a 
press conference upon my arrival in Taipei at 2300 tomorrow. I 
will talk for about an hour." Because Li suffered from 
seasickness, he wrapped a small adhesive tape around his neck on 
the instructions of his doctor. 
  Li went to the Blue Canyon Club for another friendly golf 
game yesterday morning. Amnuai finished last among the four 
players with a score of 108. Li finished third with a score of 
102. The winner was Bangkok Bank Vice President Sathit Uthaisi, 
with a score of 77. Jeffrey Koo, adviser to the Taiwan Executive 
Branch, was runner-up with a score of 84. Others attending the 
meeting on the cruise boat included Taiwan Foreign Minister 
Frederick Chien; Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development of Taiwan; Jeffrey Koo; and 
Phuket Governor Somchit Nimitkun. 
  An informed source told our correspondent that the Thai and 
Taiwan officials exchanged views on strengthening bilateral 
trade and investment cooperation. He said that Li's Southeast 
Asia tour during the Chinese new year is aimed at gathering 
economic and investment information about this region to guide 
Taiwan businessmen interested in investing in this region. 
  Li Teng-hui began his "Chinese new year trip" on 9 February. 
He met Philippine President Fidel Ramos at Subic Bay and held 
an informal meeting with Indonesian President Suharto in Bali.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters at the Foreign Ministry this 
afternoon about the PRC Government's protest against the Thai 
Government's reception of Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said that he has 
already explained Thailand's one-China policy. The Taiwan 
president visited Thailand in a private capacity or for business 
contacts with Thai businessmen. The Thai Government has nothing 
to do with the visit. Regarding the parliament president's 
meeting with Li, the foreign minister said that it is a 
parliamentary affair which has nothing to do with the government 
and the administrative branch. The foreign minister added that 
there should be no problem because it is a private visit.

  [Text] Labor and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong has denied a report that he is scheduled to hold talks 
on economic and investment issues with Taiwan President Li 
Teng-hui, who is on a vacation in Thailand. Asked to comment on 
the PRC Government's dissatisfaction with countries who have 
welcomed the Taiwan president, Phaithun said that the Chinese 
Government should understand this issue well because China 
itself recognizes Taiwanese investment. The Cabinet, however, 
has allowed talks with the Taiwan president on economic, 
cultural, and educational affairs. 
  [Begin recording] [Phaithun] Yes, we have contacts through 
the private sector for labor issues. The government only 
extends its cooperation; this has nothing to do with politics. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Although there are only talks 
on economic issues, it could upset China. 
  [Phaithun] Mainland China itself recognizes Taiwanese 
investment. Taiwan also has investments in Thailand. There 
should be no problem discussing economic affairs. [end

<F P=106> [By correspondent Huang Zhenzhong] </F>
  [Excerpts] Thai Ambassador-designate to China Sawanit 
Khongsiri told our correspondent yesterday that current 
Thai-Chinese relations are smooth, steady, and sustainable. 
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Thailand and China in 1975, Thailand has recognized only the 
Beijing government, has adhered to the joint statement signed 
during the establishment of diplomatic relations, and has upheld 
the one-China policy. 
  He said that Thai-Chinese relations date back to time 
immemorial. The long-standing relations are based on similar 
traditions and religions. Relations between the two countries 
will develop naturally despite the absence of any motivating 
force. The peoples of the two countries will benefit under the 
principle of mutual reliance and mutual assistance. 
  Sawanit, who will leave for Beijing on 17 February to assume 
his post, said that he will continue to push for the development 
of bilateral relations during his tenure. In particular, he 
will follow Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's policy of stressing 
bilateral trade and investment. Although Sawanit was the first 
secretary of the Thai Embassy in Beijing from 1978 to 1981 and 
understands some Mandarin and has knowledge about China to a 
certain extent, he considers his duty a challenge because of the 
changes there. Businessmen and investors from all countries are 
paying attention to the huge Chinese market of 1.2 billion 
people. They want to do business and invest there, and Thailand 
must make efforts in this regard. 
  He also wants to see the realization of the quadrangle 
economic development plan among Thailand, China, Laos, and 
Burma. Thailand has been working hard for this plan. It will 
soon hold a meeting for businessmen from the four countries to 
discuss details of the plan and to make friendly contacts. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sawanit said that he wants to promote exchanges of visits 
between the leaders of Thailand and China because the two 
countries maintain good relations. Prime Minister Chuan has 
visited China, and Thailand is ready to welcome Chinese leaders 
to the country. 
  He said that Thailand and Taiwan maintain only labor 
relations. There is no development of relations in other fields. 
Thailand now has about 100,000 laborers in Taiwan whose 
presence also benefits that country. 
  Sawanit also told reporters that Thailand will set up a 
consulate general in Kunming, China's southwestern Province of 
Yunnan, this fiscal year. He stressed that there are no current 
problems in Thai-Chinese relations, which are proceeding in all 
fields.

  [Excerpt] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin does not 
think the failure of talks between the United States and Japan, 
which led to an appreciation of the yen, would affect Thailand. 
He said it was a bilateral issue and part of a series of talks 
under which the United States is trying to achieve concrete 
results in reducing Japan's trade surplus. He said the two 
countries adopt a common principle in trade. 
  A source at the Finance Ministry said that there could be a 
short-term impact caused by speculation in the money market. He 
suggested that one should wait and see when the Japanese 
Government starts selling its holdings if the U.S. Federal 
Reserve buys up the money in order to reduce the impact from the 
yen appreciation. He does not think that there will be any 
impact on Thailand. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Thailand wants to renegotiate the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area [AFTA] agreements with Indonesia and Malaysia to put 
petrochemical industries under AFTA's 15-year "normal track" 
tariff cutting schedule instead of the seven-to-10 year "fast 
track". 
  The move would amount to final acceptance by Thailand that 
its petrochemical industry cannot handle the swifter lowering of 
protectionist barriers originally envisaged under AFTA's "fast 
track". But Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin indicated 
yesterday that Thailand was not seeking permanent withdrawal of 
the sector from AFTA, not even on the list of exclusions that 
will be subject to review after eight years. He said that to do 
so would be a backward step that would run counter to Thailand's 
leadership in cutting tariffs under the AFTA programme. 
  The Thai petrochemicals industry has been seeking a delay in 
the reduction of AFTA barriers ever since the basic agreements 
were signed at the ASEAN summit in Singapore in January 1992. 
The industry argues that it cannot compete without the 
protection of tariff barriers because the natural gas that it 
uses as a raw material is considerably more expensive than the 
supplies used by Malaysia and Indonesia, partly because of the 
length of the undersea pipe that brings the gas from the Gulf of 
Thailand to Rayong. 
  Some industries that use petrochemicals as raw materials, 
such as textiles, have argued strongly against retaining 
protection for petrochemicals. They say that the retention of 
tariff barriers makes their costs higher than those of their 
competitors in other ASEAN countries where petrochemicals 
supplies are cheaper. 
  Officials say privately that Thailand under the first Anand 
Panyarachun government initially agreed to put petrochemicals on 
the "fast track" as a result of a challenge from Indonesia and 
Malaysia. 
  During negotiations on the creation of the free trade area, 
the other ASEAN countries are said to have argued that Thailand 
was the most protectionist of the six. They therefore 
reportedly challenged Thailand to demonstrate its seriousness by 
agreeing to put the sensitive petrochemicals sector on the fast 
track. 
  All along, some sections of the bureaucracy have questioned 
whether the Anand government's position was justified, and 
yesterday's decision by a Finance Ministry-led subcommittee 
appears to reflect the feeling. 
  The sub-committee decided to send delegates to negotiate 
with 
Indonesia and Malaysia to keep petrochemical industries on the 
"normal track" list. Mr Tharin admitted the two countries are 
opposed to the idea. 
  An alternative proposal would be for all three countries to 
put petrochemical industries under AFTA's exclusion list. This, 
in effect, protects their petrochemical industries for another 
eight years until the exclusion lists are reviewed. 
  Officials from several countries have warned that putting 
sectors on the exclusion list will require swifter adjustments 
since the present intention is for tariffs to drop sharply back 
on schedule after the eight years of exclusion. Under the 
regular "normal" and "fast" tracks tariffs are cut gradually in 
steps of five percentage points over the relevant periods. 
  Mr Tharin said yesterday he believes that keener competition 
over this sector would not affect Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs 
are capable of competing with neighbouring countries provided 
that the competition is on a level playing field. 
  The conclusions reached by the sub-committee have been 
submitted to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who 
is in charge of international trade negotiations, he said. 
  Mr Tharin added that Dr Suphachai's compromise proposal to 
protect petrochemical industries for another five years would be 
considered as a backup proposal if Malaysia and Indonesia 
disagreed with the Ministry of Finance's initiative. But Mr 
Suphachai's proposal would adversely affect Singapore as its 
petrochemical industry is more open than any other ASEAN country. 
  The sub-committee also considered revising the taxation on 
raw materials, including LPG. The move was aimed at reducing 
the costs of raw materials which would enhance the sector's 
chance of competing. 
  In the long run local plastic industries should be able to 
compete with imported products, and Thai tariffs should not be 
too high, Mr Tharin said. He would submit the sub-committee's 
proposals to the Board of Investment at its next meeting.

  [Text] Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country to Russia, 
held interviews with reporters of ITAR-TASS, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, 
and (KOMMERSANTO), on 8 and 10 February in connection with 
Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers and with commotions on our 
missile threat loudly talked about by Western countries, 
including the United States. 
  The ambassador responded to questions about the commotions 
on 
our missile threat noisily talked about by the United States and 
Western countries. 
  He said: The United States and Western countries raved that 
by developing missiles, we are threatening Japan and South Korea 
and are exporting missiles to Middle East countries. Their claim 
is a barefaced lie. This is intended as justification for the 
United States to continuously keep military bases and troops in 
Japan and South Korea and to militarily crush our Republic by 
reinforcing its Armed Forces. This is also designed for the 
United States to militarily tie down [kunsajoguro olgo 
maenochanunde] South Korea. As is known to the entire world, our 
defense forces are, for all intents and purposes, defensive 
forces of the nation. Public opinion that we will attack Japan 
and South Korea first is a trick fabricated by the United 
States. Our country is a peace-loving state. The hardline 
conservative forces in the United States should not miscalculate 
our military power. 
  It is a firm resolution of our people and People's Army to 
defend the nation's independence and dignity. We are fully 
prepared for any contingency. We will respond to dialogue with 
dialogue and to war with war. If the United States advances 
along the road of confrontation with us through strength by 
reinforcing armed forces in Northeast Asia, we will take 
corresponding countermeasures [sangunghan taeungchaegul 
chwihada]. 
  Responding to questions on Japan's nuclear armament, the 
ambassador said that Japan recently announced that it will 
ignite a new fast-breeder reactor, which is capable of producing 
a large quantity of plutonium. He continued: 
  Japan has the potential to produce nuclear weapons at any 
time. In addition, it has a 800-ton annual nuclear reprocessing 
capacity. Japan is stockpiling 1.6 tons of plutonium at home and 
2.9 tons overseas. Japan plans to possess 50 tons of plutonium 
by 2010. When this is realized, Japan will be capable of 
producing more than 6,200 nuclear bombs. 
  Japan has already developed intercontinental ballistic 
missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Japan's 
undisguised nuclear armament poses a great threat to peace and 
security in Northeast Asia, including the Korean peninsula, and 
to the world. 
  Therefore, the people of the world, not to mention the Asian 
people, should deal with Japan's nuclear armament with a sense 
of vigilance, and should thoroughly check such armament. If one 
fails to check Japan's nuclear armament, the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula would be meaningless. Therefore, Japan's 
nuclear armament must be checked, first of all, to achieve the 
denuclearization of Northeast Asia.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 16 (KCNA) -- A statement 
supporting the cause of Korean reunification was adopted on 
February 12 at the international seminar on the chuche idea for 
the independent development and coopertion of the world peoples 
held in Uganda. 
  Noting that "10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward 
by the great leader President Kim Il-song reflects the noble 
desire of the Korean people to achieve national reunification 
and prosperity by winning the unity of the whole nation, 
irrespective of the difference in ideology, idea and system, the 
statement said all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas 
who love the country and the nation set 1995 as the first year 
of Korean reunification. 
  It said the South Korean authorities are seeking dependence 
on outside forces and North-South confrontation, ignoring the 
desire of the whole nation for reunification. 
  Pointing out that the "nuclear problem" of Korea over which 
the United States and its lackeys are raising outcries is an 
offspring of the U.S. moves against socialist Korea, the 
statement said: 
  "It is the United States that raised the `suspicion of the 
North's nuclear arms development' and it is also the United 
States that iishthreatening the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  "The United States must know that pressure or threat have no 
effect on the Korean people and such a method cannot solve the 
problem but may bring the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  "It must look sqaurely at all the facts and act with 
discretion. 
  "We fully support the proposal advanced by the Workers' 
Party 
of Korea to reunify the country through confederacy based on one 
nation, one state, two systems and two governments in accordance 
with the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, considering it to be the 
most fair one. 
  "We also strongly demand that the nuclear issue on the 
Korean 
peninsula must be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks because it was 
caused by the deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea by 
the United States."

the great leader President Kim Il-song from the participants in 
the International Seminar on the Chuche Idea for the Independent 
Development and Cooperation of the World Peoples held in 
Kampala, Uganda. 
  The letter dated February 12 says the participants in the 
seminar confirmed the truth of the chuche idea that to firmly 
build up the internal political forces and enhance their role is 
the basic guarantee of the building of a new independent society 
and called for keeping heightened vigilance against the 
western-style "multi-party parliamentary democracy" aimed at 
disintegrating the patriotic forces. 
  Noting that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the 
homeland of the chuche idea and a model in the building of a new 
independent society, the letter says the participants are 
convinced that only when they regard independence as the life 
and soul of the country and the nation and achieve unity of the 
patriotic forces by rallying the popular masses around the 
leader and the leading organization, as indicated by the chuche 
idea, can they defend the sovereignty of the country and win 
economic liberation. 
  The letter wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long 
life.

support for and sympathy with the teachings of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il that it is the basic way for achieving independent 
development in developing countries to oppose neo-colonialism, 
establish a fair international order which embodies democratic 
principles, adopt a political mode suitable for the reality of 
one's own country and strengthen the internal political forces. 
  It notes that the participants in the seminar are convinced 
that only when the outstanding idea and theory on the 
independent development and cooperation of the people expounded 
by Comrade Kim Chong-il are applied to the reality, is it 
possible to achieve the complete economic liberation of the 
country and steadfastly defend its political sovereignty. 
  It points out that they confirmed the truth of the chuche 
idea that to form independent internal forces and enhance their 
role in every country by uniting the people closely around the 
leader and the leading organization is vital to defending 
independence, the life and soul of the country, and shaping the 
destiny of the popular masses. 
  It says they have been greatly inspired by the wise guidance 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is leading the people to 
convincingly advance along the road of socialism chosen by 
themselves and by the struggle of the Korean people, who are 
steadfastly defending the sovereignty of the country, closely 
united around the leader. 
  The letter wholeheartedly wishes Comrade Kim Chong-il good 
health and long life.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 17 (KCNA) -- A declaration was 
adopted at the International Seminar on the Chuche Idea for 
Independent Development and Cooperation of the World Peoples 
which was held in Kampala, Uganda, to mark the birthday of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The declaration dated Feb. 12 noted the seminar was a more 
significant gathering as it was held on the occasion of the 52d 
birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who is 
consistently developing in depth the chuche idea. 
  It said: 
  The participants in the seminar unanimously stressed that it 
is the most urgent matter for the independent development of 
developing countries at present to liquidate neocolonialism, 
establish a fair international economic order based on the 
principle of democracy and achieve the unity of the patriotic 
forces by establishing political formula suited to realities of 
each country. 
  We consider that a new international economic order should 
be 
an independent l one which can ensure the interests of all 
countries, strong and weak, irrespective of differences between 
the rich and the poor on the principle of democracy. The 
developing countries should reject the unlimited opening of 
markets and conditioned "aids", which may cause the bankruptcy 
of the national economy and economic dependence, and positively 
develop the South-South cooperation on the principle of the 
collective self-reliance. 
  We are convinced that the fundamental interests of the 
developing nations lie in building an independent sovereign 
state in a political aspect by uniting the patriotic forces. 
  The developing countries should not follow the western-style 
multi-party system and destroy the national unity achieved 
through the arduous struggle, but firmly ensure unity and 
solidarity among the popular masses by means of building up the 
united front of different political parties around the patriotic 
political party.

  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have ended 
in failure without settling bilateral conflicts. Since the 
point at issue lies in the controversy over the basic problem on 
introduction of numerical targets, the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI] has responded coolly to the breakdown, 
saying: "It was somehow predictable." MITI intends to deal with 
U.S. pressure on Japan, which is expected to intensify in the 
future, by frequently resorting to the method of enlisting 
cooperation of auto and auto parts makers to increase purchases 
of U.S.-made products (known as the corporation approach). 
However, prospects for the framework talks still remain utterly 
unknown. Even if the talks should be resumed, it would be 
difficult to find a way out unless our two nations should come 
to share a common understanding of the objective criteria. 
Thus, discussions may have to be resumed from the starting 
point when the decision was made to set up the framework talks 
last July. 
  In analyzing the talks, a senior MITI official said: "The 
yen's sharp appreciation is a menace to us but we do not think 
that the `verbal intervention' will last long. It will also be 
difficult for the United States to take unilateral sanctions 
based on laws such as the U.S. Trade Act." His comments 
indicate that since mutual cooperation in the industrial area 
has deepened and since sanctions will affect Japan in only a few 
sectors, such sanctions may not bring about serious damage. 
  If the United States should invoke its Trade Act and take 
unilateral sanctions, such as raising import tariffs on 
semiconductors, American users will be forced to use expensive 
Japanese products because higher costs will result in higher 
prices. Thus, MITI argues that in the long run, it will be 
American consumers who will suffer disadvantages. 
  Meanwhile, the two countries had the hardest time at the 
recent talks on autos and auto parts. And concerning these 
talks, MITI indicated its confidence, and said: "Cooperation 
between the private sectors of our two countries will further 
deepen regardless of the future development in the framework 
talks." A source at the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association [JAMA] also said: "We will continue to promote 
bilateral cooperation in the industrial area." In this way, 
JAMA shows its intention to promote the corporation approach, 
which MITI advocated at the recent talks, so as to show the 
United States how effective it is. 
  However, the corporation approach gives no guarantee of an 
increase in the amount of procurement and it will take a long 
time to produce any results. In this connection, it is hard to 
expect that with the approach of the by-election this fall, the 
Clinton administration will tolerate the trade imbalance in the 
auto sector, which amounted to as huge as approximately 2.45 
trillion yen (in 1993). 
  "Numerical targets will not be accepted because it will lead 
to managed trade." This is a fair argument for Japan to claim. 
However, in view of the fact that the trade surplus has remained 
unreduced, it will be difficult to win U.S. understanding. 
  Since the numerical targets issue has become something like 
a 
debate on philosophical problems, rough sailing can be expected 
at future talks. Therefore, for the time being, the private 
sector will be asked to try to achieve the "invisible numerical 
target" by resorting to the corporation approach to steadily 
increase the purchase of U.S.-made products.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Overreaction to Breakdown of Japanese-U.S. </F>
Talks Is Taboo"] 
  [Text] The Japanese-U.S. summit talks have ended in discord 
on the issue of setting sectoral numerical targets because Japan 
insisted on saying "no" to the request. The result leaves a 
bitter taste in our mouths, and it is difficult to predict when 
they can recover from the aftermath, even after a cooling-off 
period. 
  In reviewing the actual economic trends from a calm 
viewpoint, however, Japanese and U.S. industrial circles are not 
exchanging heavy fire with each other. In other words, heated 
disputes between the two governments do not actually reflect 
competition or cooperation in the private sector as they are. 
  Thanks partly to the economic recovery, U.S. economic 
circles 
have toned down their "theory of the Japanese threat." Because 
the electronics and auto industries have completely regained 
their competitiveness, more people have come to feel that "Japan 
is no longer worthy of our attention." 
  As an actual trend, many people expect that Japan's 
current-accounts surplus will be reduced rapidly. The 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
predicts that the ratio of the current surplus to the gross 
national product (GNP) will drop to around less than 2.5 percent 
next year from 3 percent in 1992. 
  It is certain that imports of cars from the United States 
will sharply increase in the future. The auto industrial 
circles think that even if an import target is set, actual U.S. 
auto exports to Japan will exceed this target. 
  Therefore, we should not overreact to the breakdown of the 
current talks because there are many factors that will duly 
settle various issues even if no measures are taken. 
  Moreover, while the United States actually has achieved 
substantial, 3-percent growth, Japan has achieved zero growth. 
It is impossible to discuss matters at the same table without 
taking this gap in growth rates into consideration. Japan's 
economic recovery is the best remedy to reduce the surplus and 
also the best way to contribute to the global economy. 
  If the United States should impose sanctions on Japan 
because 
of the latter's rejection of numerical targets, the sanctions 
will not only worsen the economic situation in Japan but also 
exert an adverse influence on the United States and the 
international community. U.S. President Bill Clinton is 
dissatisfied with Japan's economic stimulus package. However, 
the economic measures are not the final ones. Other measures 
such as the income tax cut scheduled for next year will be 
announced. 
  The current issue is the possible increase in mutual 
distrust, which can be attributed to the fact that the 
controversy over the introduction of the yardstick known as 
numerical targets has become sort of a religious fervor. 
  Japan, once stung by pressure to permit the United States to 
gain a "20-percent" share of its semiconductor market, has 
insisted on rejecting numerical targets, because these induce 
excessive government intervention, impede the principle of 
competition between markets, and run counter to the course of 
the deregulation policy of the Hosokawa administration. 
Industrial circles have also become allergic to numerical 
targets. Under these circumstances, the government cannot force 
industrial circles to accept numerical targets by issuing 
administrative guidance, nor does it have such power. In this 
connection, industrial circles are rapidly veering away from the 
government and are moving toward deregulation. 
  The United States' argument that "a yardstick is needed to 
measure progress" is understandable. However, this depends on 
whether one should gauge "results," such as a "20-percent" 
market share, or "processes," such as cost reductions and 
improved services. 
  It is impossible for the government to conclude an 
intergovernmental accord that employs "results" as a yardstick 
because this will lead to managed trade. It may be rather 
difficult to get used to employing the second factor, 
"processes," as a yardstick in the intergovernmental accord, but 
a compromise can possibly be reached if discussions are focused 
on this point. 
  At the actual talks, however, the collapse of the 
negotiations was destined from the outset because the United 
States demanded "results" or similar criteria as a yardstick. 
  The two countries should seek ways to achieve coexistence 
and 
coprosperity after a cooling-off period. The future of the U.S. 
economy depends on how deep are the inroads it can make into 
Asia -- and to do this, Japan's cooperation is indispensable. 
  What Japan needs to do is to work out a long-term strategy 
based on changes in its economic structure. For example, it 
should seek an equal distribution of work with the United States.

  [Text] In view of the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, the government plans to take the initiative to 
frontload the implementation of market liberalization measures 
agreed upon so far. Although the framework talks failed to 
agree on the substance of the objective criteria, there had been 
some agreements reached in procedural matters. Japan has to 
underscore its efforts toward opening its market if only to 
dissuade the United States from imposing unilateral sanctions. 
Furthermore, the government also intends to expand its action 
program on government procurement, and study measures to ease 
regulations in the insurance sector to compile new market 
liberalization measures in time for the meeting of leaders of 
the advanced countries (Naples Summit) in July. 
  Responsible government officials from concerned ministries 
and agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry will meet on 15 
February to discuss how to deal with the framework talks. Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and concerned cabinet ministers will 
also meet as early as this week to start formulating concrete 
measures to open the market. 
  The objective criteria were supposed to be set to gauge the 
extent of foreign participation in the market. Even the recent 
bilateral summit meeting was not able to narrow the gap between 
the United States, which wanted the introduction of targets for 
the future, and Japan, which opposed such targets. This led to 
a breakdown in the framework talks. However, basic agreements 
had been reached in areas other than the objective criteria. 
Japan will implement these agreements on its own initiative. 
  One of these is the promotion of the improvement and 
extension of procedures for government procurement, one of the 
priority sectors in the framework talks. Early this month, the 
cabinet decided upon an action program on government 
procurement, which provided for the creation of a new organ to 
handle complaints, among other things. It was also agreed at the 
framework talks that the floor prices of telecommunications and 
medical equipment subject to competitive bidding be set at 
100,000 SDRs (IMF special drawing rights; around 15 million yen). 
  In insurance, another priority sector, concrete measures 
will 
be drawn up for matters agreed upon between Japan and the United 
States. The Finance Ministry is aiming at a reform of the 
insurance industry in fiscal 1996, which includes the 
introduction of an insurance brokerage system, and a public 
hearing system where foreign insurance companies will be allowed 
to express their opinions on the insurance market. 
  Regarding how to deal with the framework talks from now on, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa has said: "The ball has been thrown to 
us. We have to come up with ideas." Apparently, the government 
has decided to take the initiative in implementing market 
liberalization measures. After the framework talks broke down, 
the United States hinted at imposing sanctions and taking other 
unilateral actions. It is believed that the government's 
decision is partly meant to ward off such retaliation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Eloquent U.S. Deputy Secretary of </F>
State Talbott Expected To Work Out Measures To Deal With Russia 
in Confusion"] 
  [Text] Within the staggering Clinton Administration -- 
already burdened by the questionable diplomatic ability of 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and doubled troubles in 
the wake of the resignation of Defense Secretary Les Aspin -- 
Mr. Strobe Talbott, who replaced Clifford Wharton as Deputy 
Secretary of State, emerges as a key diplomatic personality. 
  The new deputy secretary, Talbott, in contrast to poor 
talker 
Secretary of State Christopher, is a glib talker. Basically, 
the deputy secretary of state is in charge of interdepartmental 
affairs within the Department of State. In the case of Mr. 
Talbott, however, he is likely to have many chances to attract 
public attention at news conferences. 
  Besides, Deputy Secretary Talbott is a universally 
acknowledged expert on Russia, which is plagued with mounting 
confusion. 
  Mr. Talbott began studying the Russian language when he was 
a 
student at Hotchkiss, a famed prep school in the Eastern U.S., 
and studied Russian literature at Yale University and at Oxford 
which he attended as a Rhodes scholar along with President 
Clinton. He is also known for translating the memoirs of former 
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the age of 24. 
  After graduating from universities he worked at TIME 
magazine 
as an expert reporter on the former Soviet Union and Russian 
affairs. He was reported to have indulged himself in Russian 
affairs even while the Washington bureau chief, reporting on 
U.S. affairs as a whole. After his 30-year-long immersion in 
Russia, he can rightly be termed a "Russophile." 
  His excessively partial concern for Russia is seen as a 
little problematic, but he is counted on by many for his 
expertise on Russia, where tension and instability continue to 
mount. It is because a blueprint for rebuilding Russia drawn up 
by the United States and the International Monetary Fund has 
greatly gotten out of shape due to the rise of ultranationalist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and the resignation of reformist First 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, and the expressed 
resignation of Economics Minister Fedorov who have pursued 
economic democratization and the like. 
  Meanwhile, a noticeable No. 2 man in Japan's Russian 
diplomacy appeared on stage when Japan-Russia relations were not 
making any improvement even after Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's formal visit to Japan, as shown by such activities as 
Russia's dumping radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan. 
  Recently Koji Watanabe, former ambassador to Italy, was 
appointed ambassador to Russia, but he is not quite an expert on 
Russian affairs. So Kazuhiko Togo, former minister to the 
United States, was called in to assist Ambassador Watanabe. 
  Mr. Togo not only has the experience of serving in Moscow 
some time ago but also was the Soviet Union Division chief at 
the Foreign Ministry when the then President Mikhail Gorbachev 
visited Japan. In addition, Mr. Togo, when he was in the United 
States as minister at the Japanese Embassy, was said to have 
developed a strong friendship with Deputy Secretary of State 
Talbott. 
  It remains to be seen how much influence these two No. 2 men 
can exert on future Japan-U.S.-Russia relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Establish a Mature Relationship Between </F>
Japan and the United States"] 
  [Text] The recent summit talks between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton made us feel 
that the two nations have entered the stage of new relationship 
under the leadership of a new generation. 
  In past summit talks, Japan was obliged to accept 
unreasonable demands in the name of the Japan-U.S. alliance, and 
this caused an anti-American feeling among the Japanese. Also, 
the two nations tended to reach vague agreements to patch up 
things for the moment, thus leaving the seeds of conflict for 
the future. 
  Nonetheless, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton 
clearly said "No" to each other on economic issues. We believe 
their approach is much better than that taken in the past when 
the ultimate objective was to achieve successful agreements. 
  However, if this result is to become what Hosokawa called a 
"mature and adult relationship," at least two conditions should 
be met. 
<H5>  Prevent the Expansion of Confrontation </H5>
  One condition is to limit confrontation between the 
Governments of Japan and the United States to bilateral trade. 
It is important not to spread the conflict to the entire 
bilateral relationship. Regarding this, President Clinton said 
at a news conference: "The two sides will maintain good 
relations in the area of politics and security." We give high 
marks to his remark. 
  What worries us are moves in the U.S. Congress. We sincerely 
hope that Congress will not present demands for Japan's greater 
cooperation in security as a means to push forward trade 
negotiations, and not pass discriminatory legislation against 
Japan. We call on Congress to act with calm. 
  The other condition is for Japan to take aggressive action 
toward opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. We 
support the goverment's decision to reject U.S. demands for 
introducing numerical targets. The refusal, however, does not 
mean that urgent issues have all been resolved. 
  Now that the government has rejected the path toward managed 
trade, it should make efforts to increase domestic demand, to 
drastically reduce government regulations and administrative 
guidance, and to establish a transparent and fair market. 
Further appreciation of the yen against the dollar would be an 
unavoidable development for the time being. 
  Under the economic framework talks agreed to last July, the 
recent summit meeting was a sort of mid-course examination. The 
two nations plan first to produce results in the three priority 
areas, and then reach a final agreement on the other issues 
before the next summit scheduled for July. 
  Five months is not very long. The Japanese Government should 
immediately set to work on devising counterproposals that will 
convince the United States. 
  We call on the United States to take a flexible stance on 
numerical targets. "The setting of numerical targets will push 
Japan back to the past method of adjusting imports through 
government manipualtion." Such arguments have appeared in 
leading newspapers in the United States and Europe. Economists 
in Japan and the United States are also opposed to numerical 
targets. Washington should listen to what they have said. 
<H5>  The United States Acts Too Rashly </H5>
  President Clinton expressed a sense of distrust in Japan by 
saying that despite more than 30 agreements reached on opening 
up the Japanese market, there had been absolutely no change. 
His understanding is not completely correct. Certainly, 
Japan's trade surplus has not been reduced remarkably. But 
bilateral agreements have produced results in the government 
procurement of satellites and supercomputers as well as the 
expansion of imports of beef and citrus. 
  It was predicted from the beginning that framework trade 
talks would be rough. Some people said that the end of the Cold 
War would allow the two nations to discuss economic issues 
straightforwardly, and others said President Clinton, who seeks 
reelection, would call for quick results. Others also pointed 
to the differences in the trade policies of the two nations. 
  Another factor that cannot be overlooked is the return of 
Japanese industry to a "Japan as Number Two" position. 
Semiconductor accords used as a model by the United States in 
recent trade talks and the plans by the Japanese auto industry 
to buy more U.S.-made auto parts were drawn up during a time 
when Japanese industry was increasing in prosperity. Faced with 
the difficult position of being sandwiched between the 
resurrection of U.S. industry and the rise of Asia, Japanese 
industry can no longer afford to accept difficult requests from 
the United States. 
  Because of the appreciation of the yen since last year, 
Japanese industry has moved production bases overseas, and 
imports from Asia and other countries have rapidly increased. 
As a result, the trade surplus has begun to decrease slowly. 
Some people have made hasty predictions that if this trend 
continues, the fierce trade friction between Japan and the 
United States will disappear. 
  It is unavoidable that economic relations between Japan and 
the United States will continue to be strained for the time 
being. It is also possible that bills will be submitted to U.S. 
Congress urging hard-line action against Japan, and that the 
U.S. Government will threaten to impose sanctions. 
  However, if the world's two economic superpowers should turn 
inward and mutually implement protectionist measures, the 
negative effect on the world economy will be great. We hope the 
two nations will tide over the current difficulties with calm 
while not losing a long-term perspective.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Heavy Responsibilities of the Japan That </F>
Said `No'"] 
  [Text] It is said that in a mature diplomatic 
relationship, it sometimes is necessary "to agree not to agree." 
  The summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton came to an unprecedented 
conclusion with no joint statement issued. At their meeting, 
the two leaders made straightforward assertions, choosing not to 
be compelled to reach a cosmetic agreement. This should be 
considered a sign that the post-Cold War relationship between 
Japan and the United States is entering a new, mature stage. 
  Whether setting "numerical targets" to measure the extent of 
openness of Japan's markets is right or wrong is not all that 
matters in the Japan-U.S. relations. As President Clinton has 
pointed out, Japan and the United States share common interests 
regarding the situation o the Korean peninsula. The two nations 
have also reconfirmed close cooperation regarding common global 
issues which include aid to Russia, the ronment, population 
control, and AIDS. 
  We should not be preoccupied with "the breakdown in 
negotiations and failure to reach an agreement" regarding the 
framework trade talks and overlook the steady progress being 
made by the two nations toward strengthening bilateral ties as a 
whole, including expanding cooperation among their private 
companies. "Japan and the United States can endure even if they 
fail to agree on certain points," (as stated by President 
Clinton.) That is the way it ought to be. 
  It is desired that both nations will take advantage of the 
cooling-off period to resume talks at mature levels. The 
maintenance of good bilateral relations is important for the 
security of Asia, as well as the rest of the world. 
  If bilateral relations are actually maturing, what is most 
needed is for the two nations to fulfill their roles as mature 
nations. In this respect, Japan -- which said what it had to 
say, and, for the first time, said "no" to what it cannot do -- 
must now carry out what can be done promptly and infallibly. 
  In particular, it is most urgent for Japan to carry out 
deregulation and improve procedures regarding government 
procurement -- measures which can be implemented under the 
government's own responsibility. Not only must Japan hasten 
steps toward a domestic-demand-oriented economic recovery by 
implementing versatile fiscal and monetary measures, but it must 
also apply the Antimonopoly Law more strictly to create a fairer 
and more open market. 
  In short, the government needs to prove that "Japan has 
changed." We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to exercise his 
leadership, taking the initiative to persuade those forces which 
resist reform. 
  Japan rejected a U.S. demand for introducing numerical 
targets in priority areas in the framework trade talks, such as 
automobiles and insurance services, on the grounds that it would 
lead to managed trade and run contrary to the principle of 
deregulation. This is only natural. Japanese and U.S. scholars 
and numerous foreign news media, including those of the United 
States, support Japan's position. 
  We urge the United States to reconsider its position and try 
to find other ways to promote access to Japanese markets. We 
cannot agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical 
targets and approaching bilateral trade talks with threats of 
imposing legal sanctions against Japan. 
  An outline of the framework trade talks was agreed upon last 
July during a meeting between Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then 
prime minister, and President Clinton. During the days of a 
one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan often took 
advantage of outside pressure to carry out domestic reform. 
With the birth of the Hosokawa administration, Japan is pressed 
with reexamining this past political approach. 
  There is no denying the fact that Japanese markets are 
extremely attractive since Japan is a member of Asia which is 
showing spectacular growth in the post-Cold War era. More than 
a few European and U.S. firms which have already enjoyed success 
in Japanese markets. 
  In view of an age when markets and consumers should decide 
who is the winner, we should all level-headedly think once again 
of ways to correct trade imbalances.

  [Text] Former prime ministers, top advisers, President 
Yohei Kono, and four executives of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] met at a Tokyo hotel on the evening of 16 
February. At the meeting the LDP top advisers exchanged views 
on the breakdown of the framework talks at the recent Japan-U.S. 
summit. Referring to Prime Minister Hosokawa's comment that 
"both Japan and the United States have now entered a mature, 
adult relationship," one top adviser after another criticized 
the prime minister, saying: "How can he say Japan and the 
United States have entered a mature relationship." 
  The LDP leadership plans to question the prime minister in 
the Diet about the conduct of his diplomacy. 
  Top LDP advisers asked at the meeting about setting criteria 
for choosing candidates to run on party tickets in the next 
elections. In response, Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said the 
LDP leadership would give priority to incumbent Dietmen in 
choosing candidates. 
  He said: "We intend to let incumbent Dietmen continue their 
political activities."

  [Text] It was disclosed on 15 February that, at the 
bidding for the government procurement of 11 supercomputers with 
funds provided in the first supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993, six supercomputer systems would be procured from U.S. 
manufacturers, with the remaining five coming from domestic 
makers. Bidding for supercomputer procurement started in 
November 1993, and IBM of the United States on 14 February won 
the 11th and last bid -- for a computer ordered for the National 
Cancer Center. Of those 11 supercomputers, two of the U.S.-made 
computers will be supplied by Cray Research Institute Inc., and 
four of the domestically-manufactured computers by Fujitsu. The 
Japanese Government considers the result of the current bidding 
"proves the procurement was conducted in a fair process."

  [Text] It has been learned that a joint survey by the 
Japanese and U.S. Governments was conducted to check the market 
share of imported automobiles in Japan and that judging from the 
survey, a joint survey report estimates that it is possible to 
increase sales of U.S.-made autos by 37,000 a year if such 
obstacles as a "keiretsu" structure between auto manufacturers 
and dealers are removed. It also estimates that if such 
conditions as securing of sales personnel and funds, and U.S. 
manufacturers' efforts to produce autos that can appeal to the 
Japanese market are met, sales of U.S.-made autos will be 
increased by 57,000 a year. Japan and the United States, in 
negotiations on autos and the auto parts sector under Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, confronted each other over "objective 
criteria," and the two nations failed to reach an agreement at 
the Japan-U.S. summit talks held last week. But since the joint 
survey report says that increasing sales of U.S.-made autos in 
the Japanese market is possible, it is likely that the report 
will have an impact on the future negotiations on auto and the 
autoparts sectors. 
  The joint survey was based on a meeting of market-oriented 
sector-selective (MOSS) committee. The survey was conducted 
from February of 1992 by the Nomura Research Institute and the 
U.S. firm Boose Allen and Hamilton [as published] at the request 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and 
the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
  The survey report lists 1) difficulty in securing sales 
personnel; 2) the shortage of sales floor space; 3) financial 
shortages; 4) lack of the three biggest U.S. auto manufacturers' 
(Big Three) efforts to make autos that can appeal to the 
Japanese market; and 5) the existence of the "keiretsu" system, 
which connects Japanese auto manufacturers with dealers, as 
obstacles to the promotion of Japanese dealers' sales of 
U.S.-made autos. The estimated figures shown in the report were 
calculated on the assumption that the above obstacles are 
removed. 
  The report estimates that it is possible for dealers to 
increase sales of U.S-made autos by 57,000 a year if the above 
four obstacles (1 to 4) are removed, adding that it is possible 
to increase sales of autos by 37,000 a year if the "keiretsu" 
system is abolished and if dealers make a franchise contract 
directly with U.S. auto makers. 
  The report also says that if prices of U.S.-made autos are 
lowered by 10-25 percent, it is possible to increase sales by 
6,000 to 27,000 a year. 
  According to the Japan Automobile Importers' Union, the 
number of U.S.-made autos imported by Japan in 1993 from the Big 
Three was 19,335.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has worked out the details of its rejection of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce's criticism based on a joint Japan-U.S. 
survey of the auto market. The ministry report includes the 
following points: 1) The survey does not conclude that the 
close ties between Japanese dealers and auto makers impede the 
signing of contracts with new agents; 2) the large gap between 
the prices of American cars sold at home and overseas can be 
attributed mainly to the large profit-margins of importers or 
costly advertising, but not to the influence of Japan's 
distribution system. 
  There has also been criticism that the ratio between 
foreign-made and domestically-made cars sold by Japanese dealers 
is very low. In rejecting this U.S. criticism, MITI says: 
"There are many types of dealer engaged in selling both 
foreign-made and domestically-made cars. The number of Japanese 
dealers selling different brands of imported cars -- no matter 
in which country they are manufactured -- reaches 18 percent -- 
about the same percentage as that of U.S. dealers."

  [Text] Japan Ido Tsushin [Mobile Communications] Company 
(Ido) is perplexed by new demands by the U.S. Government and 
Motorola Company. The company had planned to expand the use of 
Motorola systems by investing 30 billion yen over the next two 
to three years, and Motorola was informed of this plan. Ido's 
plan was supposed to have been used as a "trump card" in 
negotiations [with the United States]. 
  But the United States has come up with new demands, 
including 
increasing the number of base stations. As far as Ido is 
concerned, this means even this most difficult, final choice has 
been simply ignored, and Tsukada, president of the company, is 
infuriarated, saying: "Motorola is entering and exiting the 
arena of government-to-government negotiations as it pleases. 
This is something Japanese manufacturers cannot even 
contemplate." 
  The United States has complained from the beginning that the 
service area for Motorola systems is small compared with that 
for NTT [Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone] systems. While NTT 
systems cover 94 percent of the population in their service 
area, Motorola systems cover only about 60 percent. [sentence as 
published] What the United States insists is that "as long as 
the area where cellular phones can be used remains small, the 
use of the phones will be slow to grow." 
  But Ido had thought that if its plan was implemented, the 
coverage rates of the NTT systems and Motorola systems would be 
about equal, and the United States "would not be able to 
complain."

<F P=106> [From the "Scoop 94 Political Situation" column by TOKYO </F>
SHIMBUN reporter Tomohiro Okuni: "Indelible Discord Between 
Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura"] 
  [Text] The turmoil within the ruling coalition parties 
over the prime minister's plan for a "national welfare tax" has 
been settled by an agreement reached among the ruling coalition 
parties that the introduction of the national welfare tax is to 
be postponed and the income tax will be cut first. The turmoil, 
however, has left an indelible mutual distrust between Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura who are 
playing a pivotal role in the coalition government. Their 
discord still remains deep in the prime minister's official 
residence, and there is a possibility that discord could erupt 
some day in the future. 
  At a news conference on the afternoon of 8 February, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa apologized to the people for his failure to 
undertake the proper procedure prior to the announcement of the 
"national welfare tax." Shortly after the news conference, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura murmured, "Although I did not 
see well, I wonder if Mr. Hosokawa bowed his head to the people." 
  Mr. Takemura's expression revealed his discontent with the 
prime minister, who devoted much of his time in the news 
conference to the clarification of his position while 
apologizing to the people. 
  Mr. Takemura was notified of the plan for the "national 
welfare tax" that the prime minister had drawn up behind the 
scenes on the advice of Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary 
of Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa, 
secretary general of the Komeito, shortly before dawn 3 
February, when the prime minister announced the new tax system 
at a news conference. The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] resisted the new tax system with the posture of not 
hesitating to back out of the coalition government. Speaking at 
a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Mr. Takemura 
said: "It cannot be said that all things are right. There is a 
saying that it is best to correct mistakes." In this way, from 
the outset, Mr. Takemura urged the prime minister to think of 
shelving his plan for a national welfare tax. 
  The chief cabinet secretary, who is in a position to assist 
the prime minister, admonished the prime minister. In reaction, 
people in the ruling coalition parties criticized Mr. Takemura, 
saying, "He is like a wife who calls her husband a `bad guy at 
home' when her husband is criticized by people," (according to a 
senior official of a ruling party). 
  At the time of inaugurating the coalition government, they 
were widely known "allies." They have promised a "marriage" of 
merging the Japan New Party and Sakigake [the Harbinger Party]. 
The story of the marriage, however, still floats in the air as 
the prime minister increasingly attaches importance to his ties 
with Messrs. Ozawa and Ichikawa, and the feud is intensifying 
between Mr. Takemura and Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa. 
  The differences between the prime minister and Mr. Takemura 
on the strategy and prospects for a realignment of political 
parties are becoming apparent. In the midst of the uproar over 
the tax issue, Mr. Takemura met with Keigo Ouchi, health and 
welfare minister and chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, 
and Satsuki Eda, director general of the Science and Technology 
Agency, and representative of the the United Social Democratic 
Party. Mr. Takemura is solidifying his ties with social 
democratic forces while arranging a meeting between Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Chairman Ouchi. There is no 
doubt that he is making those moves with the second realignment 
of political parties taken into account. His moves also aim at 
keeping the prime minister from tilting toward the Shinseito 
[the Japan Renewal Party] and the Komeito. 
  Mr. Takemura once spoke highly of the prime minister, 
saying, 
"Mr. Hosokawa is a person who can make manly decisions." Of 
late, however, Mr. Takemura has not praised the prime minister's 
ability to make decisions. Now they are unable to read each 
others' real intentions, and Mr. Takemura appears to have sensed 
that the prime minister is making decisions on the advice of 
Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa while "leaving him out in the cold." 
  During the government of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
practice was that the post of chief cabinet secretary went to a 
politician who had served the prime minister as his confidant 
for a long time. The relationship between the prime minister and 
the chief cabinet secretary has changed under the coalition 
government. Less than two years have passed since the prime 
minister and Mr. Takemura began to work together as political 
allies. It seems that Mr. Takemura thinks of himself as a key 
player on an equal footing with the prime minister. At the prime 
minister's official residence, their uneasy relationship has 
become the daily target of attention.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo [Japanese Trade 
Union Confederation], held a news conference at Rengo's 
headquarters on 15 February. Commenting on Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's expressed desire to reshuffle the cabinet 
soon, Yamagishi said, "This is not desirable. There is the 
danger of creating turmoil at a time of peace," stressing his 
negative view of the plan. He cited the following reasons for 
his negative attitude: 1) a mistake in carrying out the 
reshuffle may cause a crack in the political base of the 
coalition government; 2) it is too early because the cabinet was 
formed only six months ago; and 3) right now, the important 
thing is to pass the third supplementary budget and the fiscal 
1994 budget as soon as possible. He hoped to strongly dissuade 
the prime minister, saying "the prime minister cannot do 
whatever he wants to the extent of ignoring the wishes of the 
ruling coalition parties." 
  Regarding talk of Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the only leader of the ruling 
parties who is not a cabinet member, joining the administration 
in the event of an early cabinet reshuffle, Yamagishi said, 
"This is possible. It is necessary to take the incumbent 
chairman hostage (as a cabinet member) to make sure the SDPJ 
will never say it will leave the coalition."

<F P=106> [Article by Soichiro Tahara: "`Pondering Ichiro Ozawa'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Lately excitement about Ozawa 
has again begun to run high. Just what kind of person is Ichiro 
Ozawa? 
  When the news and events of each day pass, I ponder over 
Ichiro Ozawa, the strong man behind the coalition government. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN (morning edition) of 5 November [1993] 
reported at the top of page one that "Kajima Made Regular 
Donations of 5 Million Yen to Ozawa at Bon and Yearend 
Festivals." 
  Moreover, the "Information Space J" program of TBS [Tokyo 
Broadcasting System, Inc.] reported, with pictures of bundles of 
banknotes, that during the last election, more than one 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] candidate received campaign 
funds of 20 million yen apart from the 5 million yen candidate 
official-endorsement money. Furthermore, weekly magazines are 
writing about "secret election measures" of Ozawa's election 
saying, "A succession of `accusations' is flowing in from 
contractors in `Ozawa's Kingdom,' Iwate Prefecture." There is 
no other politician like Ichiro Ozawa on whom opinion is so 
greatly divided. For that reason, he is a person around whom 
myths grow and who plays upon one's imagination, whether one 
likes it or not. 
  An executive of the Liberal Democratic Party, who was 
formerly Ozawa's staunch friend, once commented that "Ozawa is a 
rare kind of idealist." He also said, "That is Ozawa's defect." 
A leading executive of Shinseito explains that "Ozawa is not 
good at talking, and he is also not good at getting along with 
people. He is a very awkward person." 
  Indeed, when one reads Ozawa's best seller, Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan, one can glimpse "an awkward 
idealist." 
<H3>  Sweep Away the Gap Between Principles and the Opacity of 
Politics </H3>
  Ozawa emphasizes repeatedly in his book that Japanese lack 
the principle of self-responsibility and that Japanese society 
has developed into an irresponsible state of collusion and 
mutual dependence. 
  He insists that political leadership should be firmly 
established and advocates decentralization and abolition of 
regulations. 
  None of these are novel. But his manner of speech is so very 
earnest and intent that the ordinary content and commonplace 
statements make one feel a certain wonder and even fear. 
  The characters for "leadership" and "determination," which 
he 
writes repeatedly, begin to appear to have the meaning 
"forceful" and "acting arbitrarily on one's own authority." 
  Then, I recall a number of episodes which spawned "legends 
of 
forcefulness" concerning Ozawa. 
  One is the "dumping of Suzuki," who was the incumbent 
governor, before the April 1991 election for governor of Tokyo. 
Ozawa became notorious at one stroke as being a "young dictator" 
who discarded in a high-handed manner the venerable, 80-year-old 
governor who was brimming over with desire to do the job. 
  And there is the incident of summoning the three candidates 
in the autumn 1991 election for LDP party president, Miyazawa, 
Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka. 
  His bad reputation of being "conceited" or a "dictator" 
increased still more because the young acting chairman, of all 
things, summoned to his private office faction chairmen who were 
older than him. 
  There is more. The incident of the 5 million yen donation 
from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to Kanemaru in the autumn of 1992. The 
criticism that Ozawa dealt with this arbitrarily without 
consulting with the other executives of the Keiseikai [Takeshita 
faction], and that he failed. There even appeared an Ozawa coup 
d'etat theory to the effect that, actually, Ozawa tried to take 
over the Keiseikai by plotting Kanemaru's downfall, and right 
after that the Keiseikai broke up. Of course, when one gathers 
information about the innermost workings of this kind of 
"forceful" "arbitrariness," those close to Ozawa explain that 
his tactless frankness is twisted and disorted and that legends 
which depart greatly from Ozawa's intentions have taken on a 
life of their own. 
  They say of the "dumping of Suzuki" incident that Governor 
Suzuki, himself, stated that "a three-party setup of the LDP, 
Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party is a 
precondition for running," and when the Komeito, on whom they 
had depended, decided not to support him, Ozawa sought another 
candidate, but later Suzukireversed his own statement. On the 
incident of summoning the three candidates in the election for 
party president, they say that when Ozawa first contacted 
Watanabe's office and told him that he would go there, Ozawa was 
told that "due to the circumstances of his schedule of 
activities, Watanabe would go to meet him," and since it worked 
out that way, the other candidates also arranged to come to 
Ozawa's place. 
  They say, "tactless frankness".... But such things as the 
suspicion concerning general contractors, the suspicion 
concerning Sagawa Kyubin, and Ozawa's relationship with Rekiji 
Kobari, who died on the 7th, cannot be explained by "tactless 
frankness." If Ozawa has seriously decided to be a reformer, he 
should first sweep away the suspicions that cling to him and the 
opacity of the old politics. There is too great a gap between 
them and the principles that Ozawa talks about.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shigeo Mochizuki, vice minister of </F>
construction, by Koji Oguni, EKONOMISUTO editor; place and date 
not given: "Designating Bidders Is Not a Power But a Duty to the 
People"] 
  [Text] Shigeo Mochizuki, vice minister of 
construction, was born in 1935 in Nagano Prefecture. After 
graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo University, he 
entered the Ministry of Construction. After temporary transfers 
to Ibaragi Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and the National Land 
Agency, he became Economic Affairs Bureau director general in 
1988 and director of the Secretariat in 1990. He has held his 
present post since July 1993. 
  Problems with bidding on public works have led to the 
arrest of regional government leaders and top executives of the 
nation's major construction companies. "The cause of the scandal 
lies in both defects of the system and the way the system is 
operated," said Vice Minister of Construction Shigeo Mochizuki, 
whose ministry is in charge of supervising public works bidding. 
Vice Minister Mochizuki was interviewed about bidding and other 
matters. 
<H5>  Problems of the System and Problems of Its Management </H5>
  [Oguni] Recently, problems have been occurring so rapidly, 
one after another, that you almost get the impression that the 
entire Japanese archipelago has been completely contaminated by 
the corruption of construction companies. What do you think of 
the situation? 
  [Mochizuki] I don't have the words to express how irritated 
I 
am by it. I'm thoroughly exasperated. The majority of the 
520,000 companies and 6 million workers in the construction 
industry do their work honestly and seriously. With this kind of 
corruption scandal, though, the entire industry gets criticized, 
and that, the administration and I feel, is intolerable. 
  One other thing. Since last year we've come out with almost 
30 trillion yen in economic stimulus measures. Most, though, 
involve construction investment and public works that are to be 
carried out by the companies that have caused the scandal. As a 
result, the stimulus measures are not necessarily progressing 
very smoothly, as can be seen at some of the [construction] 
sites. 
  [Oguni] First, about the role of the Ministry of 
Construction 
as the supervisory agency for bidding. If corruption exists to 
this extent, it means that, as you've said, there are problems 
in the bidding system, as a result of which you're studying open 
public bidding under certain conditions. In this process, what 
is your main focus? 
  [Mochizuki] It's a fact that various things about the 
bidding 
system are now being questioned. However, I don't think that 
[the problems with] the bidding system and the current series of 
scandals are directly linked on an equal, one-to-one basis. The 
reasons for the scandals are, first, problems with the system, 
and second, the way the system is managed--in other words, 
problems with the morals of those who commission and those who 
are commissioned to do public works. The scandals occurred, I 
think, because these various problems having become so pervasive. 
  Therefore, I don't think that the system is responsible for 
everything, although, when you look at it calmly, it does 
contain elements that contribute to the occurrence of such 
scandals, and those elements have to be corrected. That is the 
main focus. 
  In Japan, ever since the Public Accounting Act of 1899, open 
public bidding has been the guiding principle on the books. 
However, it has come about that, especially in cases where there 
are special circumstances, a system of designated bidding is 
used. 
  On the other hand, the contracts related to commissioning 
public works are different than those for buying and selling 
goods. When the contract is made, there are no products. The 
problem is thus how to guarantee that what the commissioning 
party wants will be finished within the work period, will be 
inexpensive, and will have the desired quality. 
  Therefore, in a competitive system, the commissioning party, 
to get excellent work at a price as low as possible, will choose 
companies whose abilities can be trusted and get them to compete 
against each other for the work. That, based on our experience, 
is what has been found to be most appropriate. It's what the 
central and local governments and the related agencies have been 
doing. 
  Actually, after the war, based on a directive from GHQ 
[Allied General Headquarters], Japan National Railways used open 
public bidding. The result was terrible problems and a very 
bitter experience. 
  Since the bidding was free and open, all kinds of companies 
entered: ones with construction ability and ones without. To be 
more precise, there were irresponsible companies and front 
companies. Careless work was continually being done, so, to 
prevent it, it was necessary to employ an enormous number of 
supervisors and so on. In any case, it was a bitter experience. 
  And due to experiences like that, we have come to use 
designated competitive bidding. That said, however, it is coming 
to be seen, from these latest scandals, that designated bidding 
has been conducted under the illusion that it is the 
commissioning party that has the power. 
  Therefore, we have to rethink both the system and the way it 
is managed. So we're studying a system of open bidding conducted 
under certain conditions. However, the conditions would have to 
be able to guarantee such things as that reliable companies got 
the work and did it according to the desired specifications. The 
conditions would have to be objective; no arbitrariness could be 
allowed in. In this connection, we are currently attempting to 
introduce a new contract system. 
<H3>  The Bitter Experience of Interference by Gangster 
Organizations </H3>
  [Oguni] What I keep thinking as I'm listening is, Why did 
you 
go to a system of designated bidders? Vice minister, you spoke 
in rather muted terms about the experience with companies that 
didn't fulfill the required conditions, but still participated 
in open bidding. To put it more bluntly, weren't those companies 
gangster organizations? 
  [Mochizuki] Yes, there were those, and also paper companies. 
To put it briefly, it's a fact there was a bitter experience 
with ill-mannered companies, or company-like organizations, that 
interfered. 
  [Oguni] Would there be a danger of that happening today if 
you had a completely open system of bidding? 
  [Mochizuki] If we made the qualifications for participating 
in bidding such that companies without technical ability--I'm 
not just talking about gangster organizations--could 
participate, the overwhelming majority of serious companies 
would suffer and enormous confusion would result--which would 
not be in the best interests of the country. 
  [Oguni] Even so, with a system of designated bidding there's 
the problem that it's hard for new companies to participate 
unless they make a considerable [preliminary] effort. That has 
especially been the situation for foreign companies. 
  [Mochizuki] As you say, this is a big problem. How do you 
tell whether a company is reliable? The easiest way is from its 
track record. In the case of domestic companies, we can see 
their total record--not just their public works construction, 
but their private sector construction as well--so in that sense 
our approach are not exclusionary. 
  Regarding the participation of foreign companies, though, 
you 
can't but doubt the logic of only looking at a company's record 
of work done inside Japan when Japanese markets have been 
internationalized. I think it is necessary to think about a more 
flexible, realistic system for evaluating companies. 
  [Oguni] If it comes about that, in principle, the system is 
open except for some basic standards that have to be met and 
those standards are transparent, then the current situation will 
change considerably, won't it? 
  [Mochizuki] Yes, probably. But I would like to emphasize 
that 
our position is not to try to bring about open public bidding, 
under certain conditions, for all public works. For example, in 
the case of regional public works, if you consider such things 
as the policy for helping small and medium-sized companies or 
the speed needed in recovering from a disaster, it's better to 
use companies that are closely linked to the region. However, 
for work like that which the major construction companies do and 
which has become the subject of an international problem, I 
think that open public bidding with conditions is better. 
  Looking at examples from overseas, every country uses a 
bidding system geared to its particular circumstances. The U.S. 
system is said to be the freest. England used to have open 
bidding, but at a certain point they changed to designated 
bidding. The other main European countries have a system 
somewhere between the American and the British. 
  However, even in the United States, which is said to have 
the 
freest system, a company's qualifications are strictly 
investigated. In the Japanese system of designated competitive 
bidding, an investigation is carried out at the beginning of the 
bidding process, whereas in the U.S. system it is at the end--as 
a result of having submitted a bid--that a check is rigorously 
carried out. 
  In Japan, we have been conducting, since September, open 
public bidding on a trial basis with regard to more than 1 
billion yen's worth of construction. To introduce it in earnest 
in the future, though, we would first have to put various 
systems in order. There's the problem of the registration system 
and ranking, and whether the methods of accident investigation 
and management investigation that have been used until now are 
fine as is or have to be adjusted and made more transparent. 
  [Oguni] Then there's the problem of the way the system is 
managed. In the commissioning of public works, doesn't the party 
that gives the commission have an enormous amount of power? 
Wouldn't it be possible to make a little more equal the 
one-sidedness of the relationship between the commissioning 
party and commissioned party? 
  [Mochizuki] It's just as you say. If there's not a 
relationship of equality, then the contract between the two 
parties won't be fair. Designating is not a power; it is a duty 
to the people. As persons who use the people's taxes, we are in 
the position of acting for the people when we designate bidders. 
Therefore, there must be no arbitrariness involved [in the 
designation process]. Otherwise, the relationship between us, 
the commissioning party and the commissioned party, will be 
one-sided. 
  To give an example, there's the problem of companies that 
are 
designated to bid, but come to not want to bid but still have 
difficulty refusing to bid. In projects directly under the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, companies are free 
to refuse to be designated, and the same goes for the 
prefectures and the cities, towns, and villages. But if a 
company thinks, "If we withdraw, then we'll be treated badly and 
have trouble the next time around," it will not refuse. 
  If we place ourselves in the position that the act of 
designating is not a matter of power but a duty, a 
responsibility, to the people, then the system will naturally 
change. For example, at the Ministry of Construction eight 
standards are used when designating a bidder (designation 
standards). Recently, those standards were made concrete and 
objective. In other words, we should adopt designation standards 
and make them open. In short, we have our own standards and we 
will be bound by them. 
<H5>  Lack of Transparency in Cities, Towns, and Villages </H5>
  [Mochizuki] Recently, however, we examined the situation in 
the prefectures and in cities, towns, and villages, and found 
that some have designation standards and some don't. Only one of 
every four cities and one of every six towns and villages has 
standards and has made them public. We want this situation to be 
changed. The Ministry of Construction makes its designation 
process and the names of successful bidders public, but the 
cities, towns, and villages don't; it's a bad situation. 
  [Oguni] Another thing. There is a "work completion guarantor 
system" that provides that, if the company that was number one 
in the bidding is unable to complete the work, the company that 
entered the second-place or the third-place bid will assume 
responsibility and undertake the work. But doesn't that create a 
"dango" atmosphere [an atmosphere that invites collusion]?" 
  [Mochizuki] The bidders lower than second or third place 
don't win because they can't do the work inexpensively, so you 
can't expect them to stand surety for a company that can do it 
inexpensively. 
  There used to be an element of mutual assistance to this 
system; [guarantor companies] had a sense like that of a loan 
guarantor who won't let a project be abandoned half way. Due to 
the way the society has become, however, the system has 
developed problems. Therefore, about two years ago, the Ministry 
of Construction revised its policy of choosing the work 
completion guarantor from among the designated bidders, to one 
of choosing from a broad range of companies that are at least 
the equal of the winning bidder. 
  It is said that the work completion guarantor is chosen from 
the designated bidders in 17 percent of cities and 42 
percent--an extremely high frequency--of towns and villages. 
This is an enormous problem. But from the commissioning party's 
point of view, if companies are ranked A, B, C, D, and E and you 
have B-class work guaranteed by a C- or D-ranked company, you're 
worried. 
  So in that sense, these practices are easy to understand. 
But 
saying "Choose the guarantor from among the designated bidders" 
can promote "dango," and that has to be eliminated. 
  [Oguni] Then there is the problem of human relationships. 
Friends who studied together in college, or perhaps had an upper 
classman/lower classman [senpai/kohai] relationship there, go to 
work, one as a technical official in the Ministry of 
Construction, the other in a general construction company. Also, 
when technical officials reach a certain age, they receive a 
post-retirement appointment [amakudari] in a general 
construction company. Because they've associated with each other 
since they were young, they might not realize how cliquish they 
are, but it seems to me that their relationships are a breeding 
ground for cliquism. What do you think? 
  [Mochizuki] That view is often expressed these days, but for 
me it's painful to hear. A person naturally values throughout 
his life the people with whom he went to college. To deny it 
would be untrue. 
  The point is, though, we are public servants, and we are 
aware of ourselves as such. To behave according to personal 
ideas and feelings--cliquism--is, in a word, impermissible. 
<H5>  Using the Scandal as an Opportunity To Straighten Up </H5>
  [Oguni] So you can't tell a friend what to do? 
  [Mochizuki] No, we can't. A system of civil servants cannot 
function properly if a person uses his position to pursue even 
the slightest personal interest, such as trying to get on good 
terms with a company for when he golden parachutes out of the 
government. 
  Until now, when an official from the Ministry of 
Construction 
has retired and then gone to work at a general construction 
company, the company has had to sign an oath saying, "We won't 
involve him in business related to government agencies." As to 
what actually happens, however... Enforcement of the oath has 
been a topic of concern. 
  [Oguni] Until now I've been asking about the relationship 
between civil servants and the private sector, but there is one 
other relationship: that between the commissioning party [civil 
servants] and politicians. All things considered, [civil 
servants] are in a strong position, but isn't the position of 
politicians even stronger? Companies use various means to 
influence politicians and make demands of them, which can result 
in bribery cases. The one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] has ended and the political situation has changed, 
but what will happen with the relationship between bureaucrats 
(civil servants) and politicians? 
  [Mochizuki] With regard to the work under the direct 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction, I am certain that 
there is no intervention by politicians in the commissioning 
process. We have a Designation Investigation Committee whose 
chairman is not chosen in an election but is rather a civil 
servant--the head of a regional construction bureau or of a 
construction work office. As far as I know, the committee 
members have never instructed the officials in charge of 
designation to do this or do that. In particular, with regard to 
the public works worth 1 billion yen or more (work for the major 
construction companies), a committee chaired by the the vice 
minister double-checks the work of the Designation Investigation 
Committee. So the original plan is almost never changed. 
  Perhaps civil servants related to the commissioning of 
public 
works and politicians related to it have different standpoints, 
although that's just a personal opinion of mine---because 
governors, as well as the mayors of cities, towns and villages, 
are both civil servants and politicians. So I wouldn't want to 
speak carelessly about different standpoints. But, in any case, 
what is important is having designation standards and having a 
Designation Investigation Committee and establishing total 
transparency. 
  This latest scandal has been taken very hard, and seen as 
shocking, by everybody involved in commissioning public works. 
These problems existed before the changeover to the new 
government. However, the idea that it is time to straighten 
one's collar--to fix what's wrong with the system--now needs to 
become stronger than ever. At the Ministry of Construction, we 
will get the views of people in all fields and tackle the 
problems with determination.

"Adhesive Structure of Bureaucracy and Industry Obvious"] 
  [Text] There are 1,012 persons who have made the "descent 
from heaven" [amakudari, that is, the practice of 
retiring from government bureaucracy to serve as a corporate 
official] to the 2,128 total listed companies. One in five 
companies accepts amakudari. The triumvirate are the Ministries 
of Construction, Finance, and International Trade and Industry. 
The actual state of bureaucracy and industry adhesion is clear. 
  Japanese society has been formed by the "iron triangle" of 
politicians, bureaucrats, and industrialists. The arena 
cultivated for a long time by both politicians and 
industrialists has become too fat and now, a series of general 
contractor bribes has shaken the islands of Japan. 
  The bureaucratic system, which is another apex, was shaped 
in 
the early Meiji period [1868-1912], and its system of control 
has extended for over one century. Particularly after World War 
II, politicians and industrialists united to push economic 
reconstruction based on the leadership of the bureaucrats in 
order to rebuild the devastated country. 
  The structure of bureaucrats and industrialists leaning on 
each other has been formed in the shape of industry accepting a 
large number of amakudari bureaucrats to obtain protection for 
their own company and industry and the newest information. 
  A survey of amakudari officers from the bureaucracy in 
private firms was made recently by TOYO KEIZAI, and all of their 
names have been ascertained. The target firms were 2,175 
companies with a total of 40,800 employees. Added to all 2,128 
listed firms were 47 life and nonlife insurance companies and 
other nonlisted firms, as well as major economic agencies such 
as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. (See 1994 edition of 
"Political and Government Agency Personnel Record")

<H5>  Amakudari for One in Five Companies </H5>
  The total number of amakudari officers identified for the 
first time by TOYO KEIZAI is 1,070 persons. The firms accepting 
them amount to 500 companies. Since there are a total of 1,012 
officers and 474 companies pertaining just to listed firms, one 
in 4.5 companies has installed amakudari bureaucrats as officers. 
  The number of amakudari officers in private firms at the 
point in time of last year was 1,020 persons, and this number on 
the 1,000 person level has hardly changed at all for the past 10 
years. 
  It is said that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been 
decisively at the top of amakudari to private firms for the past 
20 years and according to the recent survey also, they were tops 
with 189 people. Next was the Ministry of Construction (MOC), 
which is the government agency supervising general contractors 
that has been shaken by bribery, with 176 people, followed by 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) with 99. 
However, if nonlisted firms are excluded and all listed firms 
are made the target, the results are that MOF and MOC change 
order--with the MOC in first, MOF in second, and MITI in third. 
  The fact that MOF becomes the top if the nonlisted firms are 
added is because the financial institutions which are the domain 
of MOF account for the majority of the nonlisted firms that were 
the target of the survey. Viewing collectively that 75 percent 
of the amakudari sites for both MOF and MOC are related 
industries, the relationship of the bureaucracy and industry via 
amakudaris becomes clear. 
  Moreover, 260 persons are also amakudari from special 
corporations such as public corporations, but when separated by 
supervising government agency, the prominence of MOC is 
conspicuous here too. Since 75 percent of public corporation 
officers come from the main ministry according to the "Amakudari 
White Paper" by the Federation of Government Special Corporation 
Employees (Seiroren), there should be several among these 260 
people who came from a former government agency which this 
survey did not touch. 
  The fact that bureaucrats with high positions in the main 
ministry move to important jobs such as director of a special 
corporation has been pointed out every year in the 
aforementioned "Amakudari White Paper" which considers only 
special corporations as the target of amakudari sites. 
Therefore, a survey of the migrating group coming from the three 
major ministries is in Table 2.

  There is Takashi Tanaka, currently president of the Bank of 
Yokohama who went from MOF vice minister to president of the 
People's Finance Corp. and president of the Export-Import Bank 
of Japan. There is Takanari Sugiura who was appointed chairman 
of All Nippon Airways after serving as Ministry of Transport 
(MOT) vice minister, president of Japan National Railways, and 
chief director of Japan National Railways Liquidation Corp. 
There is Shigeo Sawada who became vice president of NTT after 
serving as Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications vice 
minister and chief director of the Postal Savings Association. 
It probably can be said that the pattern here of the high class 
bureaucrat is to have a long, elegant amakudari life by 
wandering through public corporations and finally settling down 
in a private firm. 
  The treatment in private firms for one in four is generally 
high, starting with former MOF bureaucrats, with a position of 
president or higher. Moreover, the ranking of MOF and MITI has 
taken the form of endorsing what are generally called "the 
popular ministries." 
  Calculating on the basis of survey results (Labor 
Administration Research Institute) that the average annual 
remuneration for full-time officers is 18,507,000 yen, the total 
annual remuneration for amakudari listed firm officers is 
roughly 18.7 billion yen. You might say that an enormous sum of 
about 20 billion yen has been appropriated as "amakudari officer 
support expenses" by listed firms. 
  Moreover, making a trial calculation of amakudari officer 
support expenses by ministry including positions, it becomes 4.5 
billion yen for MOF, 3.6 billion yen for MOC, and 2.3 billion 
yen for MITI. The various ministries must be eager to create 
"designated chairs" of posts that can be inherited from senior 
to junior. It probably can be taken that these expenses that are 
paid by the firms indicate the vested interests as it were of 
the three ministries. 
<H5>  Construction Industry Is Still a Hotbed </H5>
  With the coming of the Hosokawa administration, interest is 
again increasing about relaxation of regulations, but what about 
the relationship between permit/license authority and amakudari? 
  The total number of permits and licenses for 1992 reached 
10,942 according to the Management and Coordination Agency, and 
the ranking by numbers are the MOT (1,966), MITI (1,915), 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (1,357), and 
thereafter to the MOF, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the 
MOC. 
  It would be thought that the ministries with the more 
permits 
and licenses would have stronger adhesion with firms, but the 
ranking by ministry from which amakudari officers come is 
somewhat different. The relationship with amakudari is not 
simply the number of permits and licenses, and it can be 
presumed that existence of power invisible to the eye that 
controls the life or death of a firm operates in acceptance. 
  According to the National Public Services Law, approval of 
the National Personnel Authority (NPA) is necessary if a 
bureaucrat is reemployed in a private firm that has a deep 
relationship with the post that he held within two years after 
his retirement (approval for 208 people in 1992). However, 
looking at the actual situation in which the majority are 
amakudari into related industries, it is understood that the 
process of approval by the NPA perhaps has become somewhat of a 
shell. 
  As became clear in the recent survey, the majority of the 
amakudari sites are related industries with the exception of the 
National Tax Administration where on the scene veterans join as 
auditors across various industrial sectors. 
  As opposed to the amakudari side which is in fact been 
turned 
to pasture, what kind of features are in the side accepting them?

  Taken up in Table 3 is a list of former bureaucrats who are 
amakudari to large and medium size general contractor listed 
firms from MOC as well as special corporations related to 
construction. It is learned that firms that accept public works 
projects, which account for 30 percent of the total construction 
demand, accept amakudari bureaucrats across the board. 
  The 475 listed companies that accept amakudari officers 
equates to 22 percent of the whole. With regard to the 84 
companies in the construction industry, it is 75 companies and 
the acceptance rate climbs to 89 percent. In the construction 
industry, in addition to those from MOC and related public 
corporations accounting for half of the amakudari officers, 
distribution for the remaining "three public works ministries" 
is 20 percent for those from the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries, and those from other ministries or 
agencies and public corporations sharing the remaining 30 
percent. 
  Moreover, while it is said that amakudari officers "make use 
of their experience and skill in private enterprise," almost all 
becomes officers in charge of marketing. This industry indeed 
has become a hot bed for amakudari coiling around various vested 
interests. 
  It is said that the industry is mature and MOF influence in 
city banks has become less that before, but nevertheless, 36 
percent of the banks accept amakudari from MOF bureaucrats. If 
those from the Bank of Japan are included in that, amakudari 
officers exist at 46 percent of the city banks. 
  That is 53 percent at regional banks (72 percent including 
the Bank of Japan). It is 68 percent at secondary regional banks 
(79 percent including the Bank of Japan), including Hyogo Bank 
where the former director of the MOF Banking Bureau was sent in 
as president, and the smaller the scale of the financial 
institution, the more the amakudari percentage climbs. 
  Is this because the larger the bank, the weaker the 
influence of MOF or the smaller the bank, the more the power of 
MOF old boys is needed? 
<H5>  Expectations for Administrative Reform Council </H5>
  The pipeline between central government ministries and 
agencies and the industrial world, which has been built up over 
a long time, is too large and fat, and its overall image is 
difficult to grasp. It clearly was impossible in this survey, 
and there are many other amakudari bureaucrats. amakudari 
bureaucrats exist in public service corporations which amount to 
20,000, special corporations and non-listed firms outside the 
target of this survey, and in posts other than officers in 
listed firms. 
  In the political world, the one-party rule of the Liberal 
Democratic Party has crumbled and a crack is entering one corner 
of the "iron triangle" that has controlled Japan for over a 
century. At this juncture, the Third Administrative Reform 
Council is preparing an Administrative Reform Council report 
incorporating policy to correct amakudari. 
  An amakudari officer states, "Among large firms, there are 
some areas that are more or less bureaucratic. There also are 
some areas where things go smoothly that way. I serve a private 
firm in those areas." The excellence of Japanese bureaucrats and 
the strong bureaucratic structure have been known for a long 
time in the world and here there is not the slightest doubt 
about what is bureaucratic. 
  Indeed, among the officers recently revealed, there probably 
are some to whom so-called amakudari does not apply. Moreover, 
there probably also is a plus aspect in that amakudari has 
smoothed the relationship between the bureaucracy and industry 
and contributed to economic growth. There also is the aspect 
that ministries and agencies have been able to demonstrate 
efficiently the function of their organization by amakudari. 
  It is necessary not to criticize amakudari unilaterally 
alone, but also to requestion a new way for personnel matters, 
including an extension of the retirement age and increase in pay 
for bureaucrats.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has given rather unusual instructions to economic organs, 
including the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations 
[Keidanren] that, in commenting on the economic stimulus package 
announced recently, they should "indicate" to outsiders "a high 
appraisal" of the program. This was disclosed in a document 
obtained by TOKYO SHIMBUN on 13 February. 
  This document, which also includes a "model" comment, urges 
economic organs to clarify their position on supporting 
correction of the gap in the ratio between direct and indirect 
taxes, and also on demanding a "prompt decision" on how 
financial sources will be secured to make up for losses from tax 
cuts -- an issue that has been discussed among various political 
parties following the rejection of the "national welfare tax" 
concept. In this way, MITI imposes pressure on the economic 
organs to make a high appraisal of the package. However, the 
economic circles have reacted strongly, saying: "It is 
tantamount to control of speech by bureaucrats." Moreover, in 
view of the fact that bureaucrats are being criticized for 
"controlling Japan," the MITI document will most likely create a 
stir in the international community. 
  On the afternoon of 8 February, before a cabinet decision 
was 
made on the comprehensive economic package, MITI sent the 
document to various economic organs, including Keidanren, the 
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI], the Japan 
Federation of Employers' Associations [JFEA], and the Japan 
Association of Corporate Executives [JACE]. The document 
entitled "Draft Comments on the Economic Package" is mainly made 
up of "major points" and "model" answers that economic organs 
should make when asked by new agencies to comment on the details 
of the economic package. 
  Among the points clearly stated in the document are: that 1) 
they should welcome and highly appraise the government's 
decision on launching the package totalling over 15 trillion 
yen; 2) that they should support the government's plan for 
correcting the gap in ratios between direct and indirect taxes; 
3) that they should call for an end to discussion on tax system 
reform, including the issue of how to finance losses from tax 
cuts, at an early date so as to obtain public consensus on the 
reform; and 4) that they should indicate their intention to 
immediately take measures based on early legislation of budget 
and tax reform bills. 
  Moreover, the document gives several "model" answers based 
on 
these points. For example: "The package can be highly appraised 
as a decisive judgement made by the ruling parties and 
government." Even a proviso is attached to the document, saying 
they should highly appraise the package "by touching on proper 
content" such as concrete examples concerning tax cuts. 
  In response, however, the business circles maintain that 
"the 
document should not be accepted" because it is unprecedented. 
Another top business leader also strongly criticized MITI and 
expressed his displeasure openly. He said: "MITI intends to 
mold public opinion by trying to convey the will and ideas of 
those who govern to those who are governed." Thus, evaluations 
of the package announced by the four major economic organs did 
not exclusively support it. For instance, JAEC Chairman Masaru 
Hayami even indicated dissatisfaction with the land tax system, 
and said: "It will have only a limited effect on promoting land 
transactions." Thus, the four economic organs managed to repel, 
for the time being, the pressure imposed on them by MITI. 
  However, being a MITI-authorized corporation formed on the 
basis of the Law on Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the JCCI 
maintains delicate relations with MITI. Thus, in the comments 
issued on the evening of 8 February in the name of Chairman 
Kosaku Inaba, the JCCI stated: "We welcome the liberal measure 
of earmarking 1.3 trillion yen to help small and medium-sized 
companies." In this comment, it can be noted that some 
"consideration" must be given to MITI's intention. 
  In response to opposition from business circles, a senior 
MITI official first admitted sending such a document to economic 
organs, and then denied it was an attempt to impose pressure on 
them. He explained that "the document is designed to make them 
fully understand the package, but 'they are not asked' to act in 
accordance with the document." 
  According to MITI Administrative Vice Minister Hedeaki 
Kumano: "No instructions were given to make draft comments nor 
did I know what was all about. Generally speaking, when an 
economic package has been worked out, a briefing will be given 
to the business circles so as to make them fully aware of the 
package. This time we tried to give them a briefing. I don't 
think instructions were given as to how the package should be 
appraised..."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make Defense Spending Curb the Starting Point </F>
for Amending `Guideline'"] 
  [Text] Concerning the growth in the fiscal year 1994 
defense budget, which has become one of the focal points of the 
fiscal year 1994 budget, the finance minister and the Defense 
Agency [DA] director general agreed on 14 February, at the end 
of their budget deal, to increase the defense budget by 0.92 
percent. Hence, the increase in the defense budget will be 
curbed to less than 1 percent for the first time in 34 years 
since 1960, when its increase was curbed to 0.6 percent. We 
pointed out when the Finance Ministry announced a draft of the 
fiscal year 1994 budget that the curb on the defense budget is a 
trend that reflects the current times. 
  With the tight fiscal policy envisioning an increase of only 
1.0 percent in the entire national budget, the defense budget 
cannot be increased exceptionally. Given the post-Cold War 
situation of the world and the Far East region, the curb on the 
defense budget is an inevitable decision and a matter of course. 
  In his speech last fall at a ceremony reviewing the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF], Prime Minister Hosokawa unveiled his 
plan to review the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan" and 
stressed that "Japan should take the initiative in promoting 
disarmament worldwide." 
  In response, the Finance Ministry planned to curb the 
increase in the fiscal year 1994 defense budget to a negative 
figure by cutting back on the procurement of military hardware 
even before the guideline is reviewed. Meanwhile, the prime 
minister is said to have intended to curb the growth in the 
defense budget to zero. The DA, however, vehemently resisted 
this. 
  The DA has claimed that 1) although it is said that European 
nations and the United States have been promoting arms control 
and disarmament, what they actually are doing is reducing their 
so-called redundant war capabilities; 2) unlike in Europe, there 
is no framework for disarmament and collective security 
arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region, and 3) in particular, 
an unstable situation continues to be present in the states 
neighboring Japan. 
  The DA has opposed any attempt to curb the growth in the 
defense budget, saying that about 80 percent of the defense 
budget goes for personnel and food expenses and payments for 
military equipment procured in past years. The DA has also 
asserted that if funding for the repair of major military 
hardware is slashed, this would ground many aircraft and keep 
many ships in port, thereby scuttling the SDF's plans to carry 
out training and maintain Japan's security. 
  The potential Soviet [as published] threat to Japan has now 
decreased largely, and the United States has cut its 1995 
defense budget by 0.9 percent. The current situation is that 
the SDF cannot avoid making itself lean. 
  The DA has so far worked to "build the SDF into a force 
beloved by the people," and we believe that its efforts to make 
the SDF a lean force will be welcomed by the people. Japan's 
neighbors in Asia, who have been concerned about the emergence 
of Japan as a military power, are also expected to welcome the 
DA's efforts. 
  What is noteworthy is that the growth of the defense budget 
has been curbed to less than 1.0 percent, but there is one point 
that we cannot clearly understand. 
  The percentage of the defense budget compared to the entire 
general accounts budget still remains unchanged. In the past 
few years, the ratio has hovered around 6.2-6.4 percent, and 
this time, the ratio stands at 6.4 percent. 
  In other words, the ratio of the defense budget compared to 
the overall budget remains as it has been. 
  The inclusion in the defense budget of the procurement of 
airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft and Patriot 
missiles is a question mark. The ruling Social Democratic Party 
of Japan, which has so far opposed their procurement, has agreed 
to this on the condition that the procurement be reexamined in 
the course of reviewing the "guideline." No serious debate has 
been held as to whether Japan really needs the aircraft, and the 
government intends to purchase the aircraft on the grounds that 
the Liberal Democratic Party government earlier promised the 
United States that it would buy it. 
  An advisory body to the prime minister is set to reach 
conclusions on the review of the "guideline" by this summer. 
The prime minister should set a direction of keeping the 
defense budget in check by defining the current curb on the 
defense budget as an important starting point for a future 
institutional curb on the budget.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Government's Draft Budget Has No Clear </F>
Policy Direction"] 
  [Text] The government's draft fiscal 1994 budget has 
finally been decided upon. While the income tax cut is 
included, in all other aspects, there is no clear manifestation 
of the Hosokawa administration's policy direction. As always, 
the draft budget is a duplicate of last year's. 
  The present budget should have been a crucial one both from 
the short-term and the mid- and long-term point of view. It 
should have been designed to achieve: first, a breakaway from 
the three-year-old recession, the most serious in the postwar 
period, led by domestic demand; second, a transition from the 
consistently producer-oriented economy since the end of World 
War II to a consumer-oriented one; and third, laying the 
groundwork for dealing with the aging society. 
  These are policy goals the Hosokawa administration has been 
upholding. Yet, how come there is no trace of them in the 
government's draft budget? 
  Aside from the income tax cut, a major increase in public 
investment is important to boost the economy. While 
appropriations for public works projects are indeed being 
increased by 4 percent compared to the original allocation in 
fiscal 1993, compared to the actual amount expended at the end 
of fiscal 1993, this, in fact, represents a considerable 
decrease. 
  For sure, finances will be in bad shape in the short-term 
because of the issuance of special government bonds for the 
first time in five years. However, we have pointed out time and 
again that an early economic recovery will be indispensable for 
resolving mid- and long-term issues. 
  From the lack of enthusiastic reactions from the economic 
circles to the long-awaited income tax cut and the comprehensive 
economic package, and the present appreciation of the yen, 
another supplementary budget may become necessary fairly soon. 
Moreover, since a provisional budget for more than one month is 
now believed to be inevitable, it is more than clear that the 
budget should have been formulated more meticulously from the 
very beginning. In addition, there is the need to deal with the 
ongoing rapid appreciation of the yen. 
  Even from the point of view of a consumer-oriented economy, 
and preparing for the aging society, the draft budget is a 
failure. The pattern of allocation of funds for public works, 
contrary to the prime minister's campaign promises, has remained 
totally unchanged. The budget is simply a result of all-out 
efforts by Diet members from both the ruling coalition parties 
and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to grab 
appropriations in the time-honored "zoku-giin" [Diet members 
having special interests in certain policy areas] style, and 
desperate efforts on the part of all ministries and agencies to 
maintain their previous appropriation level. We cannot help 
wondering what happened to the "end of the 1955 System [the LDP 
regime]"? 
  In short, the Hosokawa administration's policy ideals are 
not 
reflected in the budget at all. To say the least, this budget 
has nothing to do with the future of the Japanese economy as 
envisioned by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Has the prime 
minister exercised his leadership at all in the process of 
drawing up the budget? The only bright spot is that the income 
tax cut somehow was included. Yet, even this becomes almost 
meaningless if not followed by a radical reform of the taxation 
system. 
  These issues should be discussed thoroughly in the Diet. 
  At the same time, the government should start taking 
concrete 
steps now to effect a radical reform in the budget formulation 
process for fiscal 1995 and beyond. It is impossible to grow 
out of old habits in a short time.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuyuki Hayase, Sakura Bank Research Institute </F>
senior researcher: "Corporate Support Based on Heteronomous 
Coordination Has Not Diminished"] 
  [Text] In the past, Japanese corporations were 
managed from the long-term perspective, but changes in corporate 
financing have caused an increase in the number of stakeholders 
and the future will see greater emphasis placed on the 
"short-term perspective." Even if Japanese corporate policies 
place greater emphasis on the shareholder, substantial leeway 
will still exist to utilize main bank systems which represent 
long-term stakeholders in concurrently preserving heteronomous 
management and growth potential. 
<H5>  Control by Owners and Control by Managers </H5>
  Management styles of Japanese corporations that embrace 
management from a "long-term perspective" are often compared 
with U.S. corporate management which reflects management from a 
"short-term perspective." Management based on the "long-term 
perspective" may sacrifice short-term profits, but assumes a 
posture whereby it strives to secure greater future profits with 
a tendency to place emphasis on market share and revenues. In 
contrast, management based on the "short-term perspective" 
embraces as its foremost objective revenues, profits, and 
appreciation of stock prices and has a tendency to emphasize 
clear-cut numerical values reflected in investments versus their 
effects through such actions as capital investments and product 
development, rather than on the education and training of 
personnel or organizations and systems. 
  A basic principle of the stock company system is that it is 
managed by the owners; i.e., "the corporation is owned by the 
shareholders." Needless to say, as the economy progresses in 
sophistication and complexity and the stock company grows in 
scale, it becomes difficult for the shareholders to actually 
engage in the direct management of operations and a division 
between ownership and management evolves, but as long as 
shareholders retain the final authority to hire and fire 
managers, control by the owners can be considered as being 
maintained. 
  U.S. corporations can be considered as reflecting classical 
corporate formats which strongly characterize owner management 
of this style. Generally speaking, chief operating officers of 
U.S. corporations themselves seldom own stock in the firm they 
represent and serve as pure agents, but because the stock price 
serves as a basis of determining their performance bonus, there 
is a strong tendency for them to pursue the interests (stock 
prices) of shareholders. This is why U.S. corporations tend to 
opt for management from a "short-term perspective." 
  By contrast, in Japan, a manager-controlled format has 
evolved in which managers have taken control of corporations. In 
other words, major shareholders representing cross-shareholding 
among corporations do not concern themselves directly with 
management or operating results and managers entrusted with 
decisionmaking authority have in effect established substantive 
autonomy from owners. 
<H5>  Banks Which Regulate Corporations </H5>
  The question arises how did Japanese corporations maintain 
management effectiveness under the manager-controlled format. 
Stated in another way, shareholders maintained surveillance to 
ensure that U.S. corporate management did not become 
inefficient, but the question is what heteronomous factors other 
than the managers' self-regulating factors functioned in the 
case of Japanese corporations? In Japan, a major role has been 
played in regulating corporate management by "creditors" instead 
of "owners" of corporations, especially financial institutions 
or main banks. 
  This condition is rooted in the fact that the economy in 
postwar Japan was basically faced with a capital deficit and 
corporations were heavily dependent on external debt. Capital 
deficits meant that corporate investment plans were subject to 
severe budgetary restrictions and credit examinations of 
financial institutions serving as main sources of capital or 
their representative main banks functioned to preserve corporate 
management efficiency. 
  However, as economy shifted from high-growth to 
stabilized-growth stages, Japanese corporations were emancipated 
from severe budgetary restrictions and, additionally, the 
proportion of indirect financing for capital procurement 
declined. A survey of major corporations with capitalization in 
excess of 1 billion yen covering the composition of capital 
raised in five-year segments beginning in fiscal year 1970 shows 
that in the fiscal year 1970-1975 period, 79.6 percent of 
capital raised consisted of loans from financial institutions; 
but that in fiscal years 1985 to 1990, capital raised directly 
from financial markets consisted of 55.9 percent of capital 
procured; and that loans from financial institutions had dropped 
to 44.1 percent. Changes in financial transactions of this 
nature have led to a potential decline in the heteronomous 
function of main banks over corporate management. 
  Recently, significant operating difficulties and incidence 
of 
scandals have directed attention to corporate policies in terms 
of the lack of a surveillance function over management control 
and protection of shareholder rights, but it is believed such 
problems are rooted in a major way in changes in corporate 
financing. Environmental changes have rendered it difficult to 
seek heteronomous effects on corporate management solely from 
the main bank sector. 
<H5>  Abuses Emanating From Short-Term Ownership </H5>
  If consideration is given to the trend toward greater 
reliance on a shift from indirect to direct financing known 
accompanied by excessive emphasis of market value of common 
stock and reinforcement of shareholder rights as seen in the 
revision of shareholder class action procedures, it can be said 
that the potential has risen for Japanese corporations to change 
to the classic U.S. corporate format of control by owners. 
However, on the other hand, the classic U.S. corporate format is 
plagued with a major problem amidst excessive emphasis of market 
value of common stock. 
  Because operations of U.S. financial institutions 
traditionally place major emphasis on commercial financing, they 
have a strong tendency to raise funds primarily for large 
corporations directly from capital markets. As an example, a 
look at the procurement method for long-term capital of major 
corporations with capitalization in excess of $1 billion shows 
that 86.9 percent of such funds are obtained through the 
issuance of corporate bonds and additional stock, while loans 
from financial institutions are a mere 13.1 percent. Further, 
even in the area of short-term capital, commercial paper 
balances grew rapidly since the 1980's and as of the end of May 
1993, commercial paper market balances stood at $541.7 billion, 
a figure that almost equalled the $592.5 billion balance for 
commercial and industrial loans. 
  Because major corporations in the United States raise most 
of 
their capital needs directly from financial markets in this 
manner, heteronomous corporate management influences have been 
exercised by the shareholder. Shareholders investing capital are 
logical, important stakeholders exercising an interest in 
corporations and are unmistakable candidates to serve as 
corporate managers. However, in recent years, investment trusts 
and annuity funds have grown in stature and we must focus on the 
gains in prominence of institutions in securities markets. 
Institutional investors are short-term stakeholders who trade in 
stocks based on movements in stock prices. If complete reliance 
is placed on such short-term stakeholders for management of 
corporations, managers cannot help but devote themselves to very 
short-term aspects such as stock price trends and run the risk 
of jeopardizing corporate growth potential. It is well known 
that U.S. corporations are giving increasing consideration to 
management from a "long-term perspective" as practiced by 
Japanese firms. 
<H5>  Heteronomous Function of Main Banks </H5>
  In contrast to the foregoing, employees and main banks can 
be 
considered as representatives of long-term stakeholders. 
Employees develop their careers with corporations or enhance 
their skills in response to the special needs of corporations, 
and as they increase their ties with the destiny of the 
corporation, they hold a major interest in the future of the 
corporation. 
  Since main banks enhance the "productivity" of credit 
information through continuing long-term transactions with 
corporations and possess the incentive to accrue transaction 
benefits, they exercise an interest in applicable corporations 
from a long-term perspective. Moreover, since employees and main 
banks possess knowledge of corporate management and the 
information or know-how to render appraisals, it can be said 
that they are well qualified to serve as members of corporate 
management. 
  I believe it is possible from the foregoing perspective to 
say that while Japan adopted modern capital stock company 
legislation, it has built a management format which in substance 
avoided the abuses inherent in classic corporate formats. In the 
case of Japanese corporations, managers are often selected from 
among employees, thus making it possible to position managers in 
consideration of employee interests, while such an approach 
combined with the heteronomous function of the main banks served 
to create a management system based on the "long-term 
perspective." 
  As stated previously, excessive emphasis on the market value 
of common stock in the United States has given birth to 
distortions based on overemphasis of management from the 
short-term perspective and the simultaneous forfeiture of the 
mechanism whereby they could use bank loans as a shock absorber 
during shifts in management environment and corporate 
operations. If flexibility is diminished in corporate management 
systems of this nature, there is the risk that the condition 
will adversely affect corporate growth. The approach of 
establishing corporate management based on the reinforcement of 
shareholder rights in the management of our nation's 
corporations is an appropriate course in view of changes taking 
place in the financial environment. 
  However, in order to enhance the growth potential of 
corporations, I believe it is important to exercise caution 
against excessive emphasis on market value of common stock, 
while nurturing a system which provides for the appropriate 
merging of heteronomous functions of owners in the form of 
shareholders and creditors in the form of main banks. 
<H5>  Transaction Trends Since Collapse of Bubble </H5>
  However, some quarters appear to have arrived at the 
viewpoint that the main-bank functions of financial institutions 
have been paralyzed in connection with the creation of 
nonperforming debt accompanying the collapse of the bubble. In 
this respect, in this final section of this article, I would 
like to review recent transactions between corporations and main 
banks. 
  We will first examine the shock absorber function of the 
main 
bank in relation to changes in the financial environment. We 
will examine changes in the share of loans issued by main banks 
before and after the collapse of the bubble to a total of 29 
firms, including 24 firms with the highest loan balances from 
banks, and real estate firms with loans outstanding in excess of 
300 billion yen, based on their relatively high dependence on 
bank loans among firms listed on stock exchanges. The 24 firms 
exclude three firms currently undergoing reorganization and 
three firms which were not listed on the stock exchanges at the 
end of fiscal year 1986. An industry breakdown indicates the 
group includes nine trading companies, seven nonbanking 
financial institutions, six real estate firms, six electric 
power companies, and one other firm. 
  During the bubble expansion period of 1986-1989, main bank 
loan share rose for seven firms, 24 percent of the firms covered 
in the survey, while the main bank share loans declined at an 
overwhelming number of 20 firms, 69 percent of the firms. It is 
believed this situation arose from the fact that firms increased 
the number of marginal funding sources during the so-called 
excess money supply period. 
  Subsequently, a look at the situation after the collapse of 
the bubble in fiscal years 1989-1991 shows that the share of 
loans handled by main banks rose at 12 firms, 41 percent, while 
the number of firms where loans dropped totaled 15, 52 percent, 
indicating an increase in the number of firms where main bank 
share of loans rose. Of special significance is that among 
nonbank financial institutions and real estate firms the number 
of firms with rising main bank loans numbered four while those 
with decreasing main bank loans numbered nine during the bubble 
expansion period, in major contrast to nine firms rising and 
three firms dropping after the collapse of the bubble. It is in 
this manner that the main banks' role has expanded during the 
monetary deflationary stage and has served to function as a 
shock absorber for corporations in a changing financial 
environment. 
<H5>  Economically Logical Bank Actions </H5>
  Next, we will examine the shock absorber function of the 
main 
banks as it relates to corporate operating results. We will take 
a look at 35 firms recording deficits for the two most recent 
fiscal years and listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange and examine how loans from main banks fluctuated during 
the five-year period of 1986-1991. Of those firms, the share of 
loans from main banks rose at 22 firms or 63 percent and the 
share of loans from main banks dropped at 13 firms or 37 
percent, indicating that the share of main bank loans rose at 
two-thirds of the firms recording deficits. 
  However, it can be said that main banks are not necessarily 
functioning as shock absorbers at one-third of the firms, thus 
indicating that certain aspects of main bank functions are 
difficult to judge. But, main banks extend aid to firms when 
they suffer from operating difficulties, because if such firms 
fail completely, all the data accumulated in the past on a 
long-term, continuous basis lose their entire value. In other 
words, extension of such aid is the result of judgments based on 
economic logic that short-term aid liabilities are outweighed by 
the investment value of past data collection and productivity. 
On the contrary, if such logic cannot be recognized, there is no 
guarantee that the main bank function will take effect. 
  Actions based on the economic logic of such main banks are 
also important from the standpoint of corporate management. If a 
firm should lapse into operating difficulties and main bank aid 
were available on an unqualified basis, it would mean that no 
budgetary restrictions exist in connection with corporate 
investment actions and result in main banks functioning in a way 
to exacerbate inefficient corporate operations. 
  It is fact that nonperforming loans have been created at 
financial institutions as a result of the bursting bubble and 
that countermeasures to be taken are a major issue for the time 
being, but we do not believe it is appropriate to assume the 
view that those conditions have caused a paralysis in main bank 
functions. We believe that even if Japanese corporate management 
concepts lean toward placing more emphasis on shareholders, 
there will be the potential for continuing use of main bank 
systems in coordinating the diversity of interests, seeking 
corporate growth and providing for heteronomous controls over 
management.

<F P=106> [Article by Taro Kaneko, chairman of Marusan Securities </F>
Company: "Historical Role of Official Discount Rate Ends: 
Official Discount Rate Is Nothing More Than Bank of Japan 
Instrument To Manipulate Major Banks"] 
  [Text] The Japanese economy cannot pull itself out of 
recession despite repeated lowering of the official discount 
rate. It is only logical that skepticism is voiced about the 
economic stimulating effects of the official discount rate. The 
author stresses the need for improvements in financial and 
capital markets, while asserting that the official discount rate 
has lost its raison d'etre. 
<H5>  Transition Signaled by Issuance of Government Bonds </H5>
  Japan's official discount rate functioned well as a system 
until 1969 when we witnessed implementation of the "first hike 
in the official discount rate in the face of international 
balance-of-payments surpluses." 
  After completing the postwar recovery phase and entering 
1955, economic cycles looked good to everyone. Because the 
Japanese economy still possessed vitality, demand outstripped 
supply and management's desire for capital investments was very 
strong. 
  However, because capital accumulations were still meager and 
foreign currency reserves had reached only $2 billion, any 
growth in economic activity soon led to a shortage in foreign 
currency to pay for increasing imports. The barrier posed by the 
foreign currency levels would force the government authorities 
to convert to tighter monetary policies. Government authorities 
would signal their intentions to convert to tighter monetary 
policies by postponing government expenditures and raising the 
official discount rate. When the economy fell during recessions 
and foreign currency reserves accumulated, they would work on 
the recovery of the economy by taking the opposite type of 
actions. 
  It was because of these circumstances that the official 
discount rate functioned like the "red and green" lights of a 
traffic light and the mere announcement of a change had a very 
major impact. 
  A primary segment of the economic policies of those days was 
the low-interest policy. During the days when government policy 
called for progress toward catching up with European and U.S. 
economic levels, a handicap in the area of economic competition 
was the difference in interest levels. Because they were the 
days of the export tax abatement system to promote exports, a 
low-interest policy that sacrificed the interests of depositors 
dominated the situation to satisfy the great cause of 
compensating for differentials between domestic and 
international interest rates. 
  One phase of those policies provided for undisputed 
low-interest, large-volume loans from the Bank of Japan to major 
banks. A limited number of major banks were able to borrow huge 
volumes of funds at low interest rates from the Bank of Japan. 
Preferential treatment of this nature was rarely seen. 
  After 1960, a topic that received wide coverage in the mass 
media was that concerning "excessive loans." All major banks 
maintained huge Bank of Japan loans and call loan balances and 
constant excess liabilities, while basic industries suffered 
from chronic liability excesses because of borrowings from banks 
to pay for aggressive capital investments. Arguments for and 
against the merits of the policies existed, but I recall that 
the final analysis assumed the position that they supplied funds 
necessary for growth and that allocation of sorely needed funds 
to basic industries on a priority basis led to the sound growth 
of the Japanese economy and the enhancement of competitive 
strength. 
  A metamorphosis in the Japanese economy became gradually 
apparent in connection with the first oil shock. International 
competitiveness of industry was strengthened and capital 
accumulations had progressed to a considerable degree. Capital 
markets witnessed the full-scale issuance of secondary stock 
offerings at market prices and the issuance of convertible 
debentures, providing for the establishment of a bond market 
albeit not perfect. It came to a point where no one mentioned 
low-interest policies, and the nation experienced the 
imperceptible demise of the excessive loan issue. 
  Japan's financial markets reached levels approximating those 
of the European and U.S. markets and monetary coordination by 
the Bank of Japan could be adequately handled through its market 
operations. Further, the underlying growth potential of the 
Japanese economy gradually diminished and the provision of 
growth funds lost its significance as a principal issue. 
  These changes in the flow of events were made decisive by 
the 
issuance of government bonds. Because the Ministry of Finance 
adhered to balanced budgets until 1965, provision of growth 
funds depended primarily on Bank of Japan loans. However, when 
government bonds were issued to overcome the recession of 1965, 
adequate growth funds were supplied through the issuance of 
additional government bonds. Further, the Ministry of Finance 
issues government bonds in the form of government construction 
bonds and government deficit bonds, treating the former as 
beneficial and the latter as detrimental, but such labeling can 
be referred to as conventionalism and the merits of issuing 
government bonds should be discussed solely on an objective and 
positive basis. 
<H5>  Impediment to Economic Countermeasures </H5>
  The bubble of the period subsequent to 1985 was caused to a 
large degree by imprudent financial decontrol policies, but that 
period did signal the transformation of Japan into a capital 
supplier nation. Further, the recent collapse of the long-term 
Liberal Democratic Party's one-party government and formation of 
the Hosokawa coalition government probably reflect changes in 
public opinion that seeks a shift from Japanese economic 
policies, which strongly favor preferential treatment of 
manufacturers and corporations to those which provide for the 
interests of consumers and the general public. And, I might add 
that, the appearance of the Clinton administration in the United 
States represents the antithesis of the trend calling for 
emphasis of efficiency and decontrol and deregulation which aims 
at the perpetuation of the theories of the strong. 
  In the case of Japan, controls are much more extensive than 
in the United States and regulations that favor manufacturers 
and corporations are widespread, thus ensuring that decontrol 
will remain a primary issue for the Hosokawa coalition 
government, but I feel that the theory of the powerful as 
embraced by Thatcher, Reagan, and Nakasone faces the fate of 
modification even in Japan. 
  In looking back at economic policies of the six years 
following 1987, there were aspects where the timing was very 
faulty, leading to accelerated overheating and intensive 
over-cooling. During the initial stages of the bubble, the 
Ministry of Finance gave priority to financial reconstruction, 
causing an overburdening of the financial policies, confusion 
based on the theory of a major creditor nation with low interest 
rates and theory of Japan playing the role of anchor nation for 
interest rates, and Japan-bashing by the United States, all 
leading to excessive liquidity. We should treat as a critical 
lesson learned the fact that the money supply grew at 
double-digit rates for four years in a row during that period. 
  If the official discount rate system had not existed, we 
probably would not have adhered to an ostensible interest level 
of 2.5 percent from February 1987 to May 1989. And, I believe we 
could have changed interest rates a more flexible and issued 
warnings that excessive liquidity would lead to unexpected 
situations in the Japanese economy. 
  It is obvious that the existence of the official discount 
rate impeded the quick action of the Bank of Japan and the 
Ministry of Finance even during the economic recession after 
1991. First, it was feared that a drop of the official discount 
rate in the early stages of the recession would cause a 
resumption of the bubble. As evidence of that fear, the Ministry 
of Finance did not lift the ceilings on real estate loans on a 
conditional basis until very near the end of 1991. 
  The official discount rate was dropped from 6.0 percent to 
1.75 percent between July 1991 and September 1992. The Bank of 
Japan stressed during that period that, "Current interest rates 
are at a historically low level," and explained that, "The 
series of rate drops will soon result in the manifestation of 
cumulative effects," but the statements were proven wrong. 
  The 2.5-percent rate following the sixth reduction was same 
as the 2.5-percent level of 1987, and calling that rate a 
"historically low level" was not a mistake, but what is 
important in relation to the economy is the level of real 
interest rates. Even though the official discount rate has 
fallen to 1.75 percent, the real interest rates are not at all 
low. Stressing historically low levels merely serves to degrade 
the authority of the Bank of Japan. 
  Not only has the cumulative effect of seven drops in the 
official discount rate failed to appear at all, but various 
sources now speak of long-term recession and a dropping of the 
bottom of the economy. There is no way that we can realize a 
recovery in the economy solely on the basis of interest 
policies, but we cannot deny a conspicuous decrease in the 
effects of interest policy. The question is, why? 
<H5>  Source of "Subsidies" </H5>
  The reason is that the Bank of Japan call rate is being 
maintained at a high level. Until the spring of last year, 
short-term rates were higher than long-term rates. This 
represented the reversal of short- and long-term rates. Call 
rates approximate the goals of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of 
Japan uses this authority as an instrument to influence the 
short-term financial markets as a whole. 
  The Bank of Japan most probably feared a resumption of the 
bubble until the spring of 1992. Accordingly, long-term interest 
rates where Bank of Japan controls have little effect continued 
to fall in response to market conditions, but the Bank of Japan, 
fearing excess liquidity, maintained short-term rates at levels 
higher than long-term rates and caused large sums of money to be 
parked in call markets. 
  This artificial, illogical reversal of short- and long-term 
rates disappeared with the fourth drop in the official discount 
rate in April 1992. Just as we had thought that change led to 
the normal condition where long-term instruments called for 
higher rates and short-term instruments called for lower rates, 
the Bank of Japan introduced unsecured overnight call loans 
which carried interest rates that were higher than three-month 
certificates of deposit (CD). This second reversal of rates for 
short-term instruments continues even to this day when the 
official discount rate has fallen as far as 1.75 percent. We can 
only reaffirm our amazement at the tenacious attitude of the 
Bank of Japan. 
  The result is the continued retention of over 4 trillion yen 
in funds in the call market and the failure of the money supply 
to improve despite repeated drops in the official discount rate. 
The failure of money policies rests to a large degree in this 
situation. It is estimated that normal levels of funds managed 
in call markets would be around 20 trillion yen. In this case, 
money with nowhere to go in excess of 20 trillion yen has 
targeted the Bank of Japan short-term high interest rate 
policies as a rare opportunity and has taken refuge in the call 
markets. I would like to point out that one condition for 
recovery of the economy is the exodus of this 20 trillion yen 
pool to where it belongs; i.e., expel it from the call market. 
  And even more illogical is the situation wherein Bank of 
Japan interest rate manipulation and monetary coordination have 
caused unsecured overnight call rates to be constantly 
maintained at levels 0.25 to 0.5 percent higher than the 
official discount rate. In the United States, the federal fund 
rate, which is equal to the call rate, is often maintained at 
the same level as the official discount rate which is currently 
at 3.0 percent. The question is, why does the Bank of Japan 
maintain the call rate at a level higher than the official 
discount rate? 
  The first reason most probably relates to consideration 
given 
to the operation of small and medium financial institutions 
which issue call paper. Small and medium financial institutions 
traditionally have low loan to deposit ratios and are 
historically heavily dependent on call markets. However, that 
situation is not one that can be justified at all times. 
  A second reason is the need to maintain Bank of Japan 
influence over large banks. Large banks constantly purchase call 
paper and borrow funds from the Bank of Japan, providing fatter 
profits from Bank of Japan borrowings if the official discount 
rate is lower than call rates. Assuming current Bank of Japan 
loans average 6 trillion yen throughout the year and a 
difference of 0.75 percent exists between the 2.5-percent call 
rate and 1.75-percent official discount rate, large banks which 
benefit from the Bank of Japan loans are in effect subsidized to 
the tune of 45 billion yen a year. No matter how one views the 
situation, it is strange that such huge subsidies are made 
available to large banks which forced the management of small 
and medium financial institutions into difficult straits and 
forced them to find refuge in other industries in the form of 
subsidiary companies based on the decontrol of financial markets. 
  Even more puzzling are signs that the rate differentials 
between the official discount rate and call rate are being 
misused in salvaging failed financial institutions. If newspaper 
reports that top executives of Daiwa Bank lodged a request 
saying, "We would like to ask for special consideration for a 
Bank of Japan loan," when a decision was made for Daiwa to 
assist Cosmo Securities, are true, it appears that he was asking 
for the issuance of the type of hidden subsidy discussed in the 
preceding paragraph. It may be that a separate secret Bank of 
Japan loan fund exists to aid those banks which were forced to 
assume huge liabilities in connection with past salvage actions. 
<H5>  Abuses Connected With Official Discount Rate </H5>
  I believe there are no reasons in existence today for 
continuing the official discount rate system. 
  First, I have already spoken of the issuance of government 
bonds to provide for growth funds. Since the underlying 
potential for growth in the Japanese economy has declined, the 
system whereby the official discount rate was maintained at a 
low level and growth funds were supplied through Bank of Japan 
loans is now outdated. 
  Next, the question is what is the situation from the 
standpoint of realizing appropriate money supply levels? This 
question is answered by money supply records since 1987. I would 
like to say that the absence of an official discount rate would 
have created a more appropriate money supply. 
  The third reason is the relationship between monetary 
adjustment and economic coordination functions. The mission of 
the central bank is to manipulate interest levels and adjust 
monetary levels appropriately to prevent both inflation and 
deflation and to maintain sustained growth. If we were to be 
asked if the official discount rate is indispensable in meeting 
those goals, the answer would be that we can do without the rate. 
  Principal nations that still maintain the official discount 
rate system are Japan, the United States, and Germany. Great 
Britain and France recognized the shortcomings of the official 
discount rate long ago and their central banks have converted to 
a system whereby they control interest rates through market 
intervention. 
  A condition that can be noted through observations in Japan, 
the United States, and Germany is that the new environment posed 
by advances in the information age and huge growth in financial 
markets have made it more difficult to manipulate the official 
discount rate because it has transcended its symbolic existence 
and is subject to wide and constant exposure to the public. 
Manipulation of the official discount rate has been subjected to 
conditions not conceivable to monetary experts of the past, such 
as the requirement that changes must be subject to a surprise 
element. Excessive focusing of attention precludes the 
effectuation of smooth changes, while the inability to avoid the 
situation in which the Bank of Japan president just one week 
prior to drops in the official discount rate must say obvious 
lies, such as, "We have no intention of dropping the rate," or 
"We have no intention whatsoever of dropping the rate," are 
indications that the effects of announcing official discount 
rate changes have been distorted. Already, the need no longer 
exists for central bank presidents of the various nations to 
indicate the direction of economic policy through manipulation 
of the official discount rate. 
  Last August [1992], the Bank of Japan, which was concerned 
about the future of the economy, introduced lower short-term 
interest rates. Since such measures are feasible, the absence of 
an official discount rate would enable implementation of more 
flexible monetary policy. It would be better in a mature 
monetary market that the central bank demonstrate its goals by 
constantly intervening in the markets. 
  Even if a decision is made to retain the official discount 
rate system, its levels should be the same as the call rates, 
and I believe the source of last resort in the form of the Bank 
of Japan should be made available only to problem banks. I would 
like to say that we should discontinue the practice of 
maintaining Bank of Japan loan balances that are constantly 
running at several trillions of yen.

<F P=106> [Report by Raymond Whittaker: "Libyan Nerve Gas Tanks Go </F>
Missing in Malaysia"] 
  [Text] Equipment for a Libyan poison gas plant, made by a 
British-owned company in Malaysia and returned there last year 
after the United Nations Security Council blocked delivery, has 
disappeared. 
  The issue has resurfaced as the Pergau dam affair has put 
British dealings with Malaysia under intense scrutiny. It could 
complicate government attempts to remain on good terms with a 
country sensitive to any perceived interference in relations 
with fellow Islamic states. 
  Concern over Malaysia's Libyan connection was renewed 
recently when the government auctioned eight steel reactor tanks 
which had been returned from Singapore, where they were seized 
last March on the orders of the Security Council's sanctions 
committee. The buyer was a small local trading company whose 
only contact is a mobile telephone number. The equipment left a 
Malaysian customs warehouse a few weeks ago, though other 
governments have been told it is in the country and will not be 
permitted to reach Libya. 
  But one Western diplomat said: "We are not 100 per cent 
happy, and won't be until we see this equipment in the hands of 
a non-Libyan end-user who actually wants it." 
  Britain has co-ordinated efforts to keep the tanks out of 
Libya since becoming aware in 1989 of Tripoli's attempts to 
obtain them. It says the equipment could produce hundreds of 
tons of mustard gas and nerve gases. Kuala Lumpur refused to 
stop the first delivery attempt, saying they were for civilian 
use. 
  The telephone number of the buyer, Wargames Management, is 
unobtainable, but investigators who have spoken to the company's 
directors say they claim to be trying to sell the vessels to 
Petronas, Malaysia's state oil company, or an American company. 
Another source said the equipment had been tailor-made for 
Tripoli and could not be adapted easily for other uses. 
  A spokesman for the Malaysian High Commission in London 
declined to comment, saying he would have to check with Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  Libya first tried in 1989 to order reactor vessels from a 
British engineering company, APV, saying they would be used to 
produce drilling mud for the oil industry. Western agencies 
suspected that they would be used to make chemical weapons. 
When the order was rejected, the Libyans turned to an obscure 
Malaysian company, Pacificwide Management, which again has only 
a mobile number. Pacificwide ordered the equipment from APV's 
Malaysian subsidiary, APV Hill and Mills, and went to court to 
obtain completion of the contract after the British-owned 
company, having become aware of the destination of the vessels, 
tried to back out. 
  With the Malaysian government refusing to intervene, Britain 
went to the sanctions committee. The shipment was declared to 
be a violation of the embargo imposed on Libya to force the 
handover of two intelligence agents accused of the Lockerbie 
bombing.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 14 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
government of Mongolia has taken a decision on some measures 
provided for the implementation of the "sugar" and "vegetable 
oil" projects. In this respect the government decided to 
develop such projects gradually, step by step and charged the 
National Development Department and the Ministry of Food and 
Agriculture to discuss and solve proper issues concerning 
credits to be granted to provide the implementation of the 
present projects as well as foreign investment and credits to be 
assigned for this purpose. 
  As was shown by the results of the experiments carried out 
during the last years in the country it is quite possible for 
the sugarbeet and oil-producing crops to be cultivated under the 
conditions of Mongolia. It was established during the 
experiments that approximately 2025 tonnes of sugar beet and 
1.52 tonnes of raps [as received] may be gathered per hectare. 
  Mongolia has to import some 45 thousand tonnes of granulated 
sugar and 4.5 tonnes of vegetable oil every year.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with former DPRK Army Captain Shin </F>
Chung-chol by correspondent Katsuhiro Kurota; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] Seoul, 15 Feb -- Grand events are being prepared in 
the DPRK (North Korea) to mark on 16 February the 52d birthday 
of Kim Chong-il, the eldest son of President Kim Il-song and his 
heir apparent. SANKEI SHIMBUN has interviewed former DPRK Army 
Captain Shin Chung-chol about Kim Pyong-il, who is a half 
brother of [Workers Party of Korea] Secretary Kim Chong-il and 
is rumored to be feuding with the latter. Mr. Shin Chung-chol 
graduated from the same class of the Kim Il-song Military 
Integrated College as did Kim Pyong-il, who is former DPRK 
ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr. Shin Chung-chol, 46, is now serving 
with the South Korean Army with the rank of colonel. 
  Mr. Shin defected to South Korea in 1983 across the 
North-South demilitarized zone. He is said to have lived 
together with Kim Pyong-il at the No. 6 Building of the Kim 
Il-song Military Integrated College for about four years from 
1978 to 1982. In the interview, Mr. Shin made disclosures about 
Kim Pyong-il, who is shrouded in mystery. 
  According to Mr. Shin Chung-chol, Kim Pyong-il was born in 
1952 and is four years younger than Shin. Kim Pyong-il is 10 
years younger than his half brother, Secretary Kim Chong-il. 
Kim Pyong-il served in the General Security Bureau as battalion 
commander with the rank of major before be was enrolled in the 
Kim Il-song Military Integrated College. At the college, Mr. 
Shin studied at the Reconnaissance Studies Department, while Kim 
Pyong-il studied at the Infantry Studies Department. They had 
frequent contacts because they were members of the same 
graduating class and lived in the same boardinghouse. Kim 
Pyong-il was an avid table tennis player, and they played ping 
pong from time to time. 
  Unlike Secretary Kim Chong-il, who is short and stocky, Kim 
Pyong-il is a handsome man who is 180 cm tall and who weighs 80 
kg. His colleagues knew that he was the second son of President 
Kim Il-song. Kim Pyong-il was a man of forthright character. 
He was humorous and very popular among his colleagues at the 
college. 
  Kim Pyong-il, who studied in the Soviet Union and in East 
European nations, is said to speak six foreign languages. He 
did well at the college and excelled in the "duty inspection" 
component, a war game exercise, which was a graduation 
examination at the college. At the college, Kim Pyong-il once 
revealed to Mr. Shin that President Kim Il-song said to him when 
he was in junior high school, "I hope you will become a 
distinguished senior military officer when you grow up." 
  According to Mr. Shin, Kim Pyong-il spoke highly of his 
older 
brother Secretary Kim Chong-il, saying, "He is a man of high 
caliber and is dutiful to his father." In this way, Kim 
Pyong-il neither spoke ill of his older brother Secretary Kim 
Chong-il nor referred to any feud with his older brother. 
  Commenting on reports that Kim Pyong-il is feuding with 
Secretary Kim Chong-il, Mr. Shin said: "In my opinion, the 
reports are exaggerated. Kim Pyong-il will not succeed his 
father as president unless an accident happens to Secretary Kim 
Chong-il." 
  According to Mr. Shin, President Kim Il-song may envision 
that Secretary Kim Chong-il will succeed him as president and 
Kim Pyong-il will support Secretary Kim Chong-il as a senior 
military officer. 
  There is information that Kim Pyong-il would be appointed as 
North Korean ambassador to Finland, and Mr. Shin indicated that 
Kim Pyong-il will return to the military after serving as a 
diplomat for the time being. 
  It has become a practice for Secretary Kim Chong-il to 
attend 
the Kim Il-song Military Integrated College's commencement 
ceremony and to hold discussions with students. In describing 
his impression of Secretary Kim Chong-il at the time, Mr. Shin 
said: His character was rash and capricious in view of his 
behavior and talking. I thought that he was a little bit 
frivolous as a leader of a nation. However, the contents of his 
address and explanations to the students were perfect, and I 
thought that he was very smart. 
  In the interview, Mr. Shin said that at the college, he 
attended a lecture on the "offensive by the army corps with 
nuclear attacks" in the tactics course of the college. Mr. Shin 
added that the lecture was given in anticipation of North 
Korea's nuclear attacks against enemies. In pointing out that 
such a lecture was already being given at the DPRK's senior 
military officer schools around 1980, Mr. Shin stated, "I 
believe there is no doubt that North Korea has already developed 
nuclear weapons."

<F P=106> [First part of two-part interview with Forestry Minister </F>
Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon; 
date not given] 
  [Text] What is the new Burmese forestry policy? 
  [Chit Swe] We are revising our national forest policy. Our 
present policy is an old one, based on the Indian national 
forest law. The Indian authorities have already revised it five 
times. We have never revised ours that is why we are doing it 
now. Anyhow, we have enacted a new forest law on November 30, 
1993. Our old one has been in use since 1902. 
  We are now trying to reduce state enterprise business, and 
to 
encourage the private sector to engage more in forestry 
business. Also instead of just selling, we are going into more 
value-added downstream industries. For those who want to carry 
out forestry-related business, they now have a choice of a 100 
per cent investment or a 50-50 per cent joint venture. Now we 
mostly welcome value-added business. We have got a lot of good 
and bad experiences in the last 4-5 years. For those, who want 
sawn timber and finished goods, there are plenty of 
opportunities. There is no problem. 
  So it means that after 31 December 1993, no more 
logging concessions have been granted to foreign companies? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes. 
  What kind of value added industries are you 
promoting? 
  [Chit Swe] There are many kinds of timber businesses. Some 
factories have to start from veneer or plywood and some go 
straight to finished goods such as furniture or handicraft. If 
it is the furniture business, it is very easy to submit a 
project proposal to the Foreign Investment Commission, and 
within months or weeks we can make a decision. 
  If they want a factory with a 100-hoppus tons a year 
capacity, a very big amount or big volume by international 
standards, then it is not easy for us. But if they want a 
medium sized factory of 30-40,000 hoppus tons a year, I think we 
can supply our raw material by tenders. In our country, to 
travel from the North to the South is a long journey. Most of 
our logs are in the upper of Myanmar [Burma], so to take them 
from upcountry to Yangon [Rangoon], sometimes takes years. Our 
climate is a little different from that of Indonesia and 
Malaysia. For them, they can extract logs all year round, but 
we get the rainy season for nearly six months and we lack 
harvesting equipment and our transport is also very poor. 
Sometimes you have to wait to harvest after November because in 
October there can be swamp-like conditions and it is not easy to 
put skidders inside. 
  You have a number of saw mills, plywood and furniture 
factories. How are they being operated -- by your Govermnent or 
by the private sector? 
  [Chit Swe] We have got some saw mills owned by our Myanmar 
Timber Enterprise. Some are in good condition, but some are in 
a bad state. If somebody wants to hire or enter into a joint 
venture with the saw mills, we have got more than 80 of them. 
Also if they want to enter into a joint venture with our timber 
enterprise we can supply them with raw material. 
  We have got five plywood factories and only two foreign 
companies, one is Daewoo of South Korea and the other SEA Lumber 
Company of Malaysia. Both are doing joint venture businesses. 
So there are three left and many companies are proposing to 
enter into joint ventures with them. Anyhow there is no 
commitment as yet. We are still negotiating. 
  What is the investment percentage of the joint ventures 
by Daewoo and SEA with your Government? 
  [Chit Swe] Our side is 45 per cent, and their side is also 
of 
the same percentage. But then, they also bring in another 10 
par cent from other company. It means there are two companies 
from their side. So Daewoo is 45, our side is also 45 and 10 is 
from another third partner. It is the same with SEA Lumber. 
The third partners are mostly investors or financiers. 
  What about those 80 sawmills? 
  [Chit Swe] Some saw mills are a little far away from the 
forest, so it is not easy to enter into a joint venture with 
other companies. We are also in short supply of harvesting 
equipment. We need money to buy machines, so instead of buying 
and selling our raw material, foreign investors can bring in 
their extraction equipment, and we will supply them with raw 
material. This means we can both together produce sawn timber 
for export to other countries. This is a joint venture. 
  What about furniture factories? 
  [Chit Swe] We have got three. For these three furniture 
factories, some countries from the West, some from Singapore and 
some from other countries have put up proposals. I think we 
have already agreed with one company from Singapore, that is 
Lambir Company. 
  Do foreign investors have to bid in running these 
factories, or do they each have to submit a proposal which is 
then considered individually? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes, one by one. 
  Apart from this downstream value-added industry, are 
you still selling logs? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes, we still got some commitments that will last 
for another 2-3 years, but we are reducing and phasing out these 
activities. 
  Who are your main buyers? 
  [Chit Swe] Our timber enterprise earns a total of about 
US$200 million a year from logs and the valued added industry. 
This is an average income. We want to sell more but we have to 
adhere to the annual allowable cut. For teak it is only 350,000 
hoppus tons (630,000 cubic metres) a year, and 1.3 million 
hoppus tons (2.34 million cubic metres) for hardwoods and other 
species. We cannot cut more than these amounts. 
  Forestry is the second most important industry after 
agriculture. Among the ministries we are the number one foreign 
exchange earner, but it is not easy now because other sectors 
are competing such as fisheries and manufacturing. 
  You are now facing increasing probbms related to 
smuggling snd illegal cutting of trees. How are you going to 
deal or resolve these problems? Are you going to enact a new law 
or amend existing ones? 
  [Chit Swe] If there is a will, there is a way. Smuggling in 
our country is very small when compared with other countries, 
such as Malaysia and Indonesia. I think in Malaysia, the 
imprisonment term is up to 20 years, but in our country it is 
only seven years. 
  What was the percentage of your forest cover before and 
after you gave out logging concessions to Thai companies? 
  [Chit Swe] There was less than 50 per cent forest cover 
before the concessions. Now it is nearly that figure. 
According to the FAO statistics, Myanmar forest cover area in 
1969-1971 was 32.2 million hectares and in 1989 was 32.4 million 
hectares. There is some expert opinion that by the year 2000, 
every country should have a forest cover area of up to 30 per 
cent. Most countries have less than 20 per cent, but ours is no 
problem because we have got about 50 per cent of forest left.

<F P=106> [Second and final part of interview with Forestry Minister </F>
Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon; 
date not given] 
  [Text] How could you continue to have nearly 50 per 
cent forestry cover when you gave out many logging concessions 
to Thai companies since late 1988 and only ended them late last 
year. The figure you gave does not seem to correspond to 
reality taking into account of the vast amount or volume of wood 
that have been extracted from those concessioned areas? 
  [Chit Swe] The whole forest cover area involved in the 
border 
concessions is only 2.6 per cent of our total forest area and 
besides, these forest have been more or less untouched in the 
past. We gave concessions of 200,000 hoppus tons only. We gave 
some concessions for four to five years to Thai companies. Up 
to now a little more than 150,000 hoppus tons a year were 
extracted during the peak years. When we started the 
concession, the average extraction was 150,000 hoppus tons a 
year along the whole stretch of the border. However since 1992 
it was taken off, because all the concessions started to expire 
and we did not renew them. 
  Now I have to see Thai friends everyday, at least one or 
two. 
They have got heavy commitments with foreign companies to get 
the raw material in time. It is very important for them. 
  Now that these logging concessions are gone, what are 
you going to do? 
  [Chit Swe] I have never said that logging concessions have 
gone. In concessioned areas we can do something for mutual 
benefit. We can harvest from those areas with our local people, 
but foreigners are not allowed to get concessions. 
  That is why some people are asking if insurgents coming out 
to legal fold, would they be entitled to the concessions. For 
this, we need time to consider. 
  For the Burman it is not easy for them to stay in that area, 
only the nationalities (ethnic minorities) stay there. To enter 
into the forestry related businesses, all interested local 
parties would have to deal with the central government or enter 
into joint ventures with foreign partners: If the area is 100 
per cent secure and our forest people can go in to check every 
tree, then we can consider which kind of business is suitable 
for that area. We have to consider that on a case by case basis. 
  So it means that even though foreign logging 
concessions have gone, the local people still have the chance to 
obtain them? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes. However, it is not easy to export logs to 
other countries. Preference is given to value-added industries. 
I cannot for certain say what kind of business is good. But in 
general there is plenty of raw material there and one can enter 
into whatever forestry-related business. In some areas we can 
set up pulp and paper factories. Because of certain tree 
species, some areas are good for veneer and plywood industries. 
  Now that all logging concessions to Thai companies have 
gone, would you please say what experiences and problems you 
have learned from giving out timber concessions to Thai 
companies? 
  [Chit Swe] Before I gave out concessions, my knowledge about 
forestry was like that of a primary student. Now after five 
years experience, I can say I have a PhD. We used to receive 
messages sent to us everyday from local commanders saying they 
seized 3,000 (illegally felled) logs here or 2,000 trees there, 
and some pointed to me saying: "Since you are the Forestry 
Minister, you are responsible for it. But I said it came under 
the jurisdiction of the police and hence not under my office." 
In Burmese we have a saying: "If you make it easier even for a 
very rich man, he still becomes a thief." It is not easy to 
conduct checks because we are far away from the forested areas. 
Because of this even a rich man can become a poacher. That is 
why in some areas we give concessions to them and at the same 
time put up border checkpoints. Anyhow they still take logs 
from some other areas. So in many areas there are many problems. 
  So the main problems you face stem from illegal 
cuttings? 
  [Chit Swe] Yes. 
  Even by concession companies? 
  [Chit Swe] Some companies are very good. They do their job 
systematically. But others however they have sub-contracts and 
the sub-contractors further sub-contract them. There are no 
checkpoints, no border police and no forest guards. 
  Roughly how many companies received your concessions 
and how many are good companies? 
  [Chit Swe] Only one third of the companies behave well. We 
gave out about 42 concessions to 34 companies. Mostly of them 
were not original timber business people and that is the root 
cause of the problems. Of those, who tried to get concessions, 
I think only 10 per cent were real timber men. More than 90 per 
cent were not. 
  What are the real reasons for you to stop border 
logging concessions? Is it because of illegal logging or are you 
environmentally conscious? 
  [Chit Swe] When we decided, it is not because of illegal 
logging. It is secondary. The first is because of the 
watershed. Our watershed is your watershed. For instance, the 
Tenasserim Mountain is a large range and is also the watershed 
of Thailand. There are also some other very high mountains in 
the Tenasserim Division. From our side it is not easy to 
extract logs because of the high mountains. So if logs are cut 
on our side there will be drought and flooding in your country 
100. Also, people from developed countries are putting pressure. 
  Up to now there are no big problems with the environmental 
people, but anyhow we must be very careful, because if the 
population become bigger, forest cover will become lesser and 
lesser. 
  The logging concessions are not only on the border areas but 
also deeper inside the country too. Our concern is that foreign 
partners would become richer and richer, but local partners 
would have no change in status. Because of this we want to 
encourage local people. 
  Thailand has plans to develop several hydropower dams 
along the Thai-Burmese border such as the over 6,000 Megawatt 
Salween Dam, and many envirommentalists are concerned that those 
projects will have negative impacts on your natural resources, 
mainly the forests. What is your opinion? 
  [Chit Swe] Now they are discussing natural gas to Thailand 
through Kanchanaburi Province. The project does not affect a 
big area--only a small area for the gas pipeline and only some 
roads. I think there is no problem. 
  As for the Salween Dam, I think it is a very big project. It 
has to go phase by phase. You should ask the Energy Minister. 
He may be able give you some ideas. 
  Which country is the biggest investor in your forestry 
industry and the biggest log buyer? 
  [Chit Swe] I think Thai companies. When it is not easy to 
get logs from the border, they come here. Thai people have very 
good experience in the timber business. They buy from our 
country, logs as well as other forestry products. 
  The Japanese are usually the highest bidders. They buy the 
best quality teak and other hardwood. However, they usually 
sell it later, especially hardwood, to the Taiwanese. There is 
a case when a Japanese company bid highest in one tender for 
some logs. We thought it was going to Japan, but it turned out 
that the company sold the logs here to a Taiwanese company. 
When I met the Taiwanese gentleman and asked him if he was 
going to take the logs to Taiwan he said he was going to sell 
the logs to China. So it is just changing hands causing the 
value to go higher and higher. Because of this, we are trying 
to sell directly to the real buyers. 
  Is China one of your biggest timber buyers? 
  [Chit Swe] No. It is Japan. The West also buys quality 
teak. Fourth quality teak is bought mainly by the Indians. They 
have got a very good market with the Middle East, which we 
don't. Because of this we go through the Indians as third party.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 15 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be defenceless in the event 
of a retaliatory attack by Serbian forces following the imminent 
air strikes by NATO, Defence Forces Chief General Borhan Ahmad 
said Tuesday. Borhan said the soldiers serving with the United 
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were not armed to fight a 
full-scale war but adequately to defend themselves as 
peacekeepers. [passage omitted] 
  You must understand that my boys are not there for the war. 
Only as peacekeepers. They will have to find their own way to 
defend themselves (in the face of the air strikes), he told 
reporters. We are not prepared to fight the Serbs if they react 
to the air strikes. We can't simply retaliate to heavy 
artillery with our rifles, can we? Gen. Borhan asked. In that 
respect, Gen. Borhan said, when the soldiers cannot retaliate, 
the best option for them is to take cover in trenches. This is 
the kind of risk we are taking and in the process we have to 
expect casualties, he said. [passage omitted] 
  He said some of the 1,500 Malaysian soldiers are holding 
positions in Sarajevo, pockets of them are outside the ravaged 
city while some are on their way to the city. There were 
reports that some of the soldiers are positioned in split. The 
soldiers were scheduled to be operational by this month but, 
according to Gen. Borhan, the UNPROFOR command had reassigned 
the Malaysian Batallion (Malbatt) to be fully operational (as 
peacekeepers) by next month.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia will 
ask the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to arm the 
country's soldiers serving with the United Nations peackeeping 
force in Bosnia-Herzegovina if NATO attacks the Serbian 
aggressors around Sarajevo, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said 
tonight [as received]. The Malaysian soldiers would need the 
weapons to defend themselves against any retaliation from the 
Serbs, he said. 
  The cabinet, at its weekly meeting Wednesday, decided to ask 
NATO to supply Malaysian soldiers arms similar to that used by 
its troops if NATO attacks the Serbian aggressors, he told 
reporters here. We will ask NATO to supply weapons similar to 
that its soldiers have, and we will make the request as soon as 
possible, he said. 
  Nevetheless, Dr. Mahathir was doubtful whether NATO would 
launch any attack against thc Serbs who had stepped up their 
strikes recently against the people of Bosnia. We do not believe 
that NATO will attack. It only says it wants to attack, he 
said. Replying to a question whether Malaysian troops would 
continue to defend themselves if tha war prolonged, he said: we 
have to consider whether we get assistance from those who have 
the capability. So far we have not been notified by NATO whether 
it wants to assist or not. He said Malaysia also requested the 
United Nations to withdraw the arms sanctions on the people of 
Bosnia to enable them to defend themselves. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the government had no plans to increase 
the 
number of its soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina because the 
existing number, about 1,500, was determined by the United 
Nations.

  [Text] The federal government has ruled out any form of 
cooperation with the Parti Bersatu Sabah [United Sabah Party], 
PBS, after the state elections. The deputy prime minister, 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu 
today that the decision was taken after consultations with the 
prime minister, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and other 
National Front [BN] leaders. Datuk Sri Anwar said there is no 
way the federal government can cooperate with a PBS-led state 
government, as its policies and personalities were inconsistent 
with those adopted by the BN. 
  On the privatization of several key government agencies in 
Sabah, Datuk Sri Anwar said the process was conducted contrary 
to the principles and rules of privatization adopted by the 
federal government. Any project privatized by the federal 
government is first evaluated by the Economic Planning Unit 
before it is considered and approved by the cabinet. The 
interest of the government and the respective states is always 
safeguarded. In the case of Sabah, privatization is decided by 
a single person and the interests of Sabah were ignored.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Petrochemical, one of Japan's largest 
chemical producers, is taking a 30 percent stake in the Shell 
group's $750 million [Singapore currency] styrene 
monomer/propylene oxide project in Singapore. 
  A Shell spokesman said yesterday that the two parties have 
agreed in principle to team up for the proposed project, which 
is a part of a $4 billion plan to expand Singapore's 
petrochemical complex. But the joint venture agreement is to be 
signed only after the larger expansion plans for the 
petrochemical complex are finalised. Details of these plans, 
delayed since last year, are likely to be ironed out in the next 
few weeks. 
  In essence, Shell's deal with Mitsubishi will see the two 
chemical giants form a joint venture -- Seraya Chemical 
Singapore. Shell will own 70 percent, and Mitsubishi, 30 
percent, of the company which will build a styrene 
monomer/propylene oxide plant on Pulau Seraya. The new plant 
will produce 310,000 tons of styrene monomer and 140,0000 tons 
of propylene oxide per year. These petrochemicals are used in a 
wide range of products including packaging materials, toys and 
electrical goods. 
  Construction is scheduled to begin next month, with 
completion and a trial production run slated for the second 
quarter of 1997. Raw materials for the proposed plant will come 
from the main petrochemical complex on an adjacent island, Pulau 
Ayer Merbau. 
  For Mitsubishi, the tie-up with Shell will help it establish 
overseas production bases and avoid both rising production costs 
and flat petrochemical demand in Japan. The group said in a 
statement issued in Tokyo on Monday that its decision to take a 
stake in Shell's project is prompted by the need to keep tight 
reins on its competitive edge. 
  Also, Mitsubishi's existing styrene monomer capacity of 
480,000 tons per annum, largely exported to Southeast Asian 
markets, could be insufficient to meet future demand growth in 
these markets. Under the Shell-Mitsubishi agreement, the 
Japanese group will be entitled to 95,000 tons of styrene 
monomer and 42,000 tons of propylene oxide per year. Mitsubishi 
said it plans to sell the bulk of these products in Southeast 
Asia. 
  On Shell's part, the latest joint venture will further 
deepen 
its ties with its Japanese partner. The Anglo-Dutch group 
already holds a 20 percent stake in Mitsubishi Petrochemical. A 
Shell spokesman said Mitsubishi could help contribute capital 
and additional marketing channels for the new plant's products.

  [Text] Singapore -- Investment commitments in the local 
manufacturing sector rose almost 12 percent last year to $3.89 
billion [Singapore currency], despite growing competition from 
other regional economies seeking new capital. 
  Economic Development Board [EDB] chairman Philip Yeo said 
yesterday that the commitments were in "better-quality" projects 
and were expected to generate $3.12 billion in gross value-added 
or GVA. This is a measure of the contribution to Singapore's 
gross domestic product. "We have kept to our objective of 
attracting better-quality projects resulting in higher GVA per 
worker," Mr Yeo said. "Projects in our pipeline are even 
better." He did not give details of the nature or value of the 
projects in the pipeline. But at the end of 1992, around $9.4 
billion worth of projects were under serious negotiation. 
  The 1993 commitments translate to a GVA per worker of nearly 
$294,300. This is nearly four times the current average GVA per 
worker for the manufacturing sector. 
  Mr Yeo emphasised the importance of manufacturing 
investment. 
"We look for a balance. We like to have both manufacturing and 
services," he said. "But manufacturing is the key because it 
creates a multiplier effect. Without manufacturing there will 
be no demand for services." 
  More than half of the total commitmments in 1993 came from 
the chemicals and electronics industries. The U.S. remained the 
biggest investor, pumping in about $1.45 billion or 32 percent 
of the total. Next was Europe with $857 million, then Japan with 
$779 million. Investments by home-grown companies came to $741 
million, accounting for 19 percent of the total. This was 6.7 
percent rise over 1992. The services sector attracted 
commitments of $352 million and generated total business 
spending of $470 million. 
  At a briefing yesterday, EDB managing director Tan Chin Nam 
also outlined EDB's strategic thrusts for the year in the light 
of the generally weak Western economies and growing competition 
among Asian countries. 
  These are some of EDB's tasks for 1994: 
  -- Play a key role in the development of world-class 
industry 
clusters. These are groups of manufacturing companies, covering 
a product from the start, such as design, to the final phases of 
assembly. 
  -- Help make Singapore a global business hub. The EDB is 
finalising an International Business Hub 2000 study to set a 
framework and direction. The focus will be on headquarters and 
business services, communications and information. 
  -- Regionalisation. The Finance Ministry has provided a 
special budget for the International Business Development 
Strategic Business Unit to be expanded into a full operating 
division of the EDB. 
  -- Developing local enterprise. The EDB will seek to 
strengthen the supporting industry base to attract more quality 
foreign investments.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan says Asia has 
a vested interest in seeing the United States resolve its trade 
differences with Japan. Tensions between the two economic 
powers have heightened, with the United States now threatening 
to impose sanctions in 30 days unless Japan acts to allow U.S. 
access to its cellular telephone market. Senator McMullan says 
there is still time for the two countries to sort out their 
differences amicably. Over the past few days, Australia has 
maintained its stance of not taking sides in the dispute. 
Camille Fennell asked the trade minister why Australia was 
adopting such a stance: 
  [Begin recording] [McMullan] Well, we are saying very 
forthrightly that we are opposed to the idea of managed trade, 
but there is no reason for us to take sides. We strongly have 
the view that Japan should open its markets and we also strongly 
have the view that they should not be opened in a discriminatory 
way -- in a way that discriminates against Australia's interests 
-- and we are making representations on both those matters to 
Tokyo and to Washington, and we will continue to do so. 
  [Fennell] Well, I understand you have had our ambassadors in 
Washington and Tokyo both assessing Australia's point of view. 
  [McMullan] That's right. 
  [Fennell] It appears you haven't had much of a hearing in 
Washington. What has been the reception in Japan? 
  [McMullan] Well, it is not so much that we haven't had a 
hearing. I mean, there we are just one voice in the 
international community. We should not overestimate our 
influence. It is important that our ambassadors express our 
views and that we express it forthrightly, because we've got an 
interest in this matter. But we should not get carried away and 
say just because the Australian ambassador to the United States 
expresses a view, or the Australian Government does, that the 
U.S. and Japan are going to sit bolt upright and say wow, I 
never thought of that, and change their position. We are 
seeking to add our voice to the other voices who are saying it 
is in the international interest -- it is in the self-interest 
of the U.S. and Japan -- that this matter is resolved amicably, 
fairly, and in a way that does not particularly inhibit the 
economic growth in Japan, because their economic recovery is 
very important to the whole world. But we also know the U.S. 
economy is looking stronger, but we don't want to see any 
inhibition to its recovery either, but it is not the one that is 
particularly vulnerable at the moment. 
  [Fennell] Well, some commentators have suggested that the 
United States is taking unfair advantage of Japan at the moment, 
considering it is in its worst recession since World War II. Is 
there any merit in that? 
  [McMullan] Well, I don't think they are being motivated by 
that, but I do think that all of us -- the United States 
included -- have to be sensitive to the impact of any events -- 
any actions we might take -- on the nascent Japanese recovery, 
because the demand for American goods, as for Australians, is 
significantly influenced by how well the Japanese economy does. 
So it is quite clearly contrary to the self-interests of the 
United States to impede the Japanese recovery, because we want 
them to be importing our products; the Americans want them to be 
importing American products. The balance of the trade deficit 
won't change if the Japanese economy doesn't have the strength 
to import American products. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's special trade ambassador, John Button, 
has laid the blame for the trade dispute between Japan and the 
United States on the Americans. Mr. Button says it is simply a 
case of the United States resenting Japan's success in 
manufacturing and as a trading nation. He said while the United 
States is upset over Japan's huge trade surplus with them, 
Washington had to realize Japan had earned that surplus. Mr. 
Button said there are parallels between the United States' 
attitude to Japan and its attitude to Vietnam. 
  [Begin Button recording] Clinton has now lifted the embargo, 
but for a long time you could only conclude that the embargo, in 
spite of all the rhetoric, was really about the fact that 
Vietnam really won that war and America lost it. And that is a 
strange and unfortunate way to conduct foreign policy in a 
realistic sense, in my view. And it is the same with Japan -- 
very difficult circumstances for some American industries 
occasioned by better manufacturers in Japan. And I don't know 
that that is something you ought to be sort of punished for.

  [Excerpts] A national waterfront dispute is escalating 
with ports around Australia already at a standstill. 
Australia's major stevedoring company has begun dismissing 
workers in a move to break the strike action which began in 
Sydney a week ago when compulsory redundancy notices were issued 
to 55 employees. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
exports are being held up on the nation's docks. 
  Leader of the opposition coalition National Party, Tim 
Fischer, said the federal government must intervene to bring an 
end to the strike. He said the strike is an attempt by unions 
to block the progress of waterfront industry reforms. 
  The Australian Meat Exporters Council said at least two meat 
processing companies will also start standing down workers from 
today as a result of the ongoing waterfront strike. 
  The council said one plant in Victoria will lay off its 
entire work force of 550, while in Tasmania, a processor with 
150 employees will also be forced to halt production. [passage 
omitted] 
  The federal government is keeping its distance from the 
escalating waterfront dispute, saying it would prefer the 
parties to settle the matter through the Industrial Relations 
Commission. But, the spokesperson for industrial relations 
minister, Laurie Brereton, said the minister is very concerned 
about the implications of the dispute for Australia's trade 
reputation. 
  The spokesperson said that is all the more reason the matter 
should be settled through the commission although the Australian 
Chamber of Shipping has faxed a letter to the minister 
requesting his intervention.

or two-thirds majority to win. 
  [Begin Reddan recording] The government's candidate, Luc

Bernard Bani, who is supported by the opposition group, and 10 
ballot papers were destroyed. A local council president was 
disqualified from the electoral college on a procedural matter. 
  Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourt called for the 57-member 
electoral college to reconvene on 2 March. Justice D'Imecourt 
also apologized for any offense he had caused for comments he 
had made over the opposition's boycott of the electoral college 
last Monday. It had boycotted because it had not been officially 
notified. 
  Justice D'Imecourt had said that the boycott was a disgrace 
and would make Vanuatu the laughingstock of the Pacific. 
Following those comments, the opposition had accused him of 
political bias. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku: "Kim Chong-il Has Not Appeared on </F>
His Birthday"] 
  [Text] Splendid celebrations marking Kim Chong-il's 52d 
birthday took place throughout North Korea on 16 February. The 
protagonist himself did not appear, thus arousing various 
observations. 
  Rumors have been continually disseminated on Kim Il-song's 
intensified personal involvement in administration and politics, 
on barriers of receipt of foreign currency (Office No. 39 in the 
party's financial and accounting department)--the source of 
money for Kim Chong-il, and on Kim Chong-il's accident 
groundlessly spread in Beijing -- thus indicating stumbling 
blocks on the road of his succession to power. 
  The atmosphere in North Korea is quite the reverse. In an 
editorial carried in NODONG SINMUN--the party's organ--on 16 
February, the North Korean Workers' Party emphasized "the 
single-hearted unity with Kim Chong-il as the center," thus 
flatly rejecting such rumors. 
  In addition, various events celebrating his birthday were 
held in North Korea and overseas. A banquet hosted by the party 
Central Committee was held on the evening of 15 February, a 
soiree by youth and students in Pyongyang and a soiree by the 
Ministry of People's Armed Forces was held, and receptions were 
also held. In addition, awards and citations were given to 
economic and educational circles on the occasion of Kim 
Chong-il's birthday. 
  Meetings to resolve loyalty to Kim Chong-il were held by 
workers' organizations, including workers trade unions, 
agricultural workers' trade unions, and womens' leagues, as well 
as by youth and students. On 16 February, a national meeting of 
the juvenile corps was held in Pyongyang Gymnasium. The meeting 
urged the juvenile corps members to strengthen the "movement to 
learn from the youth of Kim Chong-il." North Korea's overseas 
missions also held events marking his birthday as usual. 
  However, Kim Chong-il himself did not attend any events 
marking his birthday. Thus, the people have doubts as to his 
personal condition. Experts in North Korean affairs, however, 
do not attach importance to his failure to appear. Kim Chong-il 
participated in his 50th birthday celebrations in 1992. He 
attended, with President Kim Il-song, the celebrations held in 
the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on the very date of his birthday. He 
also saw a mass game, "With the party forever," held in 
Pyongyang Gymnasium by youth and students in Pyongyang. All this 
seemed to have been prompted by the custom of treasuring every 
10-year mark. 
  Kim Chong-il did not personally attend any birthday 
celebrations last year, either. His participation in a few 
political events, including the 8th Congress of the Socialist 
Working Youth of Korea held in February, encompassed all of his 
movements. In addition, there was no report on his activities 
during the month of February in 1991, not to mention his 
attendance in birthday celebrations. 
  Proceeding from this, we will be able to confirm the changes 
surrounding Kim Chong-il only after seeing if Kim Chong-il 
attends the meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of publication 
of the socialist rural thesis--a political event to be held 
soon--and the Supreme People's Assembly meeting, which is 
usually held in March or April.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The leader of South 
Korea's main opposition Democratic Party (DP), Yi Ki-taek, said 
Thursday he had heard that North Korean heir-apparent Kim 
Chong-il was seriously hurt from an informed foreign source. 
Kim has not been shown on television, even on his birthday, and 
has recently made no public appearances, Yi told reporters, 
adding that Kim's injuries were so bad that he may not be able 
to do his job properly even if he succeeds his father, President 
Kim Il-song. 
  "I don't know if Kim was hurt in a car accident or from a 
gunshot, but it doesn't look like a natural illness," Yi said. 
He preferred that his source remain anonymous, except to say 
that he or she is a foreigner. DP insiders said Yi probably 
heard the news from a North Korea expert with whom he had 
communicated while trying to arrange a visit to North Korea. 
  The Japanese press has been reporting that the succession 
hopes of Kim Chong-il have suffered a severe blow, citing "the 
dear leader's" financial woes. Government officials dismissed 
the rumors about Kim. 
  "There have always been rumors about Kim Chong-il and rumors 
are just tales that are groundless," one official said, adding 
that Kim did not appear on television on his previous birthdays.

  [Excerpt] Seoul, Feb. 17 KYODO -- South Korean Government 
authorities on Thursday [17 February] dismissed press reports 
that Kim Chong-il, son and heir apparent to North Korean 
President Kim Il-song, has been seriously injured. 
  Officials told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the South Korean 
Government 
has observed nothing unusual in North Korea, stressing that it 
is "quiet." 
  "If anything had happened to Kim Chong-il, changes in the 
daily schedule, including celebrations for his birthday (on 
Wednesday), should have appeared," the officials said in 
dismissing the reliability of the reports. [passage omitted

reported in foreign news reports. 
  Meanwhile, on 17 February North Korean central broadcast

January and urged them to vigorously carry out this year's 
economic tasks. This belated report has attracted the people's 
attention.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korean defense 
authorities said Thursday there were no grounds to support 
recent rumors about the son and heir-apparent of North Korean 
paramount leader Kim Il-song, Chong-il. 
  Rumors have run wild since Kim Chong-il failed to appear at 
any events marking his 52th birthday on Wednesday, with one 
saying his succession was being threatened by a cut-off of 
foreign fund channels and another claiming he was seriously 
injured in a mysterious accident. 
  "There are some foreign media speculating something bad has 
happened to Kim Chong-il after he made no public appearances on 
his birthday," a senior official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
headquarters said. "But we have found no signs of any problem 
related to Kim," he said. 
  He recalled that foreign media had engaged in similar 
speculation when Kim did not appear publicly for periods in the 
past, adding that defense officials were nevertheless keeping a 
close watch on North Korea and all affairs related to the 
younger Kim. 
  Meanwhile, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic 
Party, said he had been told of the rumors concerning Kim 
Chong-il by "a person in the U.S. Government" four days ago. 
  Speaking to local and foreign journalists who swarmed his 
office to query him about remarks made earlier in the day that 
Kim seemed to have been seriously injured, Yi apparently stepped 
back from the rumor, saying, "He is a reliable source but he 
said his information had yet to be confirmed independently."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States again met unofficially early Thursday (Korean 
time) in New York after meeting a day earlier, when Pyongyang 
reversed its past hard-line position on accepting international 
nuclear inspections, and are reportedly near agreement on 
scheduling the next round of high-level talks and other issues. 
  U.S. officials briefed South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu on the meeting upon his arrival in Washington earlier 
in the day after traveling to Canada and meeting with United 
Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York. 
  After coordination with South Korea, U.S. officials are to 
meet again with North Korean negotiators as soon as Friday, 
Seoul officials said. 
  In Thursday's meeting, the two sides reportedly discussed 
the 
schedule for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspection team to enter North Korea, resumption of inter-Korean 
contacts to discuss an exchange of envoys, announcement of the 
suspension of the South Korea-U.S. "Team Spirit" military drill, 
and the third round of high-level talks, while agreeing in 
principle to exchange a memorandum of understanding on a "small 
package deal" this week. 
  North Korean officials said an IAEA team may be able to 
initiate inspections early next week, adding they will propose a 
fourth round of working-level talks with South Korea to discuss 
an exchange of envoys. The talks have been stalled since last 
October. But the two differed somewhat on the timing of the 
Team Spirit suspension announcement and on future bilateral 
relations, Seoul officials said. 
  It is true there was some disagreement over setting exact 
dates, but the two would have no trouble reaching agreement 
within the week, a government official predicted. 
  Washington reported the results of the meeting to Foreign 
Minister Han and asked for Seoul's opinions on the non-agreed 
issues, he said.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State 
Department has sent a letter to the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry urging Pyongyang to resume dialogue with South Korea as 
soon as possible, it was reported Wednesday. 
  The letter, addressed to Kang Sok-chu, first vice foreign 
minister, also called for a third round of high-level talks 
between the United States and North Korea, informed sources 
said. They said the letter was handed to Ho Chong, North Korean 
deputy ambassador to the United Nations, when the two countries 
had a working-level contact in New York Tuesday, shortly after 
North Korea said it would accept inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  No further details on the letter were immediately available, 
but other sources said it was written by Robert Gallucci, 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. 
He asked Kang to prepare for the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks at an early date, they said. 
  Meanwhile, South Korea and the United States plan to 
announce 
suspension of the joint military exercise "Team Spirit," after a 
team of IAEA inspectors arrives in Pyongyang and North Korea 
resumes dialogue with South Korea. 
  At the same time, Washington will announce an exact 
timetable 
for the third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang, the 
sources said. 
  Diplomatic sources in Washington and New York said an IAEA 
inspection team will arrive in North Korea early next week at 
the latest to check all seven reported nuclear facilities while 
an inter-Korean contact will also be made. Therefore, chances 
are high that South Korea will announce suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise next week, they said. 
  As for the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean 
talks, 
they may be held in mid-march after the IAEA team completes its 
inspection and South and North Korea exchange special envoys. 
But the date for the U.S.-North Korean talks may be announced 
as soon as the IAEA inspection gets under way, they said. 
  The sources said everything will go smoothly once North 
Korea 
expresses its intention to resume dialogue with South Korea, 
indicating that problems related to inter-Korean talks are the 
crucial factor in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry dismissed yesterday reports 
from Russia quoting a scholar as saying North Korea owns nuclear 
weapons and carried out secret tests, saying they turned out to 
be groundless. 
  A South Korean Embassy official in Moscow contacted Vladimir 
Kumachev, a senior researcher quoted in the press, and was told 
he was misquoted, Paek Nak-whan, director-general of European 
Affairs, said. Kumachev, with Russia's Institute of National 
Security and Strategic Research, was quoted as saying that North 
Korea has nuclear weapons "according to information we have 
received." 
  He was also quoted as saying Pyongyang carried out nuclear 
tests in African countries. A Russian official, asked to verify 
the reports, said he wasn't even aware of the existence of the 
named institute. 
  Kumachev told the South Korean Embassy official that he only 
said North Korea "could be" possessing nuclear arms as claimed 
by certain press reports and is trying to build up its weapons 
program, Paek said. 
  The Russian official assured Seoul that North Korea does not 
have the precision technique involved for a nuclear weapons 
program and does not have the launching capability, he said.

  [Text] It was learned that Ho Chong, deputy chief of the 
DPRK's UN mission, who was the contact for the North Korean side 
in U.S.-North Korea contacts, will be replaced around 24 
February. A diplomatic source in New York confirmed this on 17 
February, and said that Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the UN 
mission will take his place. Since the measure to replace 
Deputy Chief Ho Chong came right after North Korea announced 
that it would accept full-scope nuclear inspection, it is being 
presumed that this is the first step in changes in North Korea's

  [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] source 
revealed that the IAEA will not inspect fuel rods at the 
experimental atomic reactor during nuclear inspections in North 
Korea this weekend. This source explained that this is because 
the inspection of the fuel rods is only possible when fuel rods 
are changed. This source also added that the IAEA inspection 
team will only inspect the monitoring camera and the sealing of 
the atomic reactor.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- UN chief Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali voiced hope Wednesday that North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections would help to stabilize nuclear 
non-proliferation and the United Nations. Meeting South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Butrus-Ghali called North Korea's 
decision a breakthrough in the nuclear problem that was heading 
to a dangerous end. The decision, in the long run, will serve 
as an important impetus for inter-Korean relations, as well as 
maintenance of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the 
United Nations, the secretary-general was quoted as saying. 
  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) 
have just agreed on resumption of nuclear inspections last held 
in February 1993. The inspectors are to check whether North 
Korea has diverted any of its nuclear materials since then. 
  Foreign Minister Han called the development an incomplete 
solution, but nevertheless satisfactory and important progress 
that provides a breakthrough in the dispute. 
  South Korea will continue efforts to achieve stability in 
the 
region, Han told the secretary-general. 
  The foreign minister explained Seoul's decision to make an 
early withdrawal of its army unit from Somalia, while promising 
to take an active interest in future UN peacekeeping operations 
there. 
  Seoul has announced it is pulling out its army engineering 
unit three months ahead of schedule as most western nations are 
withdrawing.

<F P=106> [By THE KOREA TIMES correspondent Chong Pyong-chin] </F>
  [Text] OTTAWA -- Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said here 
Tuesday that he will tune policies with U.S. officials on the 
North Korean nuclear problem in Washington again after seeing 
the schedule for inspections by an IAEA team. 
  "I hope that the inspection will go smoothly as agreed upon 
by the IAEA and North Korea," Han said, welcoming North Korea's 
decision to open the facilities to the IAEA inspection. 
  Following are questions and answers from a press conference 
at Westin Hotel here. 
  Q: What do you think about reports that North Korea accepted 
a fullscope inspection of its nuclear facilities? 
  A: North Korea representatives in Vienna informed the IAEA 
just a few hours ago that the North will accept the IAEA's 
inspection to maintain continuity of safeguards at seven 
declared nuclear sites. We welcome this and hope that the 
inspection will be carried out as agreed on by the IAEA and 
North Korea. 
  Q: When do you think the inspection will begin? 
  A: I don't know the exact date. But I believe that an 
inspection team will enter Pyongyang in a week. 
  Q: When do you expect Rep. Ronald Dellums, chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, to visit Pyongyang? 
  A: The Department of State had not reached a final decision 
on when he would visit Pyongyang due to the expectation that 
North Korea and the IAEA would make progress at inspection 
talks. Even now, I believe there is no finalized schedule. 
Chairman Dellums himself has his own plan. I believe that he 
will be able to visit Pyongyang in a few days if his visit to 
North Korea is not likely to hinder the nuclear negotiations. 
  Q: Will high-level North Korea-U.S. contacts resume soon in 
New York? 
  A: I believe that a North Korea-U.S. contact had been sought 
before the negotiations made progress in Vienna. North Korea 
proposed resumption of a high working-level contact in New York. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard and Ho Chong, 
North Korean deputy representative to the United Nations, are 
scheduled to meet at five Tuesday afternoon in New York. The 
contact will take place as there is no reason to cancel it now 
that progress has been made in Vienna. 
  Q: What do you think about reports that North Korea proposed 
to the United States a contact in New York last weekend? 
  A: I think it's better not to mention it now that progress 
has been made on the IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear 
sites. 
  Q: What will you talk about in your second meeting with U.S. 
officials in Washington Feb. 17? (Han is scheduled to reenter 
Washington Thursday via New York, where he will meet with United 
Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali Wednesday.) 
  A: First of all, I will look at the itinerary of the IAEA 
inspection team. But nothing has been decided on whom I will 
meet. The schedule will be fixed when I go there.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday that imposing sanctions 
against North Korea was not desirable even if it had transferred 
nuclear matter for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. 
  Arriving here after completing a visit to Canada, Han said, 
"Since our purpose related to the North Korean nuclear problem 
is to see to it that North Korea does not develop or own a 
nuclear weapon, even if it had diverted nuclear matter it is not 
desirable to impose sanctions unconditionally on Pyongyang for 
its past behavior. Instead, we should receive a guarantee from 
North Korea that it will not divert nuclear matter any more and 
make Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear weapons if it has already 
made one or more." 
  Han expected that it would take at least four to five more 
years for North Korea to reach the point where it can actually 
use nuclear weapons even if it makes them without any outside 
checks. 
  "We need to adopt a prudent attitude in taking measures 
risking a war in case North Korea turned out to have already 
used nuclear matter (for making weapons)," he said. 
  Concerning North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections, 
he judged that the dispute has passed one critical point, but 
that many more critical points must be surmounted in the future. 
  "As far as I know, the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] inspection team will be sent to North Korea early next 
week," he added. He predicted that Pyongyang would agree to 
resuming inter-Korean dialogue. 
  "Of course, it is up to North Korea. But since it wants to 
hold a third round of high-level talks with the United States, I 
think it will agree to resumption of inter-Korean dialogue," he 
said. 
  He added that deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
would be decided according to strategic and tactical military 
needs, apart from the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  The U.S. Congress and press have often taken a hard line 
against North Korea, but the Clinton administration's policies 
can be judged to have maintained consistency, according to Han. 
  "The recent controversy over sanctions in the United States 
is only part of the picture as far as consistency. The South 
Korean and U.S. Governments share the recognition that they 
should try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue as long 
as the continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained." 
  But if North Korea refuses to accept special inspections by 
the IAEA and the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks is not held, the process that was employed last year will 
not be followed, he said. 
  "Then it is quite possible that a resolution seeking 
sanctions against North Korea would be passed at the United 
Nations Security Council," he said. 
  Meanwhile, a scheduled visit to Pyongyang by Rep. Ronald 
Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was 
canceled because North Korea agreed to inspections by the IAEA, 
Han said.
