  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Up to 2,000 Muslim 
youths staged an anti-American demonstration in front of the US 
Embassy here Tuesday, accusing it of involvement in drug 
trafficking and of anti-Muslim policies. "We demand an apology 
from the US government over the involvement of its two 
diplomatic staff in the crime of drug trafficking," said members 
of the group, which claims to belong to the Front for Indonesian 
Youths Saviour. 
  One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said 
the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he 
called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Muslim 
world and was always forcing its interests on others. "America, 
out... America, AIDS ...America, narcotics ..." the crowd 
alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging of the 
two embassy staff. The crowd, which according to police 
estimates numbered 2,000 people, delivered a statement to the US 
Embassy. The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment. 
  The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of 
the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an 
airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from 
Washington. Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure 
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-populated nation, to open 
ties with Israel. [passage omitted] 
  Reading out parts of the statement handed to the embassy, 
they also accused US diplomats [of] "contempt for Indonesian 
laws," for sending two embassy staff members, accused last month 
of drug trafficking, to the United States last week. The 
embassy has said the men would be court martialled in the United 
States. 
  The demonstrators demanded that the two Americans, 
identified 
as Joseph Bryner and Michael Karajin, be returned to Indonesia 
for trial and that the embassy apologize for their conduct. The 
two, one holding diplomatic immunity, were among four foreigners 
and two Indonesian nabbed by the police here for their alleged 
involvement in the trade of a dangerous drug, known as Ecstasy. 
  The group, also said Washington needs to be fair and honest 
in viewing the rise of Islam and its followers and avoid the 
influence of the Jewish lobby when determining its foreign 
policy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A top adviser to 
President Bill Clinton indicated Friday [18 February] the United 
States may revive the so-called "Super 301" trade law as part of 
a fresh U.S. trade strategy to open up Japanese markets. 
"Clearly, (Super) 301 is, as is well known, an option," White 
House Counselor David Gergen said, referring to the lapsed trade 
law that allows Washington to take a strong hand in retaliating 
against unfair trade practices. 
  Gergen, speaking briefly with a group of Japanese reporters, 
said Clinton has yet to make a decision on what measures 
Washington will take following the collapse of top-level trade 
talks. The president "will sit down with his advisers in the 
next few days to talk about that," Gergen said. 
  Clinton collided head-on with Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa in a meeting in Washington last Friday on ways 
to reduce Japan's trade surplus and open up Japanese markets to 
foreign goods. 
  Clinton vowed Thursday to pursue an aggressive policy to 
open 
markets he described as the "most closed" among industrial 
nations. 
  While gearing up for a new offensive in increasingly 
acrimonious trade disputes with Tokyo, the Clinton 
administration also took steps this week to sell its trade 
policy directly to Japanese business leaders. Gergen said the 
White House invited half a dozen top Japanese business 
executives to meet with senior Clinton aides Tuesday to send a 
message to Japan that Washington is not seeking "numerical 
quotas" in promoting imports to Japan. 
  "We hope that they can help more people in Japan understand 
the administration's position was not (after) numerical quotas. 
We had a good discussion about that," Gergen said. 
  Among the Clinton aides who attended the hourlong meeting 
were White House National Economic Council Director Robert Rubin 
and his Deputy W. Bowman Cutter, Treasury Deputy Secretary Roger 
Altman and White House Economist Alan Blinder. 
  The Japanese business executives, led by Yotaro Kobayashi, 
chairman of Japan's Fuji Xerox Co., were in Washington for a 
meeting with a U.S. business group involved in trade with Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 20 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa called on his successor, Morihiro Hosokawa, on 
Sunday [20 February] to move quickly to repair strained 
relations between Japan and the United States. "Adults' 
relations mean they don't fight," Miyazawa said, appearing on a 
Fuji television program. 
  Asked about the failed Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, he 
suggested Japan should deal with each issue positively. 
  Miyazawa said the Japanese trade surplus with the U.S. will 
not drop sharply, but that Tokyo needs to make Washington 
understand it is making efforts to correct the trade imbalance. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa invited former Labor Minister Toshio 
Yamaguchi to his official residence Sunday for talks on ways to 
promote Japan-U.S. dialogue. Formerly with the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, Yamaguchi, now an independent, said he 
recommended more frequent exchanges of Japanese and U.S. 
legislators to help improve bilateral ties. Yamaguchi used to 
maintain an office in Washington to keep abreast of developments 
in U.S. politics.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, a powerful figure in the ruling 
coalition, on Monday [21 February] criticized three coalition 
parties opposing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to 
reshuffle the cabinet. 
  "Placing posts (of cabinet members) is the prime minister's 
exclusive authority. We should speak (only) when we are 
consulted or asked for our opinions. The prime minister should 
do it by his own decision," Ozawa said at a press conference. 
  His remarks represented a rebuke against the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake [Harbinger], the three ruling 
coalition parties opposing Hosokawa's reshuffle plan. 
  The proposed cabinet reshuffle is expected to center on 
removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of 
Sakigake, from his post. 
  Ozawa, who is regarded as the chief coalition strategist, 
said he will not join the 21-member cabinet upon the reshuffle. 
  The seven parties are divided on the cabinet reshuffle, with 
the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling parties, DSP and 
Takemura's Sakigake against it and Shinseito and Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] pushing strongly for it. 
  Ozawa reiterated calls for merging all seven ruling parties 
into a single group to compete with the major opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election for the 
House of Representatives. 
  Takemura has opposed Ozawa's stand to set up a two-party 
system in Japan, hoping instead to form a third "liberal" force 
of Sakigake, the SDPJ, the DSP and reformists from the LDP.

<F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 19 February that the U.S. 
Government, accepting the ROK Government's request to reconsider 
the plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK, decided to 
tentatively withhold the deployment. 
  In a meeting with U.S. President Clinton on 18 February, ROK 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu revealed the ROK Government's hope 
that the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK be 
reconsidered in view of changes in the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, and President Clinton expressed his will to respect 
the position and opinion of the ROK Government. 
  A high-ranking official in Washington said that "the U.S. 
Government's decision to tentatively withhold the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to the ROK was made considering the changes in 
security on the Korean peninsula, including the North Korean 
acceptance of nuclear inspection, and of the ROK Government's 
position calling on the United States to take into account 
forthcoming North-South dialogue and U.S.-North Korea relations." 
  It has been learned that Gary Luck, commander of the U.S. 
Forces in the ROK, recently sent an additional request to the 
U.S. Defense Department that it tentatively withhold the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK. 
  Commander Luck had requested earlier the Defense Department 
mobilization and deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK 
considering the state of security affairs on the Korean 
peninsula, and the U.S. Government approved his request. Based 
on this, the United States has been reviewing various issues, 
including the timing of the deployment. 
  It was also learned that Luck, commander of the U.S. Forces 
in the ROK, received from Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the ROK Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, a message from the ROK Government on its 
position that the timing of the deployment of Patriot missiles 
to the ROK is not appropriate and that the plan for the 
deployment should be reconsidered.

<F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The positive [kungjongjok] assessment of North 
Korea, made when it allowed an overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal], is being hampered because the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team's entrance to North Korea 
is being delayed. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix will report at the IAEA 
Board 
of Governors regular meeting, which will open at 1830 [0930 GMT] 
on 21 February, that although North Korea allowed an overall 
inspection, the agency is unable to start the North Korea 
inspections due to the delay in issuing visas to the inspection 
team members. 
  Director General Hans Blix will stress, in particular, that 
in order to give an entire picture of North Korea's nuclear 
development, it is necessary for North Korea to provide 
additional information and allow special inspections [tukpyol 
sachal] of the two unreported facilities, and that he will 
continue to promote the solution to these matters as a separate 
issue while watching how North Korea will implement the Nuclear 
Safeguards Accord. 
  After receiving the director general's report today [21 
February], the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss the North 
Korean nuclear issue as a main agenda item on 22 or 23 February 
and will urge North Korea to take appropriate steps to allow the 
overall inspection as soon as possible. 
  It seems that the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss, in 
particular, ways to help North Korea become a sincere member of 
the international community after smoothly solving the special 
inspection problem with the IAEA and ultimately return to the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] since it has allowed the 
overall inspection. 
  It has been learned that North Korea will send a new 
three-member delegation from Pyongyang to the IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting to explain its position on the overall and 
special inspection issue and the issue of its return to the NPT.

  [Excerpt] Three trawlers were sunk in a battle between Thai 
navy gunboats and suspected Cambodian pirates off southeast 
Thailand, officials and witnesses said yesterday. Two Thai 
fishing boats and one pirate boat went down after catching fire 
during the fighting, witnesses said. The Thai boats were 
apparently caught in the crossfire between the navy and the 
pirates. The navy detained 14 suspected pirates. Witnesses 
said casualties must have been high as 40mm cannons, 
rocket-propelled grenades mortars and machine guns were used. 
The navy confirmed the battle but declined to give details of 
casualties. 
  The captain of a fishing boat sailing in the Gulf of 
Thailand 
near the Thai island of Ko Kut said the battle broke out on 
Saturday morning when three Thai navy boats exchanged fire with 
the suspected Cambodian pirates. 
  A naval officer from the patrol boat Kan Tang, which guards 
fishing boats in the area said the battle took place in an area 
about eight miles (13 km) south of Ko Kut. It started after the 
naval boats had gone to the assistance of Thai fishing boats 
which he said were being robbed by Cambodian pirates. 
  Witnesses at Klong Yai port in southeast Thailand said two 
navy gunboats arrived late on Saturday with 14 Cambodians on 
board. They were taken away to an undisclosed location. 
  Pirate attacks on fishermen in the Gulf of Thailand have 
been 
increasing at an alarming rate and forced the navy to provide 
round-the-clock security for the fishing fleet, fishing industry 
sources said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Warmongers' Reckless </F>
Military Reinforcement Maneuvers"] 
  [Text] These days, the South Korean puppets are all the 
more viciously stepping up maneuvers to prepare for a new war. 
According to broadcast reports from Seoul, the puppet defense 
ministry is reportedly examining a plan to bring in Patriot 
missiles from 1997 as part of the next-generation antiair 
defense project. 
  The puppet defense ministry and the headquarters of the 
joint 
chiefs of staff are reportedly pushing ahead with the plan to 
bring in the Patriot missiles because Nike Hercules and Hawk 
antiair missiles were brought in more than 20 years ago and, 
furthermore, there is the need to counter the North's missiles. 
It was also learned that the puppet defense ministry secretly 
informed lawmakers of the national defense committee of the 
puppet national assembly of its plan some days ago. Before the 
national assembly interpellation session, an opposition lawmaker 
distributed a script that proved that the puppet defense 
ministry had included introduction of the Patriot missiles in 
the SAM-X project starting in 1997. 
  In addition, it was known that the South Korean puppets are 
carefully examining the introduction of the Russian S-300 PMU 
missiles. In a script distributed for the national assembly 
interpellation in advance on 21 February, the puppet defense 
ministry revealed that it will decide on the ultramodern weapon 
systems, after conducting a comparative study of similar weapon 
systems from around the world, and thus hinted that the purchase 
of the Russian S-300 PMU missiles is under review. 
  This clearly shows how much the South Korean puppets are 
running amok in the military reinforcement to prepare for a new 
war and reveals the rascals' antinational, bellicose colors. As 
is already known, in connection with the criminal acts of the 
U.S. and South Korean puppets to deploy the Patriot missiles, we 
cleared our stance on 31 January through the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's statement. 
  Voices opposing the deployment of the Patriot missile to 
South Korea are also strongly resounding among the South Korean 
people. One example of this is that on 19 February, hundreds of 
youth, students, and people in Seoul carried out demonstrations 
shaking their fists to protest the plan of the United States to 
deploy the Patriot missile to South Korea. They shouted slogans 
of "Yankees go home!" and "Do not import weapons!" and carried 
out demonstrations. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are planning to drag 
in the Patriot missile to South Korea at any cost and are even 
planning to drag in Russian-made missiles. This shows very well 
what the situation of the rascals' maneuver to prepare for a new 
war to invade the North is. 
  The maneuver to indiscriminately import missiles by the 
puppets is an intolerable challenge toward all the people who 
desire the country's peace and peaceful reunification. It is 
also an act that can be carried out only by a group of war 
maniacs running toward the road of war and confrontation. 
  It is clear to anyone that the deployment of up-to-date 
missiles including the Patriot missile to South Korea will bring 
about a very dangerous situation in which it will all the more 
aggravate the tense situation in our country and increase the 
danger of war. Moreover, launching a criminal maneuver of 
dragging in up-to-date missiles at a time when violent remarks 
that enhance war mania are being made everyday among the 
bellicose elements in the United States and South Korea cannot 
but be regarded as a grave matter. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring which is even planning to drag in 
missiles which are murderous weapons because it lacked even 
dragging in some 1,000 various nuclear weapons to South Korea to 
change it into the largest nuclear advance base of the Far East, 
is a very wicked nation-seller and a warmonger's group that 
greatly surpasses his predecessors, the military fascist 
dictatorial maniacs. 
  All facts prove that if the bellicose group such as the Kim 
Yong-sam ring that does not even hesitate to push the nation 
toward nuclear calamity is left alone, the danger of war cannot 
be eliminated in our country. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the remainder of 
its dirty doomed life by clinging to the outside forces at the 
price of advancing as the shock brigade of the aggressive 
policy. However, this is a foolish act. This will only advance 
their destruction. The Kim Yong-sam ring must contemplate over 
the grave consequence which the reckless war maneuver will bring 
about, act with discretion, and immediately stop the maneuver to 
bring in up-to-date missiles including the Patriot missile.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- An estimated 300 
members of the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification 
[Chonkukyonhap] of South Korea held a citizens' rally for the 
realization of national sovereignty in front of the Myongdong 
Cathedral in Seoul Saturday and protested against the scheme of 
the U.S. imperialists to ship "Patriot" missiles into South 
Korea, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  They expressed indignation at the fact that the puppet 
clique 
are kicking up a row over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the 
North, in conspiracy with the United States, and concern over 
the situation of the Korean peninsula which has been more 
strained by such anti-DPRK campaign. 
  After the rally they staged a demonstration, shouting 
anti-U.S., anti-"government" slogans.

<F P=106> ["Papers Call for Overthrow of Kim Yong-sam Traitorous </F>
Group" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- It is two years 
since documents of inter-Korean agreement were effectuated, but 
they have failed to bear fruit and have become sheets of waste 
paper today. 
  Papers here today say this is entirely because the 
"civilian"-veiled traitorous "government" of Kim Yong-sam has 
denied the principles of independence, peace and great national 
unity and obstructed their implementation on unreasonable 
grounds. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The effectuation of the North-South agreement and the joint 
declaration on denuclearization was proclaimed at the sixth 
North-South high-level talks February 19, 1992. This was an 
epoch-making event which served as a landmark in-moving toward 
peace and reunification of the country. 
  Had both the North and the South fulfilled the documents of 
agreement, they would have been able to part with the past 
marred by distrust and confrontation, bring about a new epoch of 
reconciliation, remove the danger of war and open a bright 
horizon of peace and reunification of the country. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, pursued the policy 
of dependence on outside forces more zealously than its 
predecessors and resumed the Team Spirit joint military 
maneuvers with the United States under the pretext of "suspicion 
surrounding the nuclear development" of the North, the war game 
which had been suspended toward the end of the "Sixth Republic." 
This was tantamount to declaring its refusal of all dialogues 
and its overt nullification of the documents of agreement. 
  The puppet clique laid hurdles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks 
and completely opened the rice market of South Korea, yielding 
to pressure from its U.S. master, though its predecessors had 
not dared to do so. 
  Although the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique cried for "reform" 
and "liquidation of the past" it has left intact the "National 
Security Law," the "Security Planning Board" and the "Secret 
Affairs Command," turning South Korea into a grave of human 
rights and democracy. It has broken up the dialogue and 
cooperation between the authorities of North and South which had 
been held in the period of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" 
dictatorship and blocked nongovernmental dialogue and contact. 
  Since the traitor Kim Yong-sam took office in South Korea, 
the acts of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, confrontation and 
war have become more undisguised and vicious, the people's 
desire for independence, democracy and reunification has been 
put down, the documents of agreement between the North and the 
South have been reduced to waste paper, dialogues have collapsed 
and the situation has become worse than in the days before the 
adoption of the North- South agreement. 
  As long as such traitor as Kim Yong-sam is left alone, 
neither reconciliation and unity of the nation nor the peace and 
reunification of the country can be achieved and only 
confrontation and war will befall. 
  The anti-national, anti-reunification group forsaken by the 
people must be overthrown. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is a stumbling block in 
the way of reunification. If the cause of national 
reunification is to be promoted, the block must be removed 
resolutely.

<F P=106> ["Reckless Frenzy of Simpletons" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities at a "meeting of officials concerned with 
mobilization" some time ago called for a full "mobilization 
posture" of para-military forces to cope with an "emergency". 
  Branding this as a reckless frenzy of simpletons, NODONG 
SINMUN in a commentary today says the recent move of the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous clique is very ill-boding as it is a 
criminal step usually taken by warmaniacs on the eve of war. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  This year, too, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has held war 
confabs not infrequently allegedly to "cope with an actual war" 
and "establish a posture of immediate counteraction", and openly 
declared that they would resume "Team Spirit" or stage another 
military exercises. 
  The puppets are also making haste with the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea with the United States, 
unusually scaled up their "military budget" and are hell bent on 
arms buildup. The fact that the Kim Yong-sam group now has put 
on the order of the day the question of mobilizing para-military 
forces ten million strong in a war against the North tells that 
the war frenzy of "civilian" warmaniacs has reached an extremely 
dangerous stage. 
  Due to such criminal moves of the puppets, the situation of 
the Korean peninsula now is in a dangerous phase reminding one 
of the time when the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppet clique unleashed the war to invade the North in 1950. 
  While the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique resorting to 
criminal moves to ignite a war in a "civilian" guise is left 
intact, our fellow countrymen cannot live in peace even a 
moment, nor can they evade a bloodletting from another war. Kim 
Yong-sam, a traitor to the nation and the enemy of peace and 
reunification, must be removed in good time.

<F P=106> ["Doom of Kim Yong-sam Group Sealed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- With the Kim 
Yong-sam traitorous group left intact, it is inevitable that the 
South Korean people fall a prey to outside forces. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this, commenting on the persistent 
struggle of South Korean people against rice market opening. 
  Holding that if the Kim Yong-sam group has a shred of 
national conscience, it must promptly cancel the rice market 
opening as demanded by the South Korean people, the analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, however, schemes to legally finalize 
the opening of the rice market, twaddling about "the final plan 
for the implementation of the agreement" and "follow-up 
measures." 
  Worse still, it brands the demand of the people for 
renegotiation concerning the rice market opening as a call for 
"isolation" of South Korea and their struggle as "violence," 
answering it with fascist suppression. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group keeps all the repressive forces in 
full readiness for action to crack down on the people's struggle 
any moment. Its criminal intention is to suppress the people's 
resistance at the point of the fascist bayonet and hurriedly 
take follow-up measures by all means for the liberalization of 
rice import. 
  The South Korean people, incensed against the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique, are now resolved to turn out in a mass 
struggle to foil its policy of rice market opening and overthrow 
the self-styled "civilian government." 
  It will not be long before the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
meets its disgraceful doom.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
comment on a "speech" on the "policy orientation" of the 
"Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea by its Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil, the traitor. 
  NODONG SINMUN in a commentary brands the traitor Kim 
Chong-pil's malicious slander against the DPRK over the "nuclear 
issue" as an open challenge to the DPRK's sincere efforts for 
reconciliation, unity and dialogue and an unpardonable criminal 
act of trampling upon the desire of the fellow countrymen for 
reunification. 
  The analyst points out: 
  The South Korean puppets are the criminals who have created 
nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula by shipping nuclear 
weapons into South Korea and have stepped up their own nuclear 
armament. So they are not in a position to talk about the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  It is the height of impudence for the puppets to meddle in 
the problem that should be solved through negotiations between 
the DPRK and the United States and say this or that in this 
regard. 
  That day the traitor Kim cried over "armed provocation" by 
the North and raved that it should be checked. His outburst is 
a shameless act that reminds people of a thief crying "Stop 
Thief!" 
  By calling for "close cooperation with friendly countries," 
he meant, in essence, to slay fellow countrymen with the sword 
of outside forces. 
  It cannot be forgiven and overlooked that he cried the South 
"should not make haste with unification" and that it should 
"make full preparations for reunification by prevailing over the 
North". He revealed in this a heinous intention to keep the 
division for an indefinite period, dawdling away time and 
achieve "reunification by prevailing over communism" through a 
war, not a peaceful reunification. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil's outcries for "predominance over 
the North," revealing the scheme to delay reunification and his 
reiteration of the doctrine "unification by prevailing over 
communism" that is not possible any time are all unpardonable 
anti-national criminal acts, says the commentary. 
  MINJU CHOSON in a signed commentary says if the "Democratic 
Liberal Party" continues to bar national reunification with the 
outcries for "unification by prevailing over the North" and 
"unification by prevailing over communism" that are impossible, 
they will face a stern judgment by the people.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries Must Stop 'Economic Sanctions' </F>
Campaign"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities are reportedly arguing that full-scale routine and 
ad hoc inspections must be made because the scope of inspection 
for the continuity of safeguards agreed upon between the DPRK 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is not enough 
to verify the transparency of the nuclear activities of the DPRK. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, answering a question put 
by 
Former Foreign Minister Michio Feb. 18, said "in case economic 
sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council with a final 
breakdown of agreement between North Korea and the IAEA, the 
Japanese Government would show a responsible response." This 
cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to block a 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and bring 
the situation back to the extreme phase. 
  Such act of the Japanese authorities blatantly getting on 
the 
nerve of the DPRK well shows that although they "appreciated" 
in word the result of the negotiation between the DPRK and the 
IAEA in Vienna Feb. 15, unable to ignore the unbiased public 
opinion, it was a reluctant talk and they still pursue, in 
actuality, the policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK through 
"economic sanctions." 
  They have long since threatened "economic sanctions in the 
form of ban on imports and exports, ban on remittance, ban on 
the entry of ships into ports and freezing of North Korea's 
assets." This is a criminal act which may cause an 
unpredictable, dangerous result. 
  Even at this time when the DPRK and the IAEA have reached an 
agreement on the inspection for the continuity of safeguards, 
the Japanese authorities are talking about "full-scale routine 
and ad hoc inspections" and "responsible response." It is not 
hard to guess that their ulterior intention is to frustrate the 
DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost, obstruct a fundamental solution to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and step up in real 
earnest their ambitious plan to convert Japan into a nuclear 
power on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK. 
  Their vicious scheme to put "economic sanctions" on the 
peaceloving DPRK by branding it as a "nuclear culprit" while 
keeping mum about their criminal attempt to build a nuclear 
power deserves criticism from unbiased public opinion. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' outcry for "special inspection" 
and "economic sanctions" in duet with right-wing conservatives 
of the United States is as good as trying to push the DPRK out 
of the Nonproliferation Treaty. It is self-evident that such 
developments would bring irrevocable, grave consequences to 
Japan, too. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must clearly see the staunch will 
of the Korean people who always maintain independence and are 
fully prepared for any contingency. 
  They must look straight at the trend of the times, act with 
discretion and immediately stop the criminal campaign for 
"economic sanctions" against the DPRK.

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Nuclear War Force" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Concern over Japan 
pushing ahead with its program of plutonium stockpile was voiced 
at the International Round Table Conference held in Tokyo. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this reflects 
the 
worldwide caution against Japan, which has surfaced as a new 
nuclear war force in Northeast Asia. 
  What the Japanese reactionaries intend is to stockpile large 
quantities of weapon-grade nuclear materials and mass produce 
and possess nuclear weapons any time, the analyst says, and 
continues: 
  Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line today. It 
plans to possess plutonium enough to make 6,200 nuclear bombs in 
2010. It is now fully prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
Japan has more than 150 companies and 3,300 factories engaging 
themselves in nuclear activities. It set up a nuclear-launching 
system long ago, and recently developed even a long-range 
missile, a means of delivery of nuclear weapons. 
  Japan's scheme of nuclear armament is all the more grave and 
dangerous because it has opened the way of overseas dispatch of 
troops. 
  Its accelerated nuclear armament is a grave threat to peace 
and security of the Korean peninsula and the rest of Northeast 
Asia. We must never be Japan's nuclear victim. We will cope 
with Japan's dangerous nuclear armament with heightened 
vigilance. 
  The promotion of the nuclear armament of Japan, our 
neighbour, in a dangerous stage renders the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula meaningless. To denuclearize Northeast 
Asia including the Korean peninsula is vital to the building of 
a nuclear-free world. 
  The world, not to speak of Asia, must pay due attention to 
Japan's nuclear armament and launch an international campaign to 
check it.

<F P=106> ["France Must Ponder Over the Matter"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- France is now 
misbehaving itself over the definition of the scope of 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards agreed on between 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
  LE MONDE recently cried for a "special inspection" of the 
DPRK, claiming that a "decisive attitude of the international 
community" should be shown. 
  This is a pernicious propaganda aimed at casting a chill 
over 
the agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA. It reveals the 
sinister intention of France to force "special inspection" upon 
the DPRK and take international "sanctions" and pressure against 
it. 
  As was already reported, the afore-said agreement has been 
unanimously welcomed by world public opinion as affirmative 
developments for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  France, however, is obtrusively crying for a "decisive 
attitude of the international community," ignoring the unbiased 
opinion. This is not only an intolerable challenge to us but a 
criminal act to arrest the affirmative developments provided 
with so much efforts. 
  Some time ago, the French foreign minister and the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman argued that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" should 
be "examined" by the United Nations Security Council. France 
has called for "sanctions" more than once against the DPRK to 
isolate and stifle it, in league with the U.S. right-wing 
conservative forces, Japan and the South Korean puppets. 
  Such persistent moves of France against the DPRK are 
apparently aimed at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear 
test, charging the DPRK with the fictitious "nuclear issue." 
  They are also motivated by its wicked design to encourage 
the 
United States, a dialogue partner of the DPRK, to confrontation 
with us to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, cause a military conflict 
in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, profit from a 
massive sale of destructive military equipment and strengthen 
relations with the South Korean puppets. 
  We take a serious view of the criminal acts pursued by the 
French wuthorities to stifle the DPRK. 
  If France continues to resort to such insidious acts without 
discretion, it would drink a bitter cup. 
  France would be well advised to clearly see the situation, 
ponder over the matter and promptly stop such wicked acts as 
doing harm to others.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- Letters to the 
U.S. President, the United Nations secretary general and the 
board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
were adopted at a meeting of political parties and political 
forces in the Middle East for solidarity with the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea held in Syria on February 8. 
  The letter to the U.S. President said the U.S. Government's 
pressure and threat against people's Korea are not aimed at 
solving the problem peacefully but at rendering it complicated. 
  Noting that a proper solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula is that the United States comes out again to 
the negotiating table with people's Korea, it demanded that the 
U.S. forces and nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea 
and the double-standard policy be renounced in dealing with 
international issues. 
  The letter to the United Nations secretary general voiced 
solidarity with people's Korea subjected to threat and blackmail 
and called on him to make responsible efforts for the 
discontinuation of such provocative moves increasing tension. 
  It noted that the United States must be forced to end the 
presence of its forces with nuclear arsenal in South Korea, stop 
the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and come out to 
talks, a proper way for a fair and comprehensive settlement of 
the crisis. 
  The letter to the board of governors of the IAEA pointed out 
that the primary cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula is the presence of the U.S. Forces with nuclear 
weapons in South Korea. 
  It urged the IAEA to free itself from the U.S. pressure in 
the campaign against people's Korea, refrain from applying 
double standards in dealing with the nuclear issue and take a 
responsible action.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Let the `Phone' Issue Jeopardize the </F>
Future of Japan and the United States"] 
  [Text] On 15 February, the United States announced it has 
ruled that "Japan's market is closed for car and portable 
phones, violating a 1989 agreement between the two nations." It 
plans to draw up within 30 days a list of Japanese products 
which will be subject to punitive tariffs. Should Japan fail to 
respond with opening its market, the United States is prepared 
to initiate sanctions, including imposing punitive tariffs. 
  However, this matter is difficult for us to understand, no 
matter how we look at it. 
  A bilateral agreement on cellular phone systems guarantees 
U.S. access to Japan's market by allocating certain frequencies 
to U.S. firms which adopt a transmission system that is 
technologically different from that which Japan has already 
adopted. In other words, the accord gives equal opportunities 
to U.S. firms, but it does not guarantee them equal results 
after they have been given a chance to compete with Japanese 
firms. 
  Currently, the issue has been pulled away from the hands of 
the government and is now subject to business strategies of 
private firms. According to the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, however, the United States has demanded 
during trade talks which have been held so far that Japanese 
phone service companies purchase 225,000 portable phones within 
the next 18 months because U.S. firms have not made a good 
showing. 
  Apparently, the "results-oriented" trade policy of the 
administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton is also reflected 
among private firms. No wonder Japan complains that it is 
impossible to bring this about, to say the least. 
  At their meeting last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and President Clinton must have surely confirmed the two nations 
would resume talks on their trade issues after a cooling-off 
period. The latest U.S. moves rub this agreement in the wrong 
way and add more fuel to the bilateral trade friction, rather 
than help it cool off. 
  Since the Japan-U.S. summit meeting has ended in a failure, 
we urge that both nations maintain their composure. Should the 
two nations, whose combined GNP accounts for 40 percent of the 
world's total GNP, find themselves bogged down in a trade war, 
it would be harmful not only to themselves, but also to the 
whole world. 
  It cannot be denied that the latest U.S. decision implies a 
"retaliatory" measure against Japan for the latter's rejection 
of U.S. demands for numerical targets at the framework trade 
talks. 
  It has also been reported that the United States intends to 
withdraw a promise it has made at GATT's new round of 
multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round) to reduce tariffs on 
electronic products. It is believed the United States has in 
mind major Japanese items in connection with this move. After 
the summit meeting, the U.S. Government, together with Congress, 
has hinted that it is considering various options toward 
imposing retaliatory measures against Japan. This is extremely 
regrettable. 
  The United States is resorting to a strategy which includes 
sanctions because it believes that, from past experience, Japan 
will not change unless there is outside pressure and that, if 
pressured, Japan will eventually give in. 
  Unfortunately, the agreement between the two nations in 1989 
regarding opening of Japan's market for car and portable 
telephones is a classic example. At the time, the Japanese 
Government insisted there were "no more frequencies left for 
allotment" to U.S. firms. However, the government gave in to 
demands of the U.S. Government, which threatened sanctions by 
invoking its 1988 Trade Act. Thus, the government agreed to a 
last-minute political settlement which allowed U.S. firms to 
gain access to the Japanese market. 
  Such involuntary market opening maneuvers should now be 
discontinued. 
  Should the U.S. Government initiate sanctions against Japan, 
it would be logical for Japan to take its case before 
multilateral review under GATT. That, however, would further 
escalate the tension between the two nations. 
  The telecommunications industry can be expected to still 
continue making solid growth. We feel Japan and the United 
States can further cooperate in fields they are strong in, such 
as technological and product development and building 
information networks.

  [Text] Saying that they will take the case to the GATT, 
the Prime Minister's Official Residence, Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunication, and other ministries are maintaining the 
stand of opposing the U.S. move to impose economic sanctions 
against Japan. In this regard, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official expressed strong concern on 17 February saying "such a 
reaction will worsen the Japan-U.S. relations." 
  The Foreign Ministry plans to ask relevant agencies to 
coolly 
respond to the U.S. move while giving consideration to bilateral 
ties. 
  The United States decided that "Japan violated the accord" 
over the issue of selling mobile phones in the Japanese market. 
Following this decision, the United States is suggesting the 
possibility of reviving the Super 301 (clause designed to 
specify unfair trade partners and unfair acts and to impose 
sanctions against them). In this regard, some government 
officials are saying that depending on the nature of sanctions, 
they will not hesitate to appeal to the GATT. Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said: "We will deal with the situation on the 
basis of the international rules." 
  However, the Foreign Ministry -- which takes not only 
economic aspects but also overall Japan-U.S. ties, including 
security matters, into consideration -- wants to ask the United 
States to calmly deal with the issue. At the same time, it 
points out the need for the government to objectively and calmly 
respond to the U.S. move, saying that "we should avoid radical 
responses and deal with the issues one by one while actually 
observing the U.S. move and thoroughly studying contents (of 
sanctions against Japan)," (according to a senior Foreign 
Ministry official). Foreign Ministry officials are saying this 
because they feel a sense of crisis that "the entire Japan-U.S. 
relationship will go wrong once both sides start to speak 
emotionally," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). 
  As for the future measures to deal with the situation, the 
Foreign Ministry firmly maintains its conventional stance that 
"economic issues should be separated from (political issues) to 
avoid their negative impact on the entire Japan-U.S. 
relationship," (according to a government source). The Foreign 
Ministry wants to secure U.S. understanding by working out its 
own market liberalization measures soon and conveying government 
policies to the United States through some means, such as 
dispatching a special envoy to the United States. 
  Moreover, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry are working in close 
cooperation with each other. Kunihiko Saito, vice minister of 
foreign affairs, and Koichiro Matsuura, deputy minister for 
foreign affairs, are contacting Hideaki Kumano, vice minister 
of international trade and industry, and Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice 
minister for international affairs, respectively. The Foreign 
Ministry plans to do its best to "avoid a situation in which 
sparks of the economic issues spread out to the entire 
Japan-U.S. relationship causing brush fires," (according to a 
senior Foreign Ministry official).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Package of Market Opening Measures </F>
Under Study -- Government Struggling To Come Up With a Trump 
Card To Play"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. framework talks have entered a new stage 
in the search to find a way to break the deadlock. The Japanese 
Government will hold a meeting of cabinet ministers in charge of 
economic affairs early next week to discuss specific action 
programs to promote Japanese imports, increase public 
investment, and cut the trade surplus. The idea is being 
floated of sending a special envoy to the United States right 
after the specific action programs are mapped out. The 
government wants to prevent any U.S. sanctions on Japan from 
decisively worsening bilateral relations. But the government is 
struggling to come up with specific measures which might 
represent a trump card and help break the impasse. The 
restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade 
Act is regarded as unavoidable. 
<H5>  Japan's Responses </H5>
  In a bid to break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, 
the government has decided to speedily design a package of 
measures focusing on four areas -- government procurement, 
competitive policy, the promotion of imports, and deregulation. 
A senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
official said on 19 February that "we can present vision for the 
macroeconomics area." The government has suggested the 
possibility of increasing the 430-trillion-yen "Basic Plan For 
Public Investment." The Japanese Government promised the United 
States in June 1990 it would spend that figure on public 
investment. Every government ministry and agency has begun 
studying a package of firm measures. 
  The "Basic Plan For Public Investment," to be implemented 
between 1991 through the year 2000, was agreed between Japan and 
the United States at the structural impediment initiative talks. 
The idea is quickly surfacing that the government should set 
the public investment increase to be incorporated in the fiscal 
1995 budget while promoting debate among the ruling coalition 
parties on a sweeping reform of the current tax system. Its 
subsequent plan to increase public spending should then be 
speedily presented to the United States. 
  Ways to expand "the government procurement action program," 
which was decided by the cabinet on 4 February, will be studied. 
In the particular area of government procurement of 
telecommunications gear and medical equipment, the government 
will adopt a comprehensive appraisal system under which 
consideration will be given to the function of some items, in 
addition to their price, when choosing among final tenders. The 
government is likely to look at the possibility of reducing the 
level of procurement spending that government-controlled 
organizations are obliged to announce publicly in early January 
each year. 
  At the framework talks on competitive policy, the United 
States strongly urged Japan to "address noncompetitive practices 
by Japanese enterprises." The government is expected to examine 
the possibility of strengthening the Fair Trade Commission's 
inspection function and rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly 
Law. In a bid to prevent a recurrence of bid-rigging, the 
government will also examine ways to expand public works 
projects subject to open competitive tender. 
  The government will consider additionally constructing 
foreign access zones, expanding permanent exhibitions of 
imported housing, and creating information centers to help 
foreign firms eager to export to Japan. The government will 
study integrating the current customs clearance and import 
procedures into a single procedure and increasing the number of 
imported goods exempted from import inspections. 
  It is highly likely that the government will relax the 
import 
certification and standard system for automobiles, which the 
United States lobbied for strongly at the framework talks. The 
government will study ways to expand access to loans extended by 
government-backed financial institutions for enterprises 
starting business following deregulation. In the financial 
area, the government will establish a public hearing system to 
deal with complaints filed by foreign-affiliated insurance 
companies. It will also introduce an insurance brokerage system. 
<H5>  Future U.S. Moves </H5>
  In reaction to the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks, the U.S. Government quickly reached a consensus on taking 
a hard-line trade policy toward Japan. The U.S. Government, 
which has already begun taking action to impose sanctions on 
Japan over the mobile phone issue, will announce on 17 February 
a set of new trade measures against Japan centered on 
restoration of the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade 
Act. Influential Republicans and Democrats in Congress support 
a tough stand against Japan and the Congress will start full 
deliberation of a bill against Japan on 22 February, once the 
current recess is over. 
  The U.S. Government has harshly criticized Japan for 
rejecting objective criteria to gauge the openness of the 
Japanese market. At the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks, the 
United States presented a compromise proposal under which "Japan 
would maintain its trend of import growth." The Japanese side 
showed no intention of compromising with the United States and 
flatly rejected the U.S. compromise, saying: "We cannot go 
along with the U.S. proposal to set numerical targets." 
  Tokyo's rejection of objective criteria has reinforced 
criticism of Japan in the United States. Even American 
champions of free trade, including Trade Subcommittee Chairman 
Gibbons of the House Committee on Appropriations, have begun to 
think "we have no choice but to take a hard line against Japan." 
Small businesses and labor organizations that previously 
criticized President Clinton's trade policy, now intend to 
support his administration. 
  The Clinton administration is being cautious about "imposing 
actual sanctions on Japan" in order to avoid further clashes 
with Tokyo. The National Economic Council (NEC) is in charge of 
mapping out a package of concrete trade measures against Japan 
and the U.S. Government will make a decision on 17 February. 
The U.S. Government is trying to apply the maximum pressure on 
Japan, and this is likely only to heighten tensions in 
Japan-U.S. trade relations.

  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, in a 19 
February speech in Nagoya, touched on the issue of Japan's trade 
surplus which has caused confrontation between Japan and the 
United States. He said: "The government is not in a position 
of being able to interfere in automakers' business in a 
capitalist nation or a country in which market mechanism 
functions well. And, there is no such law. If the automobile 
and insurance industries come up with ideas to solve the issue, 
it may be necessary for the government to support them in 
implementing the ideas." Thus, he indicated that trade 
imbalance should be corrected mainly through the private 
sector's voluntary efforts.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Omago: "Japan, U.S. </F>
Could Not Catch `Signs for Concessions'"] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended in 
failure. However, during the final phase of the negotiations, 
there were three chances for reaching an agreement. The United 
States once showed its intention to give up the demand for 
Japan's commitment on numerical targets for market 
liberalization. Also, the nation expressed great expectations 
for Japan's tax cut policy pledged by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. While the talks have 
failed due to mutual misunderstanding and distrust resulting 
from a lack of communications, a review of these points may 
provide some clue for "reconciliation" in the future. 
<H3>  First Chance -- Compromise Plan Shown by U.S.; Dispatch of 
Special Envoy Went Wrong </H3>
  Commenting on one of the reasons for the breakup of the 
framework talks and the Washington summit, a White House 
official said: "The bilateral discord at the final stage of the 
negotiations started when special envoy Kiuchi visited 
Washington." According to U.S. officials, Kiuchi met with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to pave the way for Foreign Minister 
Hata's U.S. visit on 9 February. However, he "just conveyed the 
prime minister's desire for settling the negotiations without 
any proposals." In explaining this, Japanese officials said 
"the prime minister's purpose was to sound out the true 
intention of the United States." But the envoy could not do so 
because U.S. officials were displeased with the lack of new 
proposals. 
<H5>  Sudden Proposal from U.S. </H5>
  On the afternoon of 8 February, or immediately after the 
envoy's visit, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor 
conveyed his decision to discontinue vice ministerial and 
working-level framework negotiations in Washington. His 
high-handed attitude intensified the sense of distrust among 
Japanese negotiators, and this became an obstacle to mutual 
concessions. 
  The U.S. negotiators had a wrong impression, too. When 
Foreign Minister Hata told U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter 
Mondale that he wants to "sincerely settle" the negotiations, 
the United States had too much expectation for "Japan's new 
proposals on tax cut and numerical target." 
  In fact, Deputy Assistant to the U.S. President Bowman 
Cutter 
(of the National Economic Council) showed a concession plan on 
the objective criteria issue to Deputy Vice Foreign Minister 
Koichiro Matsuura. According to him, the United States was 
ready to make concessions on the following points: 1) it will be 
acceptable if the criteria for government procurement can 
measure the trend of import growth of the past; 2) no objective 
criteria is necessary on the insurance negotiation; and 3) it 
will be acceptable if criteria for assessing auto parts imports 
can measure the trend of import growth of the past. He also 
proposed an extension of the framework talks by a month. The 
proposals made at the initiative of the White House looked 
acceptable to Japan. However, Japanese negotiators could not 
accept the offer since they did not believe it, which was too 
far from the USTR's position. 
  The first round of the Hata-Kantor negotiations started on 
the morning of 10 February, but U.S. negotiators were 
disappointed that he had no proposal to break the deadlock over 
the bilateral talks. Following this, President Clinton had a 
meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC), and declared "no 
empty agreement is needed." After this, the USTR's Office became 
even more difficult to deal with. 
<H5>  Second Chance -- No Commitment on Tax Cut </H5>
  Yet, the tough attitude of USTR Kantor was not very obvious 
when Hata met him on the evening of 10 February. U.S. officials 
said, at that time, the United States was still thinking of a 
concession on the objective criteria issue if Japan shows a 
clear decision on an income tax cut. However, the United States 
could not show its concession plan since Hata did not say "the 
tax cut will be continued after 1994" in meetings with Vice 
President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Japan 
thus missed its second chance. 
  Hata and Kantor met again at 0100 local time on 11 February, 
and the USTR's Office finally showed its own opinion. U.S. 
negotiators again demanded "future-oriented" criteria, and it 
was impossible for Japan to accept it. The ministerial talks 
broke down when Foreign Minister Hata finally decided to reject 
the U.S. demand. 
<H5>  Last Chance -- Hosokawa Did Not Clarify Commitments </H5>
  The last chance was the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11 
February. White House officials let the President bring 
"concession plans on the objective criteria issue and on 
extension of the talks" in expectation for "Hosokawa's definite 
pledge on the tax cut and objective criteria issues." Yet, 
Hosokawa made no commitments during the summit talks. 
  While Clinton did not pick on Hosokawa in consideration for 
"the prime minister's efforts on the tax cut issue," he had to 
get rid of the U.S. concession plan. 
  After the talks, a senior White House official said "the 
President was somewhat disappointed with what the prime minister 
said." 
  Taking this into account, it is obvious that the breakdown 
of 
the bilateral talks was because both Japan and the United States 
could not catch signs for concessions because of lack of mutual 
understanding. Due to bureaucratic sectionalism [nawabari 
ishiki] in both Japan and the United States, officials of 
different ministries and agencies placed different importance on 
the issues of tax reduction and the objective criteria. Because 
of this, they failed to realize points at issue during 
discussions. It appears the failure in the bilateral talks 
indicates the need for overcoming bureaucratic barriers to 
settle negotiations both on micro and macroeconomic issues.

  [Text] In response to the breakdown of Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, the government has decided to map out a package 
of new measures to open the Japanese market. The government, 
which sees improvement in the current procedures for government 
procurement as the centerpiece of the package of new measures to 
open the Japanese market, plans to take steps in 1994 to improve 
the procedures. The government also has begun to study ways to 
set up a grievance body to be mandated to handle complaints 
about government procurement by the end of March. Prime Minister 
Hosokawa plans to issue a statement announcing that his 
government will carry through the policy of "indiscriminate 
procurement" of domestic and foreign goods. 
  The package of new measures to open the Japanese market is 
to 
include specific measures in four points to improve the current 
procedures for government procurement, promote deregulation, 
increase imports and domestic investment, and adopt a 
competitive policy. 
  The government procurement action program implementation 
committee, which is made of administrative vice ministers from 
government ministries and agencies, is now at work to map out an 
action program to 1) strictly enforce the new open competitive 
tender system and expand the line of business accessible to the 
grievance body. With the United States increasingly taking a 
hard-line posture toward Japan, the government has decided to 
map out the action program earlier than scheduled. Regarding the 
government procurement of medical equipment and 
telecommunications gear whcih has been under discussion at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the government plans to 
improve the current procedures for their procurement as Japanese 
negotiators have promised at the talks. The government will 
procure goods worth more than 100,000 SDR (the IMF's special 
drawing rights, approximately 15 million yen) through bidding 
and to adopt a "comprehensive appraisal formula" under which 
consideration is given not only to prices, but to function for a 
final choice of successful tenders. 
  As for the insurance sector, on which negotiations have 
broken down at the economic framework talks, the government 
plans to announce plans to reform the current insurance system. 
On the automobile and auto parts sector, the government intends 
to promote industrial cooperation between Japanese automakers 
and American auto parts makers after choosing specific items of 
auto parts for such industrial cooperation. The government also 
plans to improve the current certification and standard for 
automobile imports.

<F P=106> [Article by Hideki Somemiya, researcher, Nomura Research </F>
Institute: "Time Will Come for Attrition of Rating Agencies; 
Search for Enhancement of Quality of Rating Systems as 
Investment Data"] 
  [Text] When viewing ratings of Japanese corporations, 
it is noted that ratings assigned by U.S. rating agencies are 
considerably more rigid than those assigned by Japanese rating 
agencies. This is probably attributable to wide differences 
between Japanese and U.S. ratings agencies in the way they view 
various industries and in their perceptions about credit 
standing. Debenture ratings in Japan are gaining recognition 
primarily in the area of corporate bond markets, but in the 
future as investors increase their interest in ratings, they 
will probably opt for rating agencies that can stand the test of 
reliability. Rating agencies will probably be required to 
enhance the quality of ratings in terms of investment data. 
<H3>  Rating Systems Expand Primarily in Connection With New 
Issues Market </H3>
  Debenture rating systems are rapidly gaining recognition in 
Japan. Only 14 years have passed since the Japan Bond Research 
Institute was established as our nation's first rating agency in 
1979, but corporations with published ratings now total more 
than 800. That number represents one-third of the firms whose 
stock is traded on the stock exchanges. 
  A major factor contributing to the widespread use of rating 
systems over such a short period was the incorporation of 
ratings in standards for issuance of corporate debentures. 
Unlike the United States where almost one century has passed 
since the birth of rating systems, issuance of corporate 
debentures in Japan was rigidly regulated until the 1970's by 
measures such as the requirement for collateral and controls 
exercised by the Bond Raising Adjustment Council. 
  As issuance of corporate debentures was decontrolled in the 
1980's, standards for issue of debentures were relaxed from 
numerical standards which emphasized the size of net assets to 
standards which required the acquisition of ratings above a 
specified level. And, in 1990, quality rating standards of 
domestic corporate debentures were consolidated into one rating 
system. Stock exchange-listed corporations of our nation which 
in the 1980's shifted from primary procurement of capital from 
indirect financing to direct financing sharply increased their 
interest in rating systems based on standards for rating 
debentures. 
  On the other hand, the actual situation was one in which 
little awareness existed of the aspect wherein the primary role 
of rating systems is to provide investment data. In the past, 
investor concern was not directed at credit risk, because very 
few ordinary corporate debentures where credit ratings are 
important had been issued, thus precluding the formation of 
active markets and very few corporate debenture defaults ever 
occurred. 
  In recent years, new issues of ordinary corporate debentures 
have finally increased and expectations have heightened for the 
formation of markets for corporate debentures. On the other 
hand, the economic recession and the issue of nonperforming 
assets have inspired growing sensitivity to corporate credit 
ratings. In actual situations, differences in market interest 
rates of interest-bearing bank debentures traded by various 
long-term credit banks have occurred and there have been cases 
where firms with low ratings have had difficulty in issuing 
commercial paper. On the other hand, there have been cases where 
institutional investors have attempted to use rating systems. As 
the role played by rating systems in the form of credit data 
increases in stature, they will probably face a stronger 
challenge in terms of ratings reliability. 
  In the United States, ratings were issued as information to 
be used by investors, but they gained increased confidence of 
investors owing to the fact that many debentures with low 
ratings underwent default during the Great Depression. Wider use 
of rating systems among investors without the impact of an 
"incident" like the Great Depression will probably require 
improvements in the operation of the infrastructure represented 
by the corporate stock markets and enhancement in the quality of 
ratings as credit data. Unless the methods used by the rating 
agencies in assigning ratings to corporations are clarified to 
include a debate on "just what do we mean when we speak of the 
credit strength of our nation's corporations," we cannot win the 
confidence of investors in rating systems. 
  We would like to ask rating agencies to provide clearly 
defined explanations of rating codes assigned as a result of 
evaluations as well as why the ratings were assigned. 
<H5>  Wide Differences Between Japanese and U.S. Ratings </H5>
  Currently, there are a total of nine rating agencies that 
can 
be used under the debenture qualification standards of our 
nation, but agencies whose performance records are widely known 
encompass five firms including two of U.S. origin known as 
Moody's (MDY) and Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) and three of 
Japanese origin known as Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI), 
Nippon Investment Service (NIS), and Japan Credit Research (JCR). 
  Each of these agencies uses the same rating codes and each 
of 
the codes should represent the same rating for any given firm 
regardless of which agency assigned the rating. However, when 
viewing the published ratings, ratings assigned to any given 
firm can vary widely depending on the rating agency in question. 
The widest variation in ratings assigned exist between those 
assigned by Japanese rating agencies and U.S. rating agencies.

  This divergence in ratings became the center of attention 
when Moody's began to aggressively publish so-called 
"unsolicited ratings" in 1992 without being requested by the 
debenture-issuing corporations. Ratings of Japanese firms 
published by Moody's as of January 1992 numbered 75, but doubled 
to 166 by September 1993. 
  Inclusion of ratings which were substantially lower than 
those issued by Japanese rating agencies became a matter of 
controversy. As of the end of July 1993, 20 Japanese 
corporations had been rated by Moody's as Ba or unqualified for 
investment, but 11 of those firms were rated A by Japanese 
rating agencies. There were also three Japanese corporations 
that had been rated B, which means that there is a 35-percent 
possibility of default within 10 years according to statistical 
research conducted by Moody's. Moody's overall average rating 
for Japanese corporations is A3, compared to an overall average 
rating assigned to the same Japanese corporations by Japanese 
ratings agencies of AA-, reflecting an overall difference of one 
grade. When viewed from the detailed perspective of notches 
expressed in plus or minus signs, there is a substantial 
divergence of three notches. The issuance of unsolicited ratings 
in such a manner resulted in more than just a minimal 
antagonistic reaction from the applicable debenture-issuing 
corporations. The situation created the term "Moody's shock." 
  As indicated in Table 1, 35 (23 percent) of the 154 Japanese 
corporations rated by Japanese and U.S. rating agencies as of 
the end of July 1993 were rated lower by the U.S.-based rating 
agency by two or more grades. Table 2 reflects the industry 
ratings of the 35 corporations, while the graph [not 
translated] reflects the average industry ratings assigned by 
JBRI and Moody's. 
  Ratings assigned by U.S. rating agencies are not 
substantially lower in all cases, ratings are substantially 
lower in some cases and moderately lower in other cases. 
  More firms are rated lower by two or more grades by U.S. 
rating agencies among manufacturing firms such as steel and 
textiles, while fewer firms are rated as such in the 
transportation equipment industries such as automotive and 
electrical equipment and precision instruments. As an example, 
JBRI ratings for transportation equipment and steel are in the 
same AA range, while Moody rates transportation equipment at an 
average of A1 in contrast to an average rate of Baa2 for steel, 
reflecting a substantial divergence. 
  Japanese rating agencies still assign high ratings to former 
basic industries of our nation, but U.S. rating agencies seem to 
assign considerably lower ratings. 
  On the other hand, substantial rating differentials are 
noted 
in the housing, real estate, and construction categories of the 
nonmanufacturing industries. Not only are these industries of a 
category that does not exist as extensively overseas as they do 
in Japan, but substantial differences in ratings between 
Japanese and U.S. rating agencies are probably attributable to 
differences in the treatment of balance sheets reflecting 
falling land values. 
  In industries such as electric power and gas and finance, 
where risks are minimized through regulation, divergences in 
ratings are relatively small and only a few firms are rated 
lower by two or more grades by U.S. rating agencies. In the 
banking industry, controversy was stirred by the alleged 
unsolicited low ratings by Moody's, but of 32 banks sampled, 
only five (16 percent) including trust and banking firms were 
assigned ratings which were two or more grades lower than those 
assigned by Japanese rating agencies. Banks on average were 
rated A1 by Moody's and AA by JBRI, reflecting a relatively 
small differential between Japanese and U.S. ratings. Finally, 
in the transportation area, marine transportation rating 
differentials were substantial, while differences in ratings for 
the electric rail industry were minor. 
  Japanese and U.S. rating differentials average one grade 
overall, but the divergences are relatively more substantial in 
the lower rated areas. Eight firms are rated exactly the same by 
both Moody's and JBRI and six of those firms are rated AAA. 
Other firms where Japanese-U.S. rating differentials are 
minimal, i.e., where U.S. rating agency ratings are high, are 
characterized by favorable equity-debt ratios and minimal 
concern for asset conditions. 
<H5>  Why Do Differentials Exist? </H5>
  In assigning ratings, Japanese rating agencies seem to place 
emphasis on relative comparisons among Japanese corporations, 
while U.S. rating firms seem to emphasize comparisons on an 
international level. 
  To begin with, Japanese rating agencies do not rate overseas 
firms. In the case of U.S. rating agencies, if they have already 
rated firms in a given industry in Europe and the United States 
and can rate Japanese firms based on a comparison of such 
existing ratings. It could be said that Japan-U.S. ratings vary 
widely in those cases where a firm may be competitive in Japan, 
but to a lesser degree on an international basis. 
  Additionally, a point particularly appraised highly by 
Japanese rating agencies is said to be the credit potential 
peculiar to the Japanese corporate climate which is difficult to 
reflect in any financial index. In the case of a historically 
well-established major corporation in our nation, there is 
little risk of the firm falling victim to a management crisis 
even if it is marginally profitable and has an unfavorable 
financial structure. Such firms enjoy a credit standing peculiar 
to major Japanese firms which is difficult to explain on a 
logical basis, but is based on factors such as supporting roles 
played by affiliated companies and main banks and commitments 
made by government authorities. It appears that perceptions of 
such credit standings vary widely between Japanese and U.S. 
rating agencies. 
  On the other hand, financial and public service industries 
covered by explicit regulations are aggressively rated higher by 
U.S. rating agencies. 
  Then, there is the possibility that conservative ratings are 
issued in those cases of unsolicited ratings because of the lack 
of adequate data on which to base appraisals. It is especially 
questionable whether valid ratings can be made based solely on 
externally available information in the case of banks and 
nonbanks. 
<H3>  Divergences in Ratings Among Japanese Rating Agencies Is 
Minimal </H3>
  Divergences in ratings among the three Japanese rating 
agencies is small compared to those between Japanese and U.S. 
rating agencies, as reflected in Table 3. Regardless of which 
comparison is viewed, 60 percent of the firms assigned multiple 
ratings reflect ratings which are essentially the same with less 
than one notch of variance. Further, 90 percent of the firms are 
limited to variances which fall within a notch.

  However, a look at firms whose assigned ratings vary shows 
that of the three rating agencies, there is a trend whereby JBRI 
ratings are the lowest and JCR ratings are the highest. In other 
words, as of the end of July 1993, JBRI rated 54 firms lower 
than NIS and 21 higher than NIS, while rating 34 firms lower 
than JCR and higher than JCR in the case of seven firms. In 
comparisons between NIS and JCR, NIS rated 22 firms lower and 17 
firms higher, indicating a trend whereby NIS assigned somewhat 
lower ratings. 
  A comparison of ratings by the three Japanese rating 
agencies 
shows that differentials between JBRI and the other two agencies 
have diminished and that between NIS and JCR, it should be noted 
that more firms are being assigned lower ratings by JCR. 
<H5>  Eventual Reduction in Differentials </H5>
  Ratings reflect the opinions of independent rating agencies 
and variances are unavoidable because they are based ultimately 
on subjective judgments. However, from the standpoint of 
investors, lenient appraisals are risky and overly rigid ratings 
could result in missed opportunities. 
  It is imperative that current differentials in ratings by 
rating agencies will become the topic of debate as use of such 
data by investors progresses. As activity in stock markets 
intensify, trading by investors based on evaluations of reliable 
rating agencies will take place and such evaluations will be 
reflected in market prices. Even for firms issuing debentures, 
there will be no value in being rated by rating agencies not 
used by investors, leading to diminishing rating differentials 
among rating agencies and the attrition of rating agencies that 
fail to gain the credibility of investors. 
  Further, debate is taking place which aims at the future 
discontinuation of qualification standards for the issuance of 
debentures. If circumstances are such that investors are unable 
to check the reliability of stocks in the market place, there is 
the risk that issuing firms will not hesitate to work with 
rating agencies that issue high ratings merely for the sake of 
satisfying qualification standards. However, if qualification 
standards are discontinued, the market will become the 
qualifying judge for stocks and only ratings winning the trust 
of investors will prevail. 
  Since revenues of Japanese rating agencies are currently 
dependent on rating fees collected from corporations issuing 
debentures, the objective of agencies was to increase the number 
of firms soliciting ratings and stabilizing the revenue base. 
However, now as investors focus on the rating differentials 
among the agencies, agencies must now compete with each other on 
the basis of quality of ratings as investment data.

  [Text] The Self Defense Forces [SDF] have been conducting 
Japan-U.S. joint exercises over the past nine years. Based on 
statements by those connected with the exercise, it was 
disclosed on 19 February that at the command post exercise [CPX] 
conducted during the joint exercise, SDF units were supposed to 
attack Russian territories, including the four northern islands 
and Sakhalin. Despite the fact that the CPX is conducted on 
computer screens without actual mobilization of units, the 
exercise may become a controversial issue because such an 
exercise could be regarded as a deviation from the authority of 
the SDF whose objective is to defend Japanese territorial land, 
sea and air space based on the principle of an exclusively 
defense-oriented posture. 
  The objective of conducting a CPX, which is different from 
an 
actual exercise [jitsudo enshu] in which units will be actually 
mobilized, is to train staff officers in conducting liaison 
between the "exercise command [renshu bu]," which is in command 
of actual operations, and the "commanding headquarters [tosai 
bu]," which is in charge of creating imaginary circumstances 
[jokyo sotei] based on the scenario. 
  The CPX, which was started in fiscal 1985, has been 
conducted 
every year except in the year of the Gulf war. The eighth CPX 
conducted this year lasted 10 days, from 26 January through 4 
February, with the participation of some 3,200 U.S. Forces 
personnel and about 3,400 SDF personnel. 
  Acting as the commanding officer from SDF was Tetsuya 
Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council, and from the 
U.S. forces was Richard Meyers, commander of U.S. Forces Japan 
[USFJ]. While the USFJ set up its commanding headquarters at 
Yokota Base, the SDF set up its commanding headquarters at the 
Defense Agency's Central Command, and its exercise commands at 
the operation rooms of the Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff 
Office, and Air Staff Office. 
  As was done in past years, the exercise started with an 
attack and landing on Hokkaido by Russia, which is regarded as 
an "imaginary enemy." It is reported, however, that no attacks 
were conducted against Russian territories or the northern 
territories because the exercise was concluded by "UN 
mediation." However, it was also reported that at the CPX 
conducted in the past years, training in attacks against various 
places were conducted in accordance with different 
circumstances; and an attack against Russia's maritime oblasts 
is named "C-1 Attack"; attack against the four northern islands, 
"C-2 Attack"; and attack against Sakhalin, "C-3 attack." 
  In an exercise conducted in a certain year, the exercise 
command reported to and requested the commanding headquarters to 
launch attacks against a unit of war vessels based on the 
imaginary circumstances that a unit of Russian war vessels 
intending to make a landing on Hokkaido was concentrated at 
Aniva Bay in southern Sakhalin. Based on the judgment of the 
commanding headquarters, a permit for attacks was issued. Then 
the U.S. Forces first attacked Russian SAM's (surface-to-air 
missiles) deployed at such places as Notaro at the southernmost 
tip of Sakhalin; secured command of the air; and then F-1 
support fighters of the Air Self-Defense Force attacked Russian 
vessels. Reportedly, such an exercise was conducted in the past 
but this scenario has been handled as "top secret."

  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister, appeared on a live program of 
Tokai Television on the morning of 19 February. In the program, 
he touched on how Japan should deal with the DPRK's (North 
Korea's) suspected possession of nuclear arms in its diplomacy 
toward the country. He stressed: "It is important that the 
United States, Japan, and the ROK will get united in dialogue 
with the country gradually and step by step." He also added: 
"Because some members of the ruling coalition parties have had 
close relations with North Korea, it would be possible to hold 
dialogue with the country via them." Thus, he indicated that 
the ruling parties would also seek dialogue with North Korea 
through diplomatic efforts with the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan and other parties playing a mediatory role.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa firmed up his 
intention on 19 February to go ahead with cabinet reshuffle, 
which is a focal point of the political situation, at the end of 
February. He will start making a full-fledged effort to iron out 
differences of opinions among the ruling coalition parties early 
next week. However, members of the ruling parties think that it 
is likely that the cabinet will be reshuffled around 28 February 
because some members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] are beginning to say that an early cabinet reshuffle is 
unavoidable. In addition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, whose fate as chief cabinet secretary has become a 
focal point of the cabinet reshuffle, disclosed his intention on 
19 February to abide by the prime minister's final decision. 
However, it is expected that the SDPJ and other parties will 
oppose the idea of having a cabinet reshuffle before reaching a 
conclusion on revision of the political reform bills. It is 
certain that the conclusion will be delayed until next month. 
Therefore, the prime minister is assuming the stand of making 
the final decision on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle while 
carefully observing the outcome of the coordination-making 
process within the ruling parties. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, in his speech delivered in 
Nagoya on 19 February, commented on the issue of a cabinet 
reshuffle, saying: "Generally speaking, we are not in a 
situation of reshuffling the cabinet because we just started 
deliberations on economic matters and the budget issue." He 
also said: "It is up to the prime minister to decide to 
reshuffle his cabinet. I am a party representative and I will 
express my opinion whenever necessary. Fundamentally, I will do 
my best to support the Hosokawa administration. I am not in the 
position of clinging to the post of the chief cabinet secretary 
or being reluctant to give it up." In this way, he explained 
his intention to abide by the prime minister's decision. 
  As for the scale of the reshuffle, the prime minister 
initially wanted to minimize it by removing Takemura from the 
post of chief cabinet secretary and assigning him to another 
cabinet post. However, due to strong opposition from the SDPJ 
and Sakigake [Harbinger], he plans to make a medium-scale 
cabinet reshuffle to lessen the impression that it is designed 
to "dump Takemura." 
  In addition to Takemura's case, personnel reshuffle of 
officials in charge of political reform -- whose remaining tasks 
are to revise the political reform bills and to draw up bills 
for division of single-seat constituencies -- and the 
possibility of appointing SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to a 
cabinet post will be the focal points of the cabinet reshuffle. 
Among the ruling parties, the SDPJ is the only party whose 
chairman is not a cabinet member.

<F P=106> [Roundtable talk between Koshiro Ishida, Komeito (Clean </F>
Government Party) chairman and director general of the 
Management and Coordination Agency; Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and health and welfare 
minister; Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger) and 
chief cabinet secretary; Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), and deputy prime minister and foreign minister; 
and Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan (SDPJ); moderated by Yoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
political department chief; place and date not given; first 
paragraph is YOMIURI introduction] 
  [Text] Following the enactment of a package of four 
political reform bills, YOMIURI SHIMBUN has invited five 
coalition leaders to discuss the merit of the bills, the 
prospects for political realignment, as well as other political 
issues at hand. As for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], we had a separate interview with Secretary General 
Yoshiro Mori. 
<H3>  Political Reform Legislation: What Does It Signify and How 
Can It Be Assessed? </H3>
  [Oikawa] What does the enactment of the four political 
reform 
bills signify and how do you assess it? 
  [Takemura] I felt that Nagatacho [the political center of 
Japan in Tokyo] has finally recovered its sound thinking. Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and I were watching the upper house 
reject the reform bills on television. Shortly after that I 
said, "Perhaps it is better, though we did not expect such a 
situation," and he replied, "Yes, you are right." The prime 
minister would have great difficulty in redistricting the 
nation, in choosing members of the council to be in charge of 
drafting a redistricting plan, if the reform package were 
enacted by only a narrow margin of two to three votes. He was 
aware of that. So for him, a wide consensus was indispensable. 
  [Murayama] I really welcome the enactment of the political 
reform bills because the Hosokawa Cabinet began by staking its 
political fortunes on the implementation of political reform. 
However, as SDPJ chairman, I would like to stress that the 
biggest point lying at the bottom of the political reform issue 
is the prevention of corruption. I regret that the fund-raising 
control system was eased (to allow each lawmaker to set up one 
fund-raising body to receive corporate donations for a 
transitional period of five years, while each company will be 
permitted to contribute up to 500,000 yen a year), because the 
SDPJ has devoted itself intensely to keeping the proposed ban on 
corporate donations to individual lawmakers unchanged. However, 
I feel happy because the coalition government was able to 
fulfill its responsibility after all. 
  [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, did you not expect the failure 
of 
the reform bills? 
  [Murayama] I never had such a thought, because as a 
coalition 
member, the SDPJ is also responsible. 
  [Ishida] I am not 100 percent satisfied with the political 
reform legislation. However, when I think of the difficulties 
we had -- finding common ground within the multifactional 
coalition, plus reaching a compromise with the opposition LDP -- 
I should say it was the best we could do. It was a historic 
achievement. 
  [Ouchi] I was very anxious, because at the last minute there 
were many politicians calling for a second vote in the lower 
house, knowing that this scenario could lead to a dissolution of 
the Diet. On 27 January, I called on the prime minister at his 
official residence in the evening and said, "You should 
absolutely not dissolve the Diet. Dissolution is equivalent to 
ignoring the position of the public. A general resignation of 
the cabinet should also be avoided, because it will lead to 
great confusion. Please have a top-level meeting with the LDP 
and make tenacious efforts to the end." I spoke to him as if 
negotiating personally with him. A top-level meeting with the 
LDP inevitably meant that the prime minister would have to make 
concessions and accept some modifications of the reform package. 
However, as the saying goes, "knock at the door, and it will 
open;" I thought the top-level meeting would avert the worst 
situation. 
  [Hata] The political reform legislation gives us the 
opportunity to eliminate evil practices that had resulted from 
the multiseat electoral system. Political parties, candidates, 
and lawmakers are now able to act on their own responsibilities, 
and they have to do so. We should also achieve Diet reform. 
  [Oikawa] Mr. Takemura, what had the prime minister planned 
to 
do if the Diet failed to enact the bills? 
  [Takemura] On 27 January, the prime minister told a meeting 
of the private-sector advisory committee on political reform 
that he would not cling to the post of prime minister. That was 
how he really felt at that moment. If we take him at his word, 
he had no intention to dissolve the Diet. I have been telling 
the prime minister, "If you take responsibility for failure by 
dissolving the Diet, the public will not understand, and it 
would give an impression that you are acting in a high and 
mighty manner." It seems that the prime minister did not think 
too much about failure. 
  [Oikawa] How soon will the date of implementation of the new 
laws be fixed? And what about the difficult task of redividing 
the nation into single-seat districts. 
  [Takemura] As the forthcoming regular Diet session will not 
be pressed for time, it was decided at the top-level meeting 
that the implementation date will be fixed "before the 
government's draft budget is formulated." You should know this. 
As for redistricting, it has to come after (legal) amendments. 
To be able to start with a clean slate, the redistricting task 
will be entrusted to several experts. 
  [Oikawa] Concerning the redistricting plan, the adjustment 
of 
views inside each coalition party seems to be difficult. 
  [Murayama] An independent council, to be set up under the 
Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of compiling a 
redistricting plan. Therefore, we are not in a position to say 
we accept such-and-such but we refuse this-and-this. We should 
accept the plan submitted by the council without reserve. 
<H5>  The Second Act of the Political Realignment Drama </H5>
  [Oikawa] What will the coalition be like in the future? Is 
there a possibility of a reshuffle within the coalition? 
  [Takemura] We have to turn quickly to other important 
issues, 
such as the implementation of a new package of economic stimulus 
measures and the formulation of a budget bill. There will be 
neither time nor energy to spare for a change in the coalition, 
until we finish compiling the budget bill, until the prime 
minister returns from the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting, and, 
moreover, until the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget bill. As 
we have a tight schedule, we have to go on at full tilt until 
the beginning of May when the week of consecutive holidays 
begins. 
  [Ouchi] The coalition should have an intensive dialogue with 
the LDP on important issues related to national interest, such 
as the formulation of a budget bill, including such matters as 
income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike, and the economic 
framework talks, which are expected to top the agenda of the 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting. The coalition should not always 
think about bringing down the LDP by any means. However, I do 
not mean that the dialogue with the LDP will immediately bring 
about a reshuffle in the coalition, that is to say, a grand 
alliance with the LDP. Neither will it lead to a distribution of 
some cabinet posts to the LDP. The prime minister has clearly 
said that the compromise with the LDP will not lead to a grand 
alliance. Moreover, whether the LDP will support the government 
from outside the cabinet is not the question. It is quite 
normal and necessary for a government to ask a powerful 
opposition for assistance and understanding. There is nothing 
strange about it. 
  [Ishida] The current coalition will not transform into a 
grand alliance, because the political reform legislation is 
expected to facilitate the consolidation of existing political 
groups into two big parties coming to power by turns. 
  [Hata] It is good if all the parties can be in friendly 
rivalry with one another on the same grounds. For that, a 
political realignment is necessary. There would be two big 
political parties in friendly rivalry. If so, politicians will 
always be keyed up, because any scandal will prove fatal to the 
party. Moreover, they will have to speak out, having the 
possibility of a change of regime always in mind. Such 
circumstances will help develop a sound government with a sound 
ruling party and a sound opposition. 
  [Oikawa] Are Shinseito and Komeito planning to merge into a 
new party? 
  [Hata] People are inventing stories about a 
Shinseito-Komeito 
alliance as they like. Mr. Ozawa (Shinseito secretary general) 
and I are on good terms with Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi 
Ichikawa. However, it does not mean that Shinseito and Komeito 
will merge into a new party. Once politicians pursue discussion 
on what politics should be like in the future, political 
realignment will take shape spontaneously, as the next general 
elections draw near. 
  [Ouchi] The important issue after political reform is party 
reform. This should be the next step for political realignment. 
A new system can be good or bad; everything will depend on 
political parties and politicians. If it goes in the wrong 
direction, it could lead to another one-party rule or bring 
about an undemocratic government. Party reform or political 
realignment should be easy to understand for the public. 
Political forces, which have established a democratic ideology, 
are to play a major role. The new electoral system will prove 
efficient only if political forces, which have a common local 
policy or a common vision for the future, can join hands. 
  [Murayama] There might be a little reshuffle in the 
coalition. However, the framework will probably remain 
unchanged: The current coalition in power and the LDP in 
opposition. How will political parties cooperate with one 
another when the next election is held under the new single-seat 
electoral system? That is the question. Depending on the 
outcome of the next election, there might be a minor change in 
the coalition government. 
  [Ouchi] We should not say, "Let's accomplish realignment of 
the political map by putting the LDP aside." We are not in such 
a situation. What is needed is a wholesale realignment 
affecting all parties, including the LDP. For example, imagine 
that you have many balls of different colors. You put them all 
in a box with a small hole. You strongly shake the box, and the 
balls will come out of the hole in different combinations. But 
you cannot know the results in advance. Political realignment 
is like this, and each party should bear this in mind. 
  [Hata] Yes, you shake the box and then a new combination 
comes out. 
  [Murayama] What kind of merger or what kind of partnership? 
It will depend on how parties cooperate with one another to win 
an election. In any event, there is no possibility for a 
political party to come into power single-handedly for the time 
being. Which is the best between a two-party system and a 
moderate multiparty system as advocated by Prime Minister 
Hosokawa? I personally think that some form of multiparty 
system is necessary, because the people's mentality is so 
diversified. 
  [Ishida] The single-seat constituency system will 
inevitably trigger a policy argument between two political 
forces, excluding the Japanese Communist Party. In the case of 
the current government, it was only after the election that the 
seven parties and one parliamentary group reached an agreement 
to form a coalition. However, the same procedure will probably 
not work next time. In the next election, the coalition parties 
will have to campaign as a new political force formed by 
different parties capable of reaching agreement on different 
policies. 
  [Takemura] The LDP and the SDPJ have terminated their 
historic role. I do not think the current political camps -- 
the LDP and the non-LDP force -- will be consolidated, as they 
are in the second act of the political realignment drama. The 
LDP as well as the SDPJ are expecting various changes. That is 
not all. All parties, including Sakigake, are going to be hit 
by a severe blizzard called political realignment. Will it 
produce three new parties or four new parties? I do not know. 
Political ideologies and basic policies will become the pivotal 
point of political realignment. My opinion is that it will not 
immediately lead to a two-party system, because people's values 
are so diversified. As for a possible merger of Sakigake and 
the Japan New Party into a new party, we will carry on 
negotiations to form a definite plan. I understand that the 
time is now ripe for a merger, because of the enactment of the 
political reform legislation. 
  [Oikawa] In terms of political ideology, coalition parties 
differ little from one another, except for the SDPJ. However, 
opinions might be divided in regard to the future course of 
Japan. Is that the case? 
  [Hata] You say that the SDPJ is different. However, the SDPJ 
has agreed with other coalition parties on the rice issue (for a 
successful conclusion of the trade talks under GATT). It has 
also accepted the outline of the eighth report submitted by the 
Election System Council. Concerning the bill to amend the 
Self-Defense Forces Law (which would allow the use of SDF 
aircraft to rescue overseas Japanese from crises), we could also 
reach an agreement with the SDPJ, although the bill has not 
passed the Diet yet. Like the SDPJ, there are various opinions 
inside Shinseito as well. For instance, Shinseito members have 
suggested many different ways to deal with the question of 
Japan's eligibility for a permanent seat in the United Nations 
Security Council within the framework of our Constitution. A 
party having lots of free discussions is a democratic party, and 
it is the democratic way to cooperate with others once something 
is decided by the majority. The parties in the ruling coalition 
can work together on any issue. 
  [Murayama] We want people to change their view that the SDPJ 
is different, because we are no longer living in an era of 
ideological conflict. I often tell my party members that we 
should continue to hold our own ideology on the one hand. 
However on the other hand, we should see things in a flexible 
manner, since policymaking requires a realistic stance. It is 
important for the SDPJ to continue to cooperate with other 
coalition parties, by finding common ground with them. 
  [Ishida] Seen from the viewpoint of Komeito, there was once 
a 
difference in policy between the SDPJ and the other parties. 
However, when we agreed to form a coalition, we were determined 
to overcome the differences, and we have been making efforts in 
that direction until now. For instance, with regard to the 
Uruguay Round, we had much trouble with the rice issue. 
However, we were able to overcome the differences though it was 
an ordeal, and we settled the issue. We should keep this ordeal 
in mind. If all coalition parties are able to speak out, they 
can continue to work together. 
<H5>  Tax Reform and Administrative Reform </H5>
  [Oikawa] From now on, the SDPJ should find the issue of a 
consumption tax hike more important than political reform. 
  [Murayama] I do not understand why you always refer to the 
SDPJ, because the consumption tax hike is also a tough question 
for all parties in the ruling coalition: Komeito, the DSP, 
Shinseito -- every party is concerned. A rise in the 
consumption tax strongly goes against the current of the times. 
People in the lower income brackets are not paying any income 
tax. A consumption tax hike will become a new burden for these 
people who will never share in the benefit of income tax cuts. 
In this sense, when we think of the purpose and the expected 
effect of income tax cuts, we cannot accept a rise in the 
consumption tax aimed at covering the shortfall in revenues. 
  [Hata] We should soon start a debate on what the taxation 
system should be like; in other words, we will have to discuss 
whether it will be possible to carry out income tax cuts. My 
party is having hot discussions. The SDPJ is not the only party 
highly concerned with it. It is an important issue for every 
party. What we need is an income tax reduction to stimulate the 
economy. What should be done to cover the subsequent shortfall 
in revenues? The outline of a tax reform plan is expected to be 
presented in about three or four days. 
  [Murayama] Parties in the ruling coalition should manage to 
reach an agreement after heated discussions, setting aside 
differences. Such a process helps support and invigorate the 
coalition government. To what extent will it be possible to 
implement an income tax reduction? How should it be financed? 
The SDPJ is now talking about these points. 
  [Oikawa] However, the SDPJ seems to have difficulties 
putting 
up a united front on that issue. 
  [Murayama] our immediate plan is to carry out a 
large-scale reduction of the income tax as a way to stimulate 
the economy. To cover the shortfall in revenues, we propose 
revising unfair points in the current taxation system, and 
cutting down operating expenses. If these measures are 
insufficient to finance the income tax reduction, we will accept 
issuing deficit-financing bonds as a special measure. However, 
it should not be done unconditionally. Deficit-covering bonds 
should be issued as a short-term revenue source, for instance, 
within a time limit of three or five years. Moreover, we will 
have to examine the ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax 
revenue; we will also have to look at the balance between 
assets, income, and consumption. We might even consider a bold 
and drastic comprehensive taxation. [sentence as published] We 
propose a sweeping revision of the tax system. At the same 
time, we should form a new welfare vision to cope with the aging 
society. How should social welfare be financed? How far can it 
be covered by tax revenue? How far will social insurance 
programs be applied? We will have to give a satisfactory 
explanation to the public. There is nothing irresponsible in 
what we are saying. 
  [Ishida] Some people say that the income tax cuts and the 
consumption tax hike should be handled as one unit. This sort 
of argument should not exist in the first place. A tax reform 
plan will never be approved by the public as long as there is no 
clear vision about a welfare society and an aging society. My 
party cannot readily agree to a plan to raise the consumption 
tax to cover income tax cuts. 
  [Murayama] If the political reform bills were killed, I had 
made the following suggestion: The prime minister should 
neither dissolve the Diet nor announce a general resignation of 
the cabinet, even if the political reform bills are killed. The 
cabinet should rather fulfill its responsibility by compiling a 
new package of stimulus measures, a third supplementary budget 
for the current fiscal year, and a budget bill for fiscal 1994. 
The cabinet should decide whether it has to take responsibility 
for not achieving political reform, only after settling these 
economic issues. In addition to the revision of the electoral 
system accompanied by the introduction of anticorruption 
measures, we will have to promote a decentralization of power 
and carry out Diet reform. Political reform will only be fully 
achieved when these three pillars are completed. 
Decentralization of power and Diet reform are the next two 
items on the political agenda. 
  [Ishida] Yes, you are right. The government will soon 
formulate its outline on administrative reform. It will set 
forth decentralization as well as economic deregulation. This 
medium-term administrative reform policy will become an 
epoch-making event that was not conceivable under LDP rule. 
<H3>  The Treatment of SDPJ Dietmen who Rebelled Against Their 
Party Leadership </H3>
  [Oikawa] How will the SDPJ treat its members who disobeyed 
the leadership? 
  [Murayama] The SDPJ Central Executive Committee has already 
decided on the punitive action to be taken against those who 
acted against the party's resolution. The Discipline Committee 
will make the final decision. One characteristic of the SDPJ is 
that the party is composed of broadminded people. However, once 
something is agreed on as a party resolution, the party 
leadership wants all members to act on it. 
  [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, do you have any intention to 
resign? 
  [Murayama] I have never announced an intention to resign. 
SDPJ rules stipulate that such organs as the party convention 
and the Central Committee are responsible for party 
administration. A party convention has to be held, or a meeting 
of the Central Committee has to be convened, each time as 
needed, to hear and approve reports on what has transpired. I 
will have to call a meeting of the Central Committee at the 
proper time to report the settlement of the rice issue and the 
development of the political reform issue, and get the approval 
of other members.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, General Secretary of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by an unidentified MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] A crack in the Hosokawa 
administration has since deepened due to controversy surrounding 
a possible cabinet reshuffle. What are your views? 
  [Kubo] If the aim of the reshuffle is only to remove certain 
ministers from the cabinet, we should be told so. Although the 
arbitrary power to reshuffle the cabinet is given to the prime 
minister, it does not mean that he can do whatever he wants. If 
he reshuffles the cabinet for reasons of political strategy, it 
would become a problem for the ruling parties as a whole. There 
are no grounds for a reshuffle because the administration is 
only six months old. I do not think it should be done. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think the move toward political 
realignment will gain momentum? 
  [Kubo] It may be difficult to hold a general election under 
the new electoral system this year. A unified local election 
and an election for the House of Councillors next year are 
scheduled before the next general election for the House of 
Representatives is due. I think the way the ruling parties 
cooperate with each other in the House of Councillors' election 
will influence the political realignment. 
  [Correspondent] What is the aim of the SDPJ at the next 
general election, which will be held under the new electoral 
system? 
  [Kubo] We should prevent the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
from returning to power. The ruling partners should seek 
thorough electoral collaboration. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean the ruling parties should merge 
into one "new party" -- the idea advocated by Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa? 
  [Kubo] When I view Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa's view of the ideal nation, I think it 
impossible for the ruling parties to merge. Unless the ruling 
partners share a similar view of Japan's future and how to 
secure people's rights, it will be impossible to merge the 
coalition forces into one political party simply to win an 
election. Furthermore, Mr. Ozawa advocates a 
two-conservative-party system. One is the party of "new 
conservatives"; the other the same old LDP. We do not accept 
this idea. Ozawa's proposed system may change the focus of 
power, but I don't think it will bring a bright future for 
Japanese politics. 
  [Correspondent] What kind of a political picture do you 
think desirable? 
  [Kubo] Political forces that consistently adhere to the 
principles of the Constitution, peace, democracy, and human 
rights are necessary in Japanese politics. We need a new era in 
which "new reformists" stand against "new conservatives." The 
SDPJ should play an important role in the formation of the "new 
reformists." 
  [Correspondent] What must the SDPJ do to bring this about? 
  [Kubo] We need to change the party by abandoning the old 
character of the party. We will establish the common political 
aims of "new reformists," including those who have been 
"conservatives," and thus form a new political force. In 
creating the new political force, it is also possible the SDPJ 
will dissolve itself for the better without absorbing other 
parties. 
  If the old LDP continues to exist, Japan will see a 
"tripolar" political scene with "new conservatives," "new 
reformists," and the "LDP." If the LDP reforms itself, we 
might, perhaps, form a coalition government of genuinely 
"tripolar" structure -- new conservatives, new reformists, and 
the LDP. 
  [Correspondent] What distinguishes these three political 
forces? 
  [Kubo] The issue of international cooperation is one factor. 
We should stress that Japan bases its international 
contributions on the spirit of the Constitution. Regardless of 
what sort of international cooperation is proposed, I oppose 
international contributions under which military troops are 
sent. My ideal nation and view of the Constitution are 
different from those of Mr. Ozawa, who says Japan needs to 
become a "normal nation." Another point is whether political 
forces adopt a "consumer-oriented" policy or a 
"producer-oriented" policy. However, when the need to change 
power is taken into consideration, we must establish a "common 
basic policy" to stabilize politics. 
  [Correspondent] Who are the potential leaders of the new 
political forces? 
  [Kubo] In politics, having a competent leader is more 
important than promoting political arguments. Mr. Takahiro 
Yokomichi (governor of Hokkaido) is one prospective leader in 
view of his age and experience. Governor Yokimichi's term of 
office expires in spring next year. I hope that, Hokkaido 
citizens and events permitting, he will decide to return to the 
political arena in Tokyo). 
  [Correspondent] Is the party prepared for the split that may 
occur in the process of political realignment? 
  [Kubo] Within the party there are members who do not 
recognize us as a member of the coalition government and act on 
their own. But most party members are different and take a 
different view of fulfilling the party's appointed task. A 
political party can work for the people only when it comes to 
power. I think it would be fairer to say that any member who 
acts on his own is a highly questionable member of the party, 
rather than that their actions may lead to a party split.

  [Text] On 18 February 1994, the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] and local people ambushed the attacking troops 
of the two-headed government and the Vietnamese communist 
puppets in areas south and west of the Anlung Veng region. The 
attacking troops had launched an offensive in Anlung Veng with 
an infantry unit moving in front of three T-54 tanks, and 
another infantry unit behind the tanks. The NADK and local 
people intercepted a group of the forward infantry troops and 
attacked the troops behind the tanks. In a few minutes, we 
killed or wounded many of the infantry troops in the rear. The 
survivors retreated in disarray, leaving the tanks behind. At 
the same time, we assaulted the infantry troops in front of the 
tanks. They were all killed, wounded, or forced to flee in 
disarray by our surprise attack. Moreover, they knew that the 
infantry troops in the rear had been routed, and thus they had 
no support in the rear. At that moment, we encircled the three 
tanks that were isolated like iron ingots in the open field. The 
occupants of the tanks jumped out and took off their uniforms so 
that no one could tell whether they were officers or rank and 
file. We destroyed two of the T-54 tanks and captured another. 
  On the same day, we damaged another T-54 tank west of 
Lumpong. We also killed Brigadier Generals (Suan Siphon) of 
Division 5 and (Chin Ieng) of Division 286, two colonels, and 36 
soldiers; wounded 60 enemy soldiers; and captured 27 others. 
  According to a report from Route 68, nearly 100 puppet 
soldiers deserted the front lines and arrived at Route 68. 
  The enemy is being encircled and smashed bit by bit. We are 
attacking and smashing the enemy communications lines in 
particular. The doomsday of the military ringleaders of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government is 
drawing near.

  [Text] Armed people, in cooperation with the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], attacked, destroyed, and 
completely dispersed the two-headed government's troops invading 
Kompong Roka Commune in Leach District of Pursat Province on 10 
February. We killed five enemy soldiers on the spot and wounded 
more than 10 others. We also destroyed a communal office 
building, a police station, and 10 firearms, and we seized 13 
assorted guns, including a B-40 rocket launcher and two M-72 
weapons. 
  The two-headed government mustered and sent a battalion from 
the Pursat provincial town to further invade the liberated 
commune on 12 February. The people and NADK, however, sprung an 
ambush at Prey Thom, killing three enemy soldiers and wounding 
eight others and dispersing and forcing the others to retreat. 
We also captured two invading soldiers and seized three AK 
rifles, 16 knapsacks of rice, and some war materiel. 
  Following the attack and destruction by our people and NADK 
of the train carrying war materiel in an area between Krang 
Chhvea and Re Phlak [Kompong Chhnang Province], the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government on 16 February 
marshalled and sent 230 soldiers from their remaining weary 
forces to invade the area. Their invasion, however, was 
completely destroyed by our people and NADK. We killed eight 
enemy soldiers, wounded 15, and forced the others to beat a 
hasty retreat. We destroyed 11 assorted arms and a a 
significant quantity of war materiel and seized 12 guns, 
including seven AK rifles, three B-40 rocket launchers, and two 
60-mm mortars, as well as some ammunition.

  [Text] The tin box marked "Uranium: Danger" that was 
seized by a Burapha Task Force unit in Aranyaprathet over a week 
ago is believed to be depleted Uranium 238 that was used by the 
U.S. Army in the Vietnam war. A source at the Army's Scientific 
Department said the military always used this depleted uranium 
for the purpose of making armour-piercing bullets because of its 
high penetration power. He said Thai army officers had 
occasionally received similar items in the form of sticks from 
its intelligence unit but it had never come in a tin box. 
  The source said the department so far had not sent any 
officer to fetch the box to determine the type of substance it 
contains, but he believes it might be Uranium 238, as it was 
widely used by the U.S. Army. If not, it might be parts 
smuggled from a small research nuclear reactor unit in Dalat, 
Vietnam. 
  A Vietnam war expert said the unit was given to the 
Vietnamese government during the Vietnam war for research 
purposes but the U.S. government took back all its equipment in 
1975. He said that the USSR donated the equipment needed to 
resume the operation of the small research reactor in Dalat in 
1976. He dismissed the report that the box might contain 
uranium since he had never seen it when he was in Vietnam during 
the war. He believed that it might be a joke or the work of a 
gang of swindlers. 
  Meanwhile, the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace said 
depleted uranium has low radioactivity and would not be a danger 
to anything and cannot be used to produce nuclear weapons.

  [Text] The high price of Thai rice resulting from a surge 
in Japanese orders is artificial and farmers would be devastated 
if demand subsided, exporters warned. 
  "Rice demand from Japan is artificial. It will go on for a 
while, not forever," said a source. Japan allowed rice imports 
for the first time in decades this year after an unusually wet 
summer damaged its crops. Under a new Gatt accord, the country 
is also required to import four per cent of total domestic rice 
consumption starting in 1995. 
  Thai rice farmers enjoy high prices due to Japan's demand 
for 
at least 800,000 tonnes of premium grain, said the source. 
Demand has steadily pushed up global prices for the product. 
To ensure supplies, Thai exporters helped bolster the domestic 
price of premium rice. Tokyo agreed to buy 457,000 tonnes of 
100 per cent and sticky rice in four lots. Last year's price 
for the first lot started at US$273 per tonne and soared to $450 
for the fourth. Thailand plans to expedite delivery of the 
latest 194,000 tonnes at a freight-on-board price of $495 to 
Japan. 
  Currently, the domestic price of rice is Bt510 per 60 kg, 
while it is normally Bt490 at this time of year. The source 
warned that if Japanese demand for rice increases, "Thais, 
perhaps, could be forced to pay more for the same rice." But if 
Japan halts its orders, the price plunge would cause havoc 
primarily among farmers, the source said. Japan's rice imports 
mainly benefit large Thai companies, the source added. Under 
Japan's system, rice import quotas are allocated to 11 major 
Japanese trading firms. Amounts assigned depend on each 
company's performance since World War II. 
  These semi-cartels are then paired with major Thai rice 
exporters to facilitate orders. Small and medium-sized Thai 
exporters are barred from competing. Among the pairs are 
Japan's Mitsui with Thailand's Hong Yiah Seng; Mitsubishi with 
Capital Rice; Marubeni with Thai Hua; Tomen with Huay Chuan 
Rice; Seto with EPC Rice; and Nichiman with Soon Hua Seng. 
  The same source told THE NATION that Capital Rice's venture 
with Mitsubishi resulted in a 60,000 tonne order for the former 
when Tokyo agreed to import an additional 194,000 tonnes. 
  "It is believed that a company could have a profit of $100 
per tonne," the source said. 
  Small and medium-sized Thai rice exporters have rushed to 
Japan to lobby for quota allocation changes enabling them to 
share in the wealth, the source said, as Tokyo plans to import 
200,000 tonnes from Bangkok in addition to its 800,000 tonne 
order last year.

  [Text] The Laotian Government has ordered all of its 
immigration checkpoints on the Thai-Laotian border to be open 
every day, according to Deputy Transport and Communications 
Minister Charat Phuachuai. Mr Charat said the order followed his 
recent request to Laotian PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon 
to open the checkpoints seven days a week. 
  Laotian border immigration checkpoints with Thailand earlier 
opened from Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m to 5 p.m. and closed 
every Sunday, he said. This forced tourists from the Thai side 
who crossed the border on Saturday to come back the same day. 
Checkpoints which worked on Sunday would enable tourists to stay 
in Laos on Saturday night and return to Thailand the next day, 
he said. 
  Laos has international immigration checkpoints with Thailand 
at Vientiane (opposite Nong Khai), Bokeo (opposite Chiang Khong 
district of Chiang Rai province) and Pakse (opposite Ubon 
Ratchathani province). 
  These international checkpoints were ordered from February 
16 
to open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and temporary checkpoints were to 
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a 50 baht charge per tourist, Mr 
Charat said.

  [Text] The Cabinet yesterday approved a project to develop 
Luang Prabang Airport in Laos as proposed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  The foreign minister or his representative will sign a 
memorandum of understanding on the project with the Lao 
Government. About 50 million baht has been set aside for the 
development of the airport in Luang Prabang, the former royal 
capital of Laos. 
  Construction will begin in May this year and is scheduled to 
be completed within 20 months. Laos will waive income taxes and 
other duties and various fees for the personnel, vehicles, and 
materials involved in the project. Related agencies of both 
countries will set up a technical working group to facilitate 
the implementation of the project. The group is empowered to 
supervise, control, and make decisions on the project.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday vowed to 
ensure that all military agencies comply with the government's 
food-for-arms counter trade policy despite dissatisfaction by 
several top brass. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other Cabinet 
members vowed to move forward with the policy. But the prime 
minister said only major arms deals, not small ones, should be 
subject to the barter trade policy. He said other government 
agencies, not only the military, would also be required to 
consider the possibility of barter trade negotiations. 
  Wichit, a non-MP and non-partisan member of the Chuan 
Cabinet, claimed that "politics" was behind the show of 
dissatisfaction by the generals over the trade policy. But the 
defence minister would not elaborate. 
  "I don't want to talk about it," Wichit said when asked what 
he thought had prompted the top brass to come out to attack the 
government over the policy. "Even a neutral guy like me has 
taken so much blame over this. This has been politicized. I am 
working for the people's interest and the policy is a good one 
which will benefit the country's economy." 
  On Monday, Army Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit 
strongly criticized the Defence Ministry for having allegedly 
failed to coordinate government and military discussions about 
the counter trade policy. 
  "All the problems and confusion should be referred to the 
permanent secretary for defence or the defence minister," Wimon 
said. "I want to know how they interpret the government's 
policy and whether they can explain it." 
  Last week, following a meeting of the Defence Council, a 
policy-making body of military agencies, several top brass came 
out to attack the policy as "impractical". They said the policy 
would severely affect the armed forces plan to modernize their 
weapons and delay arms purchases. The country's interest would 
eventually be affected if the prices went up after the delay, 
they said. They said no arms dealers would be interested in 
bartering their weapons for Thai commodities. But government 
leaders said the generals misunderstood the policy. The 
government wanted only that the armed forces keep the Commerce 
Ministry informed about their planned arms purchases. The 
ministry and other agencies concerned could then try to 
negotiate with the governments of the arms dealers to buy Thai 
agricultural products in return. 
  Wichit said the policy should not be called "barter trade" 
as 
it would bring about confusion. 
  "The Nov 2 Cabinet resolution is clear-cut," Wichit said. 
"They just want the armed forces to help government agencies 
concerned to negotiate with the arms-selling countries to buy 
our agriculture products." 
  Wimon and several generals have complained that their main 
duty was to defend the country, not to conduct trade 
negotiations. But Wichit said yesterday it should pose no 
problem for the armed forces to help other government agencies 
concerned in the negotiations. 
  "I've told the Cabinet that the Defence Ministry is not good 
at trade negotiation. But I am also obliged to respond to the 
need of other ministries concerned. We can help the ministries 
carry out the negotiations in the first place because the armed 
forces could tell the arms suppliers that their country should 
buy some Thai products too," Wichit said 
  He said he had explained the government's policy to chiefs 
of 
staff of all the armed forces, and there should be no problem or 
misunderstanding. 
  He said military attaches to Thai embassies in foreign 
countries could also help in the counter trade negotiations. 
  Wimon had complained on Monday that all army purchase plans 
had "bounced back". 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa quoted Wichit as 
telling the Cabinet that he wanted all arms purchases to be 
carried out in line with the food-for-arms policy. But Chuan 
told reporters yesterday the government wanted only major arms 
purchases to be carried out in line with the counter trade 
policy. 
  "If they want to buy only 100 to 200 rounds of cannon 
ammunition, they don't have to negotiate for the counter trade," 
Chuan said. 
  "The defence minister has offered to consider by himself 
which deals should be conducted under the counter trade policy. 
So, the final decision on which deals should be subject to the 
counter trade policy will depend on the minister. But if a deal 
is only Bt1 or 2 million worth, no negations are needed." 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday 
that the Air Force plan to purchase G-222 transport planes from 
Alenia, an Italian firm, had to be further delayed. He said the 
Thai government had to wait until Italy has a new government 
before sending representatives to negotiate with the country to 
buy Thai agriculture products in return for the plane purchase. 
  "The negotiation may take place next month or in April," 
Suphachai said. "The Air Force will not be affected because we 
will at least be able to buy the planes on the same quotation." 
  The deputy prime minister said the government only wanted to 
help farmers with its barter trade policy.

  [Text] The Cabinet yesterday approved a Bt715-billion 
budget for fiscal year 1995, the first balanced budget during 
the term of the elected government of Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai. The figure represents a 14 per cent increase from the 
1994 budget. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the balanced budget was 
possible because the country's economic growth during the past 
year had passed the government's target and because more 
efficient tax collection was expected. The 1995 Budget Bill 
will be forwarded to the House of Representatives for 
deliberation in June, he said. The 1995 fiscal year starts this 
October. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa denied that 
discussion of the budget at the Cabinet meeting yesterday was 
linked to a possible dissolution of the House. 
  Earlier rumours suggested that the government wanted to rush 
the 1995 Budget Bill through Parliament then dissolve the House 
before calling a snap general election. Aphisit dismissed the 
rumours, saying the government had to prepare the bill in 
advance so the budget could be approved in time for the 
beginning of the new fiscal year.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of comments by Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the </F>
Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council, in an 
interview with ASAHI SHIMBUN; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit meeting was not one of those 
at which playing with words could somehow do the trick. It is 
problematic that the failure of the meeting to reach an 
agreement on the framework talks is taken as the "independence 
of the Japanese diplomacy." What is crucial in diplomatic 
negotiations is to make efforts to see they do not break up. I 
must say that the meeting was a failure. 
  It is not only Japan which is to blame. The United States 
which wanted to narrow down all the negotiations to only one 
thing -- setting of the numerical targets -- is responsible as 
well. But Japan was only concerned with rejecting it, failing 
to present an alternative to it. 
  Beginning with talks on textiles, many negotiations have 
been 
held between Japan and the United States. In a number of cases, 
they came close to failing, but the negotiators were able to 
avoid the worst and resolve differences because both parties 
made efforts to reach agreements at the talks. In the 
Japan-U.S. construction talks and the structural impediments 
initiative talks in which I was personally involved, I persisted 
with the position of saying "No" to the U.S. demands, but I 
presented counterproposals as well. 
  This time that sort of efforts were not made at all. The 
negotiations were entrusted to bureaucrats, and politicians did 
not try to take responsibility. Now, the United States keeps on 
criticizing the bureaucrats, but it is barking up the wrong 
tree. The bureaucrats cannot go beyond the roles assigned them. 
  The United States' possible incitement of the high-yen value 
or enforcement of sanctions in case of a failure of the summit 
meeting has been anticipated. The trend of national bond and 
stock prices in the United States is stable. So is the market 
of the dollar against the mark. If the United States decides on 
imposing sanctions, Japan has things to say, too. As far as the 
cellular phone issue is concerned, it should be dealt with 
pursuant to international rules. 
  I doubt if the Japanese Government can really talk about 
"mature, adults' relationship" without feeling shame in its 
conscience. Prime Minister Hosokawa may be thinking that way in 
fact, but there are people within the government who are 
concerned as much as we do. Many of the bureaucrats who 
accompanied him on the visit to Washington returned home very 
much disheartened. In that respect, Mr. Hosokawa is too 
ignorant. 
  In the meeting of the seven major nations' (G-7) finance 
ministers and central bank governors to be held soon, the 
Japanese Government must seek the cooperation of other nations 
to ensure that the exchange market better reflects Japan's 
fundamental economic conditions. On the other hand, the 
government must continue to make efforts to open up Japan's 
markets. The Liberal Democratic Party can cooperate in that 
regard, but if the government wants us to cooperate, it must 
stop telling lies. 
  The government says it is easing rules on 1,591 items, but 
the number is a simple sum of what the government offices cited. 
Many of them are duplicated. I hope the government will stop 
bragging about the numbers which are wrong.

<F P=106> [`Summary' of interview with Nobuo Matsunaga, former </F>
Japanese ambassador to the United States, by ASAHI SHIMBUN; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Matsunaga] It is regrettable that Japan and the 
United States failed to reach an agreement in the framework 
trade talks. Japan could not concede to Washington because what 
they asserted in the talks was unreasonable. 
  Japan is also to blame for its inappropriate response to 
U.S. 
demands. Japan flatly rejected U.S. demands for setting 
"objective criteria," saying: "They will lead to managed 
trade." Although the rejection was reasonable, Japan had no 
counterproposals. Washington was very dissatisfied and said: 
"What can Japan propose instead?" Japan should have a sense of 
remorse over its actions. 
  The relationship between Japan and the United States in the 
postwar era has been like that of a child and an adult. 
However, now that Japan has become a powerful state, it is no 
longer allowed to yield and act under pressure. In other words, 
I think Japan is now in the process of freeing itself from 
"gaiatsu [external pressure]" by the United States. The recent 
summit meeting was a reflection of this process. Japan will not 
be free from gaiatsu unless it makes decisions and implements 
them on its own. I told foreign and finance ministers that the 
future of Japan-U.S. relations depends on how Japan deals with 
the United States. 
  What Japan should do now is to achieve economic growth 
through the expansion of domestic demand. Also, it should 
promote deregulation in priority areas in the framework trade 
talks. 
  There are undesirable trends both in Japan and the United 
States. In Japan, people tend to praise the "Japan that can say 
no." This is very dangerous. On the other hand, some Americans 
are in favor of "Japan bashing" measures. Japan should watch 
this trend carefully. 
  There are arguments in the United States that Washington 
should take punitive actions against Japan and that it should 
incite the yen to rise. These arguments are wrong and too 
emotional. It is necessary for both the United States and Japan 
to refrain from becoming emotional. 
  If Washington imposes sanctions on Japan, Tokyo should react 
calmly. Since it is obvious that such sanctions run counter to 
GATT rules, Japan should file a complaint with GATT. Concerning 
the appreciation of the yen, I think Japan will be able to avert 
a further hike if it makes efforts to open Japanese markets 
wider and increase imports. 
  The Japanese system, practices, and rules are slightly 
different from those in the United States. However, the two 
nations have the common goal of achieving reforms in accordance 
with principles of the market economy. I do not think the 
conflict of opinion between the two nations will intensify and 
become serious. 
  In the recent summit meeting, the two leaders confirmed that 
Japan-U.S. relations are more important than anything else in 
such fields as politics and security. I want to stress that 
this is a great result. They also noted that despite severe 
economic relations and many twists and turns, the two nations 
should continue to cherish their entire relationship. 
  First of all, Japan should decide what it should do and 
implement what it has decided. After having done so, it should 
consider how to deal with the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] and the U.S. Department of Commerce on 16 February issued 
a joint report on "Why U.S. Automobiles Do Not Sell in Japan." 
The report predicts that if the problems in selling U.S.-made 
automobiles -- like Japanese auto manufacturers' close ties with 
auto dealers and the U.S. manufacturers' inadequate sales 
efforts -- are removed, annual sales will grow from the present 
19,200 (in 1993) to about 57,000. As the report represents 
results of a survey endorsed by both countries, it is likely to 
have an impact on the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations with 
respect to automobiles and auto parts, an agreement on which 
could not be reached at the recent Japanese-U.S. summit. 
  The survey was proposed by the United States at the 
Japan-U.S. structural impediments initiative talks in 1991. It 
was conducted in 1992 by Nomura General Institute of Japan and 
Boos Allen and Hamilton, interviewing or presenting 
questionnaires to domestic and foreign auto manufacturers, 
importers, dealers, and consumers. 
  As reasons for Japanese dealers being reluctant to handle 
U.S. automobiles, the report cites: 1) Problems in securing 
enough employees; 2) the problem of U.S. manufacturers not 
making enough efforts to enter the market; 3) difficulties in 
obtaining good outlets; and 4) lack of funds. 
  According to the report, if the auto dealers are able to 
secure enough employees their sales will grow by 5,000 units, 
and if the U.S. manufacturers adopt systems in their automobiles 
that the Japanese are used to, sales will grow by an additional 
3,500 units. Furthermore, the report estimates that if all 
these problems are resolved at the same time, there will be 
multiplying effects, and the sales of U.S. automobiles will jump 
up to 57,000 units. 
  MITI itself says: "Some of the estimates given in the report 
are difficult to understand; there is not much meaning in the 
numbers given there." But it is possible that the United States 
will use these numbers in criticizing the "Japanese-style 
structure" like keiretsu dealings. 
  Moreover, in relation to the manufacturer-dealer 
relationship 
the United States complained about in the new economic 
consultations, the report points out that 33 percent of dealers 
have received capital investment from manufacturers and that 40 
percent have long-term debts owed to manufacturers. Even though 
rules banning keirestu-affiliated dealers from handling 
nonkeiretsu vehicles were removed in 1990, the report notes that 
16 percent of the dealers replied: "I think restrictions exist." 
  As evidence of U.S. manufacturers making no efforts to enter 
the market, the report points out the need for them to bring 
right-hand drive vehicles into Japan, quoting U.S. company 
representatives in Japan as saying: "Parent companies are not 
putting enough energy into the Japanese market." 
  The report also says the actual price of U.S. vehicles sold 
in Japan are higher than those for Japanese vehicles by an 
average of 20 percent; and, advertisement and maintenance of 
sales network expenses are pushing up prices.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made a speech at 
his meeting with lawmakers held at the Japan New Party's 
headquarters in Takanawa in Tokyo on the evening of 18 February 
and said: "Probably, Japan and the United States never before 
had such intensive discussions at summit meetings." In this 
way, he stressed that Japan held fast to its stand at the recent 
Japan-U.S. summit talk. 
  As an example, he cited the following dialogue: President 
Clinton insisted on saying that "although both countries signed 
more than 30 accords after the 1970's, none of them was 
observed." In response, the prime minister said: "I do not 
think what you have said is right. Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone [NTT] Company purchased $17-million-worth of goods in 
1980. But, the NTT is buying $780-million-worth of goods now. 
This is an increase by 46 times. Can you still say that no 
progress has been made?" 
  Moreover, Hosokawa also touched on the issue of auto and 
auto 
parts, which was a focal point at the new economic talks, and 
said: "Cars with a steering wheel on the right-hand side are 
driven in 18 percent of the countries in the world. There are 
many European cars, such as Mercedes and BMW's, in the Japanese 
market. Since U.S. companies are not trying hard to sell their 
cars in Japan, it is not right for you to say we are not buying 
U.S. cars." Reportedly, Hosokawa pointed out lack of efforts by 
the United States.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of opening the 
Japanese mobile phone market, the U.S. Government has confirmed 
that Japan had violated the Japan-U.S. Telecommunications 
Agreement. Commenting on the U.S. Government's action at a news 
conference on 17 February, Futoshi Shirai, administrative vice 
minister of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said: "I 
have heard the Japan Mobile Communications Company, which is in 
charge of handling American mobile phone companies, has done 
what it can do for them. I think that Japan has no means left to 
deal with the issue." In this way, he expressed his pessimism 
about avoiding U.S. sanctions. 
  At the news conference, the administrative vice minister 
also 
said that the Japan-U.S. negotiations were set to be held on the 
morning of 15 February at the request of the U.S. side, but the 
negotiations were delayed until after U.S. Trade Representative 
Kantor's news conference, and lashed out at the way the United 
States has dealt with the issue in bilateral negotiations, 
saying, "My feeling is that the United States intended from the 
beginning to confirm Japan's violation." 
  Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, returned to Japan on 17 February 
after holding talks with Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Barshevsky on the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone 
market. Speaking at a news conference that day, he expressed the 
grim view that negotiations cannot be held under the present 
circumstances, saying: "We will not comply with any request from 
the United States for the resumption of negotiations under the 
threat that it may resort to the process of imposing sanctions 
against Japan. At the present stage, the issue cannot be 
resolved politically."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Lead Found on Solution to the </F>
`Cellular Phone War' Issue"] 
  [Text] On 18 February, three days had passed since the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decided that Japan is 
unfair in the cellular phone (portable and car phones) sector. 
On the United States' position that it will not hesitate to 
impose sanctions against Japan, Posts and Telecommunications 
Minister Takenori Kanzaki, at a news conference the same day, 
said, "We would like to negotiate so that that may not take 
place. We still have time," but then added, "This question 
should be dealt with at the private-sector level; it is 
difficult to say how much the government can do." Apparently, 
not even a lead has been found yet on how to resolve the 
"cellular phone war" between Japan and the United States. 
  Japan IDO Tsushin [Mobile Communication] Company (IDO) has 
accepted almost all of Motorola Company's demands including 
those which can be said to be even irrational. What the company 
can do has reached the limit. Tateo Tsukada, president of the 
company, poured out his anger, "Motorola in documents on 
negotiations used the word must. That is no word for a supplier 
to use in dealing with a client." The confrontation between the 
two companies has driven them into a state of being emotional. 
Not much can be hoped for from the private-sector negotiations 
the government wants to rely on. 
  President Tsukada has many reasons to be angry, and one of 
them is the final compromise plan offered by Motorola. Motorola 
in it suggested IDO "buy 225,000 sets of Motorola-made phones." 
What it means is that since IDO plans to provide service to a 
maximum of 450,000 subscribers by making investments in the 
future, Motorola suggests IDO use Motorla phones in half of them. 
  Under the current cellular phone service system, the phones 
are rented to customers by telecommunications companies like NTT 
Docomo and IDO, but after April, all phones are set to be sold 
freely, thus enabling sales agents of these companies, as well 
as other big stores, to sell them. 
  Consequently, the two companies are now in the process of 
getting ready for the change -- NTT Docomo abolishing its 
practice of taking guarantee money of 100,000 yen effective 
October next year and IDO lowering its price of phones, while 
both of them trying to get rid of all the phones on hand. For 
instance, if a set costs 50,000 yen, the total will come to 10 
billion yen. Regardless of how competitive Motorola's phones 
may be, 225,000 sets is a large number. It can be a matter of 
life or death for IDO to add this number of phones to its stock. 
  At present, IDO is using phones made by NEC Corporation, 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Nippondenso Company, while 
the cellular phone companies affiliated with Danini Denden 
Company, which use the Motorola system, are using phones made by 
Motorola, Sony Corporation, Kyocera Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., 
Toshiba Corporation, and Oki Electric Industry Company. 
Besides, there are moves by other companies joining the group 
of manufacturers after April, and according to an electric 
machinery manufacturer, "it is evident that Japanese electric 
home appliance manufacturers will eventually win" [in the 
competition for the cellular phone market]. Apparently, 
Motorola's demands which can be interpreted as being "aimed at 
cleaning up Motorola's inventories" are making the resolution of 
the issue difficult.

  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended in 
failure at the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit talks. However, a 
source close to the Japanese negotiators disclosed on 19 
February that Japanese and American negotiators each attended 
consultations the day before the summit in the belief that the 
other side had made concessions, and this misunderstanding 
further intensified the conflict. 
  According to the same source, the United States made a new 
proposal which suggested not adopting any numerical targets at 
the talks between Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura and 
Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic 
policy, on the evening of 9 February. The surprised deputy 
foreign minister immediately met with negotiators from the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and informed them "the U.S. side has 
backed off [oritta]." 
  Nevertheless, when the U.S. side called for "aiming at a 
goal" at the talks between U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata the following morning, 
Hata consented in his response. As a result, the situation 
further changed. 
  While the Japanese side took "a goal" simply to mean 
"accord," Representative Kantor took it as "numerical targets" 
and believed that "the Japanese side had backed off." Thus, the 
two cabinet members "confirmed" that the other side had made 
concessions. Therefore, meetings on three sectors -- government 
procurement, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts -- were 
resumed at the vice-ministerial level. 
  However, neither Japan nor the United States indicated any 
sign of making concessions. Maintaining that the Cutter 
proposal of the previous evening was merely a private plan, the 
U.S. side refused to talk about it. To make matters worse, the 
U.S. side threatened that "since the Japanese economic stimulus 
package seems rather insufficient, an expression of 
`disappointment' would be included in the part connected with 
macroeconomic issues in any joint statement issued." After the 
consultations, Japanese officials in charge of talks on these 
three sectors looked at each other in dumb amazement, saying it 
was quite a different story. 
  The actual situation now indicates that while the U.S. side 
has intensified its offensive against Japan following the summit 
talks, Japan is quite at a loss as to how the framework talks 
can be resumed. 
  Sources connected with the Japanese negotiators have 
complained: "We are not sure at which point things went wrong, 
but we certainly did miss a very good opportunity."

  [Text] On the afternoon of 19 February, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa invited business leaders who had attended the 
recent Conference of Japanese and American Businessmen [CJAB], 
including Yotaro Kobayashi, president of Fuji-Xerox and CJAB 
acting chairman, to his official residence, and held intimate 
talks on Japan-U.S. economic relations for about 90 minutes. 
  While reporting to the prime minister on details of the 
conference, Kobayashi and other business leaders indicated their 
views that with the upturn in the U.S. economy, the repulsion 
for Japan that had existed in American industrial circles was 
gradually weakening. 
  After the meeting, Kobayashi and other businessmen stressed: 
"In the United States, the atmosphere is entirely different at 
the governmental and private-sector levels. It is not so 
intensified at the private-sector level." They disclosed that 
in their report to the prime minister on the details of the 
CJAB, they had stressed this belief.

  [Text] Commenting on Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Koichiro Matsuura's statement that the government 
economic forecast for fiscal 1994 setting the current accounts 
surplus ratio to gross domestic product (GDP) at 2.8 percent "is 
a goal to be achieved," a government source said on the morning 
of 22 February that "within the government, there are opinions 
favoring making this a formal pledge to the United States." He 
disclosed that opinions favoring a virtual public commitment on 
setting "2.8 percent as the ratio of surplus to GDP" to effect a 
breakthrough in the serious impasse in the Japan-U.S. economic 
relations have emerged in the government. This source also 
indicated that "if asked" at the conference of finance ministers 
and central bank governors of the seven advanced nations (G-7) 
beginning on 26 February, "we may make a statement to that 
effect." 
  The government source stressed that "the economic forecast 
was officially affirmed by the government," and "2.8 percent" is 
a voluntary target that the Japanese Government will work for. 
He explained that "the surplus stands at 3.1 percent of GDP at 
present. Bringing this down to below 3 percent is `just an 
offhand idea' [tsubuyaki] on the part of Japan." 
  However, he also pointed out that "the Finance Ministry is 
opposed to" making a formal pledge to the United States. "This 
is not a problem for Japan alone. It may be greatly influenced 
by the prevailing international situation, and there may be 
circumstances beyond our control. The ministry is thus saying 
we cannot make a public commitment." He added, "Since we are 
presenting this as a government forecast, it is indeed 
considered a goal to be achieved. However, we cannot take full 
responsibility for failure to achieve the goal, because this 
will also be affected by the economic policies of the European 
countries and the United States."

  [Text] Speaking with foreign correspondents in Tokyo on 22 
February, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa referred to the issue of setting numerical targets 
over which the Japan-U.S. summit blew up. He said that Japan 
should set up "effort targets" on condition that "failure in 
achieving such targets should not be subject to sanctions," thus 
showing a flexible attitude toward setting up some kind of 
numerical figures to measure progress in opening the Japanese 
market. This has been reported by news agencies. Since Mr. 
Ozawa was deeply involved in past Japan-U.S. negotiations on 
economic issues, his remarks have invited negative reactions 
from those concerned with negotiations saying: "Since term 
`targets' will be taken as a pledge, numerical targets should 
not be set." 
  In dispatching reports on Ozawa's remarks, such news 
agencies 
as the AP News Agency and KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS INC used the 
term "targets." According to their dispatches and participants 
of Ozawa's meeting with foreign correspondents, Mr. Ozawa 
reportedly said that: "Japan and the United States should make 
mutual efforts while keeping mutual reliance. It is good for 
Japan to set up targets for Japan's effort to promote market 
opening if the targets are not subject to sanctions." Moreover, 
he reportedly said that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
"should be concluded by the end of March," thus showing 
confidence in settling the issue at an early date.

  [Text] At the lower house Budget Committee session held on 
the afternoon of 18 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
commented on the issue of the suspected development of nuclear 
weapons by the DPRK (North Korea) and explained how Japan will 
deal with the situation in case the UN Security Council decides 
to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, saying: 1) It is a 
matter of course that Japan has to take responsible actions 
should the Security Council decide to do so; and 2) Japan agrees 
with the UN Charter and will take responsible actions within the 
limit of the Japanese Constitution. In this way, he went into 
more detail than before and disclosed a plan to cooperate with 
the United Nations in wide-ranging areas to impose economic 
sanctions on North Korea. 
  At the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks, the prime minister 
explained his view regarding the issue of economic sanctions 
against North Korea, saying, "We will do our best in dealing 
with the situation within the limits of our law." At the Budget 
Committee session on the same day, Michio Watanabe asked 
Hosokawa if what the latter meant by "the law is the 
Constitution or another law?" In response, the prime minister 
explained, "What I meant to say was the Constitution." 
Moreover, Watanabe asked: "We need to revise the self-defense 
law if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea. Do you 
mean to say that you will not hesitate, within the limits of the 
Constitution, to revise laws needed for crisis management?" The 
prime minister replied, "We will deal with situations within the 
limits of the Constitution more than the limits of the UN 
Charter." In this way, he indicated his opinion that he will 
revise the relevant laws, including the self-defense law. It 
seems that Hosokawa -- while keeping in mind the high 
possibility that the United Nations may carry out a blockade in 
the waters around North Korea should the Security Council decide 
to impose economic sanctions on North Korea -- indicated his 
stand that in addition to taking some measures regarding the 
issue of remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in 
Japan, it is possible to start making some contributions to such 
UN activities. 
  Following the rupture of the Japanese-U.S. economic 
framework 
talks, the United States is strengthening its plan to impose 
sanctions on Japan. In this regard, the prime minister urged 
the United States to take a prudent stand. He then explained 
how Japan will deal with the situation, stressing: "We can make 
no guess, but must see what kind of measures the United States 
actually will take. We should try to respond calmly." He 
explained that Japan will bring the case to the GATT "in 
accordance with international rules" if the United States 
actually imposes sanctions on Japan. 
  Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic Party strongly 
demanded that the prime minister assume responsibility for an 
announcement on the idea of introducing a national welfare tax, 
saying "the problem was the decisionmaking process." The prime 
minister rejected this demand and said: "It was decided 
hurriedly, so there might have been a problem with the process. 
However, nothing is wrong with the fact that the ruling 
parties' initial ideas were used as a springboard for 
discussions, and I brought the whole matter to a conclusion on 
the basis of my own decision." 
  As for the tax system reform, Hosokawa stated, "Efforts to 
trim unnecessary expenses or to revise the unfair tax system 
alone cannot support the aging society financially." In this 
way, he explained his view that a hike in the consumption tax is 
inevitable. He said this in response to a question by Yoshiaki 
Matsumoto of the Japan Communist Party.

  [Text] Parliamentary vice ministers of the government met 
on the morning of 17 February at the prime minister's official 
residence. During the meeting, Itsusei Koga, parliamentary vice 
minister of the Economic Planning Agency, referred to the 
drastic appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar 
following the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks and 
said, "The government needs to formulate clearer plans to expand 
domestic demand." During the meeting, one parliamentary vice 
minister after another also voiced the need for the government 
to quickly take steps to deal with the steep rise in the yen's 
value against the U.S. dollar. 
  Commenting on the impact of the recent sharp rise in the 
value of the yen against the U.S. dollar, Eisei Ito, 
parliamentary vice minister of the Construction Ministry, said, 
"I have no intention of raising questions about the outcome of 
the recent Japanese-U.S. summit talks, but if the government 
fails to deal properly with the drastic appreciation of the yen, 
the package of stimulus measures compiled recently by the 
government would have little effect in stimulating the economy." 
  At the meeting, Toshi Masuda, parliamentary vice minister of 
the National Land Agency, stated: "The government should make 
public its plans to deal with the recent steep rise in the yen's 
value in a way so that other nations can easily understand them. 
All government officials should realize the need to reform the 
structure of Japan's economy." In this way, he called for a 
change in economic policy in order to convert Japan's economy 
into an economy driven by domestic demand. 
  In connection with the issue of opening the Japanese 
mobile-phone market, the U.S. Government is poised to slap 
sanctions on Japan after confirming "Japan's violation of a 
Japanese-U.S. agreement." In commenting on the move by the U.S. 
Government, Aogu Matsumae, parliamentary vice minister of the 
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, criticized the U.S. 
Government for taking such a step, saying, "The assertion by the 
U.S. Government is unreasonable, and the Japanese Government 
cannot go along with the request from the U.S. Government."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 19 February morning edition] </F>
  [Text] On 18 February, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] and 
the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] announced the results of 
their joint survey on how the recent appreciation of the yen 
rate is lowering the prices of foreign-made consumer goods 
imported in December 1993. According to the survey, a decline 
in import prices was observed in 18 out of 20 surveyed items, 
and 14 items were cheaper even in the consumer market. The EPA 
commented: "The market trend is beginning to show the effects 
of the yen rate appreciation." 
  The survey was conducted to compare the import and retail 
prices of 20 items -- foodstuff, clothes, and durable consumer 
goods -- imported in December 1993 with prices in the previous 
year. The import prices were calculated from the average on 
customs entry in December, and retail prices from statistics on 
price trends in Tokyo in mid-January. 
  As a result, a decline in import prices was observed on 
beef, 
chocolate, and golf clubs. Although the import prices of 
oranges and lemons increased due to brisk demand and cool 
weather in producing nations, their retail prices in Japan 
actually dropped in line with the price decline of 
Japanese-grown citrus. On the other hand, automobile prices 
dropped on the customs clearance basis, but became more 
expensive in the consumer market. This was mainly because of 
price hikes after model changes. 
  The average foreign exchange rate in December was 108.35 yen 
to the dollar, up 12.7 percent from the previous year.

  [Text] Concerning the issue of opening up the rice market, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said on 19 February: 
"I have been pondering whether it is truly desirable to impose 
tariffs on all agricultural products without exception to 
protect the global environment." In this way, he disclosed his 
critical approach toward the government decision on the rice 
market opening. It has been observed that Takemura ventured to 
mention his view to indicate his consideration of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan, which was negative about the rice 
market opening.

  [Text] On the morning of 17 February, Shinto Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP] held a staff meeting 
of Toitsukaiha, their joint floor group in the lower house, and 
exchanged views on the question of a possible cabinet reshuffle. 
As a result, they agreed on the following: 1) They will 
support the Hosokawa administration qualitatively; 2) the two 
parties will continue to cooperate in the lower house by 
maintaining the joint floor group; and 3) Diet members of the 
two parties will further solidify their ties. 
  Following the meeting, a senior Sakigake member explained: 
"Supporting the Hosokawa administration qualitatively means that 
we will support it even if Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura is assigned to another post in the cabinet reshuffle." 
Thus, he indicated Sakigake would accept a cabinet reshuffle if 
it means Takemura is not ousted and remains in the cabinet.

  [Text] On 19 February, Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] Policy Research Council, spoke 
about the government's deregulation plan. 
  He said: "It is said there are 1,591 items listed, but there 
is a hitch to it. Deregulation will be implemented on only 231 
of these items by the end of fiscal year 1994, and only in 42 
cases will regulations be completely abolished." 
  Hashimoto made the remarks during a lecture he gave at a 
seminar for senior officials of the LDP's Miyazaki Prefectural 
Chapter. 
  He also criticized the government's attitude. 
  He said: "As such a large figure has been announced, Japan 
will face difficulties when the rest of the world becomes aware 
of the fact."

  [Text] The government plans to work out, as early as 
before the end of this month, a market-opening program centered 
on deregulation, and has also decided on including in this 
program a mechanism for assessing and checking results of 
foreign firms' actual access to the Japanese market based on 
numerical results recorded in various sectors. The government 
intends to adopt an approach of reviewing plans 1) to improve 
market access one by one while watching results of importing 
foreign-made products with competitive power based on actual 
results of procurement of foreign products in the government 
procurement sector; 2) on actual results in sales of imported 
cars as well as increase in the number of dealers engaged in 
simultaneous sales of imported and domestically-made cars; and 
3) on actual results in imports of foreign-made auto parts. In 
adopting this approach, the government aims to respond to 
overseas criticism that "the Japanese Government is indifferent 
to results." The government also plans to clearly state in this 
program that the basic plan for public investment totalling 430 
trillion yen [Y] in 10 years worked out in 1990 will be reviewed 
and the amount of investment will be increased. The total 
amount of the additional investment to be decided before the end 
of this year is estimated to reach over Y100 trillion. 
  Following the failure of the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, the government has decided to work out a market-opening 
program centered on four major points: deregulation; promotion 
of imports and investment; strengthening of policy in 
competition; and improvement of government procurement. 
Concerned agencies and ministries have already started studying 
detailed plans. Among topics brought up for discussion are 
strengthening of application of the Antimonopoly Act; 
deregulation in land utilization and the housing sector; and 
simplification of procedures for importing foodstuffs and 
medical supplies. However, the actual situation is that there 
is a shortage of effective measures. 
  The government has decided on introducing a mechanism for 
checking access results and on studying the plan to increase the 
public investment because of its judgment that it is necessary 
to set forth plans that can easily win understanding among 
foreign countries. It has been strongly criticized overseas 
that "despite Japan's continuous appeal for opening up its 
market, there have been no results whatsoever." It is observed 
that such dissatisfaction could be eased if Japan indicated its 
approach of connecting check of development in import expansion 
by numerial results, on the one hand, with efforts to analyze 
the causes and work out countermeasures, on the other. 
Moreover, in increasing the total of public investment, the 
government intends to indicate its eagerness to promote 
macroeconomic policy, according to which additional investment 
is regarded as indispensable to efforts to reduce the external 
trade surplus. 
  As for actual checking of results in the government 
procurement sector, the government plans to publish actual 
procurement from foreign firms by procurement agencies; 
moreover, it will announce to what extent procurement has been 
made by applying the general bidding system, and to what extent 
procurement has been made by signing free contracts. Regarding 
the auto and auto parts sector, the government will publish 
figures on actual imports, and at the same time announce the 
number of cases in which foreign firms have joinied in the 
design-in process when both manufacturers and users join in 
consultations throughout the processes of designing and 
development. In addition, the government intends to select 
various items -- in which foreign countries have strong interest 
-- and check actual results of their imports. 
  In revising the basic plan for public investment, the 
government intends to expand investment in those areas that are 
most closely connected with efforts to improve the living 
environment. As far as the macroeconomic policy is concerned, 
an idea has surfaced that income tax cuts should be carried out 
not only in fiscal 1995 but also in years thereafter. 
  The government is stressing that the trade surplus can be 
reduced in a steady way through efforts to open up the market 
and expand imports by implementing both micro- and macroeconomic 
policies. However, it still remains ambigious as to whether it 
will be possible to win understanding from foreign countries by 
working out only these measures.

University : "Without Revision of Procedural Law, Deregulation 
Is Impossible"] 
  [Text] The Committee on Economic Reform (the Hiraiwa 
Research Council) issued its interim report, calling for 
deregulation. No matter how good the arguments for deregulation 
are, however, they will not produce any tangible results. Why? 
Because the problem lies in the procedural law. 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The Committee on Economic Reform recently issued its interim 
report on deregulation. The report calls for freedom in 
principle with no exceptions, and proposes the strengthening of 
functions of third-party organizations and ombudsmen (OTO 
[Office of Trade Ombudsman]) to accomplish deregulation 
effectively. Can we really carry out deregulation? 
  My view is that the current conventional arguments for 
deregulation produce a limited effect. In carrying out 
administrative reform, the current method -- a committee 
approach -- cannot achieve success unless the administrative 
authorities support it. This approach is being used by force of 
habit because of the long reign of the former regime. We need to 
free ourselves from this way of thinking. Although there are 
strong expectations for supervisory organizations and OTO, their 
functions, status, and degree of independence are unknown. If 
worse comes to worst, these organizations will be a mere 
addition to the already enormous administrative structure, and 
result in a net increase in the number of government employees 
and the amount of their work. 
  Also, the proposals in the report seem too inclusive and can 
be interpreted as a message to all of the ministries to share 
the pains of adjustment equally. They don't provide a clear 
picture of in which areas deregulation will be focused or how it 
will be carried out. 
  Japan subscribes to the separation of three powers. What's 
important is to reform Japan's economic and political systems by 
using more effectively the roles of legislative and judicial 
powers and thereby achieving a dynamic check and balance between 
the two. What I want to stress here is the use of judicial power 
in solving the problem. 
  Speaking of the judicial solution, however, I think that the 
existing legal framework contains numerous restrictions, and 
that it does not necessarily serve as a means to protect the 
rights and interests of the citizens. To make it easier for 
people to bring about administrative litigation, we need to make 
the procedural law more consumer-oriented. To support this kind 
of change, we have to promote further "disclosure of information 
on deregulation." 
<H5>  All Too Inclusive </H5>
  The first paragraph of the interim report raises a question: 
"Why is deregulation necessary?" Here, it says, "Each area needs 
to be examined equally, and no `sanctuary' should be allowed to 
exist. Even in examining such areas as welfare, education, 
labor, and finance, this tenet should be applied." In the next 
paragraph, the report states that "economic control should be 
based on freedom in principle." Then, it goes on to say, 
"Control measures over entry, plant and equipment investment, 
and imports that have been employed for the purpose of adjusting 
demand and supply will be abolished at the earliest possible 
time." 
  All this is quite amazing because if it is done, all the 
problems of Japan will be solved immediately. Declaring 
"freedom in principle and control as an exception" means that 
administrative functions themselves are deemed unnecessary. 
Proposals for "reform," including administrative reform, have 
been made many times in the past. But this is the first time a 
report has advanced a principle clearly to this extent, except 
for the final report of the Committee on Administrative Reform 
issued recently. In this sense, the current report is 
epoch-making, indeed. 
  The problem, however, is that the report lacks basic 
strategies to implement its grand principle. 
  The current committee approach requires consultation with 
the administrative authorities in carrying out the 
administrative reform, and thus is up against a big wall. In 
fact, the majority of the committee members are former 
government officials. As ministries and agencies have the 
essential information, they expend great efforts in ground work 
to make ambiguous all the points that are unfavorable to them, 
watering down the final plan. The interim report, which 
proclaims the epoch-making principle in general, does not 
specify the effective date for abolishing control over entry or 
over plant and equipment investment; it simply states that such 
control "shall be abolished at the earliest possible time" and 
that "flexibility will be introduced in regulatory control." 
This will permit the government officials to evade their 
responsibility on one pretext or another in the future. 
  As a reference, the report lists about 500 related laws and 
regulations. Indeed, the list does seem all too inclusive and 
looks like an index to a compendium of laws. Does this mean that 
all the ministries will share the pains of adjustment? Who is 
going to review and examine each of these laws and regulations, 
and how? As it stands now, a person in charge of each of these 
specific laws and regulations is going to review its contents. 
The review will require manpower, and conclusions to be drawn 
from such a review seem self-evident. 
  What's necessary is to present a concrete vision of why 
deregulation will be carried out and what kinds of industries 
and socioeconomic structure Japan should strive to build. Based 
on such a vision, we need to restructure our strategies to 
ensure steady progress in deregulation. Just as the 
restructuring of the political world became possible, we also 
need to change the basic framework for system reform in the 
economic world. 
<H5>  Corporations Will Also Benefit From Deregulation </H5>
  One of the reasons for strong resistance to deregulation 
pertains to the issue of employment -- a fear that abolition of 
official regulations may increase unemployment. 
  To be sure, deregulation may cause unemployment in certain 
industries and corporations in the short run. However, once such 
deregulation is thoroughly carried out, new growth sectors will 
surely emerge. They will absorb the excess labor and may even 
increase overall employment and productivity. Therefore, it is 
important to make steady progress in deregulation so as to 
provide business opportunities to new businesses and to 
facilitate labor mobility among industries. 
  Some people might argue that the domestic industries have 
grown big because of protective regulations and the increased 
public spending. Furthermore, they might say that because of 
such regulations, new industries, and innovations were born 
through these regulatory webs. 
  In the postwar years, however, the steps taken to liberalize 
and open the market made it possible for Japan to become an 
economic power. Liberalization increased competitive pressure on 
the domestic front, urging the major industries to invest in 
plant and equipment for mass production. This in turn expanded 
the domestic market, serving as a driving force for a continuous 
increase in productivity. 
  In speaking of deregulation and import liberalization, 
people 
tend to emphasize the benefits to consumers. However, the 
beneficiaries are not limited to consumers. In fact, 
corporations benefit from such deregulation and liberalization. 
Most goods and imports that are used by corporations are 
partially finished products, not consumption goods. Lower prices 
in these intermediary goods benefit the corporations. 
  In fact, Japan's import liberalization in the 1960's was 
made 
possible largely by the desire of corporations for lower prices 
in raw materials. By switching the energy source from coal to 
oil, Japan was able to cut its energy cost and to build its 
heavy and chemical industries. If the cost of fuel were high, 
the cost of electricity would have been higher, which would 
increase the manufacturing costs and the prices of such raw 
materials as plastics and synthetic fiber. In a sense, 
inexpensive raw materials made it possible for Japan to achieve 
the high economic growth of the 1960's. 
  Currently, Japan's unemployment rate is inching up 
gradually. 
Because of this, "subsidies for employment adjustments" are 
being provided even to such key industries as home appliances 
and automobiles, increasing the number of white-collar employees 
and engineers who receive 70 percent of their wages and stay 
home. An anomaly in the export sector attests to the severity of 
the current recession. 
  Manufacturing companies have surplus labor, and the banks 
have bad assets. Being unable to borrow funds, the companies 
have been slow to restructuring their businesses. And, even if a 
corporate executive wants to make a drastic move in 
restructuring and writing off bad assets, he becomes hesitant 
because such a move will certainly be accompanied by reductions 
in dividends and capital, leading to a management responsibility 
issue. Also, the tax system stands doggedly in the way of 
mobilization of real estate transactions, as taxes on land 
values and transactions are prohibitively high as if they were 
penalties. Also, in order to revitalize Japan's agricultural 
industry, mobilization of farmland is needed. What's needed now 
is to promote mobilization immediately in the labor, financial, 
stock, and real estate markets. The solution to the current 
recession can surely be found by untangling the rigidity of the 
current system. 
  The subsidy for employment adjustments is too passive as a 
policy to be taken at present. Instead of making the existing 
enterprises retain their excess labor, we need to create new 
industries that will absorb the excess labor. Changing the 
direction of incentive giving will be the shortest cut toward 
revitalizing the economy. Making it possible for venture 
businesses to borrow money at low interest rates, and 
considering providing them with preferential tax treatments -- 
there is a room for government supports. 
  What's most important, however, is to open up business 
opportunities by eliminating entry control completely. This will 
immediately make corporations and citizens optimistic about 
their future. Redeployment of human resources by companies and 
accelerated disposition of bad assets -- that is, ways to 
mobilize human resources, funds, and land -- need to be promoted 
aggressively. This is why deregulation is urgently needed now. 
<H5>  Domestic Industries as Main Pillars </H5>
  Restructuring is most needed for the domestic industries. 
The 
Maekawa Report was based on a premise that the competitiveness 
of the export industries had to be weakened to reduce the trade 
surplus and thereby to reduce frictions with foreign countries. 
However, it used a double standard in dealing with deregulation 
issues, leaving the domestic industries almost untouched, 
probably because of their large capacity to absorb labor. 
  The premise of the report has reached the limit now that the 
exchange rate is close to 100 yen per dollar. Unless 
restructuring is carried out, Japan will never be able to come 
out of the vicious circle of adjusting to the strong yen. In the 
past, Japan has taken pride in its world-renowned 
competitiveness in such manufacturing industries as 
semiconductors, automobiles, and home appliances. However, this 
outstanding competitiveness has resulted time after time in a 
vicious circle; it leads to a rapid increase in exports, which 
in turn, sooner or later, is going to raise the value of the 
yen, to which the companies have to make bloody efforts to 
adjust themselves. Then, once Japan tides over the strong yen, 
it is looked upon warily again by the United States and Europe. 
We are no longer in the era [when we can afford to repeat the 
vicious circle] of "tiding over" the strong yen. 
  Such domestic industries as agriculture, finance, 
construction, distribution, energy, electric power, and gas have 
long benefited from protection. They are the underlying cause 
for price differentials between here and abroad, making it 
difficult for consumers to share the net profits from the strong 
yen. 
  In many cases these industries are "exempt" from application 
of the Antimonopoly Law, including these sections on cartels and 
the resale system. Even today, when Japan is a major economic 
power, such exemption is permitted. 
  In such sectors as electric power and gas, "local monopoly" 
has been allowed, the reason being their public utility status. 
In the areas of agriculture and construction, an enormous 
structure of vested interests has been created by politicians, 
bureaucrats, and businessmen, using public works projects and 
subsidies. Such protection of domestic industries has outlived 
its historical mission. 
  Inequality is limited between the continuing protection of 
the domestic industries and the pressure on the export 
industries for their adjustment efforts and sacrifices; it goes 
beyond the structural confines of these industries and their 
markets. Such export industries as automobiles and home 
appliances are comprised of assembly-type companies that have a 
vast array of domestic companies under them. Every time the 
value of the yen increased, these companies requested and 
promoted reductions in production costs from their 
subcontractors that manufacture parts for them. But the 
effectiveness of this method has reached its limit. If the 
export industries continue to be low, the Japanese economy 
itself will become shaky and weakened. 
  For the Japanese economy to find a way out of this stalemate 
and to revitalize itself, a major change needs to be made so 
that the domestic industries can become a driving force for 
growth. Also, it is important for the export industries to grow 
out of their single-minded emphasis on cost reduction and 
instead to strive to develop their own technologies and 
management know-how so that they will not have to flinch when 
faced with another increase in the value of the yen. To do so, 
we have to build a socioeconomic structure that will widen the 
room for originality and creativity, stressing the principle of 
self-responsibility. 
  Some people say that deregulation takes a long time. But 
once 
it's done, it can be achieved in a remarkably short period of 
time. At present, there are lively new entrants to the 
international communications sector. Thanks to this, charges for 
international telephone calls, which used to be fixed at about 
10,000 yen per a few minutes, have been declining rapidly. 
Besides, requests for approval of reduced charges continue to be 
filed. By choosing night-time calls for discounts, for example, 
consumers can enjoy much reduced rates and a variety of 
services. Nowadays, operators will look up telephone numbers in 
London, free of charge. Once deregulation begins, therefore, it 
will change the existing situation completely and improve the 
quality of services as well. Indeed, the "age of consumers" has 
arrived. As long as the right objectives and structure are 
presented, restructuring can be achieved at an amazingly swift 
speed. What hinders such a possibility is the existence of 
restrictive regulations. 
<H5>  Information Disclosure as a Starting Point </H5>
  To make real progress on deregulation, it is necessary to 
promote disclosure of information so that the public can grasp 
its current status and overall picture. Journalists have been 
asking me often lately, "I understand the importance of 
deregulation and opening up of the market. But where should we 
start?" 
  This question aptly indicates that the public doesn't have 
much basic information on deregulation. Although the grand 
principle has been presented at the general level, it is not 
clear what kinds of problems have beenmanifested in which areas, 
or what sort of insider information the authorities have on 
these problems. Unless such information is disclosed, the public 
will remain in the dark on specific issues and be forced to 
subjugate themselves to government officials. 
  Another reason why I want to stress the importance of 
information disclosure relates to the procedural law. From the 
beginning, the framework of Japan's administrative laws has not 
been constructed in favor of plaintiffs, the citizens. Under 
this framework, if a plaintiff doesn't have enough pertinent 
information, he will not be able to win his lawsuit. Therefore, 
what matters most is disclosure of information relating to the 
regulations. This is a starting point for deregulation. Revision 
of existing laws, especially of the procedural law, is necessary 
to make the system more consumer-oriented. 
  The framework of existing administrative law espouses the 
concept of the existence of "official power." This concept was 
established, modeled after German public laws, prior to the 
World War II by professor Tatsukichi Minobe (Tokyo University). 
According to this concept, decisions made by an administrative 
agency (such as a decision to levy taxes or to disapprove an 
application for a license, for example) are considered valid 
until such decisions are later revoked, or if they are clearly 
invalid. In other words, even if an administrative decision is 
illegal, the people subject to the decision are bound by it. 
  In sum, the concept upholds the administrative power over 
citizens. It is an interpretative legal doctrine that was born 
the effort to give relief to the citizens under the constitution 
granted by the Emperor, and that was considered as democratic 
during the prewar period. However, the concept has been rigidly 
followed even after the Constitution of Japan was established 
[after the war]. This is quite odd in this age when human rights 
are to be respected most. In reality, however, the legal views 
of administrative officials as well as of judges have not 
changed much. 
  Given the existence of "official power," decisions made by 
the authorities are presumed legal for the time being, and, 
therefore, the burden of proof rests with the citizen who brings 
his complaints in an administrative litigation. As people say 
that "one with the burden of proof will lose his case," this 
burden is quite heavy, and the chance of winning such a lawsuit 
is almost nil for the citizens. 
  Furthermore, there are rigid requirements in place regarding 
the competency for bringing about a lawsuit. "Competency 
requirements for plaintiffs" set restrictive conditions, making 
it not necessarily possible for anyone to bring a lawsuit. Also, 
because of such restrictive conditions as "benefits of 
litigation," the subject matter to be judged at a court must be 
clear and concrete. However, as it is not quite clear if any 
contestable decisions exist in the case of notification or 
administrative guidance, an intent for litigation may be turned 
down even before it comes to court. Also, as influential 
ministries and agencies issue their administrative guidance in 
person or on the phone, actual complaints can hardly be 
presented in the form appropriate for litigation. Unable to 
bring a lawsuit, therefore, the people must remain quiet in 
desperation on one hand, and the regulations remain intact on 
the other. 
  Let's assume that one was able to bring a lawsuit after 
solving all of these technical problems for litigation. In 
reality, however, suing an authority requires lots of courage, 
money, and knowledge. And the litigant may be most likely 
considered as being disrespectful of authority and accused of 
having disturbed the existing order of the industry in question; 
he could be "ostracized" as a result. Therefore, to bring a 
lawsuit against an authority, some kind of a system is needed 
where, for example, company A can pursue a lawsuit, representing 
the entire automobile industry. 
  To solve the aforementioned problems and to streamline the 
procedures for litigation, it also seems important to have a 
full-scale examination of the legislative framework, adapting 
eagerly such new ideas as "litigation by representatives." 
<H5>  Litigation Funds for Freedom in Business Operations </H5>
  What kind of strategy can we think of in order to dismantle 
regulations under the existing law? 
  I would like to propose establishment of "litigation funds 
for freedom in business operations" as a highly effective means 
to this end. For example, if each of 2,000 corporations listed 
on the stock exchange market, or their presidents, contributes 1 
million yen (it could be out-of-pocket money) to the funds to 
foot the bills for litigation, the total amounts to 2 billion 
yen. Then, an annual report is issued, summarizing the results 
of lawsuits financed by the funds. It will raise public 
awareness, and at the same time can be usee as leverage to 
promote information disclosure. 
  The litigation funds have the advantage of limiting the 
number of freeloaders because successful litigation by an 
individual against an authority to ease a regulation will also 
benefit a third party in the same situation. 
  Besides, there is a tendency in Japan to discourage 
administrative litigation, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, if 
there are no such cooperative funds for sharing the cost of 
litigation, no one is willing to bring a time-consuming lawsuit. 
  Some time ago, Yamato Transport filed an application for a 
trucking license with the Ministry of Transport [MOT]. The 
application was flatly denied, and the company was unable to 
make much progress in this matter for six years. Becoming 
increasingly flustered, the company finally decided to take the 
matter to court. Then, all of a sudden, the ministry granted a 
license, and the matter was resolved. The reason for this is 
that "if the matter goes to court, the MOT has to prove the 
`reason for not granting a license'" (per Mr. Akio Ogura, NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 17 October 1993). This case proves that 
litigation is the final resort, and that it is quite an 
effective tactic. 
<H5>  Law and Economics </H5>
  Many suggestions on deregulation have been made on the 
general level in the past. A private-sector, Hiraiwa-style forum 
(headed by Professor Iwao Nakatani), in which I participated, 
proposed establishment of the "doctrine of legal regulations" 
and enactment of the "basic law on regulations." The objective 
of this proposal was to reaffirm the superiority of judicial 
power over administrative power. However, I'm not sure if this 
kind of straightforward approach can break down the fortress of 
administrative authorities. 
  As mentioned earlier, the reason the fortress of 
administrative authorities can't be dismantled is that the 
current framework of procedural law does not favor citizens. As 
long as this situation continues to exist, the authorities will 
never be ordered to submit evidence or required to explain 
clearly the need for a particular regulation. In the long run, 
however, this means that the administrative organs in Japan will 
miss the opportunities for tensions and challenges. It is 
unfortunate for the citizens at large that the proud 
administration of Japan is losing its innate vitality. 
  In Japan, the basic law does not serve adequately as a check 
against administrative control. Defying the possibility of 
misunderstandings, I should say that administrative laws in 
Japan are written so simply that they can be interpreted quite 
flexibly, like molding clay, by the authorities. Also, as a 
rule, administrative officials have been trying to resolve 
problems by persuasion, rather than by issuing edicts. Such 
being the case, the authorities probably have not assessed the 
economic effects of regulations in a strict sense. 
  Because of these reasons, the ultimate point of contention 
is 
at the level of how each individual regulation is applied. It is 
important to put the substantive laws in order, but what's 
equally practical is to stress equality in procedural matters so 
as to guarantee the correct ways of applying and interpreting 
the substantive laws. In this respect, courts of law should be 
used actively and flexibly. 
  To do so, it is important to promote restructuring, 
including 
that of the legal framework, so as to create a consumer-oriented 
system. However, legal scholars do not seem to have developed 
their awareness on this issue. Also, there are no specialists in 
legal matters in the Hiraiwa Committee who are independent from 
administration. More than ever, there seems to be a need for 
legal scholars to acquire knowledge of economics. 
  In the United States, where the arguments for deregulation 
were initiated, the importance of [the connection between] "law 
and economics" is well recognized. Economists are required to 
have common-sense knowledge of the law, and legal scholars of 
economics. This is the point stressed by Dr. Coase, who 
received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1991. Without being 
armed with law and economics, arguments for deregulation, no 
matter how good their general theorems are, will be of "no 
practical use" in terms of specifics. 
  Japan has also entered the era when procedural law must be 
thoroughly reviewed from the consumers' perspective in 
cooperation with legal scholars. Without such an effort to make 
a drastic remedy by enacting a set of laws regarding 
administrative procedures and information disclosure, the 
committee approach will result in a repeated submission of 
impractical proposals.

  [Text] During a House of Representatives Budget Committee 
meeting on the afternoon of 21 February, Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa referred to the issue of reviewing the "National 
Defense Program Guidelines" (which were endorsed by the cabinet 
in 1976). He said: "It has been almost 20 years since the 
concept of basic defense power was formulated (since the present 
defense program guidelines were drawn up). I think it is 
necessary to rethink basic defense power in a way that is 
relative for this new era. We should basically change our 
viewpoints in the present vast flow." In this way, Hosokawa 
clarified his plan to drastically review the "concept of basic 
defense power," which is the basis of the present defense 
buildup program. Hosokawa was answering a question by Sohei 
Miyashita (a member of the Liberal Democratic Party). 
  Basic defense power is stipulated as the minimum defense 
capability that Japan, as an independent state, should maintain 
in peace time. It has been explained that "basic defense power 
is not something that directly confronts possible military 
threats imposed on Japan." Hosokawa's remarks in the session 
will likely create a great stir because they note the need for 
drastically reviewing the National Defense Prorgram Guidelines, 
including the "basic concept" of the defense buildup, and they 
are not in line with explanations given by former governments. 
  Hosokawa also indicated the intention to have his private 
consultative body come to a conclusion on new defense program 
guidelines as early as this summer, and expressed the hope that 
"the conclusion will be reflected in some way in the defense 
buildup for fiscal 1995." However, Kazuo Aichi, director 
general of the Defense Agency, advanced an opinion differing 
from Hosokawa's. He said: "In view of the actual situation, it 
will be very difficult to completely change the defense program 
in the fiscal 1995 budget." 
  LDP's Miyashita also asked a question regarding the issue of 
how participation by the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in UN 
peacekeeping operations (PKO) should be evaluated in the SDF's 
duties. He said: "There is an opinion that Article 3 of the SDF 
Law should be amended to rank PKO missions as the SDF's main 
duty. What do you think of this?" In reply, Hosokawa said: 
"The government should bring this issue before the people 
first. After the people have fully discussed the matter, the 
government should begin to study it." In this way, he indicated 
the intention to handle the issue carefully.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Liberal </F>
Democratic Party (LDP) by Yoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
political department chief; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Oikawa] What do you think of the compromise 
reached between the coalition and the LDP to save the political 
reform bills? 
  [Mori] There was no option left to the LDP. We had our backs 
to the wall. Two cabinets have collapsed under LDP rule for 
failing to achieve political reform. Consequently, the LDP also 
failed to maintain its lower house majority. For all that, 
could we still continue to put off settlement of this issue? 
No, we could not do that. This was the time to end the 
political reform impasse. The move for a compromise between the 
ruling coalition and the LDP began when lower house Speaker 
Takako Doi proposed a mediation plan. However, the whole thing 
started when the upper house rejected the reform bills. All was 
the disposition of God. 
  [Oikawa] The new electoral system is a combination of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. 
What is the merit of introducing such a system? 
  [Mori] An electoral system should exist for the sake of the 
public, and not for the benefit of politicians. If we want to 
keep the new system for a while as a transitional system, the 
partial introduction of proportional representation seats is 
unavoidable. This time, the less powerful upper house played a 
significant role, by rejecting the unconvincing political reform 
package presented by the coalition government. This fact is 
very important, because it proves the significance of the 
existence of a two-chamber system. 
  [Oikawa] How soon will the political reform bills be revised 
and enacted by the regular Diet session? 
  [Mori] It is better to strike while the iron is hot. The 
amendments should be passed as soon as possible, before the Diet 
starts deliberations on the budget bill for fiscal 1994. 
  [Oikawa] Is there no problem inside the party? 
  [Mori] The LDP is a mature party. All the party members will 
follow once the decision is made. What we want is to initiate a 
proper system as soon as possible. Once the fiscal 1994 budget 
bill is placed on the agenda, we will be able to give details on 
the partial revision of the political reform bills. 
  [Oikawa] Will the LDP take any punitive action against its 
reform-shy members who disobeyed the leadership? 
  [Mori] I am not sure whether they really wanted to oppose 
the 
reform package, because they just abstained from voting by not 
attending the plenary session. We may say that it was a 
discreet act on their part: they took care not to make the 
situation worse, while expressing their will in some way. There 
is no need to call them to account. 
  [Oikawa] Is there a possibility of a party split? 
  [Mori] I cannot say whether there is such a possibility or 
not. When the LDP was in a delicate situation because of the 
sharp divisions between pro-reform and reform-shy camps, both of 
them said that united action was indispensable. So, President 
Yohei Kono and I once thought that there would be no other way 
but to let the bills die. We were able of avoid a party split, 
and that was really a disposition of providence. 
  [Oikawa] LDP lawmakers elected from urban districts are 
expected to have a tough time in the next election under the new 
system. Do you not think that these members might leave the 
party? 
  [Mori] We have to find a way so that 80 to 90 percent of 
incumbent LDP lawmakers can be reelected, because those who may 
withdraw from the party are mostly concerned about reelection. 
To cope with the new electoral system, we will soon discuss how 
to prepare for the next election by reorganizing the party and 
creating a new structure. 
  [Oikawa] Some people say that President Kono is planning to 
support the government from outside the cabinet or to form a 
grand alliance with the ruling coalition. Is this true? 
  [Mori] The collaboration between the ruling coalition and 
the 
opposition LDP brought about the settlement of the much-awaited 
issue. The public should feel relieved to see both forces 
arriving at a compromise after a long quarrel. I cannot 
definitely say that the LDP is planning to support the 
government from outside the cabinet. I can only say that 
President Kono has made many suggestive remarks.

  [Text] Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. [KEPC] plans to 
begin demonstration tests of a superconducting magnetic energy 
storage (SMES) system, which employs superconductivity 
technology to overcome the difficult process of storing 
electricity and transmits power when necessary. Under a 
five-year plan starting in fiscal year 1994, the company intends 
to spend about 880 million yen to install the nation's largest 
demonstration system at a transmission station in the suburbs of 
Fukuoka to collect various data which could not be gathered at 
the existing small-scale facilities. Power companies have been 
asked to seek ways to level out fluctuations in power loads 
caused by a gap between normal power demand and peak demand 
experienced during summer afternoons. This problem would be 
greatly alleviated should storage of electricity become 
possible. At KEPC's research institute, researchers feel "the 
upcoming experiments will be a big step toward making the system 
practical." 
  Major electrical machinery manufacturers and four 
universities, including Kyushu University, plan to participate 
in the demonstration test. Work on designing the model system 
is to begin next fiscal year, and test operations will begin 
after the system is installed between 1997 and 1998, following 
partial tests and other initial procedures. 
  The model system will store electrical energy up to 1 
kilowatt-hour, with an output of 1,000 kilowatts. This compares 
with conventional systems' storage capacity of 200 to 300 
watt-hours and output of 50 kilowatts. In the United States, 
the U.S. Defense Department embarked on a project in late 1980's 
to develop a device to store 20,000 kilowatts per hour as part 
of its Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) plan, but apparently 
"not much progress has been made in the development project," 
(as stated by an official at the KEPC).

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan 
[NASDA] will soon start remodeling the domestically-made, 
large-scale H-2 rocket, which was successfully test-launched 
recently. 
  The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's 
launch capability to assist various related projects, such as 
construction of the Japanese space shuttle "Hope" and 
exploration of the moon and other planets. Armed with funds 
totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for 
fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the 
engine and airframe. 
  As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class 
satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been 
worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and 
other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment. 
NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned 
space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be 
launched by H-2. Without modification, however, the H-2 will be 
used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be 
nearly double those of other countries. 
  NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs 
and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and 
welding parts of the engine and airframe. It aims, reportedly, 
to cut launch costs by 30 percent. 
  There are three different methods of reinforcing the 
rocket's 
launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel 
rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two 
sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of 
the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters 
composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses 
hydrocarbon as its fuel. 
  The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of 
launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at 
present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of 
15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively. 
  The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying 
a 
long-term space development program. Projects connected with 
future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion 
now. Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various 
space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil 
from the Mars using exploration spacecraft. Teruo Sofue, a 
staff member of the comprehensive development department at 
NASDA, said: "By reinforcing the H-2 rocket, we can expand the 
range of space development. We would like to develop it into a 
rocket capable of engaging in a number of activities."

  [Text] The general secretary of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, Mr. Ajit Singh, is to visit 
Vietnam from February 21 to 25. Now Thu Hang will bring you our 
comment on the purpose of the visit: 
  This is the first visit to Vietnam by an ASEAN general 
secretary, and highlight coordinations between Vietnam and ASEAN 
are entering a new stage for cooperation and mutual development. 
Vietnam's participation in the Bali Treaty and in the foreign 
ministerial conference of ASEAN member countries last year has 
created conditions for Vietnam to join in regional political and 
economic cooperation. As well as ASEAN countries' investment in 
Vietnam is also greatly increasing. [sentence as heard] 
Singapore has 49 projects in Vietnam with a total capital of 
more than U.S.$366 million; Thailand, with 43 projects worth 
nearly U.S.$150 million; Indonesia, 13 projects with the total 
capital of U.S.$175 million; Malaysia, 20 projects worth 
U.S.$163 million; the Philippines, nine projects with the total 
capital of U.S.$47 million; and Brunei which has invested about 
U.S.$1.5 million. In comparison with the three previous years, 
the investment from these countries increased 10 times. Over 40 
agreements on economic and trading cooperations, payments, 
credits, aviation, and navigation have been signed between 
Vietnam and members of the ASEAN. In addition, dozens of joint 
ventures between Vietnam and ASEAN countries are underway in 
Vietnam. 
  Political relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member 
countries have also improved. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet has visited all six of the ASEAN member countries. 
Recently, Vietnamese party leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and 
Thailand, and state and government leaders of six ASEAN 
countries also came to Vietnam. Singaporean Prime Minister Goh 
Chok Tong pledged to do his utmost to help Vietnam in the 
latter's process of economic renovation. Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai stressed that Vietnam's quick development will 
help to promote development throughout the region. 
  Relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries are 
developing effectively and will make the visit to Vietnam by the 
ASEAN general secretary a success and will help to create peace, 
stability, cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia.

Vietnamese leaders and visit traditional cultural places of 
Vietnam, humanitarian centers, and joint venture enterprises 
between the Great Britain and Vietnam. The princess will also 
study the process of renovation in Vietnam as well as its 
foreign and domestic policies. In early March, the Cuban 
foreign minister will visit Vietnam to strengthen the friendship 
and cooperation. 
  All these visits prove Vietnam's open door policy to 
befriend 
with all nations in the world has been warmly welcomed 
worldwide. It has created favorable conditions for Vietnam to 
effectively promote its process of renovation.

  [Text] On 16 February in Can Tho City, Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet held a meeting with key Mekong River Delta leaders to 
discuss the transfer of the regional economic structure until 
the year 2000. Representatives of ministries, government 
components, and the 9th Military Region attended the meeting. 
  In his statement, the prime minister stressed: This exchange 
of views is aimed at understanding the party's practical line, 
policies, measures, and investment planning from now until the 
year 2000. The meeting, together with its follow-up opinions, 
will actively contribute to the seventh party plenum to be held 
in the middle of 1994. 
  Vo Van Kiet mentioned two major issues for the delegates to 
discuss: common issues of the transfer of economic structure in 
the Mekong River delta and urgent issues relating to isolated 
areas, former revolution bases, and areas inhabited by ethnic 
Khmer people. He reminded the delegates to pay more attention to 
the construction of infrastrucuture projects in the region. 
  With respect to economic programs, the prime minister held 
that the Mekong River delta needs to change its economic 
structure under the direction of industrialization and 
modernization to develop its production capacity by exploiting 
its regional economic advantages and biological conditions to 
meet demand on domestic and foreign markets. At the same time, 
the region needs to broaden its mechanization and 
electrification at different levels to suit the varying rural 
situation. The local agriculture-industrial economic models 
with different economic sectors to attach agriculture production 
with processing industry must be established. 
  Regarding agriculture, the Mekong River delta needs to 
improve its production quality and ensure stable and firm rice 
production. We must gradually solve problems relating to the 
post-harvest area and consumption market. We must continue to 
increase our advantages in aquaculture by semi-extensive and 
extensive breeding. At the same time, we have to consider 
policies to encourage production such as credit policy and so 
forth. 
  In industry, we must mainly develop processing industries 
for 
agricultural and aquacultural products. We must gradually 
increase the production of building materials to fully exploit 
local advantages and meet regional demands. Fundamental 
industries such as electricity, machinery production, and 
chemicals must be improved to provide better service for 
processing industries. 
  The meeting was held on 16-17 February.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 19 -- "The Mekong River delta is an 
area of great potentials, and has an important role to play in 
the country's development cause, that is why an 
industrialization and modernization strategy must be worked out 
immediately to develop this region," said Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  He was speaking at a two-day meeting on the transform of 
economic structure in the Mekong delta held in Can Tho city, the 
Mekong River delta province of Hau Giang. The meeting drew the 
participation of secretaries of the party committees and 
chairmen of the people's committees of 11 provinces in the 
region. 
  On the transform of the Mekong delta's economic structure, 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that the construction of 
socio-economic infrastructural bases is the foremost task aiming 
at ensuring a firm base for the socio-economic development and 
improvement of local people's cultural standards. At present, 
he noted, the Mekong delta's infrastructural base is too low. 
  It was reported that each year this region produces over 11 
million tonnes of rice, accounting for nearly half of the 
country's total rice output. Thus more investments in rice 
cultivation, particularly special rice-growing areas, are 
needed. Furthermore, the Mekong delta provinces had great 
potentials in breeding pigs and ducks, and planting fruit trees 
and industrial crops. Aquatic products are also a strong point 
of the region.

  [Text] HANOI, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Vietnamese workers will be 
allowed to strike to defend their interests, but only as a last 
resort, a Ho Chi Minh City labor union newspaper cited the Labor 
Ministry as saying. The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry told 
provincial authorities Friday that workers would have the right 
to strike after all efforts at conciliation were exhausted, the 
union weekly, NGUOI LAO DONG, said in its latest edition. But 
it added that workers planning to strike would have to submit to 
management a written warning 15 days prior to any action. 
  The ministry also called for the formation of conciliation 
and arbitration councils in local companies, in conjunction with 
regional state labor boards, to help resolve disputes between 
workers and their bosses, the newspaper said. If disputes were 
not resolved under the system, employees could strike two weeks 
after submitting a written warning. Negotiations would continue 
over the duration of a strike, the newspaper added. 
  In the absence of a labor code, which the National Assembly 
is expected to be adopt in mid-June, the right to strike comes 
as social conflicts have multiplied in recent months, especially 
in the south. 
  The Vietnamese press reported on three strikes that took 
place shortly before Tet -- the Lunar New Year -- at the 
beginning of the month in three major companies, one in Hanoi. 
The most drastic was at Ho Chi Minh City's Vitexco, where 500 
workers stopped work, demanding a new year bonus increase and 
social security guarantees. Some 140 Ho Chi Minh City street 
sweepers also went on strike with the same demands. In the 
capital, 200 factory workers struck for 48 hours over low and 
inequitable salaries, the newspaper said.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia's defense links with Jakarta are now just 
as important as those with Washington. That is the conclusion 
to be drawn from the first strategic review of Australia's 
defense priorities since the end of the Cold War. The 
unclassified version of the report clearly locks Australia's 
military needs into Asia, particularly Southeast Asia. And it 
also identifies China as possibly having major security 
implications for the region. John Shuvlan spoke to the 
Australian defense minister, Robert Ray. 
  [Begin recording] [Ray] Well, I think they are both equally 
important. Clearly Indonesia is the key country in our 
particular region. We are delighted at the extent we have been 
able to reestablish with them our defense links since setbacks 
in 1986. It's been a very smooth transition from the past 
somewhat brittleness into a very durable relationship. 
  [Shuvlan] We still see or we see now our relationship with 
the U.S. virtually in Asian terms, don't we? If it is good for 
Asia, then it is okay. 
  [Ray] Fairly much so, but it is not the only aspect of our 
relationship with the United States that is important. We have 
a very strong relationship on the intelligence side, on 
equipment purchases, on technological transfer. They have been 
very good to us in the last few years when we wanted to acquire 
different defense platforms, enormously cooperative as seen even 
recently through two or three second hand buys where we have 
been given the first choice of equipment. 
  [Shuvlan] So, they are not really, though, as I think 
Menzies may have have put it years ago our great and powerful 
friend anymore. 
  [Ray] Oh certainly over five decades the relationship 
changes. But there are less bilateral issues between us now, 
actually, to disturb the relationship than has been in the last 
50 years. 
  [Shuvlan] The other emerging great player in terms of a 
military might is China. How concerned are we about China's 
military future? 
  [Ray] Well, certainly, the Chinese defense force are going 
through a substantial upgrade and modernization and a lot of 
that is to do with the fact that they have got a fairly archaic 
structure. But clearly, as an economic power, they are going to, 
if they continue at the current rates of economic growth, be a 
very powerful force. 
  At the moment, however, you have to distinguish between 
capability and intent and they are showing no intent in fact of 
misbehaving in the region. It is a matter that is probably of 
more concern to some of our neighbors than to us directly 
because of the historic nature of the Chinese relationship in 
the region. 
  [Shuvlan] So, let us say for example, the Indonesian 
archipelago is something almost like a bulwark between Australia 
and China. 
  [Ray] Well, I don't see it in those direct terms, but 
clearly Indonesia, if it is a friend and we are engaged in a 
strategic partnership with them, is very much Australia's 
frontline defense. Someone else will have to defeat Indonesia 
first. But this strategic review is not looking toward an 
immediate threats emerging. Just to the long view that we 
should try to establish as good relationship as we can with the 
various countries of our region. 
  [Shuvlan] So it would take a some kind of a rogue regime in 
Beijing for the major security implications that you talked 
about in the report to take effect? 
  [Ray] Well, I am not going to target any particular regime 
in any particular country. No strategic review does that, at 
least not in the declassified version. But I have to say that, 
you know, just developing this not just bilateral relationships 
but good relationships in the region very much promotes our own 
security. [end recording]

  [Text] The foreign affairs minister, Senator Gareth Evans, 
has confirmed there is to be a judicial inquiry into Australia's 
overseas intelligence organization, ASIS [Australian Security 
Intelligence Service]. Sen. Evans told parliament the 
government has given in principle agreement to an inquiry that 
will look into the operation and management of ASIS. There have 
been calls for such an investigation following allegations which 
two former ASIS spies made on a documentary screened earlier 
this week on the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] 
program, Four Corners. 
  Among the allegations was that ASIS kept files on thousands 
of Australian citizens, that agents spied for Britain in the 
Middle East, and that secret payments were made to rebel army 
officers in the Philippines who had tried to overthrow the 
Aquino government. But Sen. Evans said the inquiry had been 
under active consideration for some time well before the latest 
allegations.

  [Text] SUVA, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Fiji's Chief Justice Sir 
Timoci Tuivaga rejected Tuesday an attempt by the governing 
Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party to stop polling in 
Tailevu Province to allow renominations for this week's 
election. The SVT, headed by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, 
wanted to nominate another candidate followed the death of Home 
Affairs Minister Ratu William Toganivalu during the period 
allowed for objections. 
  However, Tuivaga rejected the application for an injunction 
on the grounds that Toganivalu had died during this period and 
his nomination papers had become irrelevant in the election for 
Tailevu. Toganivalu had been replaced by a close associate who 
had entered the election as an independent. 
  Meantime, election officials said they were concerned by 
what 
is considered here to be a low voter turnout at the start of 
Fiji's week-long general election, particularly in Suva. They 
reported that in some areas turnout was down to between 60 and 
70 percent. 
  "We have given the snap general election a lot of publicity 
but people have not been turning up to vote since we began last 
Friday," an election official said. 
  "It's now up to election candidates to provide transport for 
their supporters and take them to their respective polling 
stations," he said. Polling has been quiet and incident-free.

  [Text] PORT VILA, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Vanuatu's opposition 
announced Monday it will reverse its usual position and consider 
forming a coalition with the ruling party to end the 
presidential election stalemate, the national radio reported 
Monday. Opposition Vanuaaku Pati (VP) coordinator Peter 
Taurakoto announced the group was considering forming a new 
political coalition with the Union of Moderate Parties (UMP), 
which heads the coalition government. The new coalition would 
help elect a new president of the republic next March 2, when 
the electoral college meets for the third time, he said. 
  Last week, the island state's electoral college, which 
consists of 46 MPs and 10 local government council presidents 
failed twice to elect the country's third head of state. No one 
party had a sufficient majority to meet the college's two-thirds 
-- 38-vote -- requirement. 
  Taurakoto explained the opposition's decision followed 
failure to reach an agreement with former prime minister Walter 
Lini's National United Party (NUP), which considers itself an 
"independent opposition" group. 
  Vanuatu Prime Minister Maxime Carlot said last Thursday it 
was "time to talk" for his government majority and the 
opposition in order to fill the presidential post. 
  The opposition parties formed an alliance in 1992 that 
includes the four parties, the VP, led by Kalpokas, Barak Sope's 
Melanesian Progressive Party, the Tan Union, headed by Vincent 
Boulekone and Nagriamel, led by Franky Steven. 
  The alliance had planned to vote for a no-confidence motion 
against Prime Minister Maxime Carlot's coalition government. 
  Taurakoto said earlier that if the coalition agreement was 
reached with the UMP, the new coalition would leave out the two 
NUP factions -- Lini's "opposition" and minister Sethy 
Regenvanu's pro- government group. 
  Carlot's government consists of a majority of eight 
ministers 
from the ruling UMP and three NUP ministers, who decided not to 
follow Lini when he withdrew last August from the UMP-NUP 
coalition government. 
  Regenvanu, the deputy prime minister and NUP minister for 
justice, culture and women's affairs issued a statement Monday 
saying that the opposition's decision to join the government was 
an "indication of desperation." It is an "180-degree 
turnaround" from an opposition group which, he said, wanted to 
bring down the government. 
  Regenvanu, who now heads a group of three dissident NUP 
members of parliament who hold ministers' portfolios, called for 
the opposition to end its "futile struggle".

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists on Feb. 17 and 18 sent an overseas-based E-3 early 
warning plane called an air command post, pursuit-assault planes 
and tanker planes to the skies above South Korea for a 
provocative day-and-night joint aerial war exercise together 
with the South Korean puppets against the North, according to 
military sources. 
  This war game involved fighter planes based in Okinawa, 
Japan, and more than 450 fighter planes of different types 
belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea and the 
puppet Air Force. Flying above Yongwol, Chongju and Yesan of 
South Korea, they staged exercises of a surprise bombing on 
targets, a support to ground attack, a long-distance movement, 
entry into war and an aerial attack. 
  In separate action, the South Korean puppets on the 17th and 
18th committed a war gamble against the North in the areas of 
Chorwon, Hwachon and Inje, South Korean Kangwon Province, and 
Yonchon in Kyonggi Province.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 21 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Central 
Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) issued an appeal to all the 
officials of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan on Feb. 21 in 
connection with the start of a "three-month campaign for the 
rights of compatriots." 
  The appeal says the campaign is a mass movement of 
innovation 
to achieve a new victory in the work for national reunification 
and all the patriotic work of Chongnyon this year, one year 
before the 50th anniversary of the August 15, 1945 liberation of 
Korea and the 40th anniversary of the founding of Chongnyon. 
  It calls for waging a grand movement to learn from the 
greatness of the sagacious leader at all Chongnyon organs, 
branches and families under the slogan "Let us learn from the 
illustrious leader Marshal Kim Chong-il!" and for strengthening 
the patriotic ranks of Koreans in Japan as ranks of people loyal 
to him. 
  "Let us all make a tangible contribution to the 
reunification 
of Korea in the 1990s through the implementation of `10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country' in the patriotic spirit that `my 
destiny is linked with the destiny of the country and the 
nation,' actively help toward the building of socialism in the 
homeland and increase the ranks of our supporters and 
sympathizers among the Japanese people," the appeal stresses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- The members of the 
delegation of the Communist Party of Canada (M-L) led by its 
national leader Hardial Bains met with Yi In-mo, former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army, on February 19. 
  The head of the delegation said Comrade Yi In-mo maintained 
his faith and will as a communist for scores of years behind 
bars in South Korea and this is an example to be followed not 
only by the Korean people but also by the world communists and 
revolutionaries. 
  He stressed that any enemy can never bring the Korean people 
to their knees because they have the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] which produced such incarnation of faith and will as Yi 
In-mo and they are wisely guided by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  A member of the delegation Sandra Bains said it is an 
intolerable crime that the South Korean puppets had kept him 
behind bars for 34 years, putting him to all manner of inhuman 
persecution. 
  Noting that it was possible in the socialist homeland that 
Comrade Yi In-mo recovered his health, she said that while in 
Korea, the delegation could see socialism of Korea advancing 
dynamically. 
  Comrade Yi In-mo said he regained his life under the deep 
loving care of the great leader and the dear leader. 
  "I could undauntedly struggle, maintaining my faith and 
will, 
because I deeply trusted only the WPK, the leader and the 
socialist homeland," he added.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- A joint statement 
was made public here Tuesday by the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] and the Communist Party of Canada [CPC] (Marxist-Leninist 
-- M-L). 
  According to the joint statement, both sides informed each 
other of the situation and activities of their parties and 
exchanged views on the matter of developing relations between 
the two parties and international issues of mutual concern and 
reached a complete consensus of views. 
  The WPK highly appreciated the CPC (M-L) that is maintaining 
the revolutionary principle even under the ceaseless 
maneouvrings of the imperialists and their stooges to undermine 
the party and strengthening the party on a new basis, firmly 
building up the basic party organizations among the masses. 
  The WPK expressed support to the stand of the CPC (M-L) 
demanding respect for the sovereignty of all countries and all 
nations, dissolution of all forms of aggressive and predatory 
military and economic blocs including the NATO and the complete 
abolition of all kinds of mass destruction weapons. 
  The CPC (M-L) highly appreciated the great exploits of the 
respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il who have strengthened and developed the WPK into an 
invincible political organization of leadership and made it 
possible to steadfastly defend and advance the socialist cause 
in whatever situation by firmly rallying the entire people 
around the party. 
  The CPC (M-L) expressed deep concern over the adventure of 
the U.S. authorities to put pressure on the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea while breaking the promise it has made at the 
DPRK-U.S. talks and held that the United States should pull all 
nuclear weapons out of South Korea and stop the projected 
deployment of "Patriot" missiles and the nuclear war exercises 
if it wants a fair solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It also expressed firm solidarity with the Workers' Party 
and 
the people of Korea in their struggle to realize national 
reunification in the form of confederacy based on one nation, 
one state, two systems and two governments on the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity. 
  Both sides expressed common will to unite, cooperate and 
further strengthen solidarity with communist and workers' 
parties and other progressive political parties of different 
countries of the world on the principle of advancing the cause 
of working class of the whole world to victory while bearing 
responsibility for the revolution of their own country with 
independence as an important idea of unity.

rising generation to be fine personnel prepared ideologically, 
intellectually and physically.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- Public figures and 
organizations of different countries have expressed full support 
to the January 31 statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman condemning the United States for resorting to 
unreasonable pressure, reversing the DPRK-U.S. agreements. 
  Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the new Yugoslav 
Communist Movement, said in an interview with the KCNA 
correspondent in his country on Feb. 7 that it was a base 
betrayal to a partner of the dialogue and an intolerable 
challenge to the fair public opinion that the United States 
pronounced an ultimatum, crying for socalled full-scope 
inspections and "sanctions". 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can never be 
solved 
by pressure and threat, he said. 
  The Mali-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement on 
Feb. 4 that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cannot be 
solved by means of force and only the dialogue is the realistic 
way for the solution. 
  It strongly urged the United States to immediately come out 
to the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The Zambia-Korea Friendship Association strongly demanded in 
a statement on Feb. 5 that the United States stop a very 
dangerous row of pressure upon the DPRK, implement the promise 
to the partner of the dialogue and discharge its duty in the 
spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement. 
  Ranbir Singh, chairman of the Indian Committee for 
Supporting 
Korea's Reunification, said in an interview with the KCNA 
correspondent in his country on Feb. 4 that the United States 
must give up its unreasonable pressure regarding the "nuclear 
issue", stop the provocative moves for another war and honestly 
accede to the DPRK-U.S. talks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- World political and 
public circles express full support to the January 31 statement 
of a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK which was 
made public in connection with the grave situation created by 
the perfidious acts of the United States. 
  Twenty-two political parties and organisations of Peru 
including the Socialist Political Action Party, the Communist 
Party and the General Confederation of Workers, released a joint 
statement on February 6. 
  The statement manifested full support and firm solidarity 
for 
the cause of the Workers' Party of Korea, the DPRK Government 
and people for defending their sovereignty and system chosen by 
themselves and for peace on the Korean peninsula and peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  It appealed to all the political parties, governments and 
peoples of the world who value peace and justice to support and 
encourage the DPRK's just stand for a solution of the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula. 
  Seven political parties and organisations of Pakistan 
including the Socialist Party, the Pakistan Organisation for 
Afro-Asian People's Solidarity and the Federation of Trade 
Unions issued a joint statement on February 8 urging the United 
States to approach the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks with a 
sincere attitude and position. 
  The statement said that if the U.S. Administration really 
has 
a willingness to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
in a peaceful way, it must honestly implement the DPRK-U.S. 
joint statement and not drive the situation to a catastrophe. 
  Five organisations of Tanzania, including the Youth Union 
and 
the Scientific and Technical Association in a joint statement on 
February 3 said that the United States must renounce the policy 
of strength and immediately withdraw its troops and nuclear 
weapons from South Korea, mindful that a nuclear war on the 
Korean peninsula would bring irreparable grave consequences to 
the Korean people and the world people. 
  A former general of Greece, George Pattas, chairman of the 
Western European Committee for Korea's Reunification and Peace, 
in a press statement on February 6 said that the U.S. hardline 
conservative forces are deliberately straining the situation by 
threatening to deploy even Patriot missiles in South Korea in a 
bid to overpower North Korea militarily. This will only result 
in obstructing an early and peaceful solution of the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, he 
added.

  [Text] On the occasion of the felicitous February national 
day, people throughout the country and officers and men of the 
revolutionary Armed Forces held meetings to take an oath of 
loyalty to supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear 
leader of our party and people. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Today our 
people are filled with the burning resolve to defend our party 
politically, ideologically, and with life in the face of any 
tribulations and storms and to share fate with the party to the 
end. 
  The meetings to take an oath of loyalty to the great leader 
[yongdoja] to the end were held in institutions, plants, 
enterprises, cooperatives, schools, units of the Korean People's 
Army [KPA] and the Korean People's Security Forces, [word 
indistinct] in the mountains, television stations, [word 
indistinct] islands, and even on navigating trade ships. 
  The meetings were attended by the people of all strata 
throughout the country, including old anti-Japanese 
revolutionary fighters, who are seniors of our revolution; 
veterans of the fatherland liberation war; functionaries of the 
party power organizations and the working people's 
organizations; workers; farmers; soldiers; intellectuals; and 
youths and students. 
  Officers and men of the three services of the KPA held a 
meeting at the face of the native home of the historic Mt. 
Paektu secret camp. At the meeting, the KPA officers and men 
deeply expressed the conviction that as long as there is General 
Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of our revolutionary Armed 
Forces, the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary forces will be 
powerful and ever-victorious. They solemnly pledged to firmly 
uphold the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by fulfilling the 
missions assigned by the country, people, times, and revolution. 
  They chanted slogans, which showed their firm pledge to 
become a fortress and shield to defend with armed forces our 
supreme commander, to become rifles and bombs, and to smash any 
strong enemies in a stroke under the great commander's 
leadership. 
  Heroic working classes of each district plant and enterprise 
-- such as Musan coal mining complex, Kim Chaek iron-steel 
complex, Namhung youth chemical complex, other large-scale 
extracting bases, metallurgical bases, and large-scale chemical 
industry bases -- solemnly resolved to uphold Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the fate of our nation and incarnation of victory and 
glory, as the pillar of faith and will for good. 
  Agricultural working people, who are accelerating final 
preparations for new year's farming with the single resolve to 
glorify this year marking the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the socialist rural theses with bumper crops, 
took an oath of loyalty on the occasion of the significant 
February national day. 
  In the meetings held at various cooperatives, including 
Mangyongdae cooperative, Chongsan cooperative, and Wonhwa 
cooperative, agricultural working people pledged to firmly 
uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, to brilliantly 
implement the party's agriculture-first policy, and to discharge 
the mission of revolutionary fighters who should glorify the 
socialist fatherland with grain. 
  Intellectuals across the country, who live and struggle with 
the glory and pride as our party's eternal companions, loyal 
defenders, and good advisers, took an oath of loyalty to bring 
into full bloom the worthwhile life of the revolutionary 
intellectuals, by more firmly rallying around Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, father [oboi] and great teacher [widaehan susung] of 
valuable political life. 
  Youth and students throughout the country, like the young 
communists who followed Hanbyol during the dawning of the Korean 
revolution, took an oath of burning loyalty to live a genuine 
life as the youth vanguards of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il and to create miracles and feats in difficult and tough 
outposts to defend and glorify the socialism of our own style 
centered on the popular masses, that is, the life and living of 
our people. 
  The oath of loyalty taken on the historic February holiday 
is 
the unprecedented expression of infinite respect and loyalty to 
the great leader [yongdoja], who provides our people with the 
most valuable dignity and happiness in the world. The oath of 
loyalty is also the demonstration of the firm faith and fidelity 
of the people of all strata and officers and men of the 
revolutionary Armed Forces to believe and follow Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, who is the fate and loadstar of our nation, like the 
God, and to resolutely defend and glorify the socialism of our 
own style to the end.

  [Text] When the whole country is significantly celebrating 
the February national day as the greatest national felicitous 
day, helicopters of the Air Force of the Korean People's Army 
yesterday conveyed, by order, the party's beneficence gifts to 
children and students at Taehwa Island, Tado Island, Tando 
Island, and Suun Island on the west sea. 
  Students of the people's schools, kindergartens, and nursery 
schools and their parents, who received gifts of love, cried, 
because they were greatly touched by the party's benevolence of 
showing care equally to the students in remote islands, as well 
as to the students on the land. 
  Upholding the great leader's [suryong] noble intent of 
getting the greatest happiness in loving and caring for the 
future generation -- flower of the class, flower of the nation, 
and flower of mankind -- and under our party's benevolence of 
showing all love and consideration for the future of fatherland 
and revolution, helicopters have delivered gifts to 
approximately 80 islands a year for 10 years in February. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il established, without 
sparing money, a school on an island where only one or two 
children live, who should go to the people's school; sent modern 
transport ships there; and provided a helicopter in winter when 
the ship cannot operate. This proud reality is not only the 
great appearance created by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's human-loving politics, but also a clear demonstration 
of the superiority of the socialism of our country centered on 
the popular masses.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held 
here Monday to celebrate the first anniversary of the 
publication of "young people must accomplish the revolutionary 
cause of chuche, upholding the leadership of the party", the 
letter addressed to the 8th Congress of the League of Socialist 
Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song. 
  President Kim Il-song in his historical letter reviewed the 
glorious course of struggle covered by the Korean young people 
and their immortal contributions to the advance of the Korean 
revolution and gave a comprehensive exposition of the fighting 
tasks facing the Korean people and youth to meet the 
requirements of a new, higher stage of the developing revolution 
and ways for their fulfilment. 
  President Kim Il-song said that the young people should 
support the leadership of the party with loyalty, united in one 
mind around Comrade Kim Chong-il, and thoroughly establish the 
party's leadership system in the league. 
  Chairman of the Central Committee of the LSWYK Choe Yong-hae 
in his report at the meeting said that the letter is an immortal 
great programme of the youth movement indicating the way to be 
followed by the socialist youth movement and a highly important 
work giving the conviction of victory and courage to the world's 
revolutionary people and youth. 
  The reporter referred to a new upswing effected in the work 
of the LSWYK and a great change in the ideological and spiritual 
traits through energetic efforts to implement the tasks set 
forth in the letter. 
  "The officials of the LSWYK and the young people are now 
striving hard to prepare themselves to be young vanguards 
defending the party and the leader in the van with their lives 
and lifeguards and death-defying corps defending and glorifying 
Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses, holding 
aloft the slogan `Let us uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with singlehearted unity!' and loudly singing the song 
`No Motherland Without You'", the reporter said, and stressed:

true vanguard fighters unfailingly loyal to the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, united around him in one mind in order to 
carry through the tasks set forth in the historical letter of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song and successfully carry 
forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to completion."

  [Text] A meeting was held at Songchon Mine to deliver a 
thank- you message from the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central 
Committee to the working class, functionaries, and three 
revolutions team members of this mine, who have achieved great 
results in producing nonferrous metallic minerals. 
  Comrade Han Song-yong, member of the Political Bureau of the 
WPK Central Committee and secretary of the party Central 
Committee; functionaries concerned; and employees and three 
revolutions team members of the mine were present at the meeting. 
  At the meeting, Comrade Han Song-yong delivered the WPK 
Central Committee's thank-you message to the working class, 
functionaries, and three revolutions team members of Songchon 
Mine. 
  The thank-you message extended warm gratitude to the entire 
working class, functionaries, and three revolutions team 
members, who have achieved great results in producing nonferrous 
metallic minerals, with revolutionary zeal and creative 
activeness and upholding the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. 
  The thank-you message pointed out: After rising up as one, 
upholding the party's militant appeal, the working class and 
functionaries of Songchon Mine explored and mobilized internal 
reserves and vigorously carried out a movement for technological 
innovation, so that they could achieve proud results, 
overfulfilling last year's production quotas in all indices of 
products. 
  The message noted: With the revolutionary spirit of self- 
relience and fortitude, the working class and functionaries of 
the mine have arranged many high-grade iron ore fields and 
equipped them with various facilities, so that they increased 
the transporting, drilling, and picking capabilities and 
consolidated the material and technological grounds for 
increasing the mineral production. 
  The message noted: By vigorously carrying out a mass 
movement for technological innovation, workers and technicians 
prepared various tool production bases inside the mine, produced 
ore crushers there, and introduced various precious 
technologies, thus actively contributing to increasing the labor 
productivity and developing the national mining in a chuche way. 
  The message highly assessed the working class, 
functionaries, 
and three revolutions team members of Songchon Mine who 
increased the mineral production with fervent loyalty to the 
party and the leader by displaying their revolutionary spirit 
and militant strength, thus making great contribution to 
accelerating the light industrial revolution and elevating the 
people's living standard. 
  The message expressed the firm belief that the working 
class, 
functionaries, and three revolutions team members of Songchon 
Mine will excellently repay the party's great confidence and 
expectations with responsible accomplishment of their 
revolutionary duties in overflowing revolutionary faith and 
optimism and under the party's leadership. 
  Next, Han Il-kun, chief technician of the mine; Yi 
Chong-kil, 
leader of a platoon; Kim Won-sop, member of a three revolutions 
team made speeches to express their resolve. 
  The speakers said that Songchon Mine could achieve great 
results in producing nonferrous metallic minerals because the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il had clearly elucidated the road for the mine and wisely 
led it. They stressed on the need to create a new turning point 
in production, upholding the great leader's New Year's address 
and the decisions made by the 21st plenary session of the Sixth 
WPK Central Committee. 
  They mentioned the need to be firmly armed with our party's 
chuche idea and keep vigorously advancing at the Chollima speed 
of the nineties. They said that based on achieved results, the 
mine will, above all, give priority to drilling, diversify the 
way of transportation, increase the ore-dressing capacity, and 
take measures for supplying materials, so as to normalize the 
production of nonferrous metallic minerals at a high level. 
  They stressed that the mine will produce more minerals by 
actively introducing advanced drilling, picking, and 
ore-dressing methods, and by vigorously carrying out the 
struggle to modernize machinery facilities and processing lines. 
  A resolution was adopted at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Great Vitality of Socialist Rural Theses"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article entitled "Great Vitality of Socialist Rural 
Theses" on the lapse of 30 years since the great leader 
President Kim Il-song published the immortal classical work 
"Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" on 
February 25, 1964. 
  The paper says the rural theses is a perfect programme of 
rural construction which indicates the way of a most successful 
solution of the socialist rural question on the basis of the 
chuche idea. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country' 
authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's 
programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for 
a final solution of the rural question." 
  In the past period the theses has been successfully applied 
to the rural construction in Korea, demonstrating its great 
vitality and proving its greatness, correctness and truth, the 
paper notes, and goes on: 
  The validity and invincible vitality of the rural theses 
lie, 
above all, in that it has powerfully accelerated the 
revolutionization and working-classization of the peasants and 
immensely strengthened the driving force of socialism in the 
countryside. 
  All the agricultural working people in Korea are now firmly 
armed with the great chuche idea of our party and closely 
rallied behind the party and the leader in ideology and purpose 
and in-morality and sense of obligation. They are making 
vigorous efforts to bringing into practice the party's 
far-reaching plan of rural construction, helping and leading 
each other forward under the slogan of collectivism--one for all 
and all for one. This is the noble traits of our peasants. 
  Its validity and vitality are also manifested in that it has 
constantly consolidated the material and technical foundations 
of the rural economy and brought a fresh development of the 
agricultural production. 
  With the successful implementation of the policy of rural 
technical revolution, irrigation and electrification were 
flawlessly completed on a high level long ago and a signal 
progress has been made in mechanization and extensive use of 
chemicals in Korea. 
  Modern means of agricultural science and technique have been 
massively introduced into the rural economy and the most 
advantageous chuche farming method has been applied with the 
result that Korea reaps bumper crops every year. 
  The validity and vitality of the theses are highly displayed 
also in that the level of guidance and management of the rural 
economy has been steadily enhanced and the gap between towns and 
countryside considerably narrowed in all spheres. 
  Thanks to the chuche-based agricultural guidance system with 
the county cooperative farm management committee as its center, 
the guidance and management of the rural economy have been 
improved and the leadership role of the all-people property over 
cooperative property enhanced to eliminate the distinctions 
between the towns and rural areas in ownership and management. 
  The level of the general knowledge of the peasantry and 
their 
technical and cultural standards have been markedly raised with 
the cultural revolution pushed ahead in the countryside, and 
the gap between the towns and the countryside in cultural living 
conditions has been narrowed with the introduction of water and 
bus services into the countryside and the expansion of the TV 
networks to cover it and the conversion of village clinics into 
hospitals. 
  Those proud victory and achievements made in rural 
construction through the successful application of the great 
rural theses in Korea are entirely results of the wise 
leadership of the party and the leader, concludes the article.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- What holds a 
brilliant place in the undying ideological and theoretical feats 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is that he, basing 
himself on the great chuche idea, has, from a new angle, 
developed to perfection the idea of socialism, says NODONG 
SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says scientific accuracy and revolutionary 
nature 
of the chuche-based idea of socialism finds a graphic expression 
in the ideology and theories on the essence of socialist society 
expounded by it. 
  It further says: 
  Our party's chuche-based idea of socialism is the first in 
history to give a clear exposition of the essence of socialist 
society with the popular masses in the centre. 
  The essence of socialist society expounded by the 
chuche-based idea of socialism is, above all, that socialism is 
a society under which the popular masses are the masters of 
everything. 
  It is the socialist society under which all the people have 
valuable socio-political integrity and live a worthy life, 
enjoying genuine political freedom and rights to the full. 
  This is a fundamental characteristic of the socialist 
society 
different from the exploiter society. 
  As the chuche-based idea of socialism expounds that the 
socialist society is the society under which the popular masses 
are the masters of everything, the popular nature of the 
socialist society has become clear. The ideology and theory are 
a weapon that deals a telling blow at the imperialists who are 
engaged in malicious slander against socialism under the cloak 
of bourgeois democracy. 
  The chuche-based idea of socialism also makes clear that 
socialism is a society under which everything serves the popular 
masses. 
  All the policies of the working-class party and state in the 
socialist society proceed from what they should do to provide 
the people with better life, and they are entirely subordinated 
to this purpose. 
  The essence of the socialist society expounded by the 
chuche- 
based idea of socialism is also that socialism is a society that 
is steadily developed by the united efforts of the popular 
masses. 
  The basic characteristic of the socialist society different 
from the exploiter society is that it is a society under which 
the entire people are firmly united on the basis of a single 
ideology and is developed by the united strength of the popular 
masses. 
  The socialist society has socio-political conditions to 
unite 
all the people on the basis of a single ideology for they have 
common purpose and interests. 
  As it definitely achieves the unity and cohesion of the 
entire people, the socialist society gives a strong impetus to 
the development of society. 
  This has vividly been proved by the proud reality of our- 
style socialism that is making a long drive, surmounting all the 
ordeals of history with the might of singlehearted unity. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed to perfection 
from a new angle the socialist idea of chuche and gave a clear 
exposition of the essence of the socialist society. This is a 
noteworthy event of great significance in the accomplishment of 
the Korean people's and world revolutionary people's cause of 
independence, the cause of socialism, stresses the article.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- New-type 
streetcars and metro cars have been manufactured at the Kim 
Chong-tae General Electric Locomotive Enterprise in Pyongyang. 
  Their accessories including the traction motors, elastic 
wheels, electric control devices were domestically eeveloped. 
  The operation of the streetcar is automated and the shock 
from the rails is minimized with the car body supported by many 
elastic devices. 
  Its operation is very safe with three brake systems 
available 
at high and low speed and in emergency. 
  The traction motor being large in capacity, it can draw a 
trailing car. 
  The metro car is automatically operated and its body is 
supported by pneumatic springs to reduce the shock from the 
rails. 
  And the newly developed compressor leaves nothing to be 
desired in the brake system.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- An increasing 
number of people are enjoying longevity in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. 
  The number of persons above 90 last year was five times the 
1980 figure. 
  Many "villages of macrobians" and "long-lived families" can 
be seen in the country. 
  Migam-ri in Kim Hyong-kwon County, Yanggang Province, is 
known as a "village of macrobians", "village of longevity." 
  The life expectancy at birth of the villagers before the 
country's liberation in August 1945 was below 30 due to hunger 
and diseases. Now the village has more than 100 people who have 
been living to the old age of 80. 
  Thirty of them are more than 90 years old. Enjoying the 
prime of youth at sixty and longevity at 90, they help the co-op 
farm in its farm work. 
  Usi County, Chagang Province, is also known for longevity. 
  In the pre-liberation days its residents suffered from 
endemic diseases. There was only one "community doctor" in the 
county. The life expectancy at birth of the county population 
lengthened by more than 40 years compared with the 
pre-liberation days. The county has nearly 30 hospitals and 
clinics. 
  The family of Pak Ki-sop, an old woman aged 108, in 
Najin-Sonbong City is respected as a "long-lived family". She 
has more than seventy children and grandchildren, a number of 
them above 80 years old. Before the liberation of the country 
she lost her husband and five sons and daughters in starvation 
and illness. Now her health is normal on all indices. 
  The state assumes responsibility for the life and health of 
the macrobians and looks after them with particular care. They 
are regularly supplied with tonics and highly nutritious 
foodstuff. All the macrobians are registered at professional 
medical organs and undergo regular medical checkup, and 
prophylactic treatment measures are taken for them. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sends benevolent 
birthday tables to macrobians each on their 100th birthday. 
Last year alone, ten old men and women who greeted their 
centennial birthday, including Kim Kum-sun in central district, 
Pyongyang municipality, and Pak Won-pom in Chungsan County, 
South Pyongan Province, received birthday tables.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Japan will explain new 
market-opening plans to top U.S. trade negotiator Jeffrey Garten 
when he visits Tokyo in early March, a senior trade ministry 
official said Tuesday night [22 February]. Garten, the 
undersecretary of commerce for international trade, has been 
invited by the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) 
to make a speech at a forum March 4. 
  The official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) said Tokyo wants the United States to understand 
its efforts in light of the impasse in bilateral talks on a new 
trade framework. 
  Japan is considering ways to speed up the opening of its 
markets and will hold a meeting of cabinet ministers Friday to 
discuss additional deregulation programs. The new plans will be 
explained to Garten as Japan's initiative to solve the impasse, 
the official said. 
  Garten is a chief negotiator in the area of automobile and 
auto parts under the framework talks. He will be visiting Tokyo 
on his way home from a trip to several Asian countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- The failure of Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to agree on a new trade framework in their recent meeting in 
Washington should not be cause for "panic," Former Vice Foreign 
Minister Hisashi Owada said Wednesday [23 February]. By the 
same token, however, it would be "dangerous" for Japan to adopt 
a business-as-usual approach in its relations with the United 
States, Owada said in an address at a Tokyo hotel. 
  Owada issued the note of caution at a gathering organized by 
the International Friendship Exchange Committee (FEC), a private 
nonprofit organization. "It would not be good to either panic 
or be optimistic, but the worst thing would be to begin acting 
on emotion," he said. 
  Owada blasted what he said was "sensational" media reporting 
about the February 11 meeting that has given a "mistaken" 
impression that bilateral relations are "heading toward a 
crisis" and that a new round of "Japan-bashing" has started in 
the United States. He said that in dealing with the U.S., Japan 
must bear in mind that the Clinton administration came to power 
on a wave of popular sentiment that the new government would 
focus on domestic woes, especially the country's ailing economy. 
  Owada expressed concern that with economic issues at the 
forefront of U.S. policy, government officials in Washington are 
finding it increasingly difficult to consider ties with Japan in 
a "comprehensive" manner, encompassing bilateral cooperation in 
the political and security fields. He suggested that their 
search for an effective way of dealing with the bilateral trade 
dispute, different from unproductive approaches of the past, has 
given rise to the idea of using the political and security 
cooperation as a kind of leverage over economic issues. 
  Owada, who is the father of Crown Princess Masako, also took 
issue with Clinton's recent remarks that none of the 30 or so 
agreements concluded between Japan and the U.S. is functioning 
satisfactorily. "In actuality, this is not the case," he said, 
calling it an example of a "great misunderstanding."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- The government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [23 February] indicated 
it could accept a proposal to agree to nonbinding targets for 
measuring progress in opening Japan's markets to imports. A 
government source said the proposal aired Tuesday by ruling 
coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, "is one idea." 
  "What is important is not to make (the targets) binding," 
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  Ozawa, the de facto head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), 
the key force in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, said Tuesday 
he believed Japan could accept "endeavor targets" to assess its 
compliance with trade agreements. Ozawa made the comment in a 
meeting with foreign journalists, according to the associated 
press. 
  The AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS] report quoted Ozawa as saying 
Japan 
only should agree to such targets only if the United States 
agreed not to penalize Japan for failing to meet them. "If we 
weren't able to meet the goals and the U.S. side quickly turned 
to trade sanctions, that wouldn't be right," he was quoted as 
saying. 
  Earlier this month, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
met in Washington but failed to strike a deal on ways to slash 
Japan's trade surpluses with the United States. At that time, 
Japan rejected a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure 
the openness of its markets to imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa voiced anxiety Wednesday that trade conflicts between 
Tokyo and Washington may take place "one after another" unless 
Japan significantly reduces its trade surplus with the United 
States. 
  Hosokawa made the remarks during a session of the House of 
Councillors Budget Committee before it passed the third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. The extra budget was 
finally approved as it was passed at the plenary session of the 
upper house. 
  The premier said the U.S. has been "irritated" by its trade 
deficits with Japan of more than 50 billion dollars annually. 
"I am afraid similar problems may repeatedly occur one after 
another unless signs of improvement come out visibly," said 
Hosokawa, referring to a U.S. announcement last week which 
unveiled steps to impose sanctions against Japan in a dispute 
over access to the Japanese cellular phone market. 
  The announcement was made a few days after Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new 
framework to slash Japan's trade surplus. 
  Hosokawa said he wants to find a way to solve the trade 
imbalance, stressing the importance of relations between Japan 
and the U.S. "We should make every effort to stabilize 
Japan-U.S. relations. It is not only a bilateral relationship 
but has impacts on Asia and Pacific regions," Hosokawa said, 
adding the U.S. presence in the region gives a sense of security 
to other countries in the region. 
  The prime minister also said he is aiming for an alliance of 
ruling parties to compete with the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election of the House 
of Representatives. He said the seven ruling parties cannot win 
the election if they field separate candidates. 
  Hosokawa, however, denied he is after a two-party system. "I 
have said Japanese politics will become a moderate multiparty 
system, not a two-party system. I still think so," he said. 
  The prime minister reportedly wants to remove Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who is opposed to the two-party 
system. 
  Takemura and former SDP [Social Democratic Party] Chairman 
Sadao Yamahana, also state minister in charge of political 
reform, voiced their support during the session for a multiparty 
system. 
  Hosokawa said he will decide whether to reshuffle the 
cabinet 
after hearing the opinion of governmental and ruling parties' 
officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- The Tokyo headquarters of 
U.S. electronics giant Motorola Inc. has been sprayed with 
anti-American graffiti amid growing calls from Washington to 
open up Japanese markets, police said Monday [21 February]. 
White and green paint was sprayed on the walls of Nippon 
Motorola Ltd., the Japanese subsidiary of Motorola in central 
Tokyo, to create slogans such as "(We Are) Against America" and 
"(We'll) Crush the Hard-Selling Diplomacy of U.S. Imperialists." 
  The graffiti covered an area of two meters by 1.4 meters. An 
unidentified man called the Tokyo media around 4 A.M., saying 
the Motorola building has been defaced. 
  The United States said last week it would impose sanctions 
against Japan by raising tariffs in a dispute over Motorola's 
access to the cellular phone market in Japan. Washington 
accused Japan of breaching a 1989 trade accord meant to boost 
imports of U.S. cellular phones and said it will retaliate by 
raising tariffs on Japanese telecommunications products and 
possible other products.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Japan's automobile industry 
will adopt an auto import program for the private sector in an 
effort to defuse trade friction with the United States, the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said Wednesday [23 
February]. But Yutaka Kume, chairman of the association, said 
the industry has no plan to introduce "objective criteria," 
which the U.S. has been demanding. 
  Kume said some auto companies in Japan can provide figures 
each year for auto parts purchases, but they should not announce 
how much they will buy in the future as it will be regarded by 
the U.S. as a "promise." 
  Kume made the remarks at a press conference in Tokyo 
concerning the failure in the bilateral economic "framework" 
trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. Autos and auto parts are one of three 
priority areas of the talks. 
  As for marketing of imported cars in Japan, Kume said the 
Japanese industry should launch a public relations project 
concerning Japan's auto sales "to make the U.S. understand that 
Japanese automakers don't control dealers."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- U.S. Rice is proving 
popular on Japan's unofficial rice market, trading at 550-580 
yen per kilogram, nearly double the price sold by the government 
to wholesalers, rice traders said Wednesday [23 February]. 
  Rice imported from China is also fetching similar prices as 
both Chinese and California rice are close in taste to the 
medium short- grain Japanese staple, according to Beikoku Data 
Bank, a private market research agency. 
  Earlier this month, the government began selling rice 
imported from China, Thailand and the United States to cope with 
a shortfall caused by a poor harvest last year. 
  Thai rice, a long-grain variety, has proven less popular 
with 
the Japanese. 
  According to Beikoku Data Bank, Thai rice is traded at 70-90 
yen per kilogram on distribution channels outside official 
markets, way below the 199 yen at which the government sold the 
product to wholesalers. 
  Faced with the unpopularity of Thai rice, the Food Agency 
has 
said it will begin selling a blend of rice imported from China, 
the U.S. and Thailand.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan has signed for about 
60 percent of rice imports required for this year, agriculture 
minister Eijiro Hata said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  "Importation of about 60 percent of 1.7 million tons (the 
government) is scheduled to import from now on this year is now 
in sight," Hata told a press conference. 
  According to the Food Agency, Japan has imported about 
445,000 tons of rice since last November. 
  In the wake of the worst harvest since the 1950s, the 
government decided last year to import rice on an emergency 
basis, mostly from the United States, China and Thailand.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Science and Technology 
Agency head Satsuki Eda said Tuesday [22 February] the Japanese 
Government expressed through diplomatic channels its regret that 
Moscow plans not to accept an international ban on the dumping 
of nuclear waste at sea. 
  "Even though all nations that had originally hesitated to 
accept (the ban) have all fallen in step with the comprehensive 
ban (on dumping), it is regrettable that only Russia remains out 
of step," Eda told a press conference after a cabinet meeting. 
  Eda said Japan will continue to urge Moscow to accept the 
dumping ban and offer technological cooperation in helping 
Russia to manage and store its nuclear waste. 
  Russia registered its noncompliance on Friday to an 
amendment 
to the London Convention on Sea Pollution and will be the only 
country of 72 signatories of the treaty to continue dumping 
nuclear waste at sea. 
  Belgium, Britain, China and France, along with Russia, had 
abstained on voting for the amendment when it was introduced 
last November at a meeting of the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO). 
  IMO officials said Monday that all of the countries, except 
Russia, have now accepted the international ban. 
  The amendment was prompted by Russia's dumping of a large 
quantity of liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan last 
October.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia in March for talks with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Japanese officials said Tuesday 
[22 February]. The deputy foreign ministers of the two 
countries, Hiroshi Fukuda and Aleksandr Panov, agreed on Hata's 
visit during two days of meetings in Moscow that ended Tuesday, 
the officials said. 
  The concrete schedule for Hata's visit will be set through 
diplomatic channels, they said. 
  The officials said Fukuda and Panov have agreed to promote 
political dialogue between the two countries and continue talks 
on a decades-long territorial dispute over four Russian-held 
islands claimed by Japan. The territorial row involves Etorofu, 
Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets, which the 
former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II. 
  During the talks in Moscow, Panov welcomed a proposal by 
Fukuda to invite a group of Russian parliamentarians and a team 
of Russian youths in the Russian Far East to Japan, the 
officials said. Details of the trips will be set through 
further talks between the two sides, they said. 
  Russia's INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported Japan has reaffirmed 
support for Russia's policy of reforms. 
  Interfax quoted Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigory 
Karasin as saying agreement was also reached on how to 
coordinate effort to boost economic cooperation between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- A senior Japanese police 
official will leave for South Korea on Wednesday [23 February] 
for two days of consultations on crime-related issues, as well 
as security arrangements for a March visit to Japan by South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, police officials said Tuesday. 
  The officials said National Police Agency Deputy Director 
General Koji Kunimatsu will sound out possibilities of 
cooperation in dealing with such problems as Korean pickpocket 
gangs in Japan, some of them armed with knives. 
  The two sides will also consider security arrangements in 
preparation for the South Korean leader's March 24-26 visit to 
Japan, they said. 
  The visit will be the first to South Korea by such a 
high-ranking Japanese police official since Kunimatsu's 
predecessor went there in 1988 just after the Seoul Olympics.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday [23 February] for a 
nine-day official visit aimed at beefing up economic ties, 
friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries. 
  Zhu is the first top Chinese Government official to travel 
to 
Japan since the coalition administration of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa came to power last August, officials said. He 
will have talks with Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
as well as meeting three former premiers -- Noboru Takeshita, 
Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa -- and business leaders during 
his stay until March 3, the officials said. 
  "Last year Sino-Japanese trade volume hit an historical 
record of 39 billion dollars, an increase of 54 percent over the 
previous year," Zhu told reporters before leaving Beijing. 
"With this Japan has surpassed Hong Kong as China's largest 
trading partner and China has became the second largest trading 
partner of Japan," he said. 
  "This year is a crucial year for China in building a 
socialist market economy," said Zhu, who is concurrently 
governor of China's central bank. 
  "This also is an important time for Japan to take major 
administrative measures to rejuvenate its national economy. 
Therefore, I believe both sides have the interest and the need 
to hold mutually beneficial exchanges and discussions," he added. 
  During the visit, the vice premier will also travel to 
Osaka, 
Kagawa and Fukuoka prefectures in western and southwestern Japan 
to take a firsthand look at corporate activities there. 
  Zhu said upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda Airport that his 
Japan trip is aimed at deepening mutual understanding and 
promoting cooperation and friendship between the two countries. 
  "Bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have already 
entered a new stage of development through common efforts by the 
two governments and the peoples," Zhu said. To further 
strengthen such ties will be beneficial for the Japanese and 
Chinese peoples in the long term and will also contribute to the 
peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and 
the world, he said.

  [Text] Kagoshima, Feb. 20 KYODO -- Maritime Safety Agency 
officials arrested five Chinese on Saturday [19 February] for 
alleged illegal entry into Japan. 
  The five men were detained during a search of the Min Shi 
Liao 2753, a 127-ton fishing boat from China's coastal Fujian 
Province, which had been anchoring some 1.2 kilometers southwest 
of Yokoate- Jima, agency officials said. 
  The five are alleged to have come ashore on Yokoate-Jima, a 
tiny uninhabited island in the Tokara Islands Chain south of 
Kyushu. 
  A passing fishing boat had seen the men setting foot on the 
island and reported them to the agency. 
  The suspects, who reportedly confessed to the allegations, 
were sent to Naze on Amami Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, for 
further questioning, the officials said. Crew members said the 
vessel stopped near the island because of engine trouble.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Japan lodged a protest 
Wednesday [23 February] against Greece for its decision to close 
a major port to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]), and called on the nation to solve the 
problem through negotiations, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Shigeru Tsumura, deputy director general of the European and 
Oceanian Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, lodged the 
protest with Greek Ambassador to Japan Yeoryios Sioris, the 
officials said. Tsumura told Sioris Japan is concerned that 
Greece's decision would have a negative influence on peace and 
stability in the Balkan region, the officials said. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced last 
Wednesday it would ban neighboring Macedonia from using the 
Greek port of Salonika, its second largest port, for all but 
humanitarian purposes. The decision was the latest development 
involving Skopje, the capital of the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, which declared independence in 1991. 
  Greece has claimed that the republic's use of the historical 
Greek name "Macedonia" as well as its use of historic Greek 
emblems on its flag, implies territorial claims against the 
northern Greek province of Macedonia. 
  Japan is concerned that conflicts in Bosnia will spread to 
other regions of the former Yugoslavia and so considers it 
important to solve problems involving Albanians in Macedonia, 
Tsumura was quoted as telling Sioris. 
  Tsumura also said Japan is considering offering economic 
assistance to Macedonia, which is affected by U.N. sanctions on 
Serbia and Montenegro, saying economic development and 
improvement of living standards there are essential to maintain 
political stability, they said. 
  Greece issued a statement of protest with Japan in December 
when it gave official recognition to Macedonia.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Honda Motor Co. is 
considering production of four-wheel [drive] vehicles in Mexico, 
a Honda official said Wednesday [23 February]. 
  The move is apparently designed to capitalize on the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which allows companies to 
make good use of cheaper labor costs in Mexico for production of 
products for export to the United States and Canada. 
  The official said, however, Honda has yet to make a decision 
on when to start production, the scale of production and models 
to be made. 
  Honda now produces motorcycles and automobile parts at a 
plant in Guadalajara, west of Mexico City. 
  The big three U.S. automakers, Volkswagen AG of Germany and 
Japan's Nissan Motor Co. have already established auto 
manufacturing plants in Mexico.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Benin President Nicephore 
Soglo chatted with Emperor Akihito on Tuesday [22 February] at 
the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, officials said. 
  Following an audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko, Soglo attended a court luncheon hosted by the emperor, 
Imperial Household Agency officials said. 
  The empress, who has suffered speech difficulties since last 
October, did not attend the lunch. Crown Prince Naruhito and 
his wife Princess Masako were in attendance. 
  Soglo arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day visit to 
seek 
Japanese political and economic support for his nation. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Soglo on Monday that 
Japan will give the African republic 1.11 billion yen in 
economic assistance. 
  Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is 
a 
former French colony that became independent in 1960. It was 
renamed from Dahomey in 1975.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 22 KYODO -- An amendment to the 
schedule for air services between Japan and Indonesia was signed 
here Tuesday [22 February], the Japanese Embassy in Jakarta said. 
  The amendment was signed by Japanese Ambassador to 
Indonesia, 
Kimio Fujita, and Wisber Loeis [name as received] of the 
Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  It is now possible for Japanese airlines to exercise traffic 
rights for their own stopover passengers between Jakarta and 
Denpasar from April 1, 1994. 
  After the Kansai International Airport opens, Indonesian 
Airlines will be able to extend air services to Tokyo, Nagoya, 
Osaka and Fukuoka. 
  Flights between Japan and Indonesia have been conducted on 
the basis of an agreement signed between the two countries on 
January 23, 1962. The schedule has previously been amended in 
1965, 1970, 1987 and 1990. 
  The latest amendment is designed to cope with the increasing 
demand for flights between Japan and Indonesia to cope with an 
increase of tourists to Bali in particular, and to help the 
Indonesian Government promote tourism.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- A top Postal Ministry 
official on Wednesday [23 February] reversed his position on 
high-definition television (HDTV) development, saying the 
ministry will continue to support an analog HDTV system 
developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp (NHK). 
  Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting 
Administration Bureau at the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, told reporters Tuesday his ministry will 
promote the development of a digital HDTV system to replace 
NHK's hi-vision system. 
  The remark stirred protests from Japanese consumer 
electronics companies, which are already selling hi-vision 
television sets. 
  Egawa said Wednesday the ministry supports the continuation 
of NHK's experimental hi-vision broadcasts, to be followed by 
full broadcasts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- A senior Posts Ministry 
official on Wednesday [23 February] retracted earlier remarks in 
favor of a digital high-definition television (HDTV) system in 
place of the current analog format. 
  The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will continue to 
support the muse analog HDTV system developed by public 
broadcaster Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Akimasa Egawa, 
director general at the ministry's Broadcasting Administration 
Bureau, told a press conference. But he added the general trend 
shows Japan's HDTV formats will eventually move toward a 
digital-based system. 
  A final decision on the matter should be made after studying 
the interests of consumers, electronic makers and other parties 
concerned, with an eye toward the next century, he said. 
  The consumer electronic industry was baffled by Egawa's 
remarks on Tuesday calling for a switch from the analog to a 
digital system in signal transmission for the next-generation 
television. 
  The remarks, apparently designed to unify Japan's HDTV 
format 
with the global trend, came at a time when NHK is already 
offering HDTV broadcasting programs under an analog format named 
"hi-vision." Electronics makers have put enormous amounts of 
money into its development. 
  Egawa's remarks drew fire from many sectors -- NHK, makers, 
retailers and consumers who have already purchased hi-vision 
televisions. 
  Egawa said his remarks do not reflect what he really meant. 
  The Posts Ministry will allow NHK to continue with 
experimental analog HDTV broadcasting in the future, he said. 
He said the ministry will promote hi-vision broadcasting using 
a broadcasting satellite set for launch next year, in line with 
a report prepared last year by the radio regulatory council, an 
advisory body to the posts and telecommunications minister. 
  Hi-vision broadcasting will continue at least until 2007, 
the 
year when the satellite's life comes to an end, Egawa said. As 
for a switch to digitalization, he said the ministry will come 
up with some proposal by this summer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Health and Welfare Minister 
Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 
said Tuesday [22 February] he is opposed to a cabinet reshuffle 
aimed at dumping Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  A cabinet reshuffle specifically designed to remove certain 
cabinet ministers would shake the foundation of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, Ouchi told a news conference. 
  He was alluding to the campaign by Hosokawa, Shinseito 
co-leader Ichiro Ozawa and others in the ruling coalition to get 
rid of Takemura, the government's top spokesman. 
  The premier and the others have differed with Takemura over 
Hosokawa's plan to introduce a so-called "national welfare tax" 
to replace the consumption tax, the future of Japanese politics 
and other key issues, political sources say. 
  The Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the 
seven-party coalition government, has also expressed 
reservations about an early reshuffling of the cabinet, which 
Hosokawa and his backers say may come later this month.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura will probably remain in the cabinet after a 
reshuffle that could take place as early as next week, a senior 
official of his Sakigake (Harbinger) Party said Wednesday [23 
February]. The 14 Sakigake members in the House of 
Representatives met to discuss how to respond to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to reorganize his cabinet, said the 
official, who spoke on condition anonymity. 
  Another official of Sakigake, which Takemura leads, told 
reporters the party may break up if he declines to accept a 
different cabinet post. 
  The mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN reported in its Wednesday 
morning edition that Takemura does not intend to accept a 
different cabinet post and is determined to leave the cabinet if 
he is sacked as chief cabinet secretary. 
  Hosokawa has indicated a desire to reorganize the 
six-month-old coalition cabinet at an early date and many 
political sources say the cabinet reshuffle is targeted at 
removing Takemura from his present key post. 
  The ASAHI said the prime minister has asked if Takemura 
could 
assume the post of foreign minister in place of Tsutomu Hata who 
would in turn take over as chief cabinet secretary. 
  The largest national daily, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, reported 
that Hosokawa has decided to carry out the cabinet reshuffle 
early next week. The YOMIURI said Hosokawa aims to sack 
Takemura as chief cabinet secretary and Hirohisa Fujii as 
finance minister, and also solicit Social Democratic Party [SDP] 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama into the cabinet. 
  The SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties, has 
opposed an early cabinet reshuffle. But Shinseito and Komeito 
have offered support for the plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 KYODO -- The government will move to 
deregulate the domestic broadcasting business, scrapping curbs 
on television and radio companies listing stock, government 
sources said Saturday [19 February]. 
  An advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications 
ministry will publish Monday a set of recommendations calling 
for wide- ranging deregulations on broadcasting firms, the 
sources said. 
  The centerpiece of the panel recommendations is a proposal 
to 
allow broadcasters to list their stock as freely as ordinary 
companies. 
  The ministry will adopt the proposal and lift the current 
restrictions on stock listing in March, the sources said. 
  To protect the broadcasting industry against intervention by 
outside capitals, the government imposes a virtual ban on 
Japanese broadcasting companies' going public, based on a 
revision in the commercial code in 1966. 
  The firms are currently required by the ministry, which 
issues licenses for broadcasting, to set a corporate rule that 
mandates an approval of the board for selling its shares. 
  Among the 189 broadcasting firms throughout the nation, only 
five are presently on the stock exchange, as they were already 
listed before 1966. 
  The new rule would give broadcasting companies full 
discretion over its stock listing, according to the sources. 
  They said the panel will also suggest allowing local 
broadcasting firms to expand into areas beyond local boundaries. 
  A restriction that forbids a company that holds a 
broadcasting station from holding more than 10 percent of shares 
in another broadcasting firm may also be eased, they said. 
  "The move will no doubt provide a favorable boost for the 
broadcasting companies that are considering stock listing," said 
a senior official of a major network.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Broadcasting firms should 
be allowed to list their stocks publicly, an advisory panel to 
the Posts and Telecommunications Minister said Monday [21 
February]. 
  The current law that restricts broadcasting firms from going 
public should be lifted to let them procure funds in the 
multimedia age, the panel said in its report of recommendations. 
  Among other recommendations made in the nine-point proposal 
is the slight easing of a rule prohibiting one company from 
owning several broadcasting companies. 
  The panel also recommended that laws be reviewed to make 
television broadcasting across country borders possible, and 
that firms' broadcasting areas be enlargened. 
  The Posts and Telecommuncations Ministry is likely to lift 
the stock-listing restriction in March and ease the rule on 
prohibiting ownership of several broadcasting firms within this 
year.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- The House of Councillors 
Budget Committee on Wednesday [23 February] approved a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to help finance the 
government's latest economic stimulus measures. 
  The extra budget will become law later in the day after 
being

Representatives passed the budget program on Tuesday. 
  The third extra budget calls for a spending increase of some 
2.19 trillion yen over the second supplementary budget. 
  It will help finance the largest-ever pump-priming package 
of 
15.25 trillion yen, and increases the overall general account 
budget for the current fiscal year ending March 31 to about 
77.44 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Japan's overall wholesale 
price index [WPI] in the first 10 days of February declined 0.2 
percent from January 21-31, the Bank of Japan said Tuesday [22 
February]. 
  The February 1-10 WPI stood at 93.8 against 100 in the base 
year 1990. It was down 2.9 percent from a year earlier. 
  The domestic WPI, on which the central bank keeps a close 
eye, was unchanged from late January but fell 1.9 percent from a 
year earlier. The index was 97.5. 
  The central bank said prices of steel and electric 
appliances 
dropped due to sluggish demand, while those of pork and eggs 
rose because of a supply shortage and textile goods prices 
increased due to higher costs of imported materials. 
  The export price index gained 0.1 percent from late January 
and 4.7 percent year on year on a contract currency basis to 
stand at 104.7. Officials said higher prices of electric 
equipment pushed up the figure. 
  In terms of yen, the index dropped 1.2 percent from the 
preceding 11 days and 3.8 year on year to stand at 84.2, 
affected by the appreciation of the yen against major currencies. 
  The import price index on a contract currency basis gained 
0.2 percent from late January but slipped 3.0 percent from a 
year before to 93.2. Prices of food and miscellaneous products 
went down, while those of primary aluminum and cotton were 
higher. 
  In yen terms, the index fell 0.8 percent from late January 
and 11.5 percent from a year before to 73.2.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Sales by commercial 
enterprises for 1993 decreased 4.0 percent from the previous 
year to 673,456 billion yen, marking the second consecutive 
yearly fall for the first time during the current recession, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said 
Wednesday [23 February]. 
  Sales by wholesalers totaled 537.08 trillion yen, down 4.1 
percent, while those by retail stores came to 136,376 billion 
yen, down 3.8 percent. 
  Wholesalers and retailers both incurred a drop for the 
second 
year running for the first time since statistics were taken in 
1953, MITI said. 
  A MITI official attributed the poor performance by 
wholesalers to falling fuel and materials prices due to the 
strong yen, as well as sluggish personal spending and slack 
corporate capital spending, particularly by manufacturers. 
  Retailers were affected by an increasing consumer tendency 
for buying bargain-priced products and a drop in import prices 
amid the strong yen, the official said. 
  On a quarterly basis, sales by wholesalers dropped 3.1 
percent in the October-December quarter from a year before, 
which was also attributable to the strong yen. 
  The fourth-quarter sales by retailers fell 3.5 percent, 
affected by an unusually warm winter, MITI said. 
  Business performance among both wholesalers and retailers is 
expected to remain stagnant in the near future, the official 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Major Japanese steelmakers 
are curtailing operations of their blast furnaces to increase 
cutbacks in pig-iron production amid a prolonged steel market 
slump, industry sources said Wednesday [23 February]. 
  Pig iron is a direct product from blast furnaces and is 
refined to produce steel or remelted into special shapes. 
  The sources said, however, steelmakers are reluctant to shut 
down their furnaces, because once closed down it would cost more 
than 10 billion yen and take several months to restart. 
  Kawasaki Steel Corp.'s mill in Chiba, east of Tokyo, is 
running only two blast furnaces at reduced operation rates. 
  They said Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kobe Steel Ltd., 
Nippon Steel Corp. and NKK Corp. are running their blast 
furnaces at reduced operation rates, but they are still higher 
than Kawasaki Steel's cutbacks. 
  Nippon Steel and NKK export surplus pig iron to South Korea 
and Taiwan, the sources said. 
  If an oversupply in pig iron continues, the companies would 
have no choice but to consider shutting down the furnaces, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The government will not 
raise the guaranteed minimum price paid to farmers for milk for 
use for butter and other dairy products in fiscal 1994, Japan's 
farm minister said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata 
told 
reporters no such raise is being considered to deal with the 
scheduled conversion of nontariff barriers into tariffs for milk 
imports as agreed on at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks in December. 
  A ministry advisory panel, the Livestock Industry Promotion 
Council, is expected to decide next month on the price for the 
year beginning April 1. 
  Farmers' organizations are calling for a raise in the price 
they receive for milk, currently 76.75 yen per kilogram, in the 
face of expected competition with imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 20 KYODO -- The number of foreigners 
coming to Japan in search of employment as technical or cultural 
experts has more than doubled since 1988, reaching 8,682 
applicants in 1992, the Justice Ministry said Sunday [20 
February]. 
  While more companies are hiring foreigners to satisfy their 
needs for special expertise or to make use of their differing 
cultural backgrounds, the trend also shows that "Japan's labor 
market has become attractive (to foreigners)," the ministry's 
Immigration Bureau said. 
  A total of 9,445 foreigners received residence status as 
"technical" or "cultural" experts in international business in 
1992. 
  More than 80 percent of the 7,336 foreigners who could be 
contacted for statistical purposes were in their 20s or 30s, and 
nearly 70 percent were men. By country, 2,750 came from the 
United States, followed by 1,157 from China and 757 from Britain. 
  A majority of the foreigners were working as language 
teachers at various kinds of schools. Computer-related jobs, 
commerce and trade were other areas in which many foreigners 
were working.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- South Korean officials 
were hopeful Wednesday [23 February] morning that the United 
States and North Korea would be able to conclude their talks on 
Pyongyang's resumption of nuclear inspections. 
  Pyongyang and Washington were reportedly negotiating details 
at the New York meeting that began early Wednesday (Korean 
Standard Time), specifically how and when the two Koreas will 
reopen dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States 
will announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team 
Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level 
talks. 
  The U.S. State Department maintains that on the same day 
that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin 
in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume. 
  Simultaneously, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for 
the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be 
announced. 
  Pyongyang and Washington are said to exchange non-paper 
[word 
as received] on contents of their agreement at the end of the 
talks, expected to last until later in the afternoon.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States met at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday 
to discuss holding a third round of high-level talks and nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  After the working-level contact, North Korean representative 
Ho Chong said it would resume one and a half hours later, but 
his U.S. counterpart Tom Hubbard was uncertain if they would 
meet again the same day. Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North 
Korean mission to the United Nations, led his country's 
delegation while Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of 
state for Asian and Pacific affairs, headed the American team. 
  Hubbard said he hoped the contact would resume, adding that 
issuing visas to the IAEA inspectors was yet to be worked out by 
North Korea and the nuclear watchdog. Hubbard said he urged 
North Korea to allow nuclear inspections as soon as possible, 
which means Pyongyang should issue visas for the inspection 
team. He said the issuance of visas was unlikely to be a big 
problem. 
  Apart from the visa issue, the two sides held serious 
discussions on the future direction of U.S.-North Korean 
dialogue, according to Hubbard. He said that holding the third 
round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang 
depends on whether or not the IAEA is allowed to inspect North 
Korea's nuclear sites. He added that the United States would 
continue to strive for the high-level talks, but said unsolved 
problems remained. 
  Ho, for his part, said he must discuss something with his 
home government in Pyongyang. 
  C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the U.S. 
State Department, accompanied Hubbard while Han Song-yol, 
councilor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations, 
attended with Ho.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States parted earlier than expected after a single 
nuclear negotiating session in New York and are likely to meet 
again Thursday, South Korean officials said Wednesday. 
  Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the 
United Nations, and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Tom Hubbard met for 90 minutes and were expected to resume talks 
after a break, but they did not, the officials said. The 
meeting reportedly ended early when North Korea demanded that 
the terms of the Pyongyang-Washington agreement be written down 
on paper. 
  American officials said they needed to consult among 
themselves on whether to accept the demand. 
  Pyongyang and Washington reportedly negotiated the accord's 
details, specifically how and when the two Koreas will reopen 
dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States will 
announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team 
Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level 
talks. 
  The U.S. State Department maintains that around the time 
that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin 
in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume. 
After that, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be 
announced. 
  Seoul officials said that despite repeated promises by 
Washington on these terms, Pyongyang wants a more concrete 
commitment. 
  The two sides are not expected to exchange official 
documents 
on the agreement they are working on, but are likely to write 
down the accord's major points on non-official paper, they said. 
  Although North Korea and the United States will meet again 
on 
Thursday, final and immediate agreement cannot be expected since 
the North Korean negotiators need time to consult with their 
home government, according to the officials. 
  Chances are, therefore, that the IAEA inspection team will 
arrive in Pyongyang next Monday since the only remaining flight 
to Pyongyang from Beijing is this Saturday.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
informed the U.S. Government that it will issue visas soon for 
members of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspection team, it was reported here Wednesday. 
  The news came at a working-level contact held in New York 
Wednesday between Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's 
mission to the United Nations, and Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant 
secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, diplomatic 
sources said. Ho told Hubbard that Pyongyang would issue visas 
for the IAEA inspectors as soon as possible, the sources said. 
  In this connection, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher said Wednesday that he believed North Korea would 
allow the IAEA team to inspect seven reported nuclear sites in 
Yongbyon soon. 
  State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said that Pyongyang 
had told the IAEA it would welcome the inspection team's visit. 
  At the meeting in New York, North Korea is understood to 
have 
relayed a reply from Kang Sok-chu, its representative at the 
first two rounds of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, to a 
letter from his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci, assistant 
secretary of state for political and military affairs. 
  The sources noted that the two sides have already agreed 
that 
the U.S. and South Korean Governments would announce the 
suspension of the joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and set 
the date for the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks after the IAEA inspection and resumption of inter-Korean 
dialogue. 
  If South and North Korea agree to exchange special envoys, 
Washington plans to hold further high-level talks with Pyongyang 
in mid-March, the sources said. And with North Korea's 
professed willingness to issue visas for the IAEA inspectors, 
the team would likely arrive in Pyongyang early next week at the 
latest, barring any unexpected developments in the meantime, the 
sources added.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Seoul urged the American 
Embassy here Wednesday to begin negotiations on paying rent for 
its facilities and on exactly when the installations became 
legally exempt from free use by the United States. 
  Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin met with Charles 
Kartman, a minister at the U.S. Embassy, and delivered a note 
explaining Seoul's position on the status of disputed facilities 
that include the embassy compound downtown and embassy staff 
residence quarters in Yongsan. It is the first time that the 
Seoul government has requested overall negotiations on all the 
facilities in question. 
  The Board of Audit and Inspection ruled last summer that the 
U.S. Embassy must pay rent for one of its twin buildings 
formerly occupied by American AID [Agency for International 
Development] organizations. The board said that since the AID 
organizations have left South Korea, there is no legal basis for 
rent exemption. 
  The embassy agreed in principle that its rent-free status 
has 
ended, but not on when it expired. The embassy took over the 
building on Oct. 1, 1980. 
  Seoul also demands negotiations on relocating embassy staff 
quarters in Yongsan Army Base since the South Korea-U.S. Status 
of Forces Agreement (SOFA) bars use of the American military 
base for non-military purposes.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Kil-u] </F>
  [Text] With North Korea's acceptance of the nuclear 
inspection, the possibility of South-North economic cooperation 
has enhanced. Thus, business circles are showing active moves 
to expand trade and investment in North Korea. 
  Conglomerates that have received invitations from North 
Korea 
or have applied to visit North Korea including Hyundai, Samsung, 
Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold Star are aiming at once again examining 
their North Korean-related business projects that have been laid 
aside. 
  In 1993, Daewoo received approval from the National 
Unification Board to carry out South-North economic cooperation. 
When Daewoo Chairman Kim U-chung visited North Korea in 1992, 
he met then-Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon and concluded a contract 
to promote nine pilot projects. Therefore, if the opportunity 
comes, Daewoo is ready to jump into the projects with North 
Korea. 
  In particular, Daewoo is planning first of all to start the 
project of developing the Nampo complex which is near Pyongyang 
and only five minutes away from the sea. 
  Rather than concentrating on heavy industry, Daewoo's 
strategy is to actively use North Korea's cheap labor to produce 
textile products and daily necessities of life such as blouses, 
jackets, and bags. 
  Based on the economic cooperation established with China, 
Samsung is showing high interest in the Tumen River development 
project; the road construction linking Jilin Province, China and 
Chongjin; and the project to develop Najin-Sonbong. 
  It was learned that in this connection, about one month ago, 
Samsung invited officials of the Jilin Provincial team dealing 
with economic cooperation between China and North Korea to the 
ROK and held deep discussions on jointly developing key 
industries such as railway, road, harbor, and communications. 
  It was learned that during the meeting a Chinese official 
said: "North Korea conveyed through an unofficial channel to 
China of the position that it will be possible for businesses 
advancing into North Korea to operate and possess property in a 
capitalistic way." 
  Samsung is also promoting at the same time the establishment 
of joint venture plants in producing sweaters, foodstuff, and 
electronic products. 
  Hyundai's Honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong visited North 
Korea in 1989 and held discussions on the development of making 
North Korea's Mt. Kumgang and Myongsasimni tourist attractions 
and on the Wonsan Bay railway project. Currently, it is 
promoting large-scale projects. It is also promoting to 
establish a cotton textile plant. 
  Lucky-Gold Star has been producing and selling working 
clothes and men's suits in the form of processing-on-commission 
trade in North Korea from 1993. In the long run, Lucky-Gold 
Star's goal is to advance into North Korea in the field of 
electricity, electronics, and synthetic fiber which are its main 
business forces. 
  Sunkyong is promoting to establish a joint venture marine 
products processing plant, and a clothing and sewing plant. 
Ssangyong is promoting to establish a joint venture shoe plant 
and marine products processing plant. 
  Forty other domestic businesses including Miwon, Hyosong, 
and 
Kolon are planning to carry out foodstuff business and 
establishment of department stores and textile plants in North 
Korea. 
  An official of Lucky-Gold Star said: "The greatest barrier 
in economic cooperation with North Korea is the fact that 
businessmen and technicians are not able to go to North Korea. 
Since economic cooperation is dependent on the political 
situation, there is no stability in investment."

  [Text] South Korea authorized 622 contacts between its 
people and North Koreans for business purposes over the past 
four years, according to official figures. But only 168 
contacts, or 27 percent of those approved, took place as the 
others did not due to lack of their preparations or refusal by 
North Koreans to meet. 
  One hundred and eleven contacts were made in China, mostly 
in 
Beijing and Shenyang, 33 in Hong Kong, 15 in Japan and nine in 
other countries, the National Unification Board [NUB] said in 
its "White Paper on Unification" released yesterday. 
  The ratio of actual contacts to total authorized 
applications 
declined from 39 percent in 1990 and 1991, 27 percent in 1992 
and 21 percent last year, apparently in line with the growing 
tensions between the two halves of the peninsula. 
  As far as the number of applications was concerned, small 
and 
medium industrialists were more inclined to inter-Korean 
contacts. A total of 516 applications came from small and medium 
companies and 137 from large ones. 
  Since the enactment of the Law on South-North Exchange and 
Cooperation in 1990 through last year-end, the NUB said, 419 
South Korean businessmen met with North Koreans in the 168 cases. 
  They were part of the 3,088 South Koreans who made contacts 
with North Koreans in 838 cases on various occasions such as 
academic forums, family reunions and business during the period. 
  Those who visited the other side of their fatherland 
numbered 
1,270 on 38 occasions, largely consisting of the several rounds 
of prime ministers' talks, each attended by a total of 100 
negotiators, support personnel and newsmen. 
  Economic cooperation, which started in October 1988 with the 
capitalist South lifting its trade embargo in the wake of the 
successful hosting of the Seoul Olympic Games, cooled later in 
1992 when Seoul linked it with the nuclear issue. 
  Businessmen here expect that inter-Korean economic ties 
would 
resume soon after the one-year impasse over the North's nuclear 
development plan is broken. 
  As Seoul is likely to give the green light to entrepreneurs 
seeking to conduct trade with the North, the private sector is 
vigorously moving to gear up for more business relations with 
the communist state.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Seoul should focus its 
North Korea policy on empowering Pyongyang's reformist groups to 
help nudge the reclusive state into opening up to the world, a 
foreign affairs research body advised Wednesday. 
  Enticements for such opening could include active economic 
exchanges where Seoul offered various short- and long-term loans 
to North Korea and other forms of financial assistance, the 
Foreign Ministry's Institute of Foreign Affairs and National 
Security (IFANS) said in a report on the North. 
  "There is a chance that the United States and North Korea 
will solve the North Korean nuclear issue with a guarantee (to 
Pyongyang) on normalization of relations and respect for the 
existing system," said the IFANS report. 
  "Seoul should acknowledge this possibility and seek North 
Korea's opening at another level," said the report. 
  Improving relations with the United States is North Korea's 
top priority this year, and Pyongyang will also step up 
diplomatic exchanges with regional superpowers Japan, China and 
Russia, the report predicted. 
  North Korea, simultaneously, is expected to expand what has 
so far been limited economic openness, it said. 
  "The basic line of South Korea's North Korea policy should 
be 
strengthening the standing of reform-driven forces within North 
Korea so that they can attempt bold changes, as well as offering 
cooperation and assistance to effect North Korea's opening," 
IFANS said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- An advance contingent of 
250 troops of the Korean Engineer Unit serving in Somalia as a 
UN peacekeeping force, will begin returning home in the middle 
of next month. 
  A Defense Ministry source said on Wednesday that the main 
body of the Sangnoksu (Evergreen) Unit will be brought home in 
early April as earlier planned. 
  "But, we plan to bring home an advance party of 250 men 
beginning mid-March depending on the conditions of Somalia," he 
said. To help arrange their withdrawal, Brig. Gen. Son 
Yong-che, deputy director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, and four other officers flew to Somalia on Monday, the 
source said. 
  The transportation means and expenses for the withdrawal of 
the Korea troops and their equipment will be shouldered by the 
UN authorities. The expenses are estimated at about 1 million 
dollars. 
  Meanwhile, the ministry decided to donate part of the 
equipment and supplies of the Sangnoksu Unit to the UN 
peacekeeping authorities in Somalia on its withdrawal. 
  The items to be donated, worth about 500,000 dollars, will 
include seven jeeps, nine generators, two water supply trucks, 
20 refrigerators, 50 air conditioners and some medical and other 
supplies, the source said.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have agreed in principle to open direct air service and have 
only technical details to settle, Foreign Ministry officials 
said Monday in contradicting reports that the two countries 
failed to narrow their differences at last week's talks. The two 
sides have already reached agreement on control transfer points. 
Last week, they agreed on beyond-point rights where South Korea 
would connect to Europe from Beijing while China would fly to 
the United States via Seoul, the officials said. 
  They also agreed on letting multiple airlines serve the 
Seoul- Beijing route from both countries, allowing Asiana and 
Korean Air to fly into the Chinese capital. While China is 
expected to service only Seoul, South Korean carriers are likely 
to acquire other destinations such as Qingdao, Dalian and 
Shenyang, according to the officials. "Technical questions 
remain, however, and they are issues for airline companies and 
transportation authorities to handle," said one official. 
  The technical issues deal mostly with industrial profits as 
South Korean companies are likely to earn more than their 
Chinese competitors on the Seoul-Beijing route, officials said. 
Chinese authorities are said to be asking for special measures 
to balance out the profit margins.

March 1, the Communications Ministry said on Wednesday. With 
the move, Korean residents of China or Chinese residents of 
Korea, exchange students, businessmen and travelers will be able

in the postal, communications and financial areas deepens. The 
communications ministers of both countries earlier agreed to 
adopt the system at two meetings last year. 
  Seoul and Beijing decided to launch the system ahead of 
President Kim Yong-sam's official visit to China in late March. 
International postal money orders are issued by agreement of 
the Universal Postal Union (UPU). China will become the 23rd 
country to cooperate on the system with South Korea. 
  At present, 380 post offices nationwide issue international 
postal money orders and payment can be made at 2,700 post 
offices.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Kun-ha] </F>
  [Text] China has emerged as the third largest trading 
partner for Korea. Korea's exports to China grew by a whopping 
165 percent in 1992 and again by 90 percent in 1993. Bilateral 
trade between the two countries is expected to grow by an annual 
average rate of 33.2 percent between 1993 and 1997 and by 18.9 
percent for the 1998- 2001 period. China has also become the 
most preferred country for direct investments among Korean 
firms. Last year, the government authorized 616 applications 
for investment in China, the largest number for a single target 
country. 
  The aggregate amount of Korean investments in China, 
however, 
is still small because direct investment by Korean firms began 
to surge only from 1992. As of the end of 1993, the aggregate 
amount of investment authorized by the government is still less 
than $1 billion. Of this, $465 million had actually been 
invested by the end of last year. China, however, is considered 
to be more than a simple trading partner; it is regarded as a 
crucial partner for industrial cooperation as well. During 
President Kim's visit, the foundation will be laid for strategic 
industrial alliance between the two countries. 
  The government will seek, among other things, an industrial 
cooperation agreement with China. Based on the framework to be 
provided by the agreement, the soon-to-be-formed Korea-China 
Joint Committee for Industrial Cooperation will systematically 
promote the industrial alliance. To finance the committee's 
activities, the Seoul government will soon inaugurate a fund, 
hopefully together with China, of some $6 million. 
  In the inaugural meeting in Beijing, the committee will 
hammer out the principles and types of cooperation, select the 
primary areas of cooperation and discuss other avenues of 
cooperation. 
  For Korea, the main fields of cooperation include aircraft, 
autos, digital telephone exchanges and nuclear power plants, 
while China is interested in cooperation in high-definition TV 
(HDTV), facsimile and large-screen color TVs. 
  In case of aircraft, Korea wants to jointly develop, produce 
and sell a commuter aircraft of up to 100 seats. Korea has 
already announced an aircraft development plan and China is 
expected to be invited to participate in this plan. 
  In the automobile sector, Korea has been asking China to 
allow imports of finished Korean autos and will encourage Korean 
parts producers to invest in China. 
  The Seoul government has also been eager to participate in 
China's telephone network modernization programs with Korean- 
developed digital telephone exchanges. Cooperation in 
developing a next-generation telephone exchanges is also on the 
agenda. 
  The nuclear power sector is another promising avenue of 
cooperation as China will construct new nuclear power plants. 
The Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) has signed an agreement 
to provide operational and management service to the nuclear 
power plant in Guangdong Province. Korea may be able to supply 
power generation equipment and participate in plant construction. 
  Korea also plans to help China accumulate technology in such 
fields of interest as HDTV [high definition television], 
facsimile and large-size color TVs. 
  Industrial cooperation also involves joint sponsorship of 
the 
so- called technology mart and exchange of engineers to 
facilitate technological exchange in specific sectors and to 
help individual firms to address firm-specific needs. 
  To expand trade further and stimulate direct investment, the 
Seoul government will also implement a set of new measures. 
First, it intends to increase the provision of loans by the 
Export-Import Bank of Korea for deferred payment exports of 
Korean industrial facilities to be used for economic development 
in China. 
  According to an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry 
and Energy (MOTIE), the bank is currently evaluating nine 
applications for loans amounting to $1.2 billion. Among them is 
an application for loans to finance $250 million exports of 
rolling stocks to the Guangdong Province of China. The Ex-Im 
Bank's loans carry 7-8 percent annual interest rates, not so low 
compared with ordinary bank interest rates of around 12 percent. 
To alleviate the burden of interest rates on Korean exporters 
to China, the government plans to provide them with the Economic 
Development Cooperation Funds (EDCF) whose interest rates are 
2-2.5 percent a year. The government will expand the coverage of 
export insurance for plant exports to China, while at the same 
time holding exhibitions of Korean goods in major cities in 
China every year. 
  Within first half of this year, the MOTIE will also come up 
with a plan to encourage Korean distributors to advance into 
China and build up their own distribution networks. Up till now, 
according to a MOTIE official, Korean exports to China have 
largely been materials for reexports; Korean goods have not yet 
penetrated into the domestic consumption market of China. 
  Partly, this was the result of the discriminatory tariff 
rates against Korean goods which were abolished only in 1992. 
Now that Korean goods can compete with foreign products on an 
equal footing, Korean exporters are in need of well-functioning 
distribution networks just as their Japanese and Hong Kong 
rivals do. 
  This year, the Seoul government will be more prudent in 
invoking antidumping and adjustment tariffs against imports from 
China to head off unnecessary trade disputes. To stimulate 
direct investment in China, MOTIE will select industrial sectors 
suitable for production plant transfer to China and will provide 
administrative and financial assistance to those who actually 
relocate plants. Candidate sectors for this encouragement 
measure include footwear and textiles. 
  Korean investments in China tend to cluster in such 
northeastern parts as Shantung and Liaoning Provinces and 
Tianjin City near Beijing. According to MOTIE officials, 
investments need to be more diversified geographically as each 
of the 10 major regions of China has its own development plan. 
MOTIE has requested the Korea Institute for Industrial 
Economics and Technology to draw up a detailed investment plan 
tailored to the development programs of the 10 regions. The 
ministry has also told the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) 
to set up trade centers in Dalian and Chonqing this year. 
Currently, KOTRA operates trade centers in Beijing and Shanghai. 
  Korean banks will be encouraged to expand their branch 
networks in China and a Korea-China joint venture lease firm 
will be promoted to provide Korean firms in China with an easier 
access to capital. According to a MOTIE official, the Daewoo and 
Halla Business Groups have expressed interest in setting up the 
envisioned lease firm. 
  All these measures are expected to help economic ties 
between 
Seoul and Beijing evolve into a new dimension. The two 
economies are, according to experts, basically complementary in 
nature, although in some sectors, they do compete. In 
approaching each other, the two countries may as well try to 
expand and capitalize on complementarity.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Japan appealed to South 
Korea Wednesday to eliminate illegal fishing near its waters 
that totals over 1,000 cases a year. The Japanese also voiced 
concern about the depletion of fishing stocks and disputes over 
accidents between vessels from the two countries, Foreign 
Ministry officials said. 
  Seoul and Tokyo sat down Tuesday and Wednesday for mid-level 
negotiations on renewing the self-regulation fishing agreement 
that expires at the end of this year. The two sides focused on 
South Korean vessels' illegal fishing activities despite 
governmental agreement on self-regulation, disputes and 
compensation from accidents, and formal mechanisms to protect 
marine resources. 
  The talks' key point is whether the two countries should 
overhaul the 1965 basic fishing accord as demanded by Tokyo, or 
just institute supplementary measures as insisted by Seoul, 
according to the officials. 
  South Korea established various regulations covering 
Japanese 
fishing in its waters in the 1965 agreement, while Japan 
virtually opened all its waters beyond 12 nautical miles. The 
action came at a time when South Korean fishing vessels were too 
small and too few to compete with the Japanese. 
  In 1987 the two countries adopted self-regulation, limiting 
the number of vessels, fishing period and size of boats, but the 
Japanese Government continued to protest at illegal activities 
carried out by South Korean fishermen despite government 
regulation. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa personally raised 
the issue at a summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
last November. 
  Seoul and Tokyo will need seven to eight more rounds of 
talks 
to settle the pending issues and plan to meet again sometime in 
April.

  [Text] The country's trade deficit with Japan rose sharply 
last month, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) said 
yesterday. KOTRA quoted statistics from the Japanese Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry as indicating that Korea 
suffered a trade shortfall of $420 million with Japan last 
month, up 46.3 percent from a year before. The country's exports 
to Tokyo in January increased 14.3 percent from the 
corresponding period of last year to $970 million, while its 
imports from it grew 22.4 percent to $1.39 billion. 
  "The increase in the trade shortfall with the neighboring 
country will continue for the time being because Korea has to 
buy more parts from Japan at more expensive prices as a result 
of the strong yen," a KOTRA official said. He said Korea will 
find it difficult to correct the chronic trade deficit with 
Japan as it still heavily relies on Japanese imports of capital 
goods to make more products and increase exports. Shipments of 
light industrial goods and electronic products face an uphill 
battle in maintaining their market shares in Japan now that 
those products made by China and Thailand, Japan's major 
overseas production bases, are expected to take bigger shares. 
China posted a $596 million surplus with Japan in the first 
month of this year, down from $753 million a year ago, KOTRA 
said citing Japanese estimates. 
  Japan's whole exports stood at $25.9 billion in January, up 
7.5 percent from the same period of last year and its imports 
rose 4.8 percent to $19.8 billion. Its trade surplus increased 
17 percent to $6.1 billion. As advanced countries, mainly the 
U.S., mounted trade pressure on Japan to correct its huge trade 
surplus, Japan's exports to industrialized countries declined by 
21 percent last month, while those to developing countries grew 
by 27.4 percent. Japan saw an increase in exports of such 
manufactured goods as electronics parts (39.2 percent), metal 
products (54.3 percent) and auto parts (15.1 percent). However, 
Japan reduced shipments of vehicles by 16.6 percent, audio 
equipment 7.5 percent and automatic data processors 11.1 
percent. Japan's imports of crude oil and petrochemical products 
declined by 21.9 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, while 
those of semiconductors rose by 50.5 percent, autos 42.9 percent 
and machinery 27.8 percent.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean consortium 
has discovered oil in the 11-2 mining area off Vietnam, 
officials of the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
Tuesday. The consortium of eight Korean companies had drilled 
in B-district of the mining area from Nov. 6 to Jan. 20, finding 
3,419 barrels of oil and 22 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
The mining area is located between 70 and 110 meters below the 
sea, 280 kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. 
  The Korea Petroleum Development Corp. (KPDC), Hyundai, 
Samsung, Daewoo, Lucky-Goldstar, Ssangyong, Samhwan and Daesung 
are participating in the project, in which Shell Co. of the 
Netherlands has a 30-percent interest. 
  The discovery has significance in that KPDC participated to 
find oil overseas as an operator, but the area's economic 
viability will not be known until further exploration is 
conducted. If the area proves to be economically feasible, KPDC 
will spend 1 million U.S. dollars along with the Vietnamese 
Government. However, more funds and materials are necessary, 
KPDC officials said. 
  The consortium will therefore start further drilling in the 
mining area in mid-August. The consortium signed an agreement 
on sharing oil from the 11-2 mining area with the state-owned 
Petro Vietnam Co. on May 19, 1992. The area is estimated to 
contain 600 million barrels of oil.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang said on Wednesday that if other countries retract or 
scale down concessional items envisaged in the Uruguary Round 
(UR) accord, South Korea would consider taking a corresponding 
step. 
  Testifying at the National Assembly session, Yi said his 
government would submit a market opening schedule to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after taking into account 
the contents of similar schedules to be submitted by major 
countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union 
(EU). He thus implied that South Korea may revise its original 
market opening plan depending on the outcome of the on-going 
U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
  The premier said that so far most other countries are 
withholding their market opening schedules. "This is due to 
their policy to cope with the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade 
talks," Yi said. 
  Also speaking at the assembly floor, Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said that last year, South 
Korea recorded a deficit of about 5,040 million dollars in the 
trade of agricultural and fishery products. He said exports 
amounted to some 2,750 million dollars and imports to 7,790 
million dollars. 
  "We plan to boost farm and fishery goods exports by 
promoting, for instance, the shipment of large amounts of hog 
meat and Kimchi to the vast Japanese market," Kim said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cho Chae-hyon] </F>
  [Text] Korea will continue to modernize and open its 
financial market to effectively cope with the rapidly-changing 
world economy, Korea Institute of Finance President Pak 
Yong-chol said yesterday. 
  In a luncheon meeting with foreign bank general managers 
here, Pak said that Korea is pressing ahead with its plan to 
liberalize the financial market and will not retract from its 
commitment to further deregulate the market in the days ahead. 
Pak explained to the foreign financiers about the Korean 
economy and financial industry. 
  "The on-going liberalization steps reflect the Korean 
government's intention to upgrade the efficiency of the 
financial industry in order to accommodate the expansion of the 
economy, its growing structural complexity and changes in the 
international economic environment," said the former senior 
presidential secretary for economic affairs. 
  Pak told foreign bankers that the Korean government has made 
financial sector liberalization a key priority. 
  In June 1993, the government presented a comprehensive plan 
for financial sector liberalization and capital account opening, 
with a detailed timetable for phased implementation in three 
steps for the period of 1993-1997. 
  This plan covers the liberalization of interest rates, the 
introduction of a system of indirect monetary control, the 
removal of credit controls and lending guidelines, the 
development of the money market, and the liberalization of 
foreign exchange and capital transactions. 
  Stressing that the financial market will be opened further 
to 
foreign competition, he said foreign banks here will be allowed 
to do business in such new areas as bank payments and 
remittances, and clearing system. 
  Pak said that the areas the government is committed to 
easing 
rules on in 1994 and 1995 are; the limit on foreign certificates 
of deposit (CDs) issuance volume, limit for over-sold position 
in spot foreign exchange deals, the foreign stock ownership 
ceiling for Korean stocks and limit on equity participation by 
foreign investment trusts in domestic trust firms. 
  As for the liberalization of foreign exchange transactions, 
he said "The government will deregulate foreign exchange 
controls and also invigorate the domestic foreign exchange 
market to assist domestic business activities abroad and to 
upgrade conveniences for the people."

  [Text] The government announced on 21 February its plans 
to fully invalidate the Korea Phantom Upgrade (KPU) project in 
which the F-4E Phantoms were to be upgraded to improve Air Force 
capabilities. 
  In this regard, the government is considering to use the 
budget allocated for this project in other projects, including 
the purchase of additional F-16s which is selected as the 
next-generation fighter. 
  The government's policy is based on the judgment that the 
project lost its meaning because the actual upgrading work of 
the F-4E's has not been carried out properly up to now since the 
KPU project began six years ago in 1988 and the F-16's will soon 
be purchased and deployed in actual combat as the 
next-generation fighter. 
  In addition, the technologies to be transferred from the 
United States were considerably reduced and the project is 
evaluated to be of little benefit to the development of the 
domestic aerospace industry. 
  The KPU is an over 3 trillion-won project to upgrade some 40 
F-4E's by the year 2010 at the cost of 80 billion won each. Two 
upgraded test aircraft are expected to be deployed in 1995. 
  According to a high-ranking government official, the KPU was 
suspended because the F-16's, which have been selected as the 
next-generation fighter, will be delivered year by year and 
deployed from October 1994, thus, the reinforcement of Air Force 
capabilities will actually begin. A total of 120 F-16's will be 
delivered by 1999 at the cost of 3.9 trillion won. 
  In the meantime, the government is studying ways to fully 
compensate Samsung Aerospace for the 14 billion-won investment 
it made for the KPU project.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Exports of South 
Korean-made weapons totaled 75 million U.S. dollars last year, 
the first upturn of weapons exports since the mid-1980s. 
  A Defense Ministry material showed on Monday that the 1993 
exports compare with mere 25 million dollars in weapons exports 
in the previous year. 
  Exports of weapons had been very sluggish from the close of 
the 1970s before they turned brisk last year thanks to heavy 
shipment to some Southeast Asian countries, according to the 
material.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- Imports have increased 
more rapidly than exports so far this year, casting a pall over 
the government's hope of realizing a trade surplus for 1994. 
  Imports rose 7.6 percent in the first 49 days of this year 
from the same period last year, while exports grew 6.7 percent, 
the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said on Tuesday. 
  Imports reached 11.6 billion U.S. dollars and exports 8.9 
billion dollars between Jan. 1 and Feb. 18, widening the trade 
deficit early in the year from 2.42 billion dollars last year to 
2.68 billion dollars in 1994. 
  A Ministry official said, "in 1993, the increase rate of 
exports was higher than that of imports throughout the year, 
improving the balance of payments a little. But this year, with 
imports increasing so rapidly, it is expected to be difficult 
for the government to improve the balance of payments." 
  The increase rate of import licences (IL) issued to 
importers 
reached 10.3 percent and 8.9 percent last November and December, 
respectively, compared to export letters of credit (LC) arriving 
here amounting to 8.7 percent and 5.4 percent in the same months. 
  The government issued 10.05 billion dollars worth of import 
licenses in the first 49 days of this year, up 26 percent from a 
year ago and foreshadowing a rapid increase in imports. 
  Conversely, export businesses here received 6.87 billion 
dollars worth of letters of credit during the same period, up 
only 12.9 percent from last year. 
  A Ministry official said: "Imports of both capital goods and 
consumer goods have been showing rapid growth since the 
beginning of this year. Imports of capital goods including 
machinery are expected to increase even further in the coming 
months because domestic enterprises are planning large-scale 
facility investment in the early period of this year. There is 
no actual way to control the increase in imports now. To improve 
the balance of payments this year, we have no other choice but 
to focus on studying ways to expand exports."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- The ratio of South 
Korea's three major overseas markets -- the United States, Japan 
and the European Union -- to total exports dropped below 50 
percent for the first time last year, the Korea Foreign Trade 
Association (KFTA) said on Tuesday. 
  Exports to China rose to 5 billion U.S. dollars, however, 
signaling a shift in export markets from advanced countries to 
Asia. 
  Exports to the United States, Japan and the European Union 
reached 39.11 billion dollars last year, or 47.6 percent of 
total exports worth 82.23 billion dollars. The ratio was 50.8 
percent in 1992. Exports to the three main markets rose 0.5 
percent last year, far lower than the total export growth of 7.3 
percent. 
  The three markets' combined share peaked at 70.5 percent in 
1987, but the ratio fell to 68.5 percent in 1988, 66.5 percent 
in 1989, 62.9 percent in 1990 and 56.6 percent in 1991 mainly 
because of the falling competitiveness of Korean products. 
  Meanwhile, exports to China rose 94.1 percent to 5.15 
billion 
dollars last year, the first time that shipments to that 
neighboring country have topped the 5-billion-dollar mark. 
Imports from the country rose 5.5 percent to 3.92 billion 
dollars. Two-way trade with the Chinese thus hit 9.08 billion 
dollars last year, with China becoming Korea's third largest 
trading partner after the United States and Japan. 
  Exports to Asia, including the Middle East, rose 16.4 
percent 
to 42.37 billion dollars last year, or 51.5 percent of total 
exports.

  [Text] Kwangju, South Korea, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- President 
Kim Yong-sam visited Kwangju on Tuesday and instructed mayor 
Kang Yong-ki to institute measures to relieve the pain of the 
city's residents. 
  Kim said, "On May 13 last year, I ruminated on the 
historical 
meaning of `the Kwangju democratization movement' and announced 
government measures to relieve the pain of Kwangju citizens and 
retrieve their honor through a special statement. The mayor 
should see to it that the city seeks a council of citizens and 
related organizations to complete the government's measures as 
soon as possible." 
  On May 18, 1980, hundreds of thousands of Kwangju residents 
resisted then-General Chon Tu-hwan's attempt to grab power and 
hundreds were killed by special soldiers. 
  Kim also voiced hope that the people of Kwangju will strive 
to create an international city of science and industry, leading 
other cities in the 21st century. 
  Meanwhile, Kim visited a machine tool factory and told 
workers there over lunch that he was pushing ahead with change 
and reform with all his might. 
  In an impromptu address, he said, "I will never neglect 
change and reform, and the rooting out of irregularities and 
corruption during my term of office."

  The council was established in 1981 to discuss judging and 
managing information and framing a national information policy, 
but has been criticized for its frequent intervention in 
politics. The council had already lost its legal grounds to 
exist on Jan. 5 this year when the law on the Agency for 
National Security Planning was revised.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The government adopted a 
set of measures on Monday afternoon to control price spiral, 
which feature the emergency importation of those farm goods 
whose prices jumped recently. The steps also include a stern 
order handed down to the proprieters of public service concerns 
such as public bath houses and restaurants to withdraw their 
recently raised charges. 
  The measures were adopted at an emergency price-related 
ministers meeting held at the Kwachon government office under 
the chair of Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok. 
  To stabilize the prices of seasoning materials, 3,000 tons 
of 
Welsh onions, 5,000 tons of onions and 3,000 tons of garlic will 
be imported. 
  The meeting decided that if service charges and industrial 
goods prices would increase or increased fees and prices are not 
brought down despite Monday's steps, the tax office would absorb 
all increased amounts as taxes. 
  To ensure rice price stabilization, the meeting decided to 
auction off 700,000 soks (100,800 tons) of rice held by the 
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation. 
  If the amount is not enough to check rice price rise, 
government- held rice will be released limitlessly. 
  Due checks will also be made to keep real estate prices from 
going up. 
  The price meeting took place after President Kim Yong-sam 
urged Deputy Premier Chong earlier in the day to take sweeping 
steps to control price spiral. 
  The attendees included home affairs, finance, 
agriculture-forestry-fisheries, trade-industry-energy, 
construction and health-social affairs ministers plus the Seoul 
mayor and the head of the National Tax Administration.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
had his share of diplomatic ups and downs during his first year 
in office. He enjoyed strong backing at home and abroad as the 
country's first civilian leader in over three decades, but was 
plagued by events such as the Uruguay Round [UR] and North 
Korean nuclear issue over which he had little control. 
  Kim started his foreign policy with a loud bang. "New 
diplomacy," he called it, essentially asking his country to look 
beyond to the regional and international communities, to 
consider trade diplomacy and not just political affairs. Hardly 
stirring from home, Kim received heads of state from 11 
countries during the year including France, Germany, Singapore, 
the Philippines, India and Australia. 
  Summits included two highly strategic meetings with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and weekend talks with Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa outside the capital city. 
  Certain events coincidentally helped Kim. The first-ever 
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened up 
a new regional horizon and gave Seoul a role in linking two 
separated continents. 
  The timely emergence of a member of the post-war generation, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa, helped in clearing up Korea and Japan's 
unhappy past at a weekend summit last November. The new 
Japanese leader enumerated his country's crimes during the 
35-year colonial rule early this century as none of his 
predecessors had ever done. While touching bases with South 
Korea's traditional allies, Kim kept alive ties with China, 
meeting President Jiang Zemin during the APEC summit. 
  Seoul-Beijing ties have steadily grown strong over the past 
year to the point where the two sides agreed to exchange 
military attaches, a symbolic event considering China's staunch 
alliance with South Korea's rival, North Korea. At the same 
time, Kim mended relations broken by his predecessor by 
establishing non-official links with Taipei through the exchange 
of missions. But when it came to major diplomatic items, Kim 
was not so lucky. 
  The conclusion of the Uruguay Round fell into his lap. 
Keeping South Korea's rice market closed had been one of Kim's 
presidential campaign pledges, but he was forced to break the 
promise at the last minute: Seoul bowed to the principle of 
tariffication without exception, including its agricultural 
market. 
  Negotiators managed to earn a 10-year grace period before 
opening the market to rice imports, but side effects from the UR 
hailstorm remain to this day with farmers and students taking to 
the streets. 
  His agriculture minister, Ho Sin-haeng, was made a scapegoat 
and fired immediately after returning from the UR negotiations. 
But the real misfortune came in the form of the North Korean 
nuclear dispute. 
  Barely one month in office, Kim's administration was hit by 
Pyongyang's thunderous announcement of its withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  The majority of Kim's foreign policy since then has been 
geared toward getting North Korea to allow international nuclear 
inspections. 
  Roughly one year after the bombshell announcement, the 
nuclear situation has returned to where it was last March, but 
only after a series of resolutions by the international 
community and sanctions threats by the U.N. Security Council. 
  Like the silver lining to a cloud, North Korea said last 
week 
that it would allow inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to resume at a scope and scale demanded by 
the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
  Kim's diplomacy had to incline heavier toward the United 
States because of the nuclear problem, especially since North 
Korea demanded negotiations with, and only with, Washington. 
  Despite outward claims that the two countries were in unison 
on how to handle the problem, the reality sometimes saw an 
imbalance between hard-line and progressive stands. 
  The latest crack came over stationing Patriot missiles in 
South Korea. U.S. chief commander in South Korea Gary Luck 
asked for the Patriot deployment and the Clinton Administration 
virtually approved it. 
  But South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu convinced 
them 
otherwise, advising delay at least while North Korea starts 
talking with the IAEA. 
  Kim's government experienced smooth sailing in regional and 
international diplomacy during the past year. He begins 1994 
with state visits to Japan and China and will likely go to 
Russia to round out a tour of superpower neighbors. 
  During the visits, the president will not only discuss 
bilateral political and economic relations but close 
coordination on the North Korean nuclear situation. But 
contrary to Kim's progress in diplomacy at the regional and 
international levels, ironically enough, inter-Korean diplomacy 
turned out to be a wild goose chase. 
  The president bears no greater burden entering his second 
year in office. Inter-Korean talks will most likely resume 
since they are a precondition to improving North Korea-U.S. 
relations. But exactly how the talks proceed and whether the 
substance is satisfactory are entirely different matters.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
economic policy is aimed at building "a new economy" based on 
the people's creative participation, a striking shift from the 
past military-based administrations' policies for economic 
growth on the basis of government control and guidance. Under 
this policy, the Kim government has embarked on various reform 
programs designed to develop the economy's growth potential with 
a small but efficient government since he took office last 
February. 
  Kim's economic team, led by former Economic Planning 
Minister 
Yi Kyong-sik and Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic 
Affairs Pak Chae-yun, worked out an initial 100-day plan to 
stimulate the economy by removing controls on business 
activities. After the plan's completion in early July, the team 
drafted a new five-year blueprint stressing development of the 
economy's growth potential. 
  Under the 100-day plan, the government took measures for 
increased corporate investment, small business restructuring, 
technological renovation, elimination of red tape and price 
stabilization of basic prices. Thanks to these measures, the 
economy began to pick up, with increasing corporate investment 
in equipment and plants. 
  On Aug. 12, however, the economy felt shock waves from the 
surprise announcement of an emergency presidential order 
requiring the use of real names in all financial transactions, 
the Kim administration's "reform of reforms." The real-name 
financial transaction system was considered by many economists 
as an obstacle to corporate investment which might negate 
stimulus measures taken under the 100-day plan. However, the 
new system has proved successful in helping the economy move 
upward from the bottom, instead of pulling down corporate 
investment. 
  Most of the money supplied to cushion the adverse effects of 
the real-name system on the money market has been siphoned out 
of circulation, and the stock market is emerging from its slump 
of the past several years. The economy as a whole is looking up 
on the strength of increasing exports. 
  Under the real-name system, however, the practice of using 
borrowed names in financial transactions is still rampant, as 
seen in the financial fraud involving Chang Yong-cha. This 
necessitates strong measures against the use of borrowed names 
for the real-name system to achieve complete success. 
  In late November, the second phase of the financial 
liberalization plan was put into effect to bring the financial 
market closer to a complete opening, a reform carrying as much 
weight as that of the real-name system. 
  The Kim Yong-sam government also initiated fiscal policy 
reform for a salutary budget system, with stress placed on 
increased investment in infrastructure. 
  For this purpose, oil taxes will become traffic taxes 
totaling 3.2 trillion won (four billion U.S. dollars) a year for 
investment in roads, railways, airports and seaports. 
  The government has since come under attack for breaking its 
promise to introduce a sliding scale system linking domestic and 
international oil prices. As international oil prices are on 
the decrease, however, the government has announced a big rise 
in oil taxes to ensure that domestic oil prices are unrelated to 
the falling international prices and thus keep consumers from 
benefiting from the plunging world oil prices under the sliding 
scale system. 
  Under the new fiscal policy, shortages of grain purchase 
funds will be made up for with government funds, not with funds 
raised by issuing grain bonds. 
  Private industries will be encouraged to make social 
overhead 
investment in a bid to lessen the government's burden of 
investment in infrastructure. To this end, various incentives 
will be given to corporations investing in infrastructure. 
  To achieve a small but efficient government, the Kim 
Yong-sam 
administration plans to restructure the 23 state-run enterprises 
and their 102 subsidiaries and eight state-run non-profit 
institutions through mergers and privatization. 
  Under the plan, 68 state-run enterprises including citizens 
national bank and Korea exchange bank will be restructured 
through mergers and privatization by 1998, and the 7 trillion 
won to be raised through privatization will be poured into 
infrastructure expansion projects. 
  The Kim Yong-sam government has conducted more economic 
reforms in the past one year than any previous government did in 
office, but its price and labor policies have failed. 
  Initiating the new five-year economic plan last year, the 
government froze civil servants' wages and restrained personal 
service charges and manufactured goods' prices from rising to 
stabilize prices, but consumer prices nonetheless rose 5.8 
percent last year and 1.3 percent year-on-year in January this 
year. 
  Moreover, the labor policy supporting the "no work, partial 
pay" principle was blamed for the extreme labor-management 
conflict at Hyundai Group companies last year.

office] has issued the following statistical report: 
  On his inaugural day of Feb. 25, 1993, President Kim ordered 
open the street in front of Chongwadae, previously off-limits to 
the general public. A daily average of 3,500 tourists and 4,500 
cars has since used the street. 
  About 1,700 persons daily climbed Mt. Inwang behind 
Chongwadae, which had also been off-limits to the public. Some 
10,325 toured Chongwadade itself in the past year. 
  The president received some 166 presents from foreign 
visitors, and on Kim's orders they were entrusted to the 
Ministry of Government Administration. Some 20 gifts came from 
Koreans but they were returned to the senders. 
  In order to lead the austerity campaign, Chongwadae cut its 
expenses by 1.79 billion won over the past year. The reductions 
were made in expenses for parties and commemorative souvenirs, 
970 million won, flowers and other decorations, 94 million won, 
and others, 728 million won. 
  Especially for banquets, dinners or breakfast at Chongwadae 
for visitors, the cost per person was cut to 7,000 to 8,000 won 
for a bowl of noodles, down from 40,000 to 60,000 won for 
Western- or Chinese-style food per person. 
  As a result, Chongwadae's total expenses declined 7.6 
percent 
from the previous year to about 1.8 billion won.

  [Text] Chinese Embassy Counselor Nie Haiqing told our 
correspondent yesterday that the state of investment by Thai 
entrepreneurs in China is relatively good. They invested a lot 
in China last year. Some investment projects are still under 
discussion. For example, Anan Panyarachun, former prime 
minister and now president of the Saha Union Group, is 
negotiating with China to form joint ventures to set up 
electricity generating plants in Tianjin and Zhuozhou in Hebei 
Province. He said that China was encouraging the kind of 
investments proposed by Anan Panyarachun. China welcomes 
investment in such infrastructure projects as power plants, 
highways, and ports. 
  He said that Thai entrepreneurs had achieved good results 
from their investments in China. The Zhengda Group [Charoen 
Phokhaphan Group] has already invested in 26 [as published] 
provinces. 
  Asked whether or not the recent visit to Thailand by 
Taiwan's 
Li Teng-hui will affect Thai-Chinese economic relations, the 
Chinese commercial counselor said there would be no impact. The 
investment atmosphere in China is good; entrepreneurs invest in 
areas that have a favorable investment atmosphere. In business 
circles, businessmen will not get involved in politics. So he 
believes that the visit will not affect investment activities 
between the two countries. 
  He said that China has a population of 1.2 billion people, a 
vast market for products.

  [Text] President Clinton has cited the Japanese 
bureaucracy as standing in the way of opening the Japanese 
market and criticized the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry by name. Commenting on the President's remarks at a 
news conference on 18 February after a cabinet session, Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minister of the international trade and industry, said: 
"American negotiators have often criticized the Japanese 
bureaucracy at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, but 
their criticism stems from misunderstanding. Japan's huge trade 
surplus with the United States has long continued unabated. We 
have to understand the President's irritation and to work to 
reduce Japan's current account surplus." 
  At the news conference, the minister also said: "We do not 
mean that Japan cannot reduce its trade surplus with the United 
States and Japan should work to do voluntarily what it can do 
for the reduction of its trade surplus. I am convinced that the 
private sector is thinking of measures to reduce it." In this 
way, Minister Kumagai stressed the need for the private sector 
to make its own independent effort to break the current impasse 
in the Japan-U.S. relations.

  [Text] A United States team will arrive in Vietnam at the 
end of this month to discuss issues including the state of the 
property seized by each country at the time of the communist 
victory in 1975. 
  Quoting Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, THE NEW 
YORK TIMES newspaper last Saturday said among the assets the 
team was expected to discuss was the former United States 
embassy in Ho Chi Minh City and South Vietnamese bank accounts 
in the United States. 
  Mr. Le Mai told THE NEW YORK TIMES that Vietnam wanted 
liaison offices to be embassies in all but name, and that the 
United States has assumed a superior attitude in its discussions 
with Vietnam. He said they were always reminding the Vietnamese 
people they were dealing with a superior power. Sometimes, we 
feel that the United States doesn't [words indistinct] on an 
equal footing, Mr. Le Mai added.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 KYODO -- Masaru Hayami, chairman of 
the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizaidoyukai), 
urged the government Monday [21 February] to set a target to 
shrink Japan's huge trade surplus. 
  Hayami said the government should break the deadlock on 
economic "framework" talks between Japan and the United States 
by setting a ratio to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 
reducing its trade surplus. 
  Hayami said such a goal should be included in a plan that 
the 
government will announce to open up Japan's markets. 
  He made the remark at a press conference in reference to the 
recent failed trade talks between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton over setting "objective 
criteria" in bilateral trade. 
  The association has repeatedly urged the government to try 
to 
correct the price gap between goods sold in and outside Japan. 
  He also said the dollar's value should be around 110 yen, 
noting there are few Japanese firms that can survive if the 
dollar remains below 110 yen.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Two key U.S. senators 
on trade matters sought trade legislation Tuesday [22 February] 
to open Japanese markets to American products after U.S. 
attempts to set Japanese import goals collapsed through 
bilateral trade talks. Max Baucus, Democratic chairman of the 
Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, and John Danforth, 
the ranking Republican on the panel, jointly submitted 
legislation to seek a permanent revival of the so-called "Super 
301" trade law. 
  While seeking legislation to revive the "Super 301" measure 
on a permanent basis, Baucus also urged President Bill Clinton 
to enforce "Super 301" by presidential order. 
  "It is time for the United States to demonstrate the courage 
to back its convictions with action," Baucus said in a statement. 
  The "Super 301" provision requires the administration to 
annually identify the most closed foreign markets and impose 
trade sanctions if negotiations do not resolve the problem. 
First enacted in 1988, the original "Super 301" provision 
expired in 1990. 
  The Clinton administration has expressed support for the 
"Super 301" measure. 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Tuesday the 
Clinton administration is "still reviewing options" to cope with 
the collapsed framework trade talks with Japan, including 
possible reinstatement of the Super 301 trade authority. 
  Clinton failed to resolve the trade dispute with Japan at a 
summit meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in 
Washington on February 11. 
  The Japanese Government is working on a fresh package of 
market-opening measures which officials in Tokyo hope will ease 
the strain in bilateral trade ties with the U.S. 
  Some Japanese diplomats in Washington, however, appear 
skeptical whether the trade measures contemplated in Tokyo, 
including deregulation and import promotion, would be 
far-reaching enough to satisfy U.S. demands. "I don't think it 
is sufficient," a Japanese diplomatic source said. 
  The source said the U.S. seems determined to set "objective 
criteria" to monitor progress in the openness of the Japanese 
market. 
  The Japanese Government has rejected the U.S. demands as 
equivalent to "numerical targets" for boosting U.S. market 
shares in Japan.

  [Text] It has been learned that the United States and 
North Korea held a working-level contact in New York again this 
morning to discuss the inspection schedule of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the preparations for the third 
round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  Well-informed Washington sources confirmed on 22 February 
that the working-level contact between the United States and 
North Korea was held in New York, but did not give details of 
the negotiations. Today's contact was held upon the request of 
North Korea. Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of the 
U.S. State Department, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of North 
Korean Permanent Mission to the United Nations were present. 
  It has been learned that in today's contact North Korea 
delivered a letter from Kang Sok-chu, vice minister of the North 
Korean Foreign Ministry, in reply to a letter from Assistant 
Secretary Robert Gallucci, and asked for a clear and early 
expression of the U.S. stance on follow-up steps, including the 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the schedule for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  The U.S. side expressed grave concern over the delay in 
issuing visas for the IAEA inspection team and reiterated its 
stance that the United States would set a date and begin 
full-scale preparations for the third round of the talks once 
the inspection begins and North-South dialogue resumes.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] A new chapter has opened up in relations between 
ASEAN and Vietnam with the visit of ASEAN Secretary General 
Datuk Ajit Singh to Hanoi yesterday. The move will further 
enhance the Indochinese country's integration into the 
six-member grouping. Already Vietnam has been accorded observer 
status to ASEAN meetings. Efforts are underway to increase its 
participation in ASEAN's activities leading to full membership. 
This was agreed upon by the grouping's six members at the ASEAN 
ministerial meeting in Singapore last July. 
  American embargo on Vietnam is now history, thus setting the 
stage for expanded economic growth and investment. This augurs 
well for the speedy inclusion of Vietnam into ASEAN. ASEAN will 
do well, to speak things aloud. The grouping's own future has 
gone by leaps and bounds. Indeed, it is rapidly becoming the 
nucleus of Asian unity, the hub around which an increasing 
number of regional entities have been erected. Economic 
benefit, aside from membership in ASEAN will confer on it 
respectability in the international community. After all, the 
people have suffered wars and destruction for far too long. It 
is about time to take the rewards of peace with the accompanying 
economic development. Among factors in favor of the country in 
its ability to join up is that it has a market economy in the 
making. It is now already in place. With these, the country is 
poised to contributing much to the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA. 
But membership is not automatic. Hanoi will have to work hard 
toward making its economic and political systems more compatible 
with its neighbors. If Vietnam shows genuine interest in 
adopting the grouping's broader principles, including pluralist 
politics and market economy, it should be made a member too. 
The member countries have agreed that the country should be 
given financial and technical aid to help its economic progress. 
  A remarkable feature of ASEAN is that it is truly flexible 
and accommodating. The observer status remains deliberately 
undefined. Cambodia has been accorded special guest status. 
This has reflected the extent to which ASEAN can prime itself 
in order to accommodate political sensitivity in its dealings 
with third countries. Even without membership, Vietnam still 
has a lot to gain. This is because ASEAN can effectively 
cooperate with countries without having to formalize its 
relationship yet. This also goes for Laos and Cambodia. A 
widening of ASEAN from six to nine will refurbish its image 
internationally. At the same time, it will strengthen its 
bargaining position with its dialogue partners. Membership in 
ASEAN has represented a tempting proposition for all the 
Indochinese countries. Most importantly, the inclusion will 
ensure greater geopolitical stability and defuse regional 
tension. It will also be the catalyst for members to focus on 
economic pursuits with renewed vigor.

  [Text] Asian Aerospace 94, the premier air show in the 
Asia-Pacific region opens today. Some 900 exhibitors from 35 
countries are taking part in the week-long air show at the 
Changi International Exhibition and Convention Center. 
  Opening the show, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General 
Lee 
Hsien Loong, urged the local aerospace industry to look beyond 
the confines of its home industry. He noted that Singapore has 
benefited from the rapid growth in aviation in the region. 
  Last year, investment commitments in the industry here grew 
by over 40 percent to 163 million [Singapore] dollars. Gen. Lee 
said Singapore will continue to service the region as one stop 
center for aerospace services. It will also continue to play 
its role in developing the regional aviation market and aviation 
infrastructure. 
  Gen. Lee however, noted that one potential obstacle to the 
growth of the industry would be infrastructure bottlenecks, 
especially insufficient airport capacity. He said newly 
developing economies like Vietnam and China will need to upgrade 
airport management, air traffic capabilities, and to build new 
airports as traffic volume expanded. 
  Gen. Lee said economic liberalization in the region would 
create more growth and business opportunities for the aerospace 
industry.

  [Text] Defense Minister Yeo Ning Hong believes that the 
ASEAN regional forum could provide an important mechanism to 
ensure peace and stability in the region. In an interview with 
JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, Dr. Yeo said Singapore could use the 
forum to develop an understanding with countries who have an 
interest in the region. Eighteen countries are scheduled to hold 
the forum in an overall session in July in Bangkok. Dr. Yeo 
said members are likely to discuss confidence-building measures 
and a more open approach to armament and arms control.

  [Text] The Singapore economy grew by 9.9 percent last year, 
up from 6 percent in 1992. It was the highest growth since 
1988. According to the annual economic survey 1993, growth was 
broad-based. It was aided by factors such as trade growth, the 
recovery in the U.S. economy and continued expansion in the 
regional economy. 
  The manufacturing sector registered strong growth with 
output 
increasing by 9.8 percent, up from 2.5 percent in 1992. 
  The financial and business services center, more than double 
its growth rate towards a 13-percent expansion. 
  The commerce sector grew by 8.5 percent, up strongly from 
4.5 
percent in 1992, and the transport and telecommunications sector 
notch up growth of 9.6 percent. 
  The construction industry, however, slowed down with a fall 
in the private sector construction demand. It registered only 
an 8 percent growth after leading the economy with 21 percent 
growth in 1992. 
  Total trade volume grew significantly by 18 percent last 
year, with trade value increasing to 257 billion dollars. 
  The U.S. remains Singapore's chief export market, accounting 
for 20 percent of its total exports last year. 
  Inflation rose only marginally, while the consumer price 
index up 0.1 percent to 2.4 percent. The rise was mainly due to 
domestic factors. 
  Singapore workers were also more productive with labor 
productivity rising 3.1 percent to 6.4 percent. The survey said 
economic growth is expected to remain healthy this year but more 
moderate from the high base last year. It is expected to grow 
by 6 to 8 percent.

  [Text] The Australian Government says six Russian diplomats 
caught spying were allowed to leave Australia during the second 
half of last year. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said the 
Russian diplomats left between July and December. He said the 
spies had been discovered during an investigation by ASIO, the 
Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Senator Evans 
said the espionage did not constitute a security crisis of any 
kind or any significant rupture in relations with Russia. 
  [Begin Evans recording] The kind of role they might have had 
in the past is not one that's appropriate to the new Russia, 
after the end of the Cold War. And there has of course been a 
very significant downgrading of the Russian espionage 
establishment since the end of the Cold War, and I think there's 
still a diplomatic purging of that kind of presence in embassies 
around the world: Australia's been no exception. But I repeat, 
we don't want to make any kind of major issue of this with the 
Russian Government, they are very cooperative. Once it was drawn 
to their attention as a result of the ASIO investigation that 
some inappropriate activities were occurring, then the issue was 
responsibly and satisfactorily resolved. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Concern about relations with Moscow is apparently 
behind an Australia Government decision to keep secret the fact 
that six Russian spies were ordered out of the country last 
year. Last June, a former Australian security officer was 
charged with spying for the Soviet Union. 
  The six Russians left the country over the next six months. 
Their expulsion was revealed in federal parliament by an 
opposition backbencher, Ken Aldred, who was responsible for 
revealing the presence of KGB special reserve officer, (Valeriy 
Zenskov), in Canberra in 1988. He told Fran Kelly Russian 
intelligence activities in Australia had increased to an 
extraordinary extent. 
  [Begin recording] [Aldred] It is a fact that they have 
built up, particularly to a peak last year, which ultimately 
led, of course, to the officers involved being asked to leave 
Australia. It appears to have three or four SVRR [Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service] officers -- foreign intelligence 
officers -- and about two GRU [Russian military intelligence] 
officers -- military intelligence officers -- are also asked to 
leave Australia as a result of their activities here. 
  [Kelly] What are these people doing here? I mean, are they 
spying? 
  [Aldred] Oh, yes. There is absolutely no doubt about 
that. There is a bit of a myth abroad because the old Soviet 
Union has collapsed, that in fact the Russian Federation does 
not operate any intelligence activities or at least no 
intelligence activities of any great note. The fact is they do, 
and in a number of cases, they have actually increased those 
activities, and of course, nowadays, and this was true in the 
latter days of the KGB as well, those activities are being 
broadened up for purely military concerns to also cover the 
industrial, economic area, and in fact, a lot of Russian 
interest, in terms of the Western democracy, is in the high 
technology area the industry has and they want to acquire for 
the Russian Federation. 
  [Kelly] Having a look at trade secrets? 
  [Aldred] Yes, we are looking at industries, trade secrets, 
new inventions, high technology, that sort of things as well, as 
well as purely military concerns and such things as shipping 
movements of allied ships in the Pacific and so on. 
  [Kelly] Is it surprising, though, that this kind of activity 
would have increased since the end of the Cold War. I mean 
surely there is less need now, less reason, for East and West to 
be spying on each other. 
  [Aldred] That's an interesting point. Certainly 
communism has collapsed, as we are all aware, in Europe. The 
reality is the new Federation is developing very interesting 
imperial ambitions. And in fact, they are making major moves 
over the last year or two to increase their influence of control 
over a number of former republics of the Soviet Union, in 
particular, Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, and the Soviet foreign 
minister, Mr. Kozyrev, is actually on record in January last as 
saying Russia continued or would continue to maintain a presence 
in the Baltic states. So, certainly, communism is gone, but 
Russian expansionism has not. 
  [Kelly] How do we know that this is true? How aware is the 
Australian Government? 
  [Aldred] I think the Australian Government is probably 
aware of much of what is going on, and the question that really 
has to be put to them is why did they cover up the expulsion or 
the request for these officers to leave last year and not come 
clean with the Australia, actually tell people what has been 
going on? The Americans have been very open about what has 
happened in Washington in the last 24 hours in relation to the 
charging of the CIA officer, and the request it had made to the 
Russians for certain Russian intelligence officers to now leave 
the United States. I think, though, the government here should 
have been just as open with the Australian people. 
  [Kelly] Is it not always the case, though, these kinds of 
incidents are kept pretty quiet? 
  [Aldred] No. No, it is not necessarily the case at all. 
Where actions had been taken in the past, whether it has been by 
the British Government, the German Government, New Zealand 
Government, the American Government, or whatever, they have 
always been very open in public about what they have done. 
  [Kelly] It has been reported that Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans, when he communicated with the Russian authorities about 
the fact the expulsion was about to happen, wanted to... decided 
to keep the incident secret because he said he felt it could 
harm bilateral relations. 
  [Aldred] I don't think that is necessarily correct 
because if you go back to past events with the old Soviet Union, 
when action was taken by various Western democracies against 
officers of the old Soviet KGB when they are expelled in a 
number of cases, trade and commercial relations went on as 
normal. It doesn't necessarily affect those relationships at 
all. 
  [Kelly] Why did you decide to expose it in the parliament 
yesterday? 
  [Aldred] I thought that people needed to know that in 
fact that the Russian intelligence services were very active, 
that they are still a problem, that it is naive to think that is 
not a problem, and that the government should come clean exactly 
about what had been done. [end recording]

  [Text] Samdech Chea Sim, acting head of state and chairman 
of the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia, cordially 
received His Excellency Georges Albert Wehry, ambassador of the 
Netherlands to Cambodia, at the office of the Cambodian People's 
Party this morning, 23 February. 
  Samdech Chea Sim sincerely thanked the Netherlands for 
granting humanitarian aid to Cambodia in the agricultural, 
health, and educational sectors and particularly for 
contributing to the Cambodian people's quest for peace. 
Concerning the Khmer Rouge [KR], he said that the royal 
government has made many concessions to reunify the nation and 
put an end to the war in Cambodia. However, because of their 
belligerent nature, the Khmer Rouge have not shown any desire 
for national reconciliation. They are bent on continuing the 
massacre and plunder of the people in the remote regions. 
Moreover, they have been using military forces against the 
Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF]. 
  Samdech Chea Sim stressed that if the Khmer Rouge keeps 
refusing to join the national reunification efforts, the royal 
government will be obliged to use military force to stop their 
savagery and protect the lives of the people. He also said that 
recently our KRAF have conducted sweep operations and succeeded 
in completely capturing the Anlung Veng camp from the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  Samdech Chea Sim went on to say that His Majesty King 
Norodom 
Sihanouk will return to Cambodia in April to join his subjects 
in celebrating the traditional Khmer New Year. 
  The Netherlands ambassador said he is delighted to visit 
Cambodia and to find that Cambodia is reunified and has a new 
legitimate government and parliament. The Netherlands 
Government will help contribute to the rehabilitation of 
Cambodia in the spirit of friendship and mutually beneficial 
cooperation, he said before stresssing that the Netherlands also 
sent its peacekeepers to Cambodia, but it is most regrettable 
that these peacekeepers failed to disarm the Khmer Rouge. He 
pledged that he would make every effort to continue on the good 
bilateral cooperation between the Netherlands and Cambodia to 
help promote Cambodia's agricultural, health, and educational 
sectors.

  [Text] Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen told Mr. 
Georges Albert Wehry, ambassador of the Netherlands to Cambodia 
[name and title as heard], on the morning of 22 February that 
the current military campaign against the Khmer Rouge [KR] 
ordered by him and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh is not a 
solution to the problem, but pressure on the guerrillas to come 
to the negotiating table. 
  Answering a request from the Netherlands, Samdech Hun Sen 
said troop reduction cannot now be implemented in Cambodia 
because of three essential factors: First, the reduction can 
affect political problems; second, the royal government still 
needs Armed Forces for self-defense and to counterattack the KR, 
preventing them from further causing insecurity among the 
people; third, the government has not yet provided those troops 
with any skill or possibility to earn a living after the troop 
cut. 
  Samdech Hun Sen reaffirmed that only peaceful political 
means 
can solve the KR conflict, not military offensives. He also 
said that the security situation and the KR problem are not 
obstacles to the Netherlands' investment in Cambodia or the 
Netherlands' aid to the country. He urged investors to do 
business in Cambodia since the country abounds with manpower, 
and he called on the Netherlands to help promote Cambodia's 
agricultural sector. 
  Mr. Georges Albert Wehry informed Samdech Hun Sen that at 
present the Netherlands is exploring how it can help Cambodia 
and determine what its needs are. The Netherlands already 
granted $1.5 million in aid to Cambodia [words indistinct].

  [Text] Three more people belonging to a bogus armed unit 
closely connected with the "Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement" 
were arrested in Tuol Kouk Ward on the morning of 18 February in 
the wake of a mopping-up operation conducted recently in the O 
Bek K'am area. 
  So far, 51 armed people who trespassed on the people's land 
in the three districts of Phnom Penh and put up armed resistance 
against government security forces on the afternoon of 17 
February have been arrested, along with some firearms. 
  A military police officer who took part in the campaign to 
crack down on anarchy said that the operation -- conducted in an 
area of Sivatha Street, north of Phsa Depot Market, where the 
three culprits were arrested -- could not be regarded as a 
success because an important person was able to escape. It has 
been learned that the man, who called himself Lieutenant General 
Men Samkol, was one of the ringleaders behind the illegal 
occupation of public land. 
  According to a reliable source, among the ringleaders, a man 
named Brigadier General Leng Serei claimed to be the commander 
of Division 015 of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement's 
national forces. It was also Leng Serei who lined his own 
pockets by issuing bogus titles to the illegally occupied plots 
of land. 
  The same source said that among the 51 people who were 
arrested, a man identified himself as Lt. Gen. Tep Phirum, a 
senior officer in the headquarters of the Khmer Angkor 
Resistance Movement's Division 015. It is not yet known where 
the bogus general was arrested. Tep Phirum also said that he is 
an officer in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] tank unit. 
The KRAF General Staff has confirmed, however, that the name of 
that person as well as the names of his accomplices were not in 
its records. 
  It was also said that these bogus armed units, which claimed 
to be part of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement and caused 
anarchy and fired on government security forces on the afternoon 
of 17 February, were not officially recognized by the Defense 
Ministry or the Royal Government. 
  Although the cause of the trespassing is not yet known, it 
is 
suspected that the groups intended to commit sabotage against 
the government. According to analysts, the strategically 
important area is located between the state radio station and 
Pochentong Airport. 
  A reliable source said the KRAF General Staff's Second 
Bureau 
is actively investigating in order to arrest the ringleaders of 
the armed groups. 
  It is worth recalling that the Khmer Angkor Resistance 
Movement has frequently been involved in deceitful troop 
recruitment activities in the recent past.

Ministry cabinet, gave a news conference on 23 February to 
national and international reporters on the military situation 
in the wake of the capture by the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF] of major Khmer Rouge bases at Anlung Veng and An Seh. He

areas 15 km around the Anlung Veng base and that the Armed 
Forces had seized 175 assorted firearms, 13 vehicles, 14 field 
radios, and two tanks of fuel. 
  H.E. Sieng Lapresse further said that at An Seh, the KRAF 
seized a significant quantity of war materiel, including 15 
DK-75 shells, 30 70-mm shells, six APL shells, 30 hand grenades,

  [Text] Over 200 armed inhabitants at Don Taeuy village in 
Kampot District of Kampot Province cooperated with the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] in attacking and destroying 
a battalion of the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets and two-headed government, which intended to plunder the 
local residents' rice and cattle and fight off the national 
resistance forces, in an area south of the village at 0600 on 19 
February. After 30 minutes of fighting, the invading troops were 
dispersed and forced to retreat. We killed five enemy soldiers 
and wounded 18 others; and we seized 15 AK rifles, three B-40 
rocket launchers, a B-41 rocket launcher, a 60-mm mortar, a 
field radio, and some ammunition. 
  On the same day, the people and NADK attacked and routed 
Vietnamese communist puppet soldiers at the checkpoints on the 
stretch of Route 3 between L'ang and Phnum Thvea in Chhuk 
District. We destroyed two military tank trucks and killed two 
enemy soldiers and wounded five others. 
  The Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government 
on 
11 February mustered and sent 300 soldiers from the 9th and 6th 
Regiments of the Province and District of Battambang and the 5th 
Military Region to plunder property of the residents living in a 
Democratic Kampuchea-controlled area east of Battambang. They 
attacked us from two Directions: The first was from Pralai 
Thmei to Ta Hen along the Stoeng Chas River and the second was 
from Khvang to (Rohai Chhak Tea). The people and NADK, however, 
ambushed, routed, and forced the invading forces to retreat. We 
killed five enemy soldiers and wounded eight others.

protests last Saturday against projected deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, a foreign news report from Seoul said. 
The demonstrators watched two actors perform a parody of the 
U.S.-South Korean "alliance," wearing cartoon masks of Uncle Sam 
and the traitor Kim Yong-sam. 
  They attacked the "alliance" as an obstacle to Korean 
reunification, sang "Yankee Go Home" and chanted "Don't import 
weapons" and "No to Team Spirit."

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists Monday committed an aerial photographing and 
electronic reconnaissance on the strategic depth and inland 
areas of the DPRK with an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane in the skies above Pochon, Yanggu and 
Kansong, South Korea, along the Military Demarcation Line, 
military sources said. 
  That day large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of 
the South Korean puppet army incited a war atmosphere, firing 
hundreds of bullets and shells in the areas adjacent to the 
demilitarized zone in Yonchon, Paju and Chorwon Counties, and 
formations of helicopter gunboats and transports of the puppet 
army staged an exercise of support and transport for ground 
attack units. 
  The war racket of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets is a vicious challenge to the unanimous desire of the 
Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for peace and 
reunification of Korea.

<F P=106> ["Unreasonable Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and some Western figures argue that the 
nuclear inspection recently agreed upon between the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] does not mean "solution of the nuclear dispute" on 
the Korean peninsula. They claim that "a special inspection of 
two military sites must be made". Commenting on this, an 
analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: What Hata said is a very 
unreasonable balderdash intended to put a brake on the 
implementation of the agreement reached between the DPRK and the 
IAEA with much difficulty after repeated negotiations. 
  The inspection agreed upon this time is not routine and ad 
hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards agreement but an 
inspection under the special situation in which the DPRK 
temporarily suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. 
  We do not think that the foreign minister of a country put 
his nose into our inspection issue, not knowing this. 
  Hata's claim for "special inspection of two military sites" 
reveals his sinister intention to spoil the agreement on 
inspection for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which 
was reached with much difficulty and force a "special 
inspection" upon us at any cost. 
  His rigmarole is nothing but a petty trick to divert 
elsewhere the attention of the world from Japan's nuclear 
armament by obstructing the solution to our nuclear issue and 
aggravating the relations between the DPRK and the IAEA and 
between the DPRK and the United States. 
  We warn that Japanese Foreign Minister Hata and his likes 
must act with discretion, clearly knowing what the "special 
inspection" means and what consequences it will entail.

  [Text] Tokyo, February 20 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] 
-- Japanese figures criticised Secretary General Ozawa of the 
Japan Renewal Party for insulting and slandering the DPRK on 
FUJI television. 
  Akira Iwai, chairman of the Japan Committee For Supporting 
the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, in a 
statement branded Ozawa's outcry as a deliberate one to foster 
among the Japanese people the "suspicion of nuclear development" 
by the DPRK. The Japanese people must not be deceived by his 
false talk, he said. 
  Hiroshi Wakabayashi, secretary of the same committee, in a 
statement said: "Ozawa preached for `building a system to 
counter a crisis,' groundlessly claiming that some change would 
take place in the DPRK. This revealed Ozawa's ulterior 
intention not only to slander the DPRK but also to malrevise the 
constitution and fascistize the government power." 
  Ippei Koyama, former vice-president of the House of 
Councillors, said Ozawa's outcry is just like Japan's past 
extensive propaganda about "threat from the Soviet Union" and is 
a drama to deceive the people. 
  Military analyst Ayazo Kubo in a statement said he could 
hardly represss indignation, hearing the TV address of Ozawa 
devoid of an iota of culture. 
  Michinao Zuchiya, chairman of the Nagano, Japan, Prefectural 
People's Council For Supporting the Independent and Peaceful 
Reunification of Korea, in a statement criticised Ozawa's 
address as an outburst putting a spoke in the wheel of DPRK-U.S. 
talks and antagonizing the DPRK. The nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula is attributable to the U.S. nuclear weapons 
deployed in South Korea, he said. 
  "The Japanese government must show sincerity for the 
improvement of Japan-DPRK relations including establishment of 
diplomatic relations," he urged.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate by-lined articles to the 24th anniversary of the 
proclamation of the cooperative Republic of Guyana. 
  The proclamation of the cooperative Republic of Guyana was a 
fruition of the struggle of her people to consolidate national 
independence, MINJU CHOSON says, and goes on: 
  After the proclamation of the republic the Guyanese people 
have covered the road of building a new society. 
  They are now striving hard for the prosperity of the 
country, 
pushing aside all manners of intervention and pressure of 
outside forces. 
  Pursuing non-aligned policy externally, Guyana is developing 
friendly relations with foreign countries and making efforts to 
establish a new international economic order. 
  Though Korea and Guyana are geographically far away from 
each 
other, the peoples of the two countries are developing the bonds 
of friendship. 
  The Korean people believe that the friendly and cooperative 
relations between Korea and Guyana will further expand and 
develop in the common interests of the two peoples. 
  The Korean people extend congratulatory greetings to the 
Guyanese people on the day of the proclamation of the republic 
and wish them great success in their future work to build a new 
prosperous society.

<F P=106> ["Solution of Nuclear Problem on Korean Peninsula Depends on </F>
U.S. Side" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign press 
branded the United States as the very one that brought forth 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Algerian paper HEBOLO LIBERE said: 
  Despite a stockpile of its nuclear weapons in South Korea, 
the United States spread a rumor that North Korea intends to 
make nuclear weapons, and is trying to internationalize it. 
  The United States is the first criminal in human history 
that 
massacred guiltless people by using atomic bombs during the 
Pacific War. The nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula does 
not come from North Korea but from the U.S. nuclear weapons 
deployed in South Korea. 
  The Indian paper DELHI SAMACHAR said: 
  The United States, taking South Korea as a bridgehead and 
nuclear forward base to gain supremacy in Asia and the world, 
shipped a large number of nuclear weapons there. Therefore, 
South Korea has been turned into a store house of nuclear 
weapons, largest in the world. 
  The JANA News Agency of Libya said: The United States, 
hiding 
its nuclear weapons in secret underground store houses of South 
Korea, cried for "nuclear development by the North." It is 
nothing but a pretext to keep nuclear weapons in South Korea. 
  The Peruvian paper LA REPUBLICA said that the U.S. 
imperialists declared the Korean peninsula the "forefront of the 
U.S. strategy" and intends to unleash a nuclear war there. 
  The Nepalese paper SUNDAY DISPATCH said that in view of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula caused by the U.S. side, 
the United States is to blame for this issue and, accordingly, 
it is clear that the issue should be solved by means of talks on 
the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
  The solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
depends on the U.S. side, it said.

of the DPRK denouncing the perfidy of the United States in 
reversing all points of agreement and promises between it and 
the DPRK. 
  Joint statements were published by the Danish Workers' 
Party, 
Common Cause, the Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist) 
and the Communist Party of Denmark on February 10, by the 
Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party (Marxists) 
and the Left-Wing Alliance of Bulgaria on February 3 and by the 
People's Democratic Movement of Guyana, the Amerindian Action 
Movement of Guyana, the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's 
Reunification and the Guyana-Korea Friendship Association on 
February 2. 
  Statements were also released by the National Committee of 
the Workers' Party of Zaire, the Central Committee of the 
October 8 Revolutionary Movement of Brazil, the Asian Regional 
Institute of the Chuche Idea, the Nepal-Korea Friendship 
Association and the Union of Tanzania Workers. 
  The statements denounced the aggressive moves of the United 
States in violating the sovereignty of the DPRK. 
  They noted that the United States which is responsible for 
the origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must not 
try to solve the issue from the position of strength but 
affirmatively respond to the formula of package solution 
proposed by the DPRK for a fair solution to the nuclear issue in 
the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
  Pointing out that it is a mistake to try to stifle the DPRK 
with strength, the statements urged the United States to act 
with discretion. 
  H.G. Mahundi, police superintendent of the Ministry of Home 
Affairs of Tanzania, in a statement released on February 7 said 
that the "nuclear issue" of Korea could not be solved by a 
strong arm or strength and demanded that the United States 
correct its wrong stand, abide by the agreed points and respond 
to the DPRK-U.S. talks before it is too late.

nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by means of negotiation, 
not by pressure." 
  Mohamedoun Dicko, secretary general of the Executive

Mali, when he received the DPRK ambassador, said that his

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA], 
highly praised the exploit of a KPA non-commissioned officer 
Hong Kyong-ae who died after saving her revolutionary comrades, 
and saw to it that the title of heroine of the republic was 
awarded to her and her platoon called "Hong Kyong-ae platoon". 
  At a critical moment she safeguarded portraits of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il at the platoon barracks and saved her revolutionary 
comrades, unhesitatingly laying down her life. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, with his benevolent care, sent gifts 
to 
her parents, praising them for having brought up a fine daughter 
for the country. 
  In December last year, he sent a 70th birthday table to 
twice 
hero of the republic Yi Hak-mun, not forgetting the day. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great brilliant commander who 
deeply trusts people's army soldiers as his comrades and loves 
them deeply. 
  Saying he must go everywhere there are People's Army 
soldiers, he has visited many posts of the KPA and shown deep 
concern for their training and life. 
  Twenty odd years ago, he called at an anti-aircraft 
artillery 
position of the people's army where he saw the training of 
soldiers and acquainted himself with their living conditions, 
asking them whether there was any inconvenience to them. And he 
had a warm- hearted conversation and posed for a photograph with 
them. 
  One summer day, he directed the training of seamen, sailing 
through the rough sea aboard a torpedo-boat. 
  Many stories about the loving care shown by the supreme 
commander to people's army soldiers are told among them. They 
include the stories that one rainy evening, Comrade Kim Chong-il 
put his own raincoat over a people's army soldier and set up a 
mobile sentry-box and, learning that a soldier, who was a son of 
a fallen fighter, did not know the fate of his younger brother 
with whom he parted during the fatherland liberation war, he 
took a measure to find his brother. So, the people's army 
soldiers deeply respect Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme 
commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and their father and 
write letters to him, vowing loyalty and filial piety to him. 
  In recent years, KPA officers, Yi Chang-ung and his six 
brothers and one sister, Kang Myong-il and his four brothers and 
many other soldiers sent letters to him, making their loyal oath 
to be revolutionary soldiers who will safeguard Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in the forefront with arms. 
  He read the simple letters of his soldiers one by one and 
sent them reply letters carrying his trust in and love for them. 
  Some time ago, Mun Chong-hwa, head of a chair of Kim Il-song 
University of politics, at the last moments of his life, left a 
will asking his students to faithfully attend supreme commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the life and soul and destiny of the 
Korean nation. 
  The People's Army soldiers are unshakably determined to 
throw 
themselves into water and fire if the supreme commander orders 
them. 
  The noblest trust, unity and harmony between the supreme 
commander and his soldiers are the source of the invincible 
might of the Korean People's Army.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- We have great rural 
theses which can convincingly declare the victory of socialism 
over capitalism in the solution to the rural question, says 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  A political essay of the paper headlined "We Have Great 
Theses" reads in part: 
  Socialist Korea is a great country, the first country in 
history to successfully solve the difficult and outstanding 
socialist rural question on the basis of the great rural theses. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country' 
authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's 
programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for 
a final solution of the rural question." 
  The great rural theses is the only programme for a solution 
to the rural question, the first of its kind in history which 
was authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and has 
been successfully implemented by our party. 
  This great theses clearly indicates the way of finally 
solving the rural question by vigorously carrying on the three 
revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, in the 
countryside, realising the leadership of the working class to 
the peasants, assistance of industry to agriculture and support 
of towns to the countryside, strengthening the guidance and 
management of the rural economy and the [words indistinct] 
between property of the whole people and cooperative property 
and eliminating the class distinction between the working class 
the peasantry. It is a great programme of rural construction 
which could be provided only by Comrade Kim Il-song, who founded 
the idea greatest ever in history and looks behind the curtain 
of time with a strong sense of responsibility for the destiny of 
our peasants and other people. 
  The changes which have taken place in the socialist 
countryside of our country thanks to the rural theses are a 
brilliant fruition of the iron will and the revolutionary 
practice of the great leader and the illustrious leader, who 
have [words indistinct] the idea and principles of the great 
theses in any circumstances and have guided our people along the 
road indicated by it. 
  Though there are many roads in the world, the way indicated 
by our rural theses is the most correct and shortest one. We 
have our own way. Our respected leader and dear leader are 
great and our rural theses is entirely just. 
  We will follow the road of chuche, the way of the rural 
theses, no matter which way the wind may blow and no matter what 
others may say. 
  We will move up the day of the complete victory of socialism 
and realise the idea of communism without fail from rice along 
the road indicated by the great rural theses, which was authored 
by Comrade Kim Il-song and has been implemented by Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  We have great rural theses.

<F P=106> [Speech by Yang Hyong-sop, candidate member of the Workers </F>
Party of Korea Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman 
of the Supreme People's Assembly, at a central report meeting 
held at the 8 February Hall of Culture on 18 February to mark 
the 20th anniversary of Kim Chong-il's promulgation of the 
program of modeling the entire society after the chuche 
idea--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today, at a historic time when all party 
members and the working people across the country are affecting 
a new upsurge in socialist construction under the revolutionary 
banner of singlehearted unity and self-reliance, we 
significantly celebrate the 20th anniversary of the promulgation 
of the program of modeling the entire society after the chuche 
idea. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formalized the great 
leader's revolutionary ideology and promulgated the task of 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea as the supreme 
program of our party in his historic work published 20 years 
ago. With the publication of the work, our party has come to 
have a mighty ideological and theoretical weapon which makes it 
possible to push ahead with the forward movement toward 
socialism, communism with certainty, and this is a historic 
event which opened a new, epochal turning point for the 
development of our party and the revolution. 
  The modern history of the Korean revolution which has been 
advancing under the banner of modeling the entire society after 
the chuche idea and today's realities clearly prove the 
greatness of the work and its invincible vitality. 
  Today we recall with dignity the course of our glorious 
struggle for the work of modeling the entire society after the 
chuche idea on which we have been victoriously advancing along 
the party's leadership, upholding the great leader [widaehan 
yongdoja] at the head of the party and the revolution. 
  Comrades: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's work is an 
immortal classical document which is of historic significance in 
the building of our party and in the development of our 
revolution. As historic experiences show, the party of the 
working class can victoriously develop revolution and 
construction and outstandingly perform its mission only when it 
has the right guiding ideology and revolutionary theory and the 
right struggle program, strategies and tactics. 
  Because it takes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, as its guiding 
principle, the Korean revolution has been able not only to 
victoriously open the road ahead of its struggle with the 
chuche-oriented line, strategies, and tactics, but also to 
consistently advance along the track of chuche without the 
slightest degree of deviation and derailment in defiance of all 
sorts of trials in history. 
  Indeed, the entire course of the Korean revolution is not 
only a proud course of victory on which the great leader's 
[suryong] revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche idea, has 
been brilliantly embodied and turned into a reality, but is also 
a historic course on which its truthfulness and vitality have 
been fully proven in all sectors of society. 
  The glorious course of the Korean revolution and the great 
epochal changes achieved in our country have clearly shown that 
the only guiding ideology which leads to victory the 
revolutionary struggle and socialist and communist construction 
of our era, that is, the era of independence--which is 
fundamentaly different from the previous eras of history--is 
precisely the revolutionary ideology of the respected and 
beloved leader [suryong], that is, the chuche idea. 
  Taking the great leader's [suryong] revolutionary ideology 
as 
a guiding ideology and making efforts for socialist, communist 
construction under its banner was not only a strong aspiration 
of the times, but was also a unanimous desire of hundreds of 
millions of people in the world. 
  With his deep insight into the aspiration of the times and 
the demands of our developing revolution, the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il published his historic work on 19 February 
1974 and, thus, gave perfect answers to the problems that the 
times and the revolution presented as urgent tasks. The dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has profoundly elucidated the 
historic position and characteristics of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary ideology, that is, the 
chuche idea, which is the only guiding ideology of the 
revolution and construction of our times; presented not only the 
program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, 
but also the basic mission of the party's ideological work and 
the immediate tasks for the realization of the program; and 
systematized them in a monolithic manner. Thus, the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il has provided an invincible, mighty 
ideological and theoretical weapon which can firmly guarantee 
the victory of the working class' revolutionary cause, the 
socialist and communist cause. This is precisely the dear 
comrade leader's immortal achievements for the times and the 
revolution. 
  The dear comrade leader's historic work is a library of the 
great leader's revolutionary ideas which have made it possible 
to bring about momentous changes in developing the communist 
revolutionary theories, building a working-class revolutionary 
party, waging revolutionary struggles, and carrying out 
construction projects. It is also a militant banner that leads 
our people and the revolutionary people in the world to victory. 
  The work has brought about a new change in the development 
of 
the guiding ideas of the revolution by strongly defending the 
great chuche idea and further enriching it. 
  The dear comrade leader has developed the great leader's 
revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of chuche-oriented 
ideas, theories, and methods and made them completed communist 
revolutionary theories on realizing the popular masses' 
independence. 
  The dear comrade leader has formulated the great leader's 
revolutionary ideas into an integrated system of the immortal 
chuche idea and revolutionary theories and leadership methods 
which the chuche idea has elucidated and, thus, clearly stated 
that the great leader's revolutionary ideas have different 
characteristics from the working class' previous revolutionary 
theories. In this way, the perfect definition of the great 
leader's revolutionary ideas has been given at last, and the 
question concerning the guiding ideas of the revolution in our 
era has been resolved brilliantly. 
  Since the question concerning the guiding ideas of the 
revolution has been resolved completely, the working class and 
the popular masses of our era, equipped with the most correct 
guiding principles and strategies and tactics, have been able to 
successfully build socialism and communism. 
  In his work, the dear comrade leader presented an idea and 
theory on imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea and 
stated that a communist society is a society that is based on 
the chuche idea and where the chuche idea has been implemented 
completely. In this way, he has provided our party with a 
fundamental guideline for its activities. 
  The dear comrade leader early on elucidated the leader's 
[suryong] status and role in the development of history and the 
implementation of the popular masses' cause of independence, and 
declared for the first time in history that imbuing the entire 
society with the chuche idea is the foremost program of our 
party. In this way, he firmly transformed the course of 
socialist, communist construction into a course of implementing 
the leader's [suryong] revolutionary cause. 
  The program to imbue the entire society with the chuche idea 
is a great communism building program to reform man, society, 
and nature as required by the chuche idea, successfully conquer 
all the ideological and political fortresses and materialistic 
fortresses of communism, and completely realize the popular 
masses' independence. Because the program to imbue the entire 
society with the chuche idea has been presented, our party has 
been able to successfully carry out the chuche revolutionary 
cause -- which the great leader cultivated -- along the most 
straight road and more vigorously accelerated the historic march 
toward socialism and communism. Truly, the program to imbue the 
entire society with the chuche idea is an immortal milestone 
that has opened a road toward historic changes in implementing 
the popular masses' cause of independence, the socialist, 
communist cause. 
  The work has elucidated the most correct road for the 
ultimate victory of the socialist, communist cause in our 
country and, thus, become a firm guarantee that enables our 
party to fulfill its historic mission. Our party's historic 
mission is to realize the popular masses' cause of independence, 
the socialist, communist cause, and completely realize the 
independence of all members of the society. 
  Thanks to the program to imbue the entire society with the 
chuche idea, our party has been able to effect social changes in 
building socialism and communism in compliance with the ideal of 
realizing the popular masses' independence, and, as a result, a 
new history has unfolded in which man's independence has been 
fully realized in all fields of his social life. 
  The dear comrade leader has presented a general direction to 
complete the chuche revolutionary cause in our country and 
elucidated detailed ways to implement the cause. In this way, 
he has provided a guiding principle that we must firmly adhere 
to in strengthening and developing our party into an honorable 
chuche-oriented party forever and endlessly enhancing the 
party's leadership role and militant function as required by the 
demand for imbuing the entire society with the chuche idea. 
  Persistently keeping up and thoroughly embodying the 
revolutionary policies for socialist and communist construction 
put forth in the work, our party has been able to successfully 
carry out the three major makeover projects, namely, remaking 
nature, society, and people, as demanded by the chuche idea, and 
to splendidly build the popular mass-centered socialism of our 
style. 
  Truly, the historic work of the dear comrade leader is a 
monumental work that has summarized the great leader's 
revolutionary idea and further developed and enriched the theory 
on building communism and the theory on revolutionary party 
building. It is our lasting assets that firmly ensure the 
ultimate victory of socialist-communist construction. Because 
of this immortal classic work, our party has been able to make 
clear its revolutionary nature and mission as a chuche party 
both in name and reality, and to steadfastly accelerate its 
historic march for the completion of the chuche revolution. 
  Comrades: Because of the greatness of the work, the historic 
work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has boundlessly 
stirred our people and the world's progressive people and 
thoroughly demonstrated its indestructible vitality in our 
practice of the revolution. For the past 20 years since the 
publication of the work, the struggle to remake nature, society, 
and people as demanded by the chuche idea has been waged 
vigorously in our country under the wise leadership of the 
party. Through this process, a momentous advance has been made 
in occupying the ideological, political, and material fortresses 
of socialism and communism, and the chronicle of our revolution 
has been more splendidly embroidered with epochal changes and 
heroic events. 
  The dear comrade leader organized and mobilized the entire 
party membership and all the people to the struggle to realize 
the tasks set forth in his historic work, making it possible for 
the vitality of the program for modeling the entire society on 
the chuche idea to be highly displayed in all fields of party 
and state building and social life. 
  The struggle of our party and people to model the entire 
society on the chuche idea has been an arduous and difficult 
struggle in which we had to pioneer the untrodden road of 
socialist construction in the fierce struggle against all sorts 
of opportunism and class enemies within and without society. 
Our party, based on its deep insight into the prevailing 
situation and the reality of the international communist 
movement, vigorously pushed ahead with the revolution and 
construction, placing itself firmly in an independent position, 
and has firmly built political, ideological, and material bases 
for the ultimate victory of modeling the entire society on the 
chuche idea. 
  We are proud to recall the past 20 years, because, through 
the struggle to realize the modeling of the entire society on 
the chuche idea, our party's authority has been extraordinarily 
enhanced, its might further strengthened, and the main force of 
our revolution solidified as an invincible one. 
  The dear comrade leader, who made it a theme of key 
importance to strengthen the party and enhance the party's 
leadership role in leading the revolution and construction, put 
forth the party building policy, above all, on modeling the 
entire party membership on the chuche idea. By implementing 
this policy, he has strengthened and developed our party to be 
invincible ranks which are firmly united based on the great 
leader's revolutionary idea, and to be a militant and refined 
leading political organization. 
  The dear comrade leader put forth a precise course and 
slogan 
of struggle at every point in the development of the revolution. 
He published numerous historic works, such as "on destroying 
the old frame and effecting a new upturn in the party work," 
"the historical lesson in socialist construction and our party's 
general line," and "the fundamental problem of the revolutionary 
party building," and led the party work along the road of great 
upturn, thus providing a firm guarantee for vigorously pushing 
ahead with the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea. 
  The dear comrade leader's wise leadership made it possible 
to make a fundamental turning point in the party work, and it 
enabled our party to greatly demonstrate its majestic appearance 
as the vigorous and seasoned party, which is excellently 
fulfilling its functions and role as a militant political 
organization winning the people's absolute confidence, with its 
roots deep in the masses, and as the General Staff office of the 
Korean revolution. 
  The dear comrade leader has renewed the party's appearance 
under the slogan for modeling the entire society after the 
chuche idea and strengthened the party to be prosperous, 
ever-victorious, militant ranks. This is indeed the most 
brilliant achievement that the dear comrade leader has made for 
the party building cause. 
  The revolution's chuche might is its political and 
ideological might guaranteed by human remolding and ideological 
remolding. Considering the establishment of the party's unitary 
control system in the entire party and society to be the first 
task of the human remolding work, our party has constantly 
intensified and developed the party's ideological work in 
accordance with the developing revolution. 
  While keeping up with the ideological revolution as a key 
problem, our party has intensified the indoctrination of the 
party members and working people on principles of the chuche 
idea, faithfulness, party policies, and the revolutionary 
tradition, so that it has armed them with our party's 
revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea and has vigorously 
pushed ahead with the ideological transformation of the entire 
society. 
  As a result of the party's vigorous ideological work of 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, party 
members' and working people's loyalty to the great leader and 
the dear comrade leader has increased more than ever. At the 
same time, the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, 
and the masses has been consolidated as firm as a rock; the 
socialist chuche has been further strengthened; and its role has 
been enhanced greatly. 
  This is a great victory achieved in the communist-style 
human 
remodeling work under the banner of remodeling the entire 
society after the chuche idea, and this is where the source of 
the invincible might lies, which enables our revolution to be 
ever-victorious under any stormy circumstances. 
  The entire society has formed into a large revolutionary 
family with the great leader and dear comrade leader as the 
parents, according to the communist principle, "One for the 
whole and the whole for one." All party members and working 
people help one another and share joys and sorrows for the sake 
of the fatherland, the people, the society, and groups, and they 
are continuously innovating and advancing, filled with optimism 
and faith in victory of the revolution. This is the real look 
of our society, where the chuche idea has been embodied. 
  The reinforcement and development of our party and the 
fundamental changes in our people's political, ideological, 
spiritual, and moral aspects clearly show that the dear comrade 
leader's historic works serve as powerful weapons for building 
the party and strengthening the main forces of the revolution. 
  It is a brilliant result of his works that through the 
struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, 
economic and cultural areas and all other domains of our social 
life are being reformed in accordance with the demand of the 
chuche idea. 
  The dear comrade leader originally elucidated principled 
problems in reforming the society in accordance with the demand 
of the chuche idea in all domains of our social life, including 
economic and cultural areas, and has wisely led the struggle to 
solve the problems. 
  Thanks to the dear comrade leader's wise leadership, the 
line 
for chucheizing, modernizing, and scientizing the people's 
economy could completely be implemented; our economic 
independence has been strengthened; the farming 
industrialization and modernization has been accelerated 
according to the rural theses; and a lot of problems in freeing 
the working people from hard and difficult labors have been 
solved. 
  Thanks to the party's tested leadership we have been able 
to make great advance in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan in defiance of the international events of the collapse of 
socialist countries and under the situation in which the 
imperialists' maneuvers against socialism and our Republic are 
viciously perpetrated. We have also been able to build in 
succession monumental edifices for the ages which amaze the 
people of the world, thereby changing the appearance of our 
fatherland in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea. 
This extensively shows the vitality of the program of modeling 
the entire society after the chuche idea and the might of our 
country's self-reliant national economy and clearly symbolizes 
the heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is victoriously 
advancing without being influenced by the worldwide upheaval. 
  The dear comrade leader has taken it as an important 
principle to establish chuche in all sectors of cultural 
construction, to embody the party spirit, the working class 
spirit, and people-mindedness, and to correctly combine 
socialist content with national form, and wisely led their 
thorough implementation. 
  With the implementation of the socialist education thesis 
the 
growing new generations have been prepared to become chuche-type 
communist human beings, a large unit of 1,730,000 intellectuals 
has been established, a grand flower garden of chuche-oriented 
literature and arts has been unfolded, and all of the people 
have become the creators and enjoyers of culture. This is the 
immoral achievement of our party in its struggle for reforming 
culture in conformity with the demands of the chuche idea. 
  Through the course of struggle for modeling the entire 
society after the chuche idea a brilliant victory has been 
achieved in the implementation of the cause for Army building, 
too. As a result of the implementation of the party's 
self-defending military line our People's Army has been further 
strengthened politically, ideologically, militarily, and 
technologically and has grown up to be an ever-victorious 
revolutionary armed forces capable of repelling any invasion by 
the enemies at one blow. As a result of the firm establishment 
of an all-people defending system we have come to have a firm 
military guarantee for the victory of the chuche revolutionary 
cause. 
  The epochal changes and rapid development achieved in our 
country's socialist construction and national defense 
construction are mighty proof to the vitality of the dear 
comrade leader's historic work. Through the embodiment of the 
program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea the 
popular mass-centered socialism of our own style has been 
further strengthened and developed, its invincible might is 
being demonstrated, the generation of our revolution has firmly 
continued, and its prospect is endlessly bright. 
  Indeed, the period of the past 20 years during which we have 
accelerated the work of modeling the entire society after the 
chuche idea along the road designated by the dear comrade leader 
is not only a period of 20 years of great change, but is also a 
period of the 20 years of creation and change which has brought 
a great golden age to chuche Korea by molding nature, society, 
and human beings. The period is also a period of the 20 years of 
victory during which we have sternly smashed all sorts of 
challenges by the imperialists and reactionaries and the 
counterrevolutionary maneuvers by the opportunists and, thus, 
resolutely safeguarded and defended and infinitely glorified the 
socialism of our own style. 
  All victories and successes achieved in the course of 
struggle for modeling the entire society after the chuche idea 
are a noble result of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
excellent and tested leadership. 
  By elucidating the path for modeling the entire society 
after 
the chuche idea and by wisely leading the party and the popular 
masses into its realization the dear comrade leader has 
completely improved party work, that is, the party's ideological 
work, and effected a new revolutionary turn in all sectors of 
social life, including the economy and culture. 
  Thanks to the farsighted wisdom and excellent leadership of 
the dear comrade leader, a great change has been effected in all 
sectors of politics, the economy, culture, and military, let 
alone party work. Thus, our revolution has been able to meet a 
period of new upsurge, and our party and people have been able 
to vigorously continue their advance along the path of modeling 
the entire society after the chuche idea even amid the 
formidable trials in history, full of faith in certain victory 
and without the slightest trepidation. 
  Truly, the dear comrade leader's leadership is a source for 
the victory of our revolution and a firm guarantee for boundless 
prosperity and development in our fatherland. 
  On this meaningful occasion today, with a sense of loyalty 
of 
all party and people in the entire country, I extend the highest 
honor and warmest thanks to the dear leader of our party and 
people Comrade Kim Chong-il, who, by carrying out outstanding 
ideological and theoretical activities and exercising energetic 
leadership, is endlessly developing and enriching the great 
chuche idea, the guiding idea of our era's revolution; 
victoriously leading the cause of imbuing the entire society 
with the chuche idea; and, thus, highly displaying our party's 
authority and the might of chuche Korea. 
  Comrades: Our party and workers has advanced far while 
carrying out the cause of imbuing the entire society with the 
chuche idea. Still, the road toward completing the cause is 
arduous and turbulent, and we have many things to do. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries are more viciously 
maneuvering to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our Republic 
and crush [apsal] our socialist cause, and the situation in our 
country is growing very tense. In compliance with today's 
situation in which we are building socialism amid tense 
confrontation with the enemy and in compliance with the demand 
of our revolution's development, we must thoroughly implement 
the revolutionary lines of self- dependence, self-support, and 
self-reliant defense and more vigorously carry out the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and culural. By so 
doing, we must resolutely defend and maintain popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style and develop it 
endlessly, and realize the cause of the fatherland's 
reunification, the nation's earnest desire, at the earliest 
possible date. 
  If we are to maintain socialism of our country and 
brilliantly realize the cause of imbuing the entire society with 
the chuche idea, we must cherish single-hearted loyalty deeper 
in our hearts and be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the 
dear comrade leader. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The entire 
party and all people must dutifully follow [chalbadduro nagaya] 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership if they are to maintain 
popular masses-centered socialism of our country and brilliantly 
complete the chuche revolutionary cause. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is our fatherland's 
destiny and our revolution's banner of invincibility, and 
loyally following the dear comrade leader's leadership is a 
decisive guarantee for completing the cause of imbuing the 
entire society with the chuche idea. 
  All party members and workers must have the unchanging, firm 
belief that our revolution will win victory without fail as long 
as there is the dear comrade leader's leadership and must be 
loyal to the party's leadership single-heartedly. 
  Important in possessing single-hearted loyalty with which we 
absolutely worship [sungbae] and follow the dear comrade leader 
is cherishing the greatness of the dear comrade leader deep in 
our hearts. 
  We must walk along the single revolutionary road, cherishing 
deep in our hearts how great is the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the people's great leader [inminui widaehan yongdoja], 
an outstanding ideologist and theoretician and politician, and a 
distinguished [pibomhan] military strategist who has literary 
and military accomplishments and loyalty and devotion. 
  Strongly arming ourselves with our party's ideas and 
thoroughly implementing those ideas is a prerequisite for 
loyally upholding the party's leadership and completing the 
chuche revolutionary cause. We must strongly arm ourselves with 
our party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, thoroughly 
implement the idea in all fields of revolution and construction, 
and wage an uncompromising struggle against toadyism 
[sadaejuui], doctrinism, revisionism, and all other antiparty, 
antirevolutionary ideological trends that run counter to our 
party's ideas. In this way, we must firmly defend the purity 
[sungyolsong] of the chuche idea. 
  All party members and workers must make loyalty to the party 
as their faith, conscience, morality, and daily life and make it 
their absolute rule to think and move only in compliance with 
the party's ideas and intentions anytime, anywhere. 
  If we, in hearty response to our party's leadership, are to 
successfully carry out the cause of imbuing the entire society 
with the chuche idea, we must more thoroughly establish the 
party's unified leadership system. 
  All the party members and working people should accept the 
party's lines and policies as the most just ones and as the 
demand of life, and by unconditionally implementing them under 
any difficult conditions and environment, they should fulfill 
their fidelity and duty as revolutionary fighters sharing fate 
with the party. 
  We should establish a firm revolutionary discipline in which 
the entire party membership, all the people, and the entire army 
move as one under the party's leadership, and should never 
tolerate any disciplineless and nonsocialist elements. In so 
doing, we should make sure to firmly establish the ethos that 
within our revolutionary rank, everyone breathes with the party, 
speaks in the voice of the party, and walks in step with the 
party. 
  To victoriously advance and complete the cause of modeling 
the entire society on the chuche idea, we should continuously 
strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party and the 
revolutionary ranks. The wholehearted unity of the leader, the 
party, and the masses is the everlasting vitality of our-style 
socialism, and the backbone of our revolution. Our revolution 
has victoriously advanced overcoming extraordinarily arduous 
trials, and we are turning adversity into a smooth condition, 
adhering to and adding luster to socialism, in a grave 
environment where the imperialists' antisocialist offensive is 
intensified in an unprecedented manner. All this is 
attributable to the fact that our revolutionary ranks have 
formed a strong main force of the revolution wholeheartedly 
united around the leader. revolutionary ranks around the leader. 
  We should taintlessly inherit the tradition of unity and 
cohesion created in the pioneering period of the Korean 
revolution, solidify the wholehearted unity of the party and the 
revolutionary ranks as firm as a rock, crush all sorts of 
challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries with the might 
of the wholehearted unity, and effect continuous upsurge in the 
revolution and construction. 
  To successfully carry out the cause of modeling the entire 
society on the chuche idea, we should accelerate the socialist 
economic and cultural construction continuously and vigorously. 
As a present task, we should concentrate all our efforts for 
the struggle to implement the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth the 
revolutionary economic strategy in the 21st plenary meeting of 
the Sixth party Central Committee and in his New Year's address 
this year setting aside three years as an adjusting period in 
which to carry out the agriculture-first policy, light 
industry-first policy, and trade-first policy. 
  Dwelling in the party's revolutionary economic strategy is 
our party's firm resolve and will to momentously improve the 
people's living standard within a few years and to develop the 
country's economy into a chuche-oriented economy which does not 
shake under any economic blockade by the imperialists. We 
should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy in order to further strengthen the might of our-style 
socialism and highly display its superiority. 
  To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy, we should highly display the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude. Under the present condition where 
the imperialists are further intensifying the maneuvers for 
economic blockade [kyongje pongsoe] to stifle [chilsik] our 
country's socialism, the way to vigorously accelerate socialist 
economic construction is to exert the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude. Under the party's militant slogan 
"Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist all-out march with 
the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude," all 
the party members and working people should dash forward 
vigorously with the spirit of the chollima plus the speed of the 
nineties and effect great upsurge in all sectors of the people's 
economy. 
  We should actively struggle to achieve a new development in 
all areas of the socialist cultural construction -- including 
science, education, literature, art, and public health -- 
upholding the party policy on cultural revolution. 
  We should constantly concentrate great efforts on increasing 
the national defense strength to cope with [taecho hayo] today's 
acute situation, in which the enemies are ceaselessly conducting 
war provocation maneuvers. 
  We should completely implement the party's military line and 
make every preparation so as to actively cope with any emergency 
situation [ku otton puruiui chonghwangedo chudongjoguro matsolsu 
ittorok]. We should also thoroughly establish the ethos of 
army-people unity in the entire society so as for the people to 
value the military and for the army and the people to share 
their fates. 
  The fatherland's reunification is the supreme national task 
[minjok chisangui kwaop] for our people that cannot be delayed 
any further. 
  We will make every effort to achieve the unity of the whole 
nation and to reunify the country in a way of confederal system 
based on the three principles of independence, the peaceful 
reunification, and the great national unity, upholding the 
10-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland presented by the great leader. 
  Although imperialists are indulging in bravado and bluster 
on 
the international stage, talking about an end of socialism, no 
one can reverse the historical trend of the worldwide people's 
advance for independence. 
  The struggle of our party and people to implement the cause 
of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea is a 
honorable and sacred struggle for our fatherland's endless 
growth and prosperity and for mankind's bright future, and it 
will vigorously encourage the progressive people of the world 
who are struggling to protect their independence. 
  We should actively contribute to implementing the global 
cause of independence and fulfill our international duties 
[uriege matkyojin kukchejuuijok uimu] by vigorously pushing 
ahead with the struggle for modeling the entire society after 
the chuche idea. 
  Our people's struggle for modeling the entire society after 
the chuche idea is arduous, but our cause will achieve the 
victory without fail. 
  There is no force in the world that can block the sublime 
march of our people, who are fighting for the just cause under 
the leadership of the great leader and the great party. 
  Let us all firmly unite ourselves around the party Central 
Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim 
Il-song, and vigorously fight for the ultimate consummation of 
the chuche revolutionary cause, with faith in certain victory 
and revolutionary optimism, under the banner of modeling the 
entire society after the chuche idea. 
  Long live Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party 
and people! 
  Long live Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our 
party and people!

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il Is </F>
the Great Leader Who Is Brilliantly Carrying Out the Cause of 
Modeling the Entire Society After the Chuche Idea"] 
  [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il expounded the 
program of modeling the entire society after the chuche idea 20 
years ago. During this period our party and people have 
consistently waged the struggle to model the entire society 
after the chuche idea under the dear comrade leader's 
leadership. As a result, they have registered great victories 
and changes which are unprecedented not only in the history of 
our nation, but also in the history of the communist movement, 
and our revolution has greeted an ever- victorious era of a new 
upsurge. 
  It is thanks to the wise leadership of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is brilliantly leading the cause of 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, that our 
people have proudly built a tower of socialist success on which 
the chuche idea has been embodied and are enjoying an 
independent and creative life to their hearts' content and that 
they are vigorously struggling and advancing, being optimistic 
about the future of socialism and communism and full of firm 
faith in victory. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
taught: Everything is being properly carried out in our country 
today and it will be also properly carried out in the future, 
too, because Comrade Kim Chong-il is outstandingly inheriting 
our revolutionary cause. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is the 
great leadership to inherit and consummate the chuche 
revolutionary cause that the respected and beloved leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song pioneered and has led to the road of victory 
and glory. The chuche revolutionary cause, which the great 
leader started its historical beginning, is the popular masses' 
cause which is pioneered and developed under the banner of the 
chuche idea, and it is also a sacred cause to completely realize 
the popular masses' independence by building socialism, 
communism, through the embodiment of the chuche idea. 
  On the course of carrying out the chuche revolutionary cause 
under the wise leadership of the respected and beloved leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, our people achieved the task of national 
liberation, brilliantly achieved the tasks of democratic 
revolution and socialist revolution in the northern half of the 
Republic after national liberation, and, thus, built the most 
superior socialist system of our own style there. In this way 
our revolution has reached a high stage, greeting a new 
revolutionary turning point. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with his insight into 
the mature demands of our developing revolution, developed and 
consummated the socialism of our own style which has embodied 
the chuche idea by expounding the program of modeling the entire 
society after the chuche idea and, thus, has provided the 
guiding principle to seek a high stage of communism. 
  As the dear comrade leader has elucidated, modeling the 
entire society after the chuche idea means to advance our 
revolution, using the great chuche idea as the only guiding 
principle, and to build and consummate socialism, communism on 
the basis of the chuche idea. In other words, it means to remold 
men, society, and nature in conformity with the demands of the 
chuche idea and, thus, to completely realize the popular masses' 
independence. 
  The program of modeling the entire society after the chuche 
idea extensively contains the most correct goal and direction of 
struggle for completely guaranteeing the popular masses' 
independence, as well as struggle policies and methods for their 
realization, by developing and consummating socialism of our own 
style and realizing communism at a high plane. 
  When we thoroughly uphold and implement the program of 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea we can develop 
and consummate the socialist cause without the slightest 
deviation and vicissitudes under any difficult circumstances and 
conditions and successfully build communist society in which the 
popular masses' independence is completely realized. 
  The cause of including the entire society with one ideology 
can be achieved only by the great leader [suryong], the great 
leader [yongdoja] who created the revolutionary ideology and 
theory representing the times and who has produced brilliant 
revolutionary achievements by embodying the revolutionary 
ideology and theory through tested leadership. 
  Despite the difficult condition in which the imperialists 
and the traitors of socialism are intensifying the 
counterrevolutionary offensive, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il always upheld the banner of the great chuche idea, put 
forth an original idea and theory to realize the program of 
modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, and has wisely 
led our people's struggle for their realization. 
  Above all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth an 
original idea and theory to realize the program of modeling the 
entire society on the chuche idea, thus providing us with an 
ideological and theoretical guideline for us to advance the 
chuche socialist cause vigorously straight forward along the 
road of victory. His new elucidation of the essence of 
socialism and of the inevitability of its inheritance and 
completion is an important achievement he has made for the 
realization of the cause of modeling the entire society on the 
chuche idea. 
  The dear comrade leader gave a new elucidation that by 
embodying the chuche idea, socialism brings forth a society 
which is free from exploitation and oppression of man by man in 
which social equality is realized and in which the popular 
masses are tied in comradeship as common masters of state and 
society and enjoy independent and creative life suitable for the 
nature of the social human being. Based on his original 
proclamation that in socialist society where the popular masses 
are masters, ideology is of vital importance and the party's 
leadership is the lifeline for the victory of the cause of 
socialism, he clarified anew that the basic factor of the 
development of socialist society lies in the struggle of the 
popular masses united in comradeship with high self-awareness 
and capability as masters. 
  His elucidation of the new idea on the method of building 
socialism is one of the important achievements the dear comrade 
leader has built for the realization of the cause of modeling 
the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader 
put forth the idea and theory on living in our own way and on 
highly exalting the Korean nation-first spirit, thus 
establishing an original method of carrying out party building 
and state building in our own way according to the chuche faith 
and will, developing politics, economy, and culture in our own 
way, and carrying out the revolution based on the Korean 
nation-first spirit. 
  That the dear comrade leader established the scientific 
theory on inheriting and completing the cause of socialism based 
on the revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most important 
achievement he made for the realization of the cause of modeling 
the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader 
made a comprehensive compilation of the idea and theory on the 
inheritance and completion of the cause of the revolution into 
such demonstrative statements, as we should firmly maintain the 
purity of socialist ideology and correctly resolve the issue of 
leadership succession in order to fulfill the cause of 
socialism. To do this, we should build the party as a guide of 
socialist-communist society under a long-range program, realize 
its leadership firmly, and correctly inherit the tradition of 
the ideology and leadership achieved by the leader. 
  Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave a new 
comprehensive elucidation of the ideology and theory on the 
essence of socialist society and its inheritance and completion 
based on the principle and methodological theory of the chuche 
idea, the abundant experience of our country's building 
socialism, and the scientific analysis of the historical lesson 
in building socialism. By so doing, we could overcome the 
limitation of the previous socialist ideology and theory 
centered on materialism and establish a complete socialist 
ideology. At the same time, our socialism was turned firmly 
into the chuche socialism centered on popular masses, thus 
enabling us to advance vigorously along the single road of 
victory and glory. This is the most noble achievement the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made on the way to realize the 
cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also provided a strong 
political force and a guarantee of armed forces to realize the 
program of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, so 
that the cause of our-style socialism could make a long drive 
taking advantage of victory unshaken in the face of any trial. 
  The dear comrade leader attached prior importance to 
building 
the party firmly organizationally and ideologically in leading 
the revolution and construction and put forth the revolutionary 
policy on modeling the entire party membership on the chuche 
idea; and, to realize this policy, he strengthened and developed 
our party into an invincible revolutionary party in which the 
uniformity of ideology and leadership is firmly ensured, in 
which the entire party membership is united as strong as iron, 
and which has taken root deep among the popular masses and 
formed a harmonious whole with the masses. 
  The dear comrade leader placed the unity and cohesion 
between 
the party and the people onto a high plane of wholehearted 
unity, and combined the entire society into one sociopolitical 
living organism in which the leader, the party, and the masses 
share their destiny. In this process, the main force of our 
revolution, the main force of the cause of our-style socialism, 
has been solidified as an indestructible force. 
  Based on his insight into the important significance of the 
revolutionary armed forces in carrying out the cause of 
socialism, the dear comrade leader put forth the independent 
army building policy on modeling the entire army on the chuche 
idea, and strengthened and developed the People's Army to be 
one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary armed forces well 
prepared politically, ideologically, and in terms of military 
technology. Hence, our people have come to have invincible 
revolutionary armed forces that can support with arms the cause 
of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. Solidifying 
the main force of the revolution into an invincible force and 
providing strong revolutionary armed forces constitute a 
decisive factor that brings forth the victorious advance and 
ultimate completion of the cause of modeling the entire society 
on the chuche idea. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il defined the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a 
fundamental way to realize the modeling of the entire society on 
the chuche idea and wisely leads the struggle to implement it. 
By so doing, he successfully remakes nature, society, and 
people as demanded by the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader 
put forth the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and 
cultural--as a strategical line for socialist-communist 
building, and exercised his leadership so that the technological 
and cultural revolutions could be vigorously pushed forward with 
the ideological revolution given prior importance. He exercised 
his leadership so that the party's leadership role for the three 
revolutions would be intensified, so that the movement of 
winning the three revolutions red flag and the three revolutions 
teams movement would be vigorously conducted, so that the three 
revolutions would be turned firmly into a work of the masses 
themselves under a powerful leadership system. As a result of 
this, the entire society came to be filled with the chuche idea, 
with the socialist collectivist spirit and beautiful communist 
virtues prevailing in it. At the same time, our self-reliant 
socialist economy came to be accelerated on the high plane of 
chucheization, modernization, and scientization; the 
intellectualization of the entire society came to be in 
brilliant progress, and the socialist literature and art came to 
be in full resplendent bloom. 
  Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly led 
the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, 
creating the history of great victory for our-style socialism, 
and brought forth an epochal upturn unprecedented in the nearly 
5,000-year history of our nation. 
  It is the greatest honor and happiness for our people to 
uphold and follow the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il--outstanding ideologist and theoretician with brilliant 
wisdom and great statesman and iron-willed brilliant commander 
with iron-will and tested leadership--at the head of the party, 
the revolution, and the revolutionary armed forces. Only 
victory and glory will shine in the future of our people who 
carry out the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche 
idea under the leadership of the dear comrade leader. On this 
road, our socialist fatherland will grow and prosper forever.

  Especially, shoes, cosmetics and enamelware have won

produce a half of the province's total. 
  The plastic daily necessities factory, the household 
articles 
factory, the garment factory and the pharmaceutical factory in 
the city are also well known nationwide. 
  Before the liberation of the nation, the city was a small 
commercial and consumer city with a backward textile industry 
and pulp and paper-making industry of a small scale. 
  The light industry of the city has made a rapid progress 
under the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The total light industrial output value of the city is 76 
times the 1944 figure before the liberation. 
  The light industry of the city relies on its own raw 
material 
base and light industrial machine production base.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Many Korean farmers 
are vacationing at holiday homes. Happy looks of farmers in the 
holiday season can be seen at scenic places such as Songchon, 
Sakju, Soktamgugok and the Lake Sohung. 
  They are spending joyful days with colorful programs of 
cultural and emotional life, rest, visits to nearby historical 
sites and beauty spots and experience-swapping at well furnished 
rest homes, overwhelmed with gratitude for the ever-growing 
benefits granted them by the party and the state. 
  The party and the state show particular care for the farmers 
in charge of the granary of the country. 
  The state gave great financial and material aid to the 
farmers after the war to improve their deteriorated living. In 
1966, it totally abolished the agricultural tax in kind to free 
them from the tax burden. Now the construction of modern 
houses, to say nothing of productive construction in the 
countryside, is done at the expense of the state. These houses 
are distributed to farmers free of charge. 
  With the enforcement of the social security system, the 
farmers, like the workers and office employees, enjoy additional 
benefits of different forms such as old-age pension, pension for 
the disabled and pension for the bereaved families. Village 
clinics were converted into hospitals, water and bus services 
were introduced into rural villages and the TV networks were 
broadened to cover the countryside long ago to leave little gap 
between farmers and urban dwellers in living conditions. 
  And the tasks of the rural technical revolution have been 
successfully promoted to remarkably diminish the differences 
between industrial and agricultural labor. 
  Before liberation the farmers went out to the fields in 
early 
morning and worked with their eyes fixed on the soil, pulling 
wooden ploughs and wielding worn-out hoes all day long, and came 
back home under the stars. But today they live in happiness, 
working, resting and enjoying a cultural life just as the 
workers do.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Agro-technicians 
are trained in large numbers in the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea. 
  The agricultural sector of Korea has hundreds of thousands 
of 
agro-technicians and experts. The average number of agronomists 
and assistant agronomists on each cooperative farm was above 60 
in 1990. 
  Korea has dependable training centres of agro-technicians. 
  There are full-time universities of agriculture and colleges 
under the study-while-working system in provincial capitals and 
major agricultural zones. 
  Wonsan University of Agriculture is the first training 
centre 
of agro-technicians founded in Korea in the post-liberation 
days. The university situated in the east coastal city of 
Wonsan has tens of departments and chairs, an institute of 
agricultural science, a doctors' course, a combined practice 
station and all other facilities for education. 
  It has produced tens of thousands of competent 
agro-technicians and dispatched them to the agricultural sector 
including institutes. 
  It has achieved tangible successes in scientific researches 
into breeding of new high-yield species, cultivation of crops, 
animal husbandry, mechanization of agriculture, pomiculture, 
sericulture, plants of economic value, etc. Greatly 
contributing to the development of agriculture and the national 
economy of the country. 
  The university is affiliated to the unesco and develops 
educational, scientific and cultural exchanges with foreign 
countries. 
  Many foreign students study at the university. 
  Kim Che-won University in Haeju City, South Hwanghae 
Province, a bread basket on the west coast, also holds a big 
share in the training of agro-technicians. 
  The university has produced many agro-technicians through 
full-time education and correspondence course and solved many 
scientific and technical problems in applying the chuche method 
of farming. 
  Unjon College of Agriculture situated in the Unjon plain 
extending 40 kilometres on the west coast is under the system of 
correspondence course. The students of the college are mainly 
farmers in Unjon County. 
  Theoretical lectures are given and practice is done on 
farms. 
  The state has set up colleges for education through 
correspondence course in Chongsan-ri, Yonan, Anak and Kaepung 
counties and other major granaries in order to fulfil the tasks 
of the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions in the 
countryside set out in the theses on the socialist rural 
question published in February 1964. 
  The training centres have hundreds of local study groups, in 
which teachers visit the students to give them lectures.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel Ramos with local </F>
and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I have signed 
Executive Order [EO] No. 160 today, entitled: Reducing the 
Special Duties of Crude Oil and Oil Products Prescribed in 
Executive Order No. 115, Series of 1993. 
  Whereas, EO No. 115, dated 24 July 1993, was issued to raise 
much-needed revenues to finance government infrastructure 
projects and social services programs; and, 
  Whereas, the legislative and the executive departments have 
identified legislative and executive measures to replace the oil 
levy under EO No. 115. 
  Now, therefore, I, Fidel V. Ramos, president of the Republic 
of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the 
Constitution, and the authority granted to me under Section 401 
of Presidential Decree No. 1464 as amended, do hereby order or 
ordain: 
  Section 1: Reduction of the special duty. The P [Philippine 
pesos] 1.90 special duty on imported crude oil falling under HS 
[expansion unknown] Heading No. 27.09, and the P2.00 special 
duty on imported oil products falling under HS Heading No. 27.10 
and 27.11, prescribed under EO No. 115 Series of 1993 and listed 
in Annex A thereof, are hereby reduced by P0.95 and P1.00 per 
liter, respectively, effective 1 January 1994. 
  Section 2: Repealing clause. All executive orders, rules, 
and regulations inconsistent with this executive order are 
hereby modified, amended, or repealed accordingly. 
  This executive order shall take effect after 30 days 
following the completion of its publication in two national 
newspapers of general circulation. 
  Done in the city of Manila, this 23d day of February, in the 
year of our Lord, 1994. Signed Fidel V. Ramos, by the 
president, Teofisto Guingona, executive secretary. 
  In effect, this lifts the P1.00 levy. And my statement in 
connection with this decision is as follows: 
  I have decided today to lift the P1.00 oil levy effective 1 
January 1994. I make this momentous decision in consideration 
of the plight of our people; their welfare has the top priority 
in our programs of government. But I also want to tell you that 
this decision challenges all of us to exert extraordinary 
individual and national effort to overcome our recurring 
resources problems for good. Progress and development have a 
cost to be paid. When the family budget for business is 
reduced, the business suffers before fresh funds come in to 
replenish -- and so it is with our national development. 
  According to our best estimates, the lifting of the P1.00 
levy will mean the delay of vital projects that could have 
generated 100,000 jobs, the deferment of the construction of 
some 5,000 schoolhouses, and the possible cancellation of some 
other vital infrastructure projects. But we can make do without 
the P1.00 levy as long as recurring alternative sources of 
revenue come in. 
  This decision also challenges us to strengthen our 
solidarity, for the real adversaries are poverty and injustice. 
And in the long run, what is paramount is that we lift the 
lives of our people so that they will have more job 
opportunities, better education, and a more healthful condition. 
  The seeds of increased unity have already been manifested in 
the wake of this urgency. We joined hands to address the 
problems of the day: The joint government-KRB [Kilusang 
Rollback -- Rollback Movement] committee working together in a 
genuine spirit of harmony despite differences; the executive and 
the legislative dialoguing patiently; the House and the Senate 
cooperating to enact needed measures; the businessmen and basic 
sectors helping each other; the NGO's [nongovernmental 
organizations] and government working hand-in-hand. So, let us 
continue this spirit of teamwork as we fight poverty and rebuild 
our beloved Philippines. 
  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] By lifting, Sir, the P1.00 oil 
levy, does that mean that you have already chosen the 
recommendations of the joint committee as to what sourcing you 
will get the replacement for this oil levy? 
  [Ramos] Yes, actually, we did not adopt everything in toto 
because there were other inputs that were derived from our 
patient, almost day-to-day dialogues with the Senate and the 
House, as well as other inputs coming from the public at large, 
because we also entertained them. And as we work on the 
combination of inputs during the last three days, we came out 
with the solution. 
  Insofar as the joint recommendation of the joint committee 
-- 
which was submitted by Secretary Guingona together with Senator 
Herrera, who are the joint co-chairpersons -- the following 
items were inputted into the so-called alternative sources: The 
reduction by 5 percent in government maintenance, operating, and 
other expenses without impairing social services; the generation 
of revenues by executive action under the so-called alien 
legalization effort; the increase in the stock transaction tax; 
the increase in the annual registration of luxury vehicles and 
recreational vehicles and the like; a tariff on non-essential 
items, or so-called zero- tariff items; as well as the 
correction in the tax exemption of married couples. 
  These were among the common recommendations of various 
sources -- including the joint government-KRB committee -- and 
also arising out of our meetings with the Senate and the House. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will this be enough? The 
amount, Sir -- will this be enough to cover the P10.5 billion? 
  [Ramos] As I mentioned in my statement, we can make do 
without the levy and recover some of the delays and setbacks in 
terms of still meeting the deadlines by the end of the year if 
the recurring alternative means will come in. That is why there 
are both executive actions which are one-time as well as 
recurrent and there are legislative measures that would ensure 
the recurrence of alternative sources of revenue. 
  I will not mention anymore the other one-time sources, 
because these were inputted in the consideration of the 1994 
proposed budget, such as privatization. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
Now that you announced the lifting of the oil levy, does this 
mean that a permanent oil price rollback is certain already? 
  [Ramos] Yes, that comes automatically. We will go back to 
the previous price levels. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And that is effective when, 
Sir? 
  [Ramos] Pardon? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] That is effective today? 
  [Ramos] Well, in other words, we go back to the levels of 
28 January. Yeah, of course -- effective right now. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So, now that, uh... 
  [Ramos, interrupting] That there will be no second wave, 
as some were speculating. [Word indistinct] it is the lifting 
of the one peso levy. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, can you give us your 
reaction to the threats of militant labor groups who are against 
the tax measures proposed by the joint committee? They still 
feel that this will burden the poor and still threaten to stage 
protest actions towards the end of the month and on 1 March. 
  [Ramos] The proposed tax measures are very progressive. 
For instance, the tax on luxury cars and the so-called affluent 
consumption. There's also one item I forgot to mention, because 
this came out of in a recent initiative, and this is the 
broadening of the value-added tax. Again, this is a progressive 
measure in that it is not intended to burden the lower classes. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Okay. Thank you, Sir. 
  [Ramos] Now, on the aspect of militant groups wanting to 
demonstrate. I have been a demonstrator and rallyist myself 
during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolution of 
1986. So we can be comfortable with that, and we will know how 
to handle it peacefully. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Breakaway communist leaders yesterday warned that 
new attacks will be unleashed against strategic targets if the 
government imposed new taxes in place of the P1 [Philippine 
pesos] oil levy. In a statement sent to media offices, Sergio 
Romero, commanding officer of the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB], 
reiterated his group's threat to "renew attacks" if no "complete 
and unconditional" rollback is implemented. 
  "It is unjust for the Filipino people the Ramos 
administration's move to force the enactment of new taxes as a 
replacement for the removal of the oil levy," Romero's statement 
said. "We will renew attacks if the government disregards the 
people's demands," Romero added, but refused to elaborate what 
kind of attacks the breakaway leftist hit squad is planning. 
  The ABB, which broke off from the leadership of Communist 
Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison, had 
claimed responsibility for the 1 February bombings of the 
offices of Shell and Petron in Makati, and Caltex in Manila. 
  Two security guards of Petron were reported hurt in the 
bombings, which police said was carried out by four unidentified 
men using dynamites. 
  The government panel in a 14-man committee looking for 
alternatives to the levy has recommended new taxes to replace 
the levy which President Ramos imposed last September. But 
members of the Kilusang Rollback [KRB; Rollback Movement], a 
multi-sectoral coalition opposed to the price increase, rejected 
the proposed new taxes. 
  Leaders of the Freedom from Debt Coalition, one of the 
groups 
under the KRB, said the government could find alternatives to 
the levy without passing new taxes. 
  According to Romero, the collection of additional taxes is a 
scheme to circumvent the people's demands for a rollback of 
petroleum prices. Romero added that new taxes are a different 
form of oppression. He urged the Ramos administration to "stop 
blackmailing" the people, roll back oil prices unconditionally, 
and refrain from implementing measures that will only further 
burden the people. 
  The ABB had warned it will bomb more offices and assassinate 
officials of the government and the International Monetary Fund 
if prices were not rolled back permanently. But ABB leaders 
later said they were temporarily halting all armed operations 
while various people's organizations are protesting in the 
streets against the price increase. 
  In its statement, the ABB also criticized the government for 
allegedly spreading distorted news that linked the armed group 
to terrorist acts, like the rumored planned bombings of oil 
depots and other facilities in the Visayas, and the reported 
coordination between the leftist rebel group and the rightist 
Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist 
Alliance]. "There is no other objective for these moves except 
to divide and divert the concentration of the widespread mass 
movement over the issue of oil and to smear our ranks," Romero 
said. 
  Police intelligence reports claimed communists in the 
Visayas 
planned to bomb power plants, oil depots, and other strategic 
targets in the region if the government again raised oil prices. 
Based on the report, the Philippine National Police placed all 
police units on alert in the entire Visayas. Police personnel 
were sent to guard places likely to be targets of the bombings. 
But the standing committee of the CPP Visayas Commission denied 
the report, saying it is a "blatant lie." Indio Pluma, spokesman 
of the CPP territorial commission, said the report was just a 
"black propaganda" against communist rebels in the Visayas. 
  Breakaway communist leaders also branded as a lie a report 
quoting an unnamed leader of the rightist military rebels as 
saying the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa provided a cache 
of explosives to the ABB in 1990.

  [Text] Malacanang on Tuesday [22 February] set in motion 
action plans for the early implementation of the East Asean 
Growth Area, or EAGA. The EAGA is an original project initiated 
by the Philippines and vigorously pursued by President Ramos 
during his state visits to Indonesia and Malaysia, two members 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which have 
expressed keen interest, along with Brunei. 
  The president signed a memorandum circular which set in 
motion the policy of increased cooperation among the 
participating countries in trade, investments, 
telecommunications, and tourism. Executive Secretary Teofisto 
Guingona Jr. said that with this circular's issuance, senior 
economic officials of the four countries can now proceed with 
the signing of a memorandum of understanding to formalize EAGA 
establishment and define their participation in the project. 
  In the memorandum circular, President Ramos ordered the 
Departments of Foreign Affairs [DFA]; Trade and Industry; 
Transportation and Communications [DOTC]; Tourism; Agriculture 
and Environment and Natural Resources; National Economic and 
Development Authority; Coordinating Council for Philippine 
Assistance Program; and other concerned agencies to identify 
strategies and initiate programs to promote EAGA. 
  The DFA was directed to set specific guidelines for the 
exchange of delegations and visits between government agencies 
and local government delegations with their counterparts in the 
EAGA; coordinate with Congress for the formulation of guidelines 
in the exchange of parliamentary delegations; coordinate 
activities related to Philippine participation in the EAGA, 
particularly those with diplomatic implications. On the other 
hand, the DOTC was ordered to, among others, initiate a meeting 
of civil aviation and airline officials of the four 
participating countries to draw up the basic terms of reference 
for the proposed Borneo, Mindanao, Sulawesi transnational air 
service system; initiate a meeting of shipping and port 
officials of the four countries to study the feasibility of 
establishing regular passenger and cargo shipping services in 
the EAGA.

  [Text] General Wimon Wongwanit, the Army 
commander-in-chief, granted an interview to reporters after 
presiding over activities marking the anniversary of the 
military intelligence unit this morning. 
  He discussed the fact that the director of the Army 
Intelligence Department filed a lawsuit against General Vang 
Pao, head of the Lao National Liberation Front. He said that, 
in essence, the Thai armed forces only want to officially record 
the charge regarding his illegal acts, so that it can be used as 
evidence if this man is arrested when he enters Thailand in the 
future. This is because a group of people has carried out 
activities along the Thai border and caused trouble for Thai 
people in the area. Their recruiting activities have created 
conflicts between Thailand and other friendly countries. They 
have also caused trouble for people in other countries by 
collecting money from Lao immigrants in the United States and 
claiming the money will be used to support Lao national 
liberation activities, using Thai territory. The Thai armed 
forces cannot allow this. As to whether any Thais have joined 
this movement, the Thai Army chief said he did not think so. 
However, some Hmong living along the border may have, he said. 
  On purchasing weapons from our trading partners by bartering 
Thai agricultural goods, Gen. Wimon said that an understanding 
has been reached by all parties concerned. Press reports, 
however, have indicated that the military does not understand 
the barter system. In fact, once a decision is made by the 
cabinet, it should be regarded as law. Therefore it must be 
practiced as long as clear explanations are provided regarding 
the amount of money required and methods to be followed. Then 
there would be no problems. Personally, he said, he agrees with 
anything that benefits poor people.

  [Text] Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet 
yesterday welcomed the Government's arms-through-barter 
requirement saying the policy would greatly benefit the people 
and the country if effectively implemented. 
  Downplaying the previous military criticism that the 
requirement would hinder the armed forces' arms acquisition 
process, Adm Prachet said the requirement represented a new 
policy and it should be welcomed as it would be beneficial to 
the country. Adm Prachet said that soldiers in democratic 
societies had no choice but to respect and obey and the 
Government's policy. [sentence as published] "In the democratic 
system, government officials have to follow the Government's 
policy and soldiers have to know their exact role in the 
system," said Adm Prachet, who will retire in 1996. 
  The Navy commander said it was understandable that the 
Government's barter trade policy has caused confusion during its 
initial period. "Now the misunderstanding has been resolved. 
Initially, there are different views on the issue but now we 
have a clear understanding," explained the Navy commander. He 
said he was optimistic that problems would not occur during the 
implementation of the policy in acquiring arms. "There should be 
no problem," said the Navy commander. 
  He said under the government barter trade policy the armed 
forces had to separately submit their arms acquisition plans to 
the Cabinet for approval should it exceeded 1 billion baht. 
  Adm Prachet said he was optimistic that the Cabinet would 
give its final approval during its next meeting to the Navy's 
proposal to buy a new fleet of attacker A-7 Corsairs from the 
United States. He said the attacker was part of the Navy's 
development plan which would cost about 2,000 million baht.

<F P=106> [From the "Lighting Rod" column: "Will the Military Cause </F>
Trouble Again?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The cabinet recently decided 
that from now on, every purchase of weapons for the armed forces 
will be made through "barter trade." In other words, we will 
trade our products, mostly agricultural goods, for weapons. 
Formerly, the armed forces were allowed to make purchases of 
weapons, planes, and military hardware through the Defense 
Ministry and government. [passage omitted] 
  As feedback from the military top brass, the commanders of 
the three armed forces voiced their discontent over this new 
policy during a meeting chaired by Supreme Commander Air Chief 
Marshal Woranat Aphichari. They said that the barter of crops 
for weapons will be a very complicated and time consuming 
process and the military have no expertise in trade. They also 
fear that the weapons or aircraft they receive from bartering 
with agricultural products will be costly and inapplicable to 
their requirements. 
  In short, the armed forces feel that they are being pressed 
by the government. Frankly speaking, if the military top brass 
or professional soldiers, who have so far been fairly quiet, 
react against the policy, some will accuse them of trying to 
rock the boat again. A few might think that politicians are 
creating conditions for certain objectives. Some even claim that 
this barter trade policy will also be applied to other big 
projects such as the elevated electric train system. 
  It is a fact that the armed forces need weapons and war 
equipment for national defense. However, they must also take 
the country's financial position into their consideration. They 
cannot go out and choose whatever they want as in the past. All 
military equipment is expensive. So they must make sure that 
the people's tax money is spent wisely. 
  I believe that leaders of the military units are "career 
soldiers." Their reaction, however, in connection with the arms 
barter policy does not look good at all. The fact is that they 
do not understand some details of the policy. 
  The government should be blamed for failing to clearly 
explain the policy to all concerned. This is Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai's style, who always leaves something for others in 
the ministries concerned to tackle. Prime Minister Chuan should 
have clarified the new policy for everyone from the beginning. 
However, he passed the ball to Defense Minister General Wichit 
Sukmak. He is good at making all sorts of comments or criticisms 
against other people. Ironically, he said very little about 
this policy. It is possible that he himself does not quite 
understand it. 
  As a matter of fact, there is nothing difficult about this 
policy. For example, when a branch of service wants to buy 
weapons from a foreign country, it must first inform the 
government. The government will then review trade between 
Thailand and the country from which they wish to buy the weapons 
before holding negotiations to see if the country wants any 
agricultural products from us. We may even bargain to have them 
buy our crops. The point is that we get their weapons and at the 
same time sell them our goods. 
  However, it should not be implied that this barter policy 
will be used with small purchases worth two or three million 
baht. 
  The government failed to spell out all the details of the 
policy, while the military is frustrated in its attempt to get 
things clearly explained and understood. And reporters are 
accused of presenting inaccurate reports as if the military top 
brass and people in government circles could do no wrong.

  [Text] Sympathy goes to Army Commander General Wimon 
Wongwanit, who said publicly that there was confusion in the 
government's policy of bartering agricultural products for 
foreign arms. He said soldiers are not businessmen and 
therefore do not have barter skills. The army commander's frank 
remark reflects a problem between the military and the 
government. That problem is lack of good coordination, which 
has created a gap of understanding and brought on reports about 
the military's anxiety over the government's policy. 
  Frankly, the cabinet's decision on arms barter is worthy of 
support. Apparently, there is flexibility in the policy's 
principle. It is unlikely that the policy requires that a 
billion baht worth of rice is to be bartered straight for an 
aircraft of the same value. It probably means that the 
government selling the plane should facilitate the purchase of 
our agricultural products. 
  A recent example comes to mind. The Air Force wants to buy 
Italian G-222 transport planes and the Italian side is coming 
here to pursue the matter. The government should inform the Air 
Force that Italy has enjoyed considerable trade surplus with us 
and has set a very high standard for import of agricultural 
products. This virtually negates any chance for any Thai 
imports. Now that the Air Force wants Italian planes, the Thai 
Government should be able to bargain with the Italian Government 
to open its market for Thai agricultural products. 
  This is a principle in negotiating arms barter. The issue is 
coordination between the government, comprising the officials 
concerned -- the commerce, agriculture, foreign and defense 
ministers -- and the military services. Therefore, the 
government should send its representatives to meet with the 
armed forces to explain the government's principle. The absence 
of such meeting has created an issue, as reflected in the 
remarks by the supreme commander and the army commander. 
  Coordination is important and the government must quickly 
bring it about. Without it there will be misunderstanding, as 
is in the case of the arms barter issue. The absence of 
coordination will lead to skepticism and confusion even in 
purchase of small amount of arms, such as whether barter is to 
be applied in purchase of artillery shells. A consultation will 
eliminate misunderstandings. The absence of coordination is what 
caused the military officials to express their skepticism.

  [Text] Thailand and Laos have agreed to set up a joint 
committee to oversee jurisdiction problems on the Thai-Lao 
Mittraphap bridge, ending a year-long impasse over the issue 
which jeopardized the April opening of the first bridge across 
the Mekong river. 
  They also resolved to use the deepest point of the river to 
demarcate the international boundary on the bridge. The 
Thai-Laotian boundary on the bridge will thus continue to be the 
same line as the boundary in the river, as insisted by Thai 
negotiators. The agreement was reached yesterday at a meeting 
between Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian 
counterpart Somsavat Lengsavat. Somsavat had stopped over in 
Bangkok on his way to Europe for an official visit which will 
take him to France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Russia. 
The setting up of the joint committee will be followed up when 
Somsavat returns from his European tour on March 10. 
  The committee will be in charge of ruling in disputes 
regardless of which side of the bridge they may have occurred. 
But the Thai side of the committee will take responsibility for 
incidents involving Thai nationals and vice versa. Problems 
involving nationals of other countries will be ruled jointly by 
the committee. 
  Both ministers yesterday also signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) on the Development of Luang Prabang Airport. 
The MoU detailed a plan for the development and reconstruction 
of the airport which is expected to cost about Bt [baht] 50 
million. The project will cover the construction of a passenger 
terminal building. The Department of Civil Aviation and the 
Ministry of Communications will start bidding procedures in 
order to select a suitable Thai construction company to 
undertake the work which is scheduled to begin in May and should 
be completed within 18 months.

  [Text] Nakhon Phanom Province Governor Sucharit Patchimnan 
disclosed that he had received a letter from the United Tour 
Company about the difficulties and inconveniences it encountered 
in organizing a package tour to Thakhek Township in Khammouane 
Province, Laos. Sucharit said he had contacted Khammouane 
Province Governor Inpong Sai-gnavong for clarification on this 
issue. 
  The Thai-owned United Tour Company cited many 
inconveniences, 
including the collection of border passage fees by the Lao 
authorities and the intended monopolization of the tourism 
industry in the Lao province. 
  The governor of Nakhon Phanom Province said that the 
provincial authority, together with the provincial Tourism 
Office, are trying to solve the problem in such a way that 
relations between the two countries will not be affected. Laos 
is in the process of changing many policies, and new regulations 
might be adopted. 
  Phairot Prokkaeo, director of Nakhon Phanom Province's 
Tourism Office, said that this is the first complaint about 
unfair treatment of Thai tour agencies by the Lao authorities. 
His office is waiting for more information from the Lao side. 
The solution to the problem might require joint efforts by the 
governors of the two neighboring provinces. Considering the 
nature of the problem, there could be some misunderstanding 
between the United Tour Company and the Lao authorities. 
  A tourist industry source in Nakhon Phanom Province revealed 
that two tour agencies -- namely Siphanom Tour and United Tour 
Companies -- are operating in the province, while the governor 
of Khammouane Province plans to set up a provincial tour agency 
to be officially called the Khammouane Tourism Company. The two 
Thai companies will be required to maintain regular contact with 
the Lao company in sending tourists to Khammouane Province.

  [Text] The National Security Council [NSC] has decided to 
ban a request by the Vietnamese to present a cultural exhibition 
in the northeastern region. It also set stringent measures for 
dealing with hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers. 
The NSC reasoned that Thailand and Vietnam do not have a 
cultural exchange agreement and felt that a cultural performance 
should be staged in the capital.

<F P=106> [Letter from Wirasak Futrakun, Thai Ambassador to Burma, </F>
published in the "Letters" section] 
  [Text] In the column, "Burma Notes", in your newspaper 
published Feb 5, in the section entitled, "Repatriation for 
students," it was stated that "The project (to repatriate the 
Burmese students) is said to be jointly worked out between 
powerful Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration Council] leader 
Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and the Thai diplomatic mission in Rangoon." 
In this connection, I wish to state categorically that there has 
never been any discussions about the Burmese students in 
Thailand between H.E. Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and me or any members of 
the Thai diplomatic mission in Yangon [Rangoon]. Furthermore, 
during the past two years since I have been the Thai Ambassador 
to the Union of Myanmar [Burma], no member of the Government of 
the Union of Myanmar has ever requested the Thai diplomatic 
mission in Yangon to do anything regarding the Myanmar students 
in Thailand. 1, therefore, hope that any fantasies of collusion 
between the Myanmar Government and the Thai diplomatic mission 
in Yangon to repatriate the Myanmar students in Thailand back to 
Myanmar will finally be put to rest. 
  However, I wish to remind the Myanmar students in Thailand 
that their continued presence in Thailand has been due to the 
humanitarian consideration of the Thai Government. Verbal 
attacks against the Thai Government by them will sap the 
humanitarian reservoir of Thailand. So will their political 
actions in Thailand against the Government of the Union of 
Myanmar, of which they may question the legitimacy, but which is 
a member of the United Nations and is recognized by the 
Government of Thailand: I do hope that the Myanmar students in 
Thailand will spend their time as guests here in our country 
investing in themselves in acquiring knowledge that will be of 
practical use in developing their country when the time comes 
for them to decide on their own will to return to their homeland.

  [Text] The Air Force yesterday won Cabinet approval for its 
planned use of forest land in Phuket to build a radar station, 
but with a condition that it must strictly comply with a 
10-point environmental measure. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai defended himself against 
accusations that the Cabinet's agreement to the Air Force 
request was aimed at appeasing the top brass in the wake of sour 
government-military relations caused by his firm stand on the 
"arms-through-barter" policy. "This is a different issue," Prime 
Minister Chuan said. "It's a question of necessity. Moreover, 
the land requested for the radar station site has already been 
encroached upon for rubber cultivation." 
  Under the Cabinet decision, the Air Force will be able to 
use 
27 rai of first-grade forest land in the Nak Koet Mountain Range 
in Katu District to build a radar station as part of its air 
surveillance system over the South. Prime Minister Chuan said 
the Cabinet's resolution to bar the use of first-grade forest 
land was still in force but the relaxation on the restriction 
was ordered for security reasons. The installation of the radar 
system would cost the Government thousands of millions of baht 
and the relaxation of the ban was made exclusively for security 
purposes, the premier added. 
  He said the Cabinet yesterday extensively debated the Air 
Force request, which was opposed by the Agriculture and 
Cooperatives Ministry and the Science, Technology and 
Environment Ministry which wanted to conserve the area for water 
catchment. The agriculture and science ministries as well as the 
National Environment Board have closely looked into the Air 
Force proposal and have drawn up a set of measures which the Air 
Force agreed to comply with. 
  The Air Force had previously studied two alternate sites at 
Hat Yai and Samui island before choosing Phuket, taking into 
consideration the investment as well as maintenance aspects. 
Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the Air Force, 
under the Cabinet's decision yesterday, would be allowed to cut 
a 2-km road into the site where the radar station would be 
located. 
  In using the spot, the Air Force must comply with the 
measure 
which requires that it: 
  -- Avoid levelling the landscape for the construction work; 
  -- Keep the road into the site as narrow as possible; 
  -- Prepare measures to prevent soil erosion which may be 
caused by the construction work; 
  -- Limit earth preparation work to the construction site. 
Dirt must be collected and properly disposed of; 
  -- Strictly look after the forest in the vicinity to 
prevent encroachment and fire 
  -- Plant trees to replace those to be cut down both in the 
construction site and the surrounding area; 
  -- Provide for a waste water treatment system; 
  -- Improve the landscape of the project site and the 
vicinity; 
  -- Build fences and a drainage system in and around the 
project site; and 
  -- Report on the progress in the implementation of all the 
measures to the science ministry every six months during the 
first three-year period. 
  Industry Minister Sanan Kachonprasat said the Cabinet agreed 
to approve the request after hearing a full explanation of the 
need for the facility. He also said the project would not cause 
damage to the national reserve as the chosen location was no 
longer forest land but had been used as a rubber plantation. 
  Maj-Gen Sanan also denied that the Cabinet had quickly 
approved the Air Force request to avoid further straining 
Government-military relations caused by last week's decision to 
reject the Air Force's request to forego a ruling requiring it 
to try negotiating with Italy to help buy some Thai farm goods 
in return for its plan to purchase six G222 transport planes.

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap has 
disclosed that he will go to the Philippines for negotiations 
with his Philippine counterpart on the sale of 400,000-500,000 
tons of Thai rice to that country. The Philippines is expected 
to buy 200,000 tons of 25-percent broken rice and 300,000 tons 
of 35-percent broken rice from Thailand. The Philippines will 
ask for a four- month credit for the purchase of this rice. If 
the negotiations are successful, the private sector will be 
allowed to carry out this rice deal, because the government does 
not intend to interfere in rice exports. 
  Chaiyot revealed that even with the delivery of 150,000 tons 
of Philippine fertilizer, the Philippines still owes Thailand 
some 475 million baht. The National Rice Policy Committee, he 
said, is responsible for this debt and will decide whether or 
not the Philippines should pay compensation to Thailand in case 
debt repayment is delayed. 
  Asked about the proposal made by Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai 
Wirawan, chairman of the National Rice Policy Committee, for 
Thai investors to pay the money they intend to invest in the 
Philippines to the committee and withdraw the same amount from 
the Philippine Government, Chaiyot said the proposal is 
practical and there should not be any problem with it. The 
deputy minister noted that the committee will take care of the 
debt while the Commerce Ministry pursues its efforts to sell 
Thai rice.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] urged North Korea to begin implementing its 
recent agreement to permit IAEA inspection of seven declared 
nuclear sites at the close of a board of governors' meeting here 
on Wednesday. 
  The UN nuclear watchdog warned that if Pyongyang fails to 
issue entry visas to IAEA inspectors by month's end, the 
director-general will call a special board meeting to discuss 
the issue. 
  North Korean Counselor Yun Ho-chin said his government had 
offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors to arrive in 
Pyongyang at a working-level meeting with the United States in 
New York on Tuesday. 
  The IAEA's 35-member board of governors ended its first 
regular meeting of 1994 here amid concerns about North Korea's 
delay in issuing visas for IAEA inspectors, releasing a 
statement calling on Pyongyang to follow up on its decision to 
allow IAEA inspections, including issuing the visas. 
  Board Chairman Ronald Walker said it had asked 
Director-General Hans Blix to immediately convene an 
extraordinary board meeting "in the absence of satisfactory 
developments in connection with the inspection, notably if a 
firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been 
settled by the end of this month." 
  A U.S. delegate said that in order for the third round of 
high-level U.S.-North Korea talks to take place, Pyongyang must 
meet all IAEA inspection requirements, adding that an 
extraordinary board meeting would likely resolve to turn over 
the issue to the UN Security Council. 
  Over 40 national delegates spoke during the two-day meeting, 
many of them criticizing North Korea for failing to issue visas 
to IAEA inspectors by the final day. The IAEA moved the North 
Korean issue from the first-day agenda to the second day, hoping 
that Pyongyang would issue the visas by then. 
  Not only the West but also pro-North Korea nations, such as 
Cuba and Syria, have charged Pyongyang with trying to resolve 
the nuclear issue outside the IAEA, linking the matter to 
improving relations with the United States, IAEA sources said. 
  Speaking at the meeting, North Korean delegate Yun warned 
that if the IAEA continued to apply "unreasonable pressure" on 
North Korea, it would invite "grave results, including 
cancellation of the decision to suspend withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." But Yun, disclosing his 
government had offered March 1 as the date for IAEA inspectors 
to arrive in Pyongyang at the meeting with the U.S. Government 
in New York on Tuesday, said visas would be issued on Thursday 
at the earliest, depending on the results of another North 
Korea-U.S. contact in New York on Wednesday. 
  Noting that Pyongyang must still negotiate the U.S. demand 
for an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea 
as a condition for further high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, 
the North Korean delegate warned his government would reconsider 
its decision to accept IAEA inspections if a special IAEA board 
of governors meeting was held. 
  The meeting adopted a resolution urging North Korea to 
implement its Feb. 15 agreement to allow IAEA inspections of its 
declared nuclear facilities and meet all obligations of the 
nuclear safeguards pact, including permission to inspect 
undeclared nuclear sites.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government will propose to North Korea that a working-level 
meeting be held on exchanging special envoys if Pyongyang issues 
visas to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors on 
Friday. 
  The decision was made as Pyongyang expressed hope that Seoul 
would take the initiative in resuming inter-Korean dialogue at 
working-level meetings with the United States in New York on 
Wednesday and Thursday, informed sources said. 
  If North Korea and the United States reach agreement at 
their 
meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will call a high- 
level strategic meeting to prepare a telephone message to his 
North Korean counterpart offering to hold the fourth 
working-level meeting on exchanging special envoys. 
  The message under consideration is expected to call for a 
working-level contact on the southern side of the truce village 
of Panmunjom early next month. 
  In line with the working-level meeting, informed sources 
said, Seoul will reportedly announce suspension of the annual 
South Korea- U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" provided that 
North Korea cooperates fully with International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspection activities and shows sincerity toward 
inter-Korean dialouge. 
  Pyongyang and Washington met again in New York on Thursday 
to 
continue discussions on follow-up measures to North Korea's 
acceptance of IAEA inspections. 
  The two are said to be near a compromise and may announce a 
set of agreements after meeting on Friday.

  [Text] New York, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- Sounding an 
unprecedentedly optimistic note, South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam said on Wednesday he was "very sure that in the end 
North Korea will accept the nuclear inspections" demanded by the 
international community in an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES 
[NYT]. Kim told TIMES reporter David Sanger at the Chongwadae 
presidential mansion in Seoul that he had received a mountain of 
information about the nuclear issue over the last few weeks. 
Based on this information, Korea's chief executive has concluded 
there is no clear evidence yet that North Korea possesses 
nuclear weapons. 
  He observed that it was a "wise opinion" for Washington to 
delay the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, 
referring to testimony in Congress on Tuesday by Gen. John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who 
said the deployment was likely to be held up because it would 
provide the North Koreans with an excuse to derail the process 
of resolving the nuclear problem. 
  He defended Seoul's alleged frequent shifts from sounding 
hawkish to dovish on the North and corrected the description of 
"inconsistency" on its policy to "tactical flexibility". The 
basic strategy being pursued by Seoul and Washington -- 
convincing the North that there are economic and political 
advantages to abandoning its nuclear weapons program -- "is 
proving quite effective," Kim noted. "This is only the beginning 
of the solution to the problem," he said, adding that 
inter-Korean dialogue and completion of nuclear inspections, 
including the North's two undeclared sites, would be necessary 
before Pyongyang could begin to receive aid and investment. 
  The U.S. daily labeled Kim's comments as the most optimistic 
assessment yet of the nuclear issue and a sharp turnaround from 
just eight months ago, when he warned the United States against 
being "led" by North Korea and declared that "time is running 
out" as the Stalinist regime would be able to produce plutonium 
by early 1994 in large enough quantities to make nuclear weapons. 
  Kim appeared to be betting that his best strategy is to 
reward the North for the first glimmerings of flexibility, 
rather than immediately pressing for better access to its 
nuclear sites now that the communist country has started to 
finally come around on allowing the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) to conduct inspections, the newspaper said. THE 
TIMES reported that Kim spoke expansively about the reforms his 
government has initiated to cure what he called "the Korean 
disease" since his inauguration a year ago. The military was "a 
club that only rewarded its own members," Kim said, explaining 
his removal of all generals involved in coups from the 1960s and 
1980s. Using the legitimacy gained from having garnered 42 
percent of the vote in a three-way election, Kim said he has 
steered the military back to its defense mission and away from 
politics, adding that military morale is high now. 
  The paper reported that Kim's critics, whose numbers are 
few, 
say his biggest failing is that his reform efforts have yet to 
trickle down through most layers of Korean society.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yi Chong-yon, editorial director of SEOUL </F>
SINMUN] 
  [Text] We could hear, in the early stage, sporadic reports 
on Washington's quite strong countermeasures to North Korea's 
irritating nuclear game [haek norum] of stalling for time by 
going in and out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
for almost the past year. 
  The United States has made a strategic conclusion 
[chollyakchogin mamurirul chikko] by deciding to overlook the 
past, whether or not North Korea currently possesses nuclear 
weapons, and not to allow its additional production of nuclear 
weapons from now on. At the same time, it decided to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK. This 
seems to be the first-step countermeasure mapped out by 
Washington with no other particular idea. 
  I do not know whether the ROK's invariable principle on and 
concrete countermeasures to the North Korean nuclear game are 
what have already been tuned by the ROK and the United States, 
but I know from reports that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has 
successfully persuaded Washington to attempt a peaceful approach 
to the issue. North Korea, however, is a group that believes in 
a logic based on strength, and it only forces its negotiation 
partner not supported by strength to make endless concessions. 
We know this well through experience. 
  I am concerned about our easy-going attitude just like 
adjusting our neckties without recognizing that our trouser legs 
are getting wet in the rain dropping from the "imitation nuclear 
umbrella [yusa haek usan]" carried by North Korea as we are 
accustomed to the comfort of the protection under the large U.S. 
nuclear umbrella. 
  Regarding our government's position, Minister Han Sung-chu 
said in New York: "Our government does not care even if North 
Korea possesses nuclear weapons now. The nuclear weapons it 
possesses can be abolished [pyegi] or dismantled [haeche], like 
those of South Africa. Our government's negotiations with North 
Korea are not aimed at inquiring into the past, but will focus 
on North Korea's future intent." If North Korea had already 
been acquitted for its possession of nuclear weapons only by 
going in and out of the NPT over the issue regarding the method 
of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
without mentioning whether it possesses nuclear weapons or not, 
it would be needless to even predict if it is possible to 
abolish or dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons in the future. 
  Minister Han's remarks that our government does not care 
about the past seem to be an iteration of the U.S. policy, not 
our government's own idea or countermeasure. The U.S. 
countermeasure is considered a strategic arrangement linked to 
its far-reaching scheme to pave the way for the 21st century, 
foreseeing the future of Northeast Asia. The United States 
never wants its influence upon the Korean peninsula, including 
North Korea, to be weakened, nor will it allow China, Russia, or 
Japan to hold sway over Northeast Asia. I think we need to 
seriously study [koryo] if it is the best strategy in the 
reality we face now to accept and follow this countermeasure 
based on the U.S. strategy. 
  Although it seems that the United States has put forward 
such countermeasures against North Korea on the assumption that 
either special inspection or simultaneous inspection of the 
North and South would not be easily carried out, it is possible 
for us -- who are the party concerned to separately hold 
negotiations with North Korea -- to be placed in a difficult 
position when we agree upon the proposal. 
  What is important here is, I think, that we need to 
carefully 
watch out the IAEA's attitude toward North Korea. The IAEA led 
by Director-General Hans Blix, who served as Swedish foreign 
minister, has adhered to its strong position that it would not 
make an exception of the nuclear inspections of North Korea in 
accordance with the basic principle that contributes to 
maintaining global peace, as well as to ensuring nuclear 
nonproliferation throughout the world. Also, it has raised an 
objection to the United States' attitude to be flexible in 
dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue in order to maintain 
its continual influence against North Korea and to keep the 
continuity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which will be 
terminated in 1995. North European member-countries -- such as 
Norway and Sweden, including Director-General Hans Blix himself 
-- have said that although the socialist ruling parties were in 
sympathy with North Korea at one time when they were in power, 
there were some points upon which they had doubts about North 
Korea because of its power system character, continuous tricks, 
and stickiness on the nuclear weapon program. They have also 
continued their consistent demands that North Korea abide by the 
IAEA's basic principles. France's L'ARMEMENT has carried an 
editorial saying that "we must not be optimistic about the 
future of the North Korean nuclear issue mainly because North 
Korea has accepted nuclear inspections, but rather be aware that 
the only resolute and consistent attitude is the very effective 
factor in maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula." Despite 
such editorials by the French paper, South Korea, which is 
directly threatened by North Korea, has been hesitant to resolve 
the nuclear issue. We wonder if the government has really a 
firm policy or consistent and basic principle to cope with the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Considering the fact that North Korea's nuclear threat may 
be 
continuously offensive against us, we must take our action and, 
with it, make North Korea become aware that their nuclear weapon 
development will be an intolerable burden to them. Judging from 
the ongoing contacts between the ROK and the United States to 
deal with the North Korean nuclear issue or the ROK people's 
feeling against it, however, I don't think it is possible for 
the government to take any action against North Korea. 
  Under this reality, the ROK's dependency upon the United 
States cannot but be continuously deepened. The government must 
know, however, that there are some people who regard the United 
States as an unwelcome friendly country. We must pay attention 
to it. 
  Also, we must keep in our mind the fact that we can avoid 
making repeated mistakes only if we fully learn something from 
our history. We must not develop our demands into the senseless 
stickiness to the nuclear issue, but instead remember the fact 
that the agreements reached between the North and South have 
been so far kept in dead storage. Therefore, we can say that 
"there are only broken agreements between the North and South at 
present."

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
ease restrictions on visits to North Korea by South Korean 
businessmen in view of recent developments in the North Korean 
nuclear issue, officials said Monday. The government would also 
relax regulations for South Korean businessmen wishing to set up 
pilot business ventures in North Korea if the nuclear problem 
was resolved, they said. 
  Seoul is studying a revision of its stance on inter-Korean 
economic cooperation to allow business contacts "when 
South-North dialogue makes significant progress." Until now, it 
had maintained it would allow inter-Korean business contacts 
only "when a breakthrough in the nuclear issue was found." The 
new government policy would represent a considerable relaxation 
on other pre-conditions that call for Pyongyang's return to the 
Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty, acceptance of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] ad hoc and special 
inspections, an inter-Korean agreement on simultaneous 
inspections of each other's nuclear facilities and reactivation 
of the South-North joint nuclear commission. 
  In addition, the government plans to relax conditions for 
South Korean businesses to establish small, pilot ventures in 
North Korea. Seoul had said it would only approve such ventures 
after the two Koreas conducted mutual inspections of their 
nuclear facilities and Pyongyang accepted special inspections by 
the IAEA. 
  The proposed changes are being contemplated to actively 
promote economic cooperation with Pyongyang while maintaining 
Seoul's original policy of linking inter-Korean economic 
cooperation with the nuclear issue. If the current government 
policy was maintained, it is possible that inter-Korean economic 
cooperation would be delayed considerably, one official said. 
"The government has decided to apply its economic cooperation 
policy flexibly while watching North Korea's attitude closely," 
he said, asking for anonymity. 
  The official stressed, however, that the government would 
not 
separate the economic and nuclear issues because South Korea was 
committed to going along with its allies on the nuclear problem. 
Overall economic cooperation with North Korea could be possible 
only after suspicions about North Korea's nuclear intentions 
were cleared up, he added.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Nearly 200 Koreans and 
Japanese formed a "gathering to guarantee the lives and human 
rights of Korean returnees to North Korea" here on Sunday. The 
gathering was held amid revelations that ethnic Korean returnees 
to North Korea from Japan under the Pyongyang Government's 
repatriation project have been oppressed by authorities. 
  It pledged to investigate the living conditions of the 
returnees and their Japanese wives and children, and to appeal 
to the Japanese parliament and the United Nations to ensure that 
North Korea does not violate their human rights. 
  At the meeting, professor of Tokyo University Haruhisa Ogawa 
was reading a message to declare its purpose when some youths, 
who appeared to be members of Chochongnyon, a pro-Pyongyang 
organization of Korean residents in Japan, shouted "we can not 
understand the name of the meeting," and "it is an intervention 
in (North Korea's) internal affairs." 
  The North Korean Red Cross and its Japanese counterpart 
agreed to arrange for Korean residents of Japan to return to 
North Korea beginning in 1959, and nearly 93,000 people had 
since returned to Pyongyang by the end of 1984. Among them, 
nearly 6,000 Japanese were included, mainly the wives of Korean 
men. Recently, however, there have been reports that some of the 
returnees who did not cooperate with Pyongyang were killed or 
went missing on suspicion they were spies.

<F P=106> [By Pak Ui-chun] </F>
  [Text] It has been estimated that North Korea will 
concentrate its efforts in improving or restoring relations with 
strong neighboring countries, such as Japan, China, and Russia, 
this year while giving top priority to improving its relations 
with the United States. 
  The Institute of Foreign Affairs and Security, headed by Pak 
Su-kil, analyzes this in a report entitled "Prospect of Changes 
in North Korea" released on 23 February, and it stresses: "We 
should strengthen the position of the reformist forces [kaehyok 
chihyangjok seryoktul] in North Korea so that they can attempt 
to make drastic changes [kwagamhan pyonhwa] and should cooperate 
and support North Korea in developing its independent system 
[chajujogin cheje palchone]." 
  Regarding the possibility of changes in North Korea, which 
adheres to "socialism of its own style," the report anticipates 
that North Korea will reform itself starting from superior 
offices, gradually and partially; will pursue the policy of 
protecting its system; will hardly reform itself starting from 
lower offices; will undergo changes after Kim Il-song dies; and 
will suffer internal disputes after Kim Il-song's death. 
  The report says, in particular, that North Korea will 
probably concentrate efforts to level the ground internally and 
externally for consolidating the system of succession by Kim 
Chong-il and expand strategies for developing its system by 
opening its economy within a restricted scope, while laying 
greater emphasis on its chuche-based independent economic policy. 
  The report anticipates: "Kim Chong-il will continuously take 
measures of treating the military preferentially in order to 
consolidate the ground of forces on his side, and will keep 
exporting weapons in secret to solve economic problems." 
  It also expects: While adhering to a confederal system, 
North Korea will inevitably give more weight to maintaining and 
developing its system than to the southward revolution because 
of a durable situation of international reconciliation and 
cooperation. It is highly possible that North Korea will seek 
reunification policies, considering South Korea to be a 
potential coexisting partner, rather than a target to overthrow. 
  The report analyses: North Korea, however, will regard 
South-North dialogue as a subordinate variable [chongsok pyonsu] 
of North Korean-U.S. dialogue. It may make rapid progress in 
South-North dialogue, if necessary, and will finally attempt the 
resumption of South-North high-level talks. 
  Accordingly, it is possible that North Korea will expand 
South-North human exchanges within a strategic scope to protect 
its system. For the time being, however, it is hard to expect 
home visits and exchanges of letters by separated families, 
sightseeing tours, and permanent stationing of correspondents 
because North Korea will not allow any exchange affecting its 
system. 
  With the prospect of changes in North Korea, the report 
advises the government to consider disseminating its plan to 
pursue peaceful coexistence with North Korea as a partner after 
the nuclear issue is resolved, inducing North Korea's opening up 
in a way of multilateral economic cooperation, helping North 
Korea participate in the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Asia-Pacific region, and strengthening ROK-U.S. 
cooperative relations so as to make North Korea have an active 
attitude toward South-North dialogue while negotiating with the 
United States on the establishment of diplomatic relations.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea on Thursday 
denied as an "invented story" the recent report that more than 
100 North Korean loggers in Siberia were wishing to come to 
South Korea. According to the NAEWOE press, a radio Pyongyang 
broadcast said it is just unthinkable that North Korean people 
try to defect to South Korea. 
  "Our people remain convinced that away from the bosom of the 
Republic, they cannot live even a moment and there is no 
rewarding future for themselves and their descendants," it said. 
The broadcast said this was clearly evidenced by the case of Yi 
In-mo and two people's constabulary unit soldiers who, after 
being rescued by South Korea in the sea, chose to return to the 
North last month. Yi In-mo was a self-styled North Korean war 
correspondent caught in the South during the Korean war as a 
guerrilla fighter, who was sent back to the North last year on 
humanitarian grounds after refusing to change allegiance. The 
radio said that the report about the loggers is a "wild rumor" 
invented by South Korean authorities in their attempt to 
"placate South Korean people's anti-government struggles and 
distract public attention." 
  A Seoul government official said over the weekend that 
hundreds of North Korean loggers escaped from Pyongyang-run 
logging yards in Siberia and more than 100 of them came in 
contact with South Korean missions in Russia for permission to 
come to South Korea. About 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are 
known to work at Siberian logging yards under harsh conditions.

  [Text] The government plans to propose to the United States 
that Korean and U.S. atomic energy corporations advance to China 
and Southeast Asian nations in consortia. Such consortia would 
have competitive advantages in Asia when they put to use Korea's 
knowhow in the fields of the construction and operation of 
nuclear power plants in combination with core technologies of 
U.S. corporations, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 
said yesterday. 
  Cooperation in nuclear energy in third countries will be one 
of the most important agenda items at a bilateral conference on 
energy and environment scheduled for tomorrow and Saturday, the 
ministry said. 
  Korea is self-reliant for 93 percent of technology required 
for the construction of nuclear power plant, the ministry said. 
  The Korean delegation headed by Kim Tae-kon, assistant 
minister for energy and resources, will also propose the import 
of energy-saving and recycling technology from the United States 
and the dispatch of energy experts to Korea, it said. 
  The United States will be represented by John Riggs, 
principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, planning and 
program evaluation at the Department of Energy.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang said on Wednesday that if other countries retract or 
scale down concessional items envisaged in the Uruguary Round 
(UR) accord, South Korea would consider taking a corresponding 
step. 
  Testifying at the National Assembly session, Yi said his 
government would submit a market opening schedule to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after taking into account 
the contents of similar schedules to be submitted by major 
countries like the United States, Japan and the European Union 
(EU). 
  He thus implied that South Korea may revise its original 
market opening plan depending on the outcome of the on-going 
U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
  The premier said that so far most other countries are 
withholding their market opening schedules. "This is due to 
their policy to cope with the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade 
talks," Yi said. 
  Also speaking at the assembly floor, Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said that last year, South 
Korea recorded a deficit of about 5,040 million dollars in the 
trade of agricultural and fishery products. 
  He said exports amounted to some 2,750 million dollars and 
imports to 7,790 million dollars. 
  "We plan to boost farm and fishery goods exports by 
promoting, for instance, the shipment of large amounts of hog 
meat and Kimchi to the vast Japanese market," Kim said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang said yesterday that if 
other countries retract or scale down agreements of the Uruguay 
Round accord, South Korea will consider taking a corresponding 
step. Yi also said the administration will submit a market 
opening schedule to GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade) after taking into account the contents of similar 
schedules to be submitted by major countries like the United 
States, Japan and the European Union (EU). 
  The premier was answering questions at the fourth-day of the 
National Assembly interpellation of the administration on 
economic matters. He implied that South Korea may revise its 
original market opening plan depending on the outcome of the 
ongoing U.S.-Japan trade talks. The premier said that so far 
most other countries are withholding their market opening 
schedules. "This is due to their policy to cope with the 
outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade talks," Yi said. 
  Also speaking on the Assembly floor, Agriculture Minister 
Kim 
Yang-pae said last year South Korea recorded a deficit of about 
$5,040 million in the trade of agricultural and fishery products. 
  In a heated session, five lawmakers who took the floor 
called 
for additional steps to promote agriculture, to support small 
companies and to deregulate business activities. 
  Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the main opposition Democratic Party 
(DP) asked whether the government intends to negotiate with GATT 
member nations again over the multilateral agreement to 
partially open the domestic rice market which was agreed in the 
Uruguay Round trade talks. He noted that the United States and 
Japan are planning to hold talks to readjust agreements on trade 
in the agricultural field while delaying submitting their plans 
to implement UR accords. 
  Kim demanded that the government invest more money in 
developing agriculture, charging that the 1.5 trillion won 
earmarked this year for restructuring the farming sector is far 
short of what is needed to implement government projects 
including farm mechanization. 
  Rep. Pak U-pyong said the Foreign Ministry should be 
expanded 
so that the ministry's function could include external trade 
affairs. He also suggested lowering interest rates to relieve 
manufacturing industries of financial burdens and contribute to 
strengthening their international competitiveness. 
  Rep. Pak Chong-hun of the DP suspected that there may be 
political motives behind the selection of the chief contractor 
for the second mobile telecommunication business. 
  "The government handed over the right to select the winner 
to 
the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). But actually, the 
government had already decided to choose Kolon as the main 
contractor in a secretive manner," Pak insisted. He also called 
for the government to overhaul the current taxation system in 
order to relieve wage earners of their high tax burden. He 
contended that the tax system runs counter to the principle of 
equity by imposing a low tax levels on those living off unearned 
incomes. 
  O Chang-sop of the DLP said the nation's industries should 
be 
restructured so that the manufacturing sectors could be a key 
industry in achieving the nation's goal of boosting its 
competitive power. 
  "In addition, administrative regulation son economic 
activities should be eased," O said. 
  Finally, he called for the government to expand tax favors 
to 
private companies which have been eager to develop new 
technologies.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korean farm 
products contain fewer pesticides than imports and are thus much 
safer, according to the Rural Development Administration's 
Agricultural Chemicals Research Institute. Tests conducted on 
840 samples of 11 farm products including rice, apples, 
strawberries, cucumbers and pears from 1990 to 1992 revealed 
that 55 percent of the samples contained farm chemicals in 
amounts below the permissible levels, the institute announced on 
Thursday. No organic chlorine-series chemicals causing chronic 
poisoning were found in the rice samples produced in 1990, while 
organic phosphorus- and carbamate-series chemicals, which are 
easily digested by the human body, were detected in amounts 
below the permissible levels. 
  In 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected, in 
tests of 5,816 samples of grain, fruit and vegetables produced 
in the United States, chemicals in 36.8 percent of the samples, 
with the chemicals in 1.2 percent being in amounts above 
permissible levels. 
  The institute's director, Yi Kun-chong, said Korean 
agricultural products were healthy because of farmers' 
observance of standards for safe use of pesticides established 
in 1980. In Korea, no pesticides are applied to farm products 
after they are harvested, while some foreign countries use 
chemicals on their farm products after the harvest to prevent 
decomposition or keep them pest-free during storage or shipment 
for export. Yi said his institute would strive to develop safer 
agricultural chemicals for safer farm products.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have completely agreed on the conclusion of a bilateral double 
taxation prevention agreement, which was initialed in Beijing on 
Thursday. A Finance Ministry official said the agreement will be 
formally signed during President Kim Yong-sam's official visit 
to China toward the close of next month. 
  The agreement, consisting of 29 articles and a memorandum, 
will, among other things, allow South Korean industries active 
in China at least the same treatment as accorded to Chinese 
industries in terms of taxation. The agreement is expected to go 
into force late this year after being ratified by the National 
Assembly. The accord was initialed by Om Nak-yong, a Finance 
Ministry director, and Zhang Xanghai, deputy director of China's 
State Administration of Taxation, following their final-round 
negotiations since Feb. 20, the official said.

  [Text] Beijing, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Woosung business 
group, a leading business conglomerate of South Korea, will 
build and operate an international school here in Beijing. 
Woosung will set up an international school of elementary and 
secondary school courses in a joint venture with the Beijing 
Joint Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Corp., a public firm 
controlled by the Beijing municipality. 
  A basic agreement on the school project was signed by the 
two 
partners in a brief ceremony here on Thursday. Ground is 
expected to be broken within the year for the construction of 
school facilities. Under the agreement, the two sides will 
equally invest 30 million dollars in the scheme. The school, 
capable of accommodating about 1,000 students, will be located 
at a 16,500-square-meter land in the Chaoyang Ward District in 
downtown Beijing. Choe Song-chin, vice group chairman, said here 
the two sides also agreed to build apartments, arcades and 
tennis courts around the school.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The trade imbalance, 
anti-dumping suits and import barriers were discussed at a South 
Korea-Mexico joint committee session in Mexico City this week, 
the first round since the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) took effect this year, the Foreign Ministry said 
Thursday. Mexican officials voiced concern over the growing 
trade imbalance in Seoul's favor and requested that South Korea 
lift restrictions on importing Mexican liquor, poultry and 
fruit, ministry officials said. 
  Seoul raised the issue of the growing number of anti-dumping 
investigations into Korean products in Mexico and asked for 
assurance that the probes be unbiased. It also brought up 
Mexican limits on quota imports and its customs tariffication 
system, naming them as trade barriers. 
  South Korea pressed Mexico to reach early conclusion of an 
investment protection accord to activate bilateral investment 
activities but the Mexicans reacted negatively, officials said. 
  The two countries initialed a telecommunications cooperation 
pact and agreed to hold talks in the near future while 
scheduling maritime negotiations for mid-March.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Home Affairs 
Ministry, investigating misappropriation of charity funds by 
local autonomous governing bodies and central government 
agencies, disclosed Thursday that more of such cases exist than 
was previously known. 
  The Ministry said that many local autonomous governing 
bodies 
besides the six cities and counties in Kyonggi Province, in 
which misappropriation cases had already been revealed by the 
Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), used charity funds 
contributed by the public for other purposes between 1991 and 
1993. The BAI announced Tuesday that heads of central government 
agencies and local autonomous governing bodies had used charity 
funds intended for the poor as "confidential expenses" or for 
other reasons. 
  The Home Ministry has decided to begin a full-fledged 
investigation into 46 government agencies and local autonomous 
bodies in which the Board of Audit and Inspection has already 
exposed scandals. The Ministry is also studying ways to expand 
inspection by the BAI to include 275 local autonomous governing 
bodies, citing the principle of equity. It plans to rebuke 
public servants found guilty of committing irregularities and 
misappropriating charity funds who are uncovered by the BAI.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- Army generals belonging 
to "Hanahoe," a private club of some graduates of the Korea 
Military Academy with close links to Former Presidents Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, and several top navy officers facing 
age-limit discharges late this year have reportedly been asked 
to leave voluntarily before the routine personnel changes in 
April. 
  Personnel officers from Navy Headquarters met up to seven 
officers with the rank of rear admiral and commodore, who face 
age-limit discharge in December, and asked if they would step 
down voluntarily in advance, navy sources said Thursday. The 
concerned rear admirals responded to the request with anger, 
labeling it "forced discharge," the sources said. 
  "The military personnel law sets the age limit of rear 
admirals at six years and says the age-in-grade of general 
officers can be extended for up to one year when their service 
is required," said one officer allegedly asked to leave. 
  "We cannot accept such a proposal that not only dampens 
military morale, but which is also against the status guarantee 
of professional soldiers," another officer said. 
  They reacted strongly to the move by navy authorities, 
saying 
they could be mistaken for the targets of a purge in connection 
with irregularities and thus would have difficulty finding 
another job. 
  In the army as well, some 10 senior generals belonging to 
Hanahoe, who were pushed into inactive posts or relieved of 
their duties early last year, have reportedly been asked to 
leave voluntarily because there are no available positions. 
Most are said to have taken a dim view of the request for 
"voluntary discharge" and demanded as a condition for their 
voluntary discharge that discrimination against 
field-grade-level members of Hanahoe be withdrawn. 
  Army and navy authorities said the request for early 
discharge was part of efforts to reduce the number of generals, 
whose ranks had expanded in the past administrations. 
  Some observers, however, point out that the move may do more 
harm than good to a military that has recently shown signs of 
recovering from earlier purges. The authorities said their 
meeting with the generals was part of procedures before April's 
appointments, adding they had just sounded out the generals on 
voluntary discharge and had no intention of forcing them out.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- The head of the 
Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), Choe Chong-hyon, has 
postponed plans to visit China this week, in his capacity as 
Sungkyong Group chairman, until the end of next month, 
apparently because selection of the controlling shareholder in 
the nation's second cellular phone company is not going well. 
  The Sunkyong Group announced on Tuesday that chairman Choe's 
planned visit to China from Feb. 24 to March 1 at the invitation 
of a Chinese oil-refining organization had been put off until 
the end of March because of problems with his itinerary. 
  The FKI has changed the dates for two leadership meetings on 
selection of the main shareholder of the second mobile 
telecommunications firm from Feb. 21 and 25 to Feb. 22 and 23, 
due to chairman Choe's plans to visit China. 
  Business sources said Choe probably postponed his visit 
because Pohang Iron and Steel Co. chairman Chong Myong-sik and 
Kolon Group chairman Yi Tong-chan had failed to agree on who 
should own the second cellular phone firm at a meeting on 
Sunday. Chong and Yi are vying for the phone business. 
  Choe made his decision on Monday.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Federation of Korean 
Industries (FKI) board held a closed meeting Wednesday night at 
which Kim Sok-won, chairman of the Ssangyong Business Group, 
reported on his meetings with Chong Myong-sik and Yi Tong-chan, 
respective chairmen of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. [POSCO] and 
Kolon Group, which are vying to take the majority stake in the 
consortium for the second mobile telephone project, FKI Vice 
Chairman Cho Kyu- ha said Thursday. 
  Kim reportedly met with the two chairmen to hammer out an 
agreement between the uncompromising business groups in their 
fight for control of the lucrative business. 
  FKI was authorized by the Communications Ministry late last 
year to form a single consortium for the second cellular phone 
network by this month. 
  The cut-throat competition was narrowed down to consortiums 
led by POSCO and Kolon after FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon's 
Sunkyong Group dropped out of the race, aiming instead to become 
the major stockholder of Korea Mobile Telecom, a state-run 
monopoly that is to be privatized. 
  FKI will conduct a final screening and comparative study 
before announcing the majority stockholder and participating 
local and foreign companies on Feb. 28, Cho said.

  [Text] A total of 50 billion won will be poured into the 
development of technology pertaining to 
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment over the next four years 
starting this year. Of the amount, the government will supply 
20 billion won or 40 percent from the Basic Industrial 
Technology Development Fund. Chip makers such as Samsung, 
Goldstar and Hyundai will take part in the project along 
semiconductor equipment manufacturers. They will share costs 
for the development of technology with chip equipment makers and 
be obliged to purchase developed products. These steps are 
featured in a comprehensive plan to groom the semiconductor 
equipment industry disclosed by the Ministry of Trade, Industry 
and Energy. 
  Even though Korea has emerged as the second largest exporter 
of memory chips, the profitability of its semiconductor industry 
has rather dropped because of its heavy reliance on imports of 
chip manufacturing equipment. 
  At present, the localization ratio of semiconductor 
equipment 
stands at a mere 12 percent. According to the ministry, there 
are some 80 chip equipment makers across the country with their 
capital mostly less than 500 million won each. Because of their 
weak financial status, they are unable to invest in the 
development of new equipment. Making matters worse is their 
high costs for management and financing. Last year, their 
investment in R&amp;D (research and development) projects 
accounted 
for 4 percent of their turnover, compared with the average 8 
percent for semiconductor equipment makers in the United States 
and Japan. 
  Local production of chip equipment amounted to $14.5 million 
last year, a mere 12 percent of the $12 billion worth demand and 
a 1.7 percent of semiconductor production worth $851.2 billion. 
In terms of technology development, Korea is only able to 
manufacture simple semiconductor equipment used at research 
institutes, while the United States, Japan and other advanced 
countries enter the stage of mass-producing next generation 
products. 
  The ministry said that the expansion in chip equipment 
production can be covered by local demand because semiconductor 
makers are increasing their investment in 4M DRAM (dynamic 
random access memory) and 16M DRAM facilities. Their combined 
facility investment last year rose 81 percent over 1992 to 2,000 
billion won and it is expected to reach 3,000 billion won this 
year. 
  If the four year-program is carried out as scheduled, local 
production of semiconductor equipment will amount to $750 
million in 1997, the average 36 percent increase a year.

Fujii said Wednesday [23 February] he would appeal to his Group 
of Seven (G-7) partners to help avoid volatile exchange rate 
movements like the yen's recent advance against the dollar. 
"Rapid swings of exchange rates are a minus not only for Japan 
but also for the global economy, and I will explain this at the 
G-7 meeting," Fujii told the House of Representatives' Budget 
Committee. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 
industrial 
nations are to meet in Frankfurt on Saturday. 
  Asked by an opposition lawmaker about a planned income tax 
cut for fiscal 1994, Fujii indicated that an income tax cut will 
be carried out in the following years as well. "It seems that 
the income tax cut has been misunderstood as one for a single 
year only," Fujii said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan will seek support 
for a stable yen and its economic measures at a Group of Seven 
(G-7) meeting in Germany this weekend, an international 
financial source said Thursday [24 February]. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 nations 
will 
gather on Saturday in Kronberg, the outskirts of Frankfurt, to 
reaffirm cooperation in macroeconomic measures for global 
growth, stable currency rates and aid to Russia, the source 
said. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan and the United States. 
  On the exchange rates, Japan will explain that the yen's 
sharp rise since early last year has "poured water" on signs of 
economic recovery, he said. Since then, Japan has launched a 
spate of pump-priming measures, including the latest record 
15.25 trillion yen package, despite the tough financial 
situation, the source noted. 
  Japan will stress the plan's inclusion of tax cuts worth 6 
trillion yen to stimulate consumption and deregulatory actions 
primarily to facilitate land-market liquidity, the source said. 
He said such steps were taken while continuing to boost public 
works and housing-related loans, sectors that remain strong. 
  Japan will brief other nations particularly on the tax issue 
to win support, the source said, citing U.S. criticism over the 
effects of a single-year tax cut. 
  U.S. officials have said such cuts are not enough to prop up 
the economy and reduce trade imbalance. They were disappointed 
with the scrapping of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
original plan. 
  It called for a permanent 6 trillion yen tax cut and an 
offsetting 7 percent "welfare tax" in three years to replace the 
3 percent consumption tax. The U.S. side had pictured tax cuts 
worth 18 trillion yen in three years. 
  The source emphasized that Japan's ruling coalition leaders 
agreed to conduct a full-fledged tax reform by year's end, an 
accord that won confirmation at a cabinet meeting. 
  He noted that the G-7 ministers and central bankers are 
unlikely to issue a joint statement on macroeconomic policies 
and currency rates, but there are chances for the aid to Russia. 
Discussions on macroeconomic policies and exchange rates will 
be limited to the morning session of the one-day meeting that 
kicks off at around 11 A.M., he said. 
  With each nation presenting its economic measures, there 
will 
not be much to discuss, he said, indicating pressure on a single 
nation is unlikely. 
  The ministers and central bankers will focus on Russian aid 
in the afternoon session and Russian counterparts will join for 
about an hour before the meeting ends at around 5 P.M., the 
source said. The G-7 nations want to directly confirm economic 
reforms since Russian President Boris Yeltsin formed a new 
cabinet in the wake of elections last December, he said. 
  According to latest information, the source said the new 
cabinet intends to inherit and continue reforms led by 
inflation-curbing economic policies that are the key condition 
for multilateral aid from G-7 nations. 
  Large chunks of aid through the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank have not been implemented due to Russia's 
political and economic uncertainties. 
  The source said the aid package decided at a G-7 meeting of 
finance and foreign ministers last April in Tokyo and upgraded 
in a Tokyo summit last July is unlikely to be increased or 
changed. 
  Confirming that Russian policies are in line with the aid 
conditions will be the major issue, he noted. 
  Despite his indication that the aid will be the major topic, 
global attention is apparently fixed on currency and trade 
issues between Japan and the U.S. 
  Bilateral trade disputes have escalated since Japan flatly 
rejected a U.S. demand for "numerical targets" at a meeting 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill 
Clinton in Washington on February 11. After trade talks failed, 
the yen surged more than 6 yen against the dollar on speculation 
over the U.S. tolerating a stronger yen. 
  Japan and the U.S. are now in a "cooling off" period and the 
G-7 meeting will be the first top-level one since the summit. 
Japanese officials said a possible meeting between Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen has not been scheduled.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The government hopes to 
swiftly work out a fresh package of measures to open Japan's 
markets more to foreign competition, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [24 February]. But the top 
government spokesman said a meeting of cabinet ministers to be 
held Friday will not reach any conclusion on specific 
market-opening measures. 
  "The cabinet-level meeting will be held to try to map out a 
plan as early as possible," Takemura told a news conference. 
The meeting, bringing together nine ministers, including the 
foreign, finance and international trade ministers, will take 
place after a regular cabinet meeting Friday morning, he said. 
  It will aim to formulate a program to speed up deregulation, 
strengthen import and investment promotion steps, revamp 
competition policy and improve government procurement processes. 
  Last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan in trade 
negotiations with the U.S. agreed to map out a four-pronged 
scheme as soon as possible. The move is intended to stave off 
the trade dispute with the U.S., which has been increasing 
pressure on Japan to whittle down its lopsided trade surplus 
since the collapse of talks on a bilateral trade framework on 
February 11. 
  Meanwhile, Takemura indicated Japan will consider an 
extension of planned tax cuts beyond this year after 
implementing a sweeping tax system reform. 
  Under the original plan, the tax cut period is limited to 
only this year. This has sparked U.S. criticism that the tax 
cut is far from sufficient to stimulate the languishing Japanese 
economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- A top-ranking official of 
the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [24 February] he is opposed 
to setting any numerical target to reduce Japan's huge trade 
surplus. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued 
there could be no figure (for such a target) that Japan could 
attain and satisfy the United States at the same time. His 
remarks were in response to a comment made in the business 
community to propose to the U.S. as an "objective criteria" a 
target of setting a ratio of Japan's current-account surplus to 
its gross domestic product (GDP). 
  "Even if there should be target figures which can satisfy 
the 
U.S. Administration, (setting such targets) would only serve as 
a stopgap measure. In a couple of years, (U.S.-Japan relations) 
would get worse," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan must take drastic 
action to improve its strained economic relations with the 
United States, a top Trade Ministry official said Thursday [24 
February]. The official at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI), speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
some Japanese officials do not understand the seriousness of 
U.S. discontent over Japan's failure to meet Washington's 
demands. 
  He emphasized Japan should take strong measures to reduce 
its 
huge trade surplus by stimulating the economy and opening its 
auto market. 
  The official said the yen is staying where it is against the 
U.S. dollar on the foreign exchange market, only because of the 
Bank of Japan's intervention to support the dollar. He said the 
yen could rise sharply if the central bank stopped its selling 
of the yen.

  [Text] Naha, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The Okinawa branch of the 
Naha District Court on Thursday [24 February] ordered the state 
to pay a total of 807.45 million yen in compensation to 768 
residents around the U.S. Kadena Air Base for noise pollution 
caused by aircraft using the base. Thursday's decision, 
however, rejected demands for a halt to night flights at the 
base in line with Supreme Court decisions in February last year 
involving Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and Atsugi Naval Air Facility 
in Kanagawa Prefecture. 
  A total of 907 residents had demanded a halt to flights to 
and from the Kadena base between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M., 1.15 million 
yen each in damages for noise-related suffering and compensation 
for future annoyance until a night flight ban is realized. 
  Judge Hiroshi Segi ruled that the noise pollution at the 
base 
had "exceeded the level of tolerance" of the residents. Segi 
said the noise was detrimental to the residents' mental health 
because of disruptions to their sleep and feelings of discomfort 
caused by it. 
  In rejecting the call for a ban on night flights, however, 
he 
said the actions of the U.S. military do not fall within the 
dominion of the Japanese state. 
  Regarding the public nature of the base as argued by the 
defending lawyers, Segi said that as an important facility for 
the defense of the nation, the base could be recognized in a 
general sense as public in nature. He added, however, that the 
argument cannot be considered seriously in the decision on the 
tolerance level of the noise. 
  Defense lawyers had argued that the noise levels were 
tolerable given the public nature of the base. 
  Lawyers for the residents had argued over 55 hearings that 
the noise had led to headaches, hearing difficulties and other 
health problems among the residents and stressed that it was a 
violation of the residents personal rights and right to peaceful 
existence. 
  Kadena Air Base is under the control of the 18th Tactical 
Fighter Wing and is considered a key base of the U.S. Air Force 
in East Asia.

attempt to win membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), officials said. Zhu made the request in a 
meeting with Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Kono replied that the LDP will actively support China's bid. 
  Zhu also asked for the LDP's support in Japan's expected 
provision of a fourth yen loan to China starting in fiscal 1996. 
  Zhu, currently on a nine-day visit to Japan which started 
Wednesday, also met three former prime ministers, Toshiki Kaifu, 
Noboru Takeshita and Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Miyazawa, noting the need of stepping up Japan's support of 
the Chinese economy, expressed concern over China's potential to 
become a military superpower, the officials said. 
  "If China becomes economically strong, it will be also 
militarily strong. Japan has a policy of not becoming a 
military superpower, so I also want China not to be one," 
Miyazawa was quoted as saying. 
  Zhu, calling Miyazawa's concern "groundless," replied that 
"China will never seek hegemony."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan and China agreed 
Thursday that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will 
visit China between March 19 and 21 for talks with Chinese 
leaders, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hosokawa and Chinese 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji reached the accord in a meeting at the 
prime minister's official residence, the officials said. 
  Details of Hosokawa's itinerary will be further worked out 
by 
the two governments, they said. 
  Zhu conveyed messages from Chinese President and Communist 
Party Leader Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng saying they are 
looking forward to meeting Hosokawa in Beijing in March, the 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa replied that he looks forward to the trip, they 
said. 
  During the 50-minute meeting, Hosokawa called for China's 
continued role in persuading North Korea to accept international 
inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons development sites, 
the officials said. 
  Hosokawa told Zhu that Pyongyang should further accept 
special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and implement an accord with South Korea to denuclearize 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Zhu, currently on a nine-day visit to Japan starting 
Wednesday, was quoted as saying there have been developments 
recently concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear problem and 
that China intends to extend efforts within its capacity. 
  Hosokawa gave high marks to China's efforts to promote 
reform 
and open-door policies and added Japan will continue to support 
such efforts, the officials said. 
  Zhu predicted that mutual economic interdependence between 
China and Japan will further strengthen, noting that trade 
between the two amounted to 39 billion dollars last year, up 54 
percent from the previous year. 
  The vice premier also noted that Japan is now China's top 
trading partner exceeding Hong Kong, while China is Japan's 
second biggest trading partner. Zhu was quoted as saying the 
two nations should further promote economic exchanges. 
  Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid to become a member 
of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the officials 
said. 
  Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts 
to become a GATT member, lowering duties and improving 
transparency of its legislation. He handed Premier Li's letter 
to Hosokawa which asked for Tokyo's continued cooperation in 
China's bid to enter the world trade body. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said Beijing has apparently been 
sending similar letters to other major countries as well. 
  Hosokawa told the Chinese that Japan is interested in 
China's 
environmental preservation and military expenses. The prime 
minister cited Japanese guidelines in extending official 
development assistance (ODA) which takes note of such fields. 
  Zhu told Hosokawa that China has been making various efforts 
to preserve the environment including beefing up legislation, 
they said. 
  The vice premier noted China's military expenses in 1993 
were 
43.7 million yuan (about 655 million yen), about 1 percent of 
its gross national product (GNP). He said the military expenses 
are mostly used for defensive purposes and that the expenditure 
is limited to the minimum necessary to defend its population of 
1.2 billion. 
  Zhu told Hosokawa he does not think it appropriate to link 
China's human rights record to the "most-favored-nation" trade 
status in the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
defended China's economic modernization program Thursday [24 
February], saying reforms are "without major problems" despite 
some symptoms of overheating. 
  While acknowledging foreign concerns about an overheating of 
the Chinese economy given its breath-taking double-digit growth, 
Zhu said he does not think the 13 percent growth of the past two 
years is too rapid, although prolonging such growth could prove 
difficult. 
  Zhu, seen as the main architect of China's ambitious 
economic 
reforms, said macroeconomic measures introduced last summer to 
rein in money supply and restore order to an inflation-wracked 
economy have stabilized prices and created an environment for 
stable growth. "We haven't seen big economic ups and downs," 
Zhu said, dismissing allegations that macroeconomic controls are 
failing. 
  Addressing Japanese business leaders at a Tokyo hotel, Zhu 
denounced foreign press reports of growing social unrest due to 
soaring prices as distorting reality. Although inflation in big 
cities has reached 18.6 percent, the urban population actually 
enjoyed better living standards as salaries increased by some 25 
percent last year, he said. 
  Beijing is well aware of inflationary risks but does not 
consider the current level of 13.4 percent as cause for concern, 
Zhu said, adding the increase in money supply has been 
successfully stabilized at about 20 percent. 
  The implementation of a comprehensive economic reform 
program, including the introduction of new taxes and a single, 
market-oriented foreign exchange rate system since January 1, 
has been "going smoothly and without creating major problems." 
  Beijing will do away with its special foreign currency swap 
centers from April 1, from which time foreign exchange will be 
handled solely through banks, said Zhu, who also heads China's 
Central Bank. 
  The planned transformation of China's banks into commercial 
banks will have to go hand in hand with the restructuring of 
unprofitable state enterprises which have depended on cheap 
loans while adjusting to market transition. Zhu predicted "big 
progress," however, in the privatization of the state-run sector 
this year. 
  Beijing hopes that a total overhaul of the tax system will 
help gradually increase the central government's revenue share 
from the present 30 percent to about 60 percent by the year 2000. 
  Zhu dismissed as "groundless" rumors that foreign companies 
will soon be listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. Beijing is 
taking a very cautious stance toward the country's fledgling 
stock exchanges, closely monitoring Chinese firms to prevent an 
"economic bubble" like that which occurred in Japan. 
  Japan-China trade, which soared by 54 percent to 39 billion 
dollars last year, is nevertheless "still small," considering 
the potential of China's huge market, he said. Increased 
investment and trade with China could help Japan overcome its 
prolonged recession and boost the competitiveness of Japanese 
products, Zhu pointed out, adding he hopes trade relations 
between the two countries would "reach a new level." 
  Zhu arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a nine-day trip 
focusing on increasing economic ties. Besides visiting a number 
of prefectures to study Japan's economic and corporate 
structures, the vice premier will also meet present and former 
political leaders.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji asked the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday [24 February] 
to continue cooperating to beef up the functions of the People's 
Bank of China, officials of the central bank said. Zhu, who 
arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a nine-day visit to Japan, made 
the request during morning talks with BOJ Governor Yasushi Mieno 
at a Tokyo hotel. 
  The chief economic planner of China as head of the central 
bank briefed Mieno on Beijing's efforts to shift to a "socialist 
market economy," the officials said. 
  The officials did not reveal the details of the Mieno-Zhu 
talks, but Zhu is believed to have clarified his bank's policy 
of keeping a tight grip on credit, at least for the time being, 
to calm an overheating Chinese economy. 
  Mieno reportedly told Zhu the Japanese central bank will 
continue to support China's attempt to shift to a market-driven 
economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata urged China to take "tangible measures" to clear obstacles 
in winning "most favored nation (MFN)" trade status by the 
United States, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday. Hata 
told Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that although Sino-U.S. ties seem 
to have improved recently, he thinks there are still some 
problems concerning renewal of the MFN status. 
  As one of the "tangible measures" to be taken to ensure 
renewal of the MFN status, Hata implied that Beijing should 
improve its human rights record, the officials said. 
  China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under 
U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension 
this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's 
human rights record. 
  Zhu told Hata that relations between Beijing and Washington 
have made progress since U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin met in Seattle in November, the officials 
said. The meeting between Hata and Zhu lasted about 50 minutes 
and was followed by a dinner, they said. 
  Also during the meeting, Hata urged China to submit as early 
as possible official lists of projects to be covered by Japan's 
yen loans so that Tokyo and Beijing could determine the 
projects, the officials said. 
  He was quoted as saying Japan places importance on 
protecting 
the environment when extending loans. 
  When Hata visited China in early January, Japan and China 
agreed to divide Japan's loan periods from five years to 
three-year and two-year periods beginning with fiscal 1996 
starting April that year. 
  Beijing has sent unofficial lists to the Japanese Government 
of the projects to be handled under the yen loans but has yet to 
submit official lists, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. said Thursday 
[24 February] it will jointly establish an air conditioner 
manufacturing and sales venture in Shanghai in March. 
  Shanghai Hitachi Household Appliances Co., which will be 
capitalized at 2.1 billion yen, will start production in April. 
  The Hitachi group will hold 60 percent of equity shares and 
local firms the remainder. 
  The new firm plans to manufacture 80,000 air conditioners in 
the initial business year. Annual production capacity will be 
expanded to 250,000 units in the 1995 business year and 300,000 
in 1996, Hitachi officials said. 
  Currently, only 2 to 5 percent of urban households own air 
conditioners. But the market has been increasing roughly 13 
percent each year. 
  Japanese electric home appliance companies like Sharp Corp., 
Sanyo Electric Co. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. have 
already started up in China.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- Nine lawmakers from the 
Japanese Social Democratic Party [SDP], including former 
chairman Sadao Yamahana and current Policy Board Chairman 
Nobuyuki Sekiyama, have joined the South Korea-Japan 
Parliamentarians' Union, informed sources said on Wednesday. 
  The SDP had been hoping to join the union for a long time, 
but other members from the Liberal Democratic Party, Democratic 
Socialist Party and Komeito Party rejected it because the SDP 
attached importance to North Korea and refused to change its 
policy toward South Korea. The nine SDP lawmakers joined the 
union on a personal level and the SDP's membership on a party 
level is still not permitted. 
  Yamahana, who is now state minister in charge of political 
reform in the cabinet, visited South Korea last September for 
the first time as SDP chairman.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- South Korean Ambassador to 
Japan Kong No-myong said Thursday [24 February] that Japan and 
South Korea share the view that suspicion over North Korea's 
nuclear intentions should be put to rest by dialogue, with 
cooperation from the United States and China. 
  Kong, in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, said South 
Korea and Japan should maintain close cooperation in seeing that 
North Korea accepts adequate international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities to ensure against development of nuclear 
weapons. He said settlement of the matter should be made a 
precondition for consideration of North Korea's participation in 
regional organizations and activities, such as the Tumen River 
Development Project near the North Korea-China border and the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Kong said Tokyo and Seoul still face unresolved issues, such 
as addressing the suffering of so-called comfort women, who said 
they were forced by the Japanese Imperial Army to provide sex to 
soldiers during World War II. But he said South Koreans were 
very touched last year by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
apologies for Japan's war conduct and its colonization of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  President Kim is scheduled to visit Japan in late March.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro 
Yokomichi and labor leader Akira Yamagishi on Thursday [24 
February] reached a broad agreement to aim at establishing a new 
liberal party in the future, officials said. In an hour-long 
meeting over lunch in Tokyo, Yokomichi and Yamagishi basically 
agreed on efforts to unite the Social Democratic Party [SDP], 
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger) 
into a democratic liberal party. 
  Yokomichi is widely regarded as one of the candidates to 
head 
the new party expected to be established some time before the 
next general election. Yokomichi is also considered a 
next-generation leader of the SDP, the largest among the seven 
parties forming the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Yamagishi, as head of the 8 million-strong Rengo labor 
organization, reportedly played a key role in helping establish 
the coalition last year. 
  The coalition's two propelling groups, Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) and the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government 
Party], have called for establishing a two-party system under 
the political reform legislation which introduces single-seat 
constituencies for House of Representatives general elections. 
  But the SDP, DSP and Sakigake, opposing the two-party 
system, 
have favored a "moderate multiparty system." 
  Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced 
support for the multiparty system. But earlier this month he 
instructed top aides to consider uniting the seven coalition 
parties into one against the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 
the next general election. 
  Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, coalition sources said 
Yokomichi is set to return to the national stage as a leading 
member of the planned new party. 
  The governor of Hokkaido in northern Japan met with Satsuki 
Eda, head of the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) and a 
cabinet minister, on Wednesday night to discuss forming a new 
party that would involve a merger with the SDP, they said. 
  Yokomichi agreed in the meeting with Eda, director general 
of 
the Science and Technology Agency, to start preparations to form 
the new party with the SDP as its core, they said. 
  Yokomichi, a former SDP member of the House of 
Representatives, told Eda he is willing to run for a Diet seat 
in the next general election. He has already received a 
positive response to the idea of a new party from SDP Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama and its secretary general, Wataru Kubo, the 
sources said. 
  Yokomichi met with Kubo and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi 
Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), on February 12 and 
agreed to form a united parliamentary group among the SDP, DSP 
and Sakigake, they said. Yokomichi has been elected to the Diet 
four times since 1969 and elected as Hokkaido governor three 
times since 1983. 
  Yamagishi, speaking at a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club, said Japan's political parties will be 
molded into three forces. Yamagishi, president of the Japanese 
Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), said the three will be the 
LDP, a new conservative party, and a new liberal party. 
  It is unlikely the seven coalition parties will merge into 
one due to different views on constitutional interpretation and 
Japan's international contributions, he said. 
  "The three polar groups will emerge in a transitional period 
to pave the way for the establishment of a two-party system," he 
said, adding this was the ideal goal for the future. 
  After returning to Sapporo, the prefectural capital of 
Hokkaido, Yokomichi told reporters, "There were no such talks 
about (setting up) Yokomichi New Party." But he did not deny 
that there has been an idea to form a new party with himself as 
an axis. 
  "People within and outside the SDP are thinking of forming 
the new party. It's not a matter for my comment," Yokomichi 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- A popular provincial 
governor is set to return to the national stage as a leading 
member of a planned new liberal party, sources in the ruling 
coalition said Thursday [24 February]. Takahiro Yokomichi, 
governor of Hokkaido in northern Japan, held secret talks with a 
cabinet minister Wednesday night on forming a new party that 
would involve a merger with the largest party in the coalition 
government, they said. 
  Yokomichi agreed in the meeting with Science and Technology 
Agency Chief Satsuki Eda to start preparations to form the new 
party with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as its core, they 
said. Yokomichi, a former SDP member of the House of 
Representatives, told Eda, leader of the United Social 
Democratic Party, at the meeting in Tokyo that he is willing to 
run for a Diet seat in the next general election, they said. 
  He had already received a positive response to the idea of a 
new party from SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and its secretary 
general, Wataru Kubo, the sources said. 
  Yokomichi met with Kubo and Chief Cabinet Secretary

Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), on February 12 and 
agreed to form a unified parliamentary group among the SDP, 
Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party, they said. 
Yokomichi, dubbed the "prince of the SDP," was elected to the 
Diet four times from 1969 and has been elected Hokkaido governor 
three times since 1983. 
  Shinseito and Komeito want a two-party system in which the 
seven coalition parties would merge into a single party, but the 
SDP and Sakigake prefer a moderate multiparty system. 
  Meanwhile, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that the SDP, 
the DSP and Sakigake have agreed to start regular consultations 
to strengthen ties among them.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Leaders of two out of seven 
ruling parties told Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Thursday 
[24 February] that an immediate cabinet reshuffle is not 
necessary, renewing their opposition to a shakeup expected to 
center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
from his post, coalition sources said. In a meeting with 
Hosokawa, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi urged the premier to revoke his reshuffle plan, the 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa told the two that he may consider a reshuffle after 
the Diet passes both the third supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993 and an amendment to a political reform package, they said. 
The Diet passed the extra budget Wednesday, while the amendment 
is expected to be approved in early March. 
  From the coalition's seven parties, the SDP, DSP and 
Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the reshaping 
plan while Shinseito (Japan renewal party) and Komeito [Clean 
Government Party] support it. 
  Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's 
future politics. Hosokawa has reportedly considered seeking a 
two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito, but 
Takemura has voiced objections. 
  Takemura also attended the meeting and suggested he has not 
changed his position opposing his removal, the sources said. He 
has reportedly rejected Hosokawa's request to go to another 
ministerial post. 
  Murayama told Hosokawa that an immediate reshuffle will give 
"an impression of a power struggle" within the coalition. Ouchi 
asked the premier not to cause a crack in the coalition by a 
shakeup, they said. 
  Hosokawa was quoted as saying he does not have a concrete 
idea on a reshuffle and will decide on the matter after hearing 
opinions of ruling party leaders. 
  On Tuesday, Hosokawa told reporters he asked his top aides 
to 
look into the possibility of uniting seven ruling parties 
against the Liberal Democratic Party in the next general 
election for the House of Representatives. 
  The prime minister told leaders of the SDP, DSP and Sakigake 
that the idea of alliance has nothing to do with the merger of 
ruling parties nor with a two-party system.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed 
Thursday [24 February] on amendment of government-sponsored 
political reform bills, political sources said. The two sides 
are expected to jointly submit the amended package to the Diet 
on Monday and the bills are likely to be approved by the House 
of Representatives and the House of Councillors by Wednesday or 
later, they said. 
  The two camps struck a deal Thursday on the last remaining 
point of difference, when the coalition parties conceded to an 
LDP demand to discuss giving political parties the status of a 
juridical person, the sources said. 
  The LDP has called for the reform bills to state that 
political parties have the status of a juridical person, saying 
parties should be in a more responsible position because they 
will be subsidized by the government under the package. 
  The coalition has opposed this, maintaining that freedom of 
association under the Constitution may be violated if political 
parties are obliged to have a juridical person's status. 
  The two sides agreed to keep discussing the matter and 
conclude the debate by the time a bill on the locations of 300 
single-seat constituencies for the lower house is presented to 
the Diet, the sources said. The bill is expected to be 
presented in the fall. 
  According to the package, 300 lower house will be elected 
through a single-seat constituency system and the remaining 200 
through a proportional representation system. Currently, lower 
house members are elected from constituencies with two to six 
seats. 
  The package was passed January 29 at the last extraordinary 
session of the Diet, but some amendments and the date of 
enforcement were removed from the package to get it through. 
  Shortly before the passage, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the amendments and date 
of enforcement will be discussed at the current ordinary session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) announced on Thursday 
[24 February] a wide-ranging business-promotion program focusing 
on eight business sectors expected to expand vigorously in the 
coming years. The program, which will help promote information 
processing, telecommunications, housing-related and other up and 
coming industrial sectors, is designed to create jobs through 
deregulations and government support to help offset personnel 
cuts resulting from restructuring measures in the private 
sector, MITI officials said. 
  MITI plans to promote such business fields as housing, solar 
power development, multimedia-related data processing, recycling 
of industrial waste, medical and social welfare and new-wave 
distribution systems like discount stores. 
  The ministry also aims to enhance sports and leisure-related 
industries and development of new materials, MITI officials said. 
  As a common task for the eight fields, the ministry plans to 
review requirements for companies to be registered on the 
over-the-counter market to help upstarts raise funds more easily. 
  The ministry also plans to provide assistance to improve the 
infrastructure for research and development activities for such 
companies. 
  Among specific measures under the program, the government 
will purchase unused land with public funds for housing 
developments. 
  The ministry also calls for introducing computers and other 
information-processing equipment into education programs and for 
better protection of copyrights for multi-media software. 
  The ministry estimates that the measures envisaged in the 
program would help boost the domestic housing-related market to 
33 trillion yen in the year 2000 from 28 trillion yen in 1992, 
and the telecommunications market to 61-70 trillion yen from 23 
trillion yen, MITI officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. has developed 
the world's smallest scale capable of submicron-level 
measurement, using mainly conductive single-crystal silicon, the 
company said Thursday [24 February]. It is the first scale 
capable of absolute submicron-level calibrations, a senior 
company researcher said. 
  The researcher, Kenichi Mizuishi, chief of Hitachi's 
Advanced 
Technology Development Department, said the microscale is 
graduated in 0.2 microns (a 5,000th of a millimeter), and may be 
used in measuring the accuracy of, for instance, scanning 
electron microscopes (SEMs). SEMs are used in measuring the 
line width -- 0.2 to 0.25 micron -- of circuits of a 256-megabit 
memory chip believed to come into practical use at the end of 
the current century. 
  The National Research Laboratory of Meteorology has 
cooperated with Hitachi in the development of the microscale. 
The development will be reported by Hitachi at a conference of 
the Society of Optical Engineering to be held in the United 
States starting February 28, Mizuishi said. 
  He said the chemical etching and laser interferometer 
lithographic processes, used in the production of semiconductor 
memory chips, has been employed in the development of the 
microscale. Interferometer is an instrument that utilizes the 
interference of waves of light for precise determinations of 
distance or wavelength. 
  In the case of the microscale, if electron microscope 
electron beams collide with the scale, it hardly causes 
distortions in the scale, and the microscale is suited for 
quantity production, the researcher said. He said the company 
hopes to commercialize the microscale within a couple of years.

  [Text] Talks to settle outstanding financial claims from 
the Vietnam War days between Hanoi and Washington will be held 
on Monday. An American MP [as heard] estimates the claims total 
about $200 million, so Washington should work out proper 
measures to solve the issue. 
  At the forum,the two sides are to consider the establishment 
of liaison offices in each other's capital. 
  Washington has declared support for Vietnam's application to 
join ASEAN. Kristoff, director of the Asian Department of the 
National Security Council said the U.S. also supports the 
Cambodia's membership application for the association. She said 
it is time for the three Indochinese countries to joint the 
regional economy. The announcement was made three weeks after 
President Clinton's decision to lift the U.S. embargo on Vietnam.

  [Text] The Criminal Court of the People's Supreme Court was 
in session -- preliminary as well as final -- in Hanoi from 
17-23 February. The case involved roundabout dealings with 
4,000 tons of steel intended for the construction of the 
north-south 500- kilovolt powerline. These dealings caused more 
than 3 billion dong in losses to the state budget. 
  Mr. Mai Ngoc Chinh, chief judge of the Criminal Court of the 
People's Supreme Court, presided over the court session. During 
its proceedings, the court heard Mr. Nguyen Tien Dam, a senior 
officer representing the People's Supreme Organ of Control, 
present a conviction report by the procurator of the Supreme 
People's Organ of Control against the following defendants: 
  1. Doan Trung Thanh, former director of the Vietnam-Poland 
Economic, Technological, and Cultural Development Support 
Services Corporation, called VINAPOL for contact purposes. 
  2. Doan Thi Huu Nghi, director of the VINAPOL Limited 
Corporation. 
  3. Former Energy Minister Vu Ngoc Hai, also known as Vu 
Hung Hai. 
  4. Deputy Energy Minister [title as heard] Le Liem. 
  5. Pham Dao Khanh, former deputy director of the Board of 
Management of the 500-kv powerline project.

  Immediately after the conclusion of the court session, Pham 
Hung, chief judge of the Supreme People's Court, convened a news 
conference and answered a number of questions from journalists 
concerning this case. Comrade Pham Hung suggested that 
journalists give objective and accurate coverage to this public 
case in the mass media. Answering a question on whether the 
court trial was aimed at corrupt elements, the comrade chief 
judge of the People's Supreme Court said: This is not a 
corruption trial. The case, however, has taken place at a time 
when our party and state are launching an anticorruption 
campaign that aims not only at opposing theft and bribery, but 
also at achieving an important goal; namely, to struggle against 
wrongdoing, lack of responsibility, extravagance, and failure to 
act in accordance with one's duties and thereby incurring 
losses. All of these things must also be regarded as criminal 
activities. Therefore, we must take action against them.

<F P=106> ["Topical Talk" by station editor Vu Dinh Vinh] </F>
  [Text] Dear comrades and friends: Today we return to the 
question of peaceful evolution and the fight against it in our 
country. First, it should be recalled that the term `peaceful 
evolution' came into existence in 1949 when it was first used by 
the Americans. The strategy has come to be a trick of 
imperialism aimed at eradicating socialism. Shrouded with a 
complex history, it has gone through many stages and has 
resorted to various essential tricks such as creating 
counterrevolutionary public opinion and mass media in the 
ideological domain, making inroads into people's cultural 
thinking, containing our economic growth, and nurturing 
reactionary forces they call democratic forces. 
  Peaceful evolution is nothing but a change in the format to 
conceal the reactionary nature of imperialism. This has been 
identified and summed up through the following: 
  -- This strategy is conducted to gradually gain influence, 
defeat socialism, and stamp out the international revolutionary 
movement by peaceful means instead of violence. 
  -- This war is being waged by soft means such as 
diplomatic, cultural, ideological, and political activities. 
Violence will only be used as a last resort. 
  -- The war under the banner of peaceful evolution 
advocates using mainly direct forces, namely men and means of a 
rival country, to undermine the rival's internal ranks with 
outside support to cause a swift crumbing and disintegration. 
This format has caused the people to be mistaken about a change 
in the nature of imperialism. 
  -- Basing itself mainly on social relations and on 
imperialist designs, the peaceful evolution strategy advocates 
using wise and sophisticated tricks to foment a tremendous 
self-destruction force from within a rival country in order to 
lead it to a comprehensive deterioration, internal anarchy, and 
finally a swift and quiet crumbing about which the imperialists 
will pretend to be innocent and uninvolved. 
  -- The peaceful evolution strategy bears a global 
character. It does not have any time and space limits. The tempo 
and the process of this war develop very slowly. Although this 
war does not give any feeling of fierceness, the results it 
produces may be very great. 
  -- The peaceful evolution strategy advocates building and 
using on-site political forces to set up its base and rally 
force from within the socialist regime for use as an inside 
force. In this strategy, the imperialists will play the role of 
external strike force. When the situation permits, they will 
resort to military force. 
  Dear comrades and friends: For Vietnam, imperialism and 
other hostile forces are using the peaceful evolution strategy 
against our country. With their clear-cut objects and 
strategies, they attach importance to the ideological and 
theoretical struggle aimed at eradicating Marxism-Leninism and 
Ho Chi Minh thought. This is one of their key spearhead moves 
aimed at infiltrating deep into and effecting a change within 
the internal ranks and the superstructure of the party and the 
socialist state; driving our national economy to stray off the 
socialist orbit course and undergo privatization and 
liberization in accordance with the market economy format of 
capitalism; rallying reactionaries from various religions and 
ethnic minority groups, taking advantage of superstition and 
divinity to incite the people to demand freedom and human rights 
in opposition to us. 
  In can be said that hostile forces have openly announced 
their design to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy 
against our country and our regime. Lately, the enemy has 
stepped up activities in various fields to achieve this. The 
intensity of this war is increasing while its scale has been 
expanded in various areas -- political, ideological, economic, 
cultural, artistic, press, religious, racial, scientific, 
theoretical, and in terms of organizing personnel. 
  The enemy, with the use of many overt, semi-overt, and 
covert 
means, is trying to gradually legalize various activities and 
organizations while seeking ways to establish contact with our 
people and involve themselves further in sowing division among 
and undermining our internal ranks from within. Simultaneously, 
they are striving to rally local reactionary forces and linking 
these with outside reactionaries. They are resorting to 
political tricks while attempting to prepare armed rebellions 
for subversive purposes. 
  It is reported that on the cultural and ideological front, 
in 
1993 the enemy and the reactionaries intensified their sabotage 
on a larger scale. According to incomplete statistics, there 
existed 17 more overseas reactionary organizations from among 
the exiled Vietnamese and an additional three 
Vietnamese-language radio stations, including Radio Free Asia, 
and 15 newspapers or magazines. In 1993 alone, they cooperated 
in launching four major propaganda campaigns against Vietnam in 
addition to many rallies and demonstrations in a number of 
countries. They brought to our country thousands of reactionary 
documents, of which 37 are new. Their activities consist of 
spreading slanderous charges and incendiary propaganda about 
democratic liberties, human rights, ethnic, and religious 
issues. They have distorted incidents in Thua Thien Hue, Ba 
Ria-Vung Tau, and Son La to sow division among the people. They 
have increased their efforts to split overseas Vietnamese, 
establish contact with and draw our overseas cadres, students, 
and workers, and called for the overthrow of the party and the 
socialist regime. 
  The enemy's mode of operations is open, brazen, 
sophisticated, and crafty. Its nature is increasingly dangerous. 
They are taking advantage of our party's renovation and 
open-door policy to carry out activities through cooperation, 
aid, investment. They have been carrying out clandestine 
activities under the guise of economic cooperation. They are 
upbeat in asking for the opening of cultural, scientific, and 
technological information centers and using various conferences 
and seminars to invite our cadres overseas to sign contracts and 
buy materials and technologies so as to propagate, influence, 
establish contact with, and bribe them. Certain enemy 
organizations also intend to restore old organizations to rally 
forces to be used as a springboard for sabotage activities 
launched from the outside. 
  Thus, while the revolution's central tasks of national 
construction and development are being busily carried out, the 
tasks of safeguarding the country, regime, and party have also 
developed in a very urgent manner. A number of incidents 
involving Vietnam that took place before Tet provided new proof 
by which our entire party, people, and army can clearly realize 
their situation and tasks and heighten their vigilance in the 
struggle against the enemy's schemes and tricks. 
  In 1994 and ensuing years, we must be more profoundly aware 
that the peaceful evolution strategy is an attempt by hostile 
forces to eradicate party rule and overthrow the 
socialist-oriented political regime in our country. This 
strategy is closely related to the dangers pointed out at the 
mid-term national party conference: The scourge of corruption 
and other social evils and being left further behind other 
countries in the region and the world economically; and the 
danger of straying from the socialist path if we fail to 
overcome irregularities in providing guidance on these issues. 
This is why we have to link the fight against peaceful 
evolution with efforts to overcome these dangers. 
  It can be said that there is a rather fierce ideological 
battle taking place between us and hostile forces as a result of 
the peaceful evolution war. For the time being, we should build 
and firmly consolidate our socialist ideological battleground if 
we want all of our party members and the masses to stand firm on 
the socialist path, Marxisim-Leninism, and Ho Chi Minh Thought; 
thoroughly understand the party's various viewpoints and its 
renovation policy; firmly maintain political stability; revamp 
the people's security network; strengthen universal national 
defense; and build a steadfast people's army. 
  It should be affirmed that it is the duty of every cadre and 
combatant and our people to smash peaceful evolution 
ideologically. To triumph in this tough and complex struggle, 
we must counter the enemy's attack with the results of our 
renovation process, with our theoretical research and 
development of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought, and 
with our efforts to build a fine lifestyle and ethical quality 
for ourselves as revolutionaries. We will strive to illuminate 
the legitimacy, clarity, and straightforwardness of the path 
toward socialism; our country's inevitable road as well as the 
law of evolution of history chosen for our nation with clear 
foresight by our party and Uncle Ho. 
  To counter the enemy's peaceful evolution schemes 
ideologically, armed forces units must always stress and 
satisfactorily maintain internal political security, fight 
against all of the enemy's psychological warfare schemes and 
tricks, intensify efforts to build clean and steadfast party 
organizations, and build comprehensively steadfast units. 
Greater attention must be paid to political and ideological 
training in view of this new situation so as to improve the 
political acumen of cadres and soldiers. We must equip them 
with the correct methodology so they can clearly differentiate 
nature from phenomena and right from wrong. Cadres and 
combatants will then have a clear idea of our friends and foes 
and of the complex socio-political issues now emerging at home 
and abroad. 
  Various units must formulate plans and measures to provide 
adequate, correct, and guided information on new developments in 
those fundamental issues related to the actual socio-political 
situation at home and abroad that are having an impact on their 
feelings and emotions, so they can cope with these things 
correctly. On this basis, they must struggle against the 
enemy's psychological warfare and efforts to sabotage us 
psychologically. Various units must also step up the movement to 
build a new cultural environment; they must struggle against 
unhealthy lifestyles, preserve our fine customs and traditions, 
and preserve and develop the character of Uncle Ho's troops in 
view of the new situation and tasks. 
  Other aspects of the fight against peaceful evolution are 
not 
without difficulties. They require us to develop immediate and 
long-term measures. These consist of: Satisfactorily 
motivating various strata of the masses -- especially clergy, 
intellectuals, writers, artists, industrialists, and businessmen 
-- to keep the enemy from using our means of transportation, 
post offices, printing houses, and the like for trouble-making 
and sabotage; consolidating mass organizations; building 
backbone forces for the political struggle; and paying attention 
to the tasks of protecting the party, organizations, and party 
cadres and members. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to detect 
and eradicate reactionary organizations promptly to maintain 
political stability, public order, and safety. 
  Dear comrades and friends, it is necessary to understand 
correctly the nature and fundamental features of the 
imperialists and the other hostile forces as well as their 
attempts to carry out their peaceful evolution strategy at the 
current complex juncture. If we heighten our vigilance and 
remain dynamic, sensitive, and able to counter the enemy 
unreservedly and promptly with our blows, the enemy will not be 
able to hold sway and attain the desired results. Meanwhile, we 
should not disregard the enemy's strategy. In 1994 and ensuring 
years, the fight against peaceful evolution is likely to become 
tougher and fiercer. This requires our entire party, people, 
and army to be more dynamic and determined to foil the enemy's 
malicious strategy and firmly preserve the ideal and the path we 
have chosen.

  [Text] The Vietnam State Bank held a conference of 
governors of northern provinces' state banks and commercial 
banks in Hanoi yesterday. The purpose was to evaluate a drive 
to renovate banking inspection, control, and regulations over 
the past three years -- 1991-93 -- and to set forth tasks for 
1994-95. 
  Over the past three years, banking inspection, control, and 
regulations have been gradually brought into in line with 
renovation of the banking sector, ranging from special 
inspection and control drives to long-range supervision and 
on-the-spot large-scale inspection of credit organizations. 
This has contributed positively to restoring order and 
discipline in banking operations. 
  Addressing the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van 
Khai commended the sector for its efforts last year to contain 
and dispel inflation and gradually increase the value of 
Vietnamese currency. The sector's credit operations have 
gradually provided good service to various economic components. 
Financial settlement work has shown progress, resulting in an 
end to the shortage of cash. Many banks have had a surplus. 
  The deputy prime minister also pointed out major tasks to be 
carried out by the sector in 1994, which consist of formulating 
measures to stabilize the value of the Vietnamese currency; 
stepping up the mobilization of capital among the people and of 
foreign capital for economic components; managing foreign 
currency more satisfactorily; and reducing negativism and 
inconveniences if the banking sector is to meet various capital 
demands of the national economy.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb. 20 -- VAC in Vietnam involves the 
household economic sector producing plants and animals from 
gardens and ponds in each family. VAC economy, which is known 
in Vietnam by three initials, V for orchard or garden, A for 
fish pond and C for live-stock breeding, appeared in the country 
where there remained agricultural cooperatives. The income of 
families from VAC economy then only made up 5-7 per cent of 
their total income. 
  Over the past recent 10 years, VAC economy developed rapidly 
with the move towards a market economy. 
  According to Mr Nguyen Ngoc Triu, special envoy of the prime 
minster and president of the Vietnam Gardeners' Association 
(Vacvina), more than 60 per cent of the farmer households' 
income is from VAC economy. He estimated this was worth about 
10 million VND [Vietnam dong] per year each. The total income 
of 10 million households engaged in VAC economy throughout the 
country is about USD [U.S. dollars] 10 billion per year. 
  With the present development, VAC is a major part of the 
agriculture-forestry economy of Vietnam, contributing to the 
diversification of agricultural produce, creating a new strategy 
for agricultural and rural development. 
  Many households are doing farming, gardening or 
afforestation 
on tens or even hundreds of hectares of land. Those who are 
engaged in aquaculture have broadened their business to lakes, 
channels and even rivers, covering tens or hundreds of hectares. 
Others have set up snake farms, chicken farms, deer, cattle or 
pig farms. 
  Vacvina has taken part in a national programme of reclaiming 
10 million hectares of waste land and bare hills to incrsease 
arable lands and create more jobs. 
  Under an agriculture promotion programme, the state and 
vacvina are helping households engaged in VAC economy in 
providing capital, technology, and products processing and 
marketing. 
  Many households have sucessfully developed VAC economy. 
Fifty thousand households in the Mekong River delta, for 
instance, have become rich thanks to VAC economy. Some of them 
are Vietnamese `billionaires'. In Tien Giang Province, people 
work on 40,000 ha of gardens (or 20 percent of the province's 
cultivated land). Their VAC output value accounts more than 20 
per cent of the province's total crop production. They have 
earned annually hundreds of billions of VND from selling plants 
and fruits. 
  In the coastal districts of Tien Hai and Thai Thuy, Thai 
Binh 
Province, people have invested big capital in reclaiming coastal 
marshes for production and earned hundreds of billion VND a 
year. They invested hundreds of billion VND in aquaculture, 
yielding from 100-150 million VND a year. 
  In the northern mountain province of Son La, about 2,600 
households are engaged in fruit tree planting. Their income 
from fruits is a dozen times over rice and maize cultivation. 
  Particularly, more than 4,000 households of war veterans in 
central province of Quang Tri, the most impoverished land in the 
country, the farmers have earned between 15-40 million VND from 
VAC economy. 
  As VAC economy had helped in providing daily nutritious 
foods 
for aged people and children, UNICEF had decided to surport and 
provide vacvina with material assistance.

<F P=106> ["Destiny of Inspection Depends on the U.S." -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- Some people are now 
misrepresenting the agreement reached between the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] on the scope of inspection for the continuity of 
safeguards, and formalities of inspection. This is the topic of 
a NODONG SINMUN commentary today. 
  The inspection agreed on recently is not routine or ad hoc 
inspection under the safeguards agreement but, to all intends 
[as received] and purposes, an inspection for ensuring the 
continuity of safeguards, the analyst says, and continues: 
  The DPRK and the IAEA could reach an agreement because the 
United States and the IAEA voluntarily withdrew their demand 
that the DPRK accept routine and ad hoc inspections and promised 
to make an inspection only for the continuity of safeguards. 
  As we have reached an agreement with the IAEA, we are 
willing 
to accept such an inspection and welcome an inspection group of 
the IAEA. 
  Whether the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of 
safeguards is made at an early date or not depends on the United 
States, not on the DPRK. 
  If the inspection is to be made soon, an agreement on 
follow-up steps for simultaneous actions must be reached as the 
DPRK and the United States promised. 
  Such steps must include an inspection of the DPRK for the 
continuity of safeguards and, at the same time, an official 
proclamation by the United States of the suspension of the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises in 1994 and the joint 
publication of the date of the third-stage talks by the DPRK and 
the United States. 
  So, it is unfair that one side ought to take an action first 
according to the promise, while the other side can take no 
action, breaking the promise. The problem cannot be resolved in 
this way. 
  It is a decisive moment in resolving the nuclear issue on 
the 
Korean peninsula and making a positive progress in improving the 
DPRK-U.S. relations. 
  It is evident that if the United States throw a snag in the 
way of reaching an agreement on steps for simultaneous actions 
or resort to pressure, the agreement between the DPRK and the 
IAEA cannot be implemented. 
  Some quarters of the United States, however, are arguing 
that 
only when the North and the South exchanged special envoys and 
the IAEA's inspection was fully made, is it possible to stop the 
"Team Spirit" and hold the third-stage talks. 
  It is attributable to this unreasonable position of the 
U.S., 
not to ours, that though the DPRK and IAEA agreed on the 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards, it has not been 
carried into effect. 
  Only when the United States show in action the fulfilment of 
its responsibility and obligation, will the inspection for the 
continuity of safeguards be made at the same time.

<F P=106> ["They Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique is now displaying feverish activities to bring 
U.S. Patriot missiles into South Korea. 
  NODONG SINMUN today views this as another sign that the 
puppet clique's war moves to slay the fellow countrymen in the 
North, teaming up with outside forces, have been carried into 
extremes. 
  The analyst says: 
  At a time when the United States was working full blast to 
deploy Patriot missiles at U.S. bases in South Korea as part of 
its attempt to overpower the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea militarily, the puppets decided to introduce the missiles. 
This is an anti- national act which can be done only by 
warmaniacs who are balking at a peaceful solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula and trying to unleash a war 
against the North of the same nation. 
  Though the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is attempting to 
frighten the North with something like Patriots, it is an inept 
act. 
  Even if the United States and the South Korean puppets bring 
into South Korea anything more terrible than Patriots, our 
people and People's Army will never be frightened. 
  The warmaniacs would be well advised to act with discretion.

  [Text] The prime minister has instructed the Police 
Department to take legal action against the Lao National 
Liberation Army for operating on Thai territory. 
  Representatives of the Supreme Command Headquarters led by 
Lieutenant Chiradet Diphian, director of the Supreme Command 
Headquarters Intelligence Department, filed a lawsuit with 
Police Major General Wannarat Khotcharat, commander of the 
Police Crime Suppression Division, against General Vang Pao, 
General Thonglit Chokbengbun, and their colleagues for having 
set up outlaw organizations -- the Lao National Liberation Front 
and the Lao National Liberation Army -- in Thailand. The two 
organizations are responsible for acts of terrorism along the 
border with Laos in Phayao and Nan Provinces. 
  Police Major General Wannarat disclosed that the police 
director general had assigned him to appoint a working team to 
investigate this case. He said he is confident that the two 
accused will be brought to trial, although the military has 
reported that they are now living outside the country. 
  Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak reaffirmed 
that the Thai Government is always ready to cooperate with the 
Lao Government in the suppression of terrorism in Laos. He 
said: 
  [Begin Wichit recording] They are in Laos. Thailand is 
willing to cooperate with Laos. His Excellency Choummali, the 
Lao defense minister, and I are well acquainted with each other 
and are willing to cooperate. [end recording]

  [Text] New York, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States held another working-level contact in New York on 
Wednesday to discuss follow-up measures to Pyongyang's 
acceptance of nuclear inspections on March 1, but failed to 
reach full agreement. 
  Diplomatic sources in Washington said that Ho Chong, deputy 
chief of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, and Tom 
Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and 
Pacific affairs, met somewhere other than the UN headquarters. 
The sources said the two sides could not agree on an exchange 
of special envoys between South and North Korea and other 
problems, adding that they would meet again on Friday. 
  It is highly likely that they will reach an agreement by 
Feb. 
25 at the latest, given that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] strongly urged North Korea to issue visas for IAEA 
inspectors and that Pyongyang told Washington it would allow 
inspections from March 1, according to the sources. 
  The sources expected that North Korea would issue the visas 
as soon as an understanding was reached with the United States 
on the content of their written agreement. 
  "I expect that the inspection team will enter North Korea on 
Feb. 28," one source said. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea proposed to the United States at 
Wednesday's bilateral contact that it would allow nuclear 
inspections to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards from 
March 1 and that the two sides should agree on taking four 
simultaneous steps, a North Korean official in New York said. 
Shortly after Tuesday's contact with Washington, Han Song-yol, 
councilor at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, 
told YONHAP in a telephone interview that the four simultaneous 
measures include joint announcement of the third round of 
high-level talks by Pyongyang and Washington. 
  The other three are Washington's suspension of this year's 
"Team Spirit," the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise, 
North Korea's positive consideration of working-level contacts 
with South Korea if the South makes such a proposal, and North 
Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections, Han said. 
  Han accompanied Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean 
Mission to the United Nations, at the contact with U.S. 
officials including Hubbard and C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea 
desk officer at the State Department. 
  U.S. officials have conditioned the third round of 
high-level 
talks on North Korea exchanging special envoys with the South, 
so the contact failed to reach agreement, according to Han. 
  "There is no change in our position that South and North 
Korea should exchange special envoys. But we oppose the U.S. 
intention to make the issue a precondition for the third round 
of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington," Han said. 
He added, "The U.S. side should be held responsible for the 
delay in issuing visas to the inspection team, because it is 
asking the unfair condition of an exchange of special envoys. 
But I think the nuclear inspections will progress well after 
all."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- A report of U.S. 
willingness to let the dollar rise to 110 yen is "completely 
misleading and warped," a senior Finance Ministry official said 
Thursday [24 February]. 
  Kosuke Nakahira, vice finance minister for international 
affairs, told a hastily called press conference that media 
reports' "reference to specific yen-rate levels are not a fact." 
He was referring to a report Thursday by the NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN about a discussion between U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at their 
meeting last month in Tokyo. 
  The major economic daily reported Bentsen as indicating the 
United States is willing to allow the dollar to rise to 110 yen. 
Nakahira said the report's "comments on exchange rates are 
completely misleading and warped," but he declined to disclose 
what Bentsen and Hosokawa actually discussed, saying, "they both 
agreed not to comment." 
  Asked if the yen's fall against the dollar is viewed as 
undesirable before the meeting of Group of Seven (G-7) finance 
ministers and central bankers Saturday in Germany, Nakahira 
said, "that's absolutely not in my mind." 
  Nakahira said he wants to scotch "as soon as possible rumors 
that do not reflect the facts." 
  Currency dealings are now conducted 24 hours a day, he 
noted, 
when asked about the timing of the press conference during Tokyo 
trading hours. 
  Nakahira also rejected suggestions of pressure from the 
United States, saying, "we are in close contact every day." 
  He also said he wants to make it clear that monetary 
authorities do not "guide or tolerate exchange rates."

has admitted that it is difficult for the police to obtain 
information on allegations that the opposition in Malaysia were 
receiving money from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, 
ASIS. He said this was expected since no one would in his right 
mind admit being involved in espionage. He disclosed this to 
reporters after the breaking of fast at the Police Training 
Center in Kuala Lumpur last night. However, Tan Sri Rahim said 
police would continue with investigation into the allegations. 
Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed was also present 
at the function attended by some 1,000 police personnel of all 
ranks.

<F P=106> [By Farush Khan] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. -- Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said 
today today the Barisan Nasional [BN or National Front] will act 
as a very effective opposition in Sabah and will fight against 
all forms of deviation, abuse of power, and oppression. The 
deputy prime minister said that the BN would monitor every move 
of the Sabah Government to ensure there would be no malpractices 
and deviation. 
  "If there is any sign of victimisation of any ethnic group 
or 
community, we will fight all out," he told reporters after 
presenting books on Islam to 15 Muslim organisations at the 
Tabung Haji headquarters before the breaking of fast. Anwar, who 
is UMNO [United Malays National Organization] deputy president, 
said that the increase in the number of seats won by the BN in 
Sabah two days ago compared to those during the 1990 elections 
was clear proof that the BN strength in Sabah could not be 
belittled. 
  Thanking all the voters and workers who had supported the BN 
during the elections, Anwar said that he was moved by the strong 
support from the people in Sabah for UMNO. Anwar had spearheaded 
the BN's campaign in the elections. PBS [Parti Bersatu Sabah or 
Sabah United Party] won 25 seats to BN's 23 to secure a simple 
majority in the 48 seat State Legislative Assembly. "With this, 
the suggestion that certain leaders like Tun Mustapha would 
obstruct the emergence of UMNO was baseless," he said. 
  He said the results of the elections also showed that 
Muslims 
and the bumiputeras [indigeneous races] in Sabah rejected 
leaders who did not support the BN. "I would like to thank the 
people as in evaluating the results of the elections, it is 
clear that non-Muslim bumiputeras, Kadazan Christians from 
certain areas as well as the Chinese also gave their support to 
the BN," he added. He said the BN could not penetrate remote 
areas and the influence of the Kadazan Christians because of the 
propaganda and the strong enmity instilled in the people. 
"However, our early achievement proves that UMNO and BN have the 
support of part of the people of Sabah," he said. 
  He called on the Parti Bersatu Sabah Government to stop its 
divide-and-rule politics and concentrate on helping the poor who 
had been neglected. 
  Asked how the results would influence the BN role in Sabah, 
Anwar said that the BN achievement in the elections was 
extraordinary. "If the elections were held one or two weeks 
later, the results could have been different," he said. Asked 
whether he would describe the BN achievement in the elections as 
beyond expectation, Anwar said in any election, the BN would 
certainly want to win. 
  "Looking at the results in 1990 and those of 1994, it is 
extraordinary. It was the first time the BN was seen as having 
contested in the real sense of the word," he said. 
  Anwar later met Sabah BN representatives. They are scheduled 
to meet Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed tomorrow. 
At the meeting with Sabah BN Assemblymen at the Legend Hotel 
here, Anwar said that the Sabah BN would uphold the principles 
of democracy and not resort to the tactics adopted by former 
Sabah chief minister Tun Datu Mustapa Datu Harun in 1985. He 
said the BN would face PBS as a responsible opposition. 
  Twenty-two of the 23 assemblymen who won in the elections 
were present. Also present were Selangor Menteri Besar [Chief 
Minister] and UMNO Vice President Tan Sri Mohamed Mohamed Taib, 
Gaya MP Philip Yong, Tawau MP Geoffrey Yee, and Pensiangan MP 
Taimin Lumaing. 
  In his speech earlier, Anwar called on Islamic bodies and 
scholars to initiate the translation of more Islamic books of 
high quality into Bahasa Malaysia. He hoped to see at least 100 
of such books translated in two years. 
  In Johor Baru, UMNO Vice President Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin 
said today the BN, particularly UMNO had scored a moral victory 
in the elections despite losing out narrowly to PBS. He said 
despite its infancy in Sabah, UMNO did better than expected.

  [Text] The finance minister, Dr. Richard Hu, today 
announced the budget, which includes one of tax rebates on 
personal income tax and the higher interest rates for CPF 
[Central Provident Fund] retirement and special accounts. Also 
additional rebates for service and conservancy and rental 
charges. For businesses, it is a mixed budget. The property 
tax will be reduced, but there will be an increase in employers' 
CPF rates and in the salary ceilings for the skill development 
fund levy. 
  Presenting his budget statement in Parliament, Dr. Hu said 
the better-than-expected growth last year yielded a healthy 
budget surplus. This strong fiscal position gives the 
government scope to pass part of the surplus back to the economy 
and to enhance the assets of citizens. 
  For individuals, [words indistinct] one of rebates of 5 
percent on income tax for year of assessment 1994 and on top of 
the GST [Goods and Services Tax] rebates announced last year, 
there will be additional rebates on HDB [Housing and Development 
Board] service and conservancy charges and rentals. This will 
raise from [Singapore dollars] $40.50 to $76.50. The rebates 
will take effect from 1 April. 
  The government will also be paying a higher interest rate 
for 
savings in the CPF retirement and the special accounts. From 1 
July next year, the rates will be one and one-quarter point 
above the normal CPF interest rates. Details will be announced 
by the labor minister later. 
  There also will be another share ownership corporate scheme 
to help Singaporeans build up CPF savings to buy shares in the 
next major privatization exercise two years from now. Every CPF 
member above 21 years will get $300 from the government. But 
the employer must contribute at least $750 during an 18-month 
qualifying period starting from the first of next month. There 
will be a prorated contribution for those who put in less than 
$750 and to help some taxpayers to enjoy (?proration) incentives 
and extension of the claim period. The claim period for the 
special and further tax rebates will be extended by two years to 
nine years. This will take effect from year of assessment 1994. 
  For companies, the property tax rates for industrial and 
commercial properties will be cut by 1 percent each point to 15 
percent from 1 July. The intention is to allow the rates in 
stages to 12 percent over the next 45 years. The cut also 
applies to residential property rented out. The concessionary 
tax rates for owned and occupied residential property will 
remain unchanged, and also there will be tax incentives to 
promote the growth of international derivative trading and 
arbitrage activities and trading of regional securities. 
  From assessment year 1995, the Asian Currency Unit -- the 
ACU 
-- and approved securities companies -- ASC scheme -- will be 
expanded to include foreign securities lending and borrowing. 
They will enjoy concessionary tax rates of 10 percent on income 
derived from lending and borrowing foreign securities with 
another ACU, ASC, or non-resident persons. The concession will 
also apply to income derived by approved fund managers who are 
arranging such transactions on behalf of foreign investors. 
  There will be no tax on securities lending fees, 
(?manifested) dividend, and interest paid by the ACU or ASC to a 
nonresident person who doesn't have a permanent establishment 
here. Also, no stamp duties on documents executed under sale 
and agreement in respect to such securities lending and the 
borrowing activities. 
  Dr. Hu also announced the 10-percent concessionary tax rates 
on income derived from stock and physical trading in silver and 
platinum with approved parties. And to promote Singapore as a 
regional securities trading and fund management center, 
transactions of ACU and ASC and non-Singapore dollar securities 
with approved fund managers will also get a 10-percent tax 
concession. But only transactions involving funds managed for 
foreign investors by such fund managers will qualify. These 
transactions will also be exempted from contract note stamp 
duties. 
  Also to be exempted from tax, income derived by ASC from 
approved syndicated offshore credit and underwriting facilities. 
The aim is to further enhance Singapore's position as a leading 
syndication center in Asia. 
  Dr. Hu also announced enhancement to foreign centers 
introduced to promote the development of the manufacturing and 
services sectors. It is to make it more attractive for 
companies to expand after the initial incentive period. The 
initial tax relief period for the expansion of established 
enterprises, expanding service companies and centers, export of 
services and warehousing, and servicing incentives is now five 
years or shorter. This will be extended to not more than 10 
years. But, further extension would be allowed [words 
indistinct] not more than five years. This will be subject to a 
maximum relief of 20 years for incentives. 
  The minister also disclosed that to nullify the effects of 
GST, import duty on cars will be 41 percent from 1 April; duty 
on taxis 17 percent and on motorcycles 12 percent. Also to 
offset GST, excise duties on leaded and unleaded petrol will be 
cut. (?And) duties on kerosene, lubricating oil, liquified 
petroleum gas, and aviation (?fuel) will be suspended. To meet 
GATT requirements, import duties on cigarettes, tobacco, liquor, 
and motor vehicles will be converted to excise duties from 1 
July, but the tax burden remains unchanged. 
  Dr. Hu also announced changes to the CPF contribution rates 
for employers and employees as well as on the salary ceilings 
for skill development levy. From 1 July, employers' CPF 
contribution will go up by 1.5 percentage point to 20 percent. 
That for employees will be reduced by the same amount to 20 
percent. Dr. Hu said the government is making a final 1.5 
percent point adjustment to the CPF contribution rates in view 
of the continued growth of the economy. He said employers and 
employees should take this adjustment into account in the wage 
negotiations. 
  On worker training, Dr. Hu told Parliament that skill 
development fund [SDF] in financial year 92 disbursed more than 
$50 million for training programs. This is much more than the 
$50 million collected through the skill development levy that 
year. Dr. Hu said at the present SDF disbursement level, the 
fund will eventually be depleted. The government has, 
therefore, decided to revise the salary ceilings for skill 
development levy collection from $750 to $1,000 from financial 
year 95. But the levy rate will remain at 1 percent. 
  He also announced more for edusave [education savings] and 
medifund [medical fund]. Dr. Hu said in good years it is 
essential we accumulate surpluses to save in time of crises and 
to secure investor confidence in our future. (?This) will also 
allow us to build up the assets of Singaporeans. In this 
regard, he said the financial year 93 edusave contribution will 
be increased to $1 billion. For financial year 94, another $500 
million will be put into edusave and $100 million into medifund. 
  Dr. Hu also announced the setting up of the pension fund for 
public officers. He said it is a good health-keeping practice 
for the government to recognize pensions as a future liability 
and to provide for it. He said civil servants should not spend 
their retirement in fear that the government can't pay their 
pensions when times are bad. 
  The government's total expenditure in financial year 94 is 
expected to reach $16.7 billion, up 19 percent from financial 
year 93. As in previous years, social and community services 
will take the largest share at nearly 40 percent with more than 
half of it for education. The second largest share at 32 
percent will be taken by national security, including defense 
and home affairs. 
  Dr. Hu said Singapore today is at a turning point. We have 
become a newly industrialized economy and are on the threshold 
of the first league of nations. But Singaporeans must not relax 
and take progress and prosperity for granted. The challenge is 
how to collectively manage to leap into the ranks of the first 
league. 
  The finance minister notes Singaporeans have achieved much 
in 
the last 20 years due to sound economic management by the 
government and the hard work of the people. These things must 
continue as we strive to gain promotion into the first league. 
  Concluding, Dr. Hu said the world economy is expected to 
perform better in 1994. The signs are optimistic. The U.S. 
economic expansion will remain strong. After last year's dismal 
performance, this year's outlook in Western Europe is 
comparatively brighter and Japan's is also expected to improve 
this year. 
  Dr. Hu noted that the expanding economies of Asia will lead 
the pack. Singapore can prosper and grow together with our 
neighbors anf trading partners if we remain competitive and 
productive. He is confident we can achieve if we continue to 
price diligence, assets, and enterprise above luck and quick 
gains.

<F P=106> [By Shigeo Masui] </F>
  [Text] New York, 19 Feb -- "It is better to have reached 
no agreement than to have reached an empty agreement." This was 
what President Bill Clinton stated positively at the recent 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. However, YOMIURI SHIMBUN's New York 
Bureau recently obtained a document that clearly indicates how 
the President decided on taking a hard line against Japan. The 
document entitled "Repairing the U.S.-Japan Relationship" was 
written by Glen S. Fukushima, vice chairman of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry [of American businessmen] in Japan. 
Fukushima, who is currently head of the Comprehensive Policy 
Department of AT&amp;T in Japan and a former USTR official in 
charge 
of Japanese affairs, is no stranger to the backstage activities 
of Japan-U.S. talks on such issues as rice and automobiles. The 
President himself read through the 12-page report, and wrote on 
it such comments as "worth reading," "to the point," and "needs 
to be discussed." Here and there in the document are underlined 
sections with a note stating "agree." 
  Included in this report are an analysis of the current 
Japan-U.S. relationship, a frank criticism of the Clinton 
administration's policy toward Japan, and suggestions for future 
strategy in dealing with Japan. The report was handed to the 
president by Prof. Derek Shearer [name as published] of the 
Occidental University, who has been an intimate friend of the 
President since their student years. The President studied the 
report on 20 January. Reportedly, the copy of the report with 
the President's comments was returned to Fukushima through Prof. 
Shearer. 
  At the same time, President Clinton gave instructions that 
copies of this report, bearing the initial "B (Bill)," should be 
distributed to 10 officials, including USTR Mickey Kantor, 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Undersecretary Roger 
Altman, and Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for 
national security affairs. What is noteworthy is that the 
so-called pro-Japanese group at the State Department, which 
oversees Japan-U.S. security issues, was excluded. 
  The returned report indicates the President read it 
intensively. In particular, the comment "agree" was written in 
two places in the report. One place is where the report 
concludes it is "wrong" to say that "Japan will go down 
[shizumu]," a comment that has been conspicuous in recent news 
coverage. It continues by stating the "depression may last 
longer than expected," but "since the foundations of the 
Japanese economy are not impaired, it will be able to make a 
comeback as the strongest rival once again." 
  The other place is where the report makes the following 
criticism: "In dealing with the issue of Japan's opening up of 
its market, the Clinton administration does not seem to 
understand when, where, and to what degree it should impose 
pressure to induce the maximum results while trying to keep 
Japanese indignation to the minimum." This portion is not only 
underlined but also marked "agree." 
  There are as many as 15 portions underlined. For example, 
"An administration's failure to take any concrete action is 
regarded in Japan as weakness, not as tolerance," or "Even if 
the two countries reach an accord, problems are bound to arise 
in a couple of months because of interpretation of the 
language." In this way, the report also gives instructions that 
in the event that an accord is reached, Japanese and English 
vocabulary used in the accord should be clarified to Japanese 
and American reporters.

  [Text] Ships from the Indian Navy and the Republic of 
Singapore Navy (RSN) have begun a week-long naval exercise in 
the Indian Ocean. Two RSN missile corvettes and an Indian Navy 
submarine will take part in the exercise involving 
anti-submarine warfare manoeuvres. The exercise will continue 
until Sunday. 
  A Mindef [Ministry of Defense] statement issued on Tuesday 
said the exercise was designed to "promote professional 
interaction and to enhance bilateral ties between the two 
navies". About 350 officers and men from the two navies will 
take part in this second joint naval exercise. The first one 
was also held in the Indian Ocean in February last year. The two 
RSN missile corvettes, the RSS Victory and RSS Valour, left for 
the exercise on Friday. The commander of the RSN task group is 
Lt-Colonel Gary Lee, who is also commander of the RSN's 188 
Squadron. 
  The two vessels arrived at Port Blair in the South Andaman 
Islands on Sunday and participants spent Sunday and Monday in 
familiarisation and shore training before sailing for the waters 
around the Andaman and Nicobar islands for the exercise. 
  The Mindef statement said the joint exercise between the RSN 
and the Indian Navy reflected the warm relationship between the 
two countries.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI], on 22 February, started work verifying that past trade 
agreements with the United States have yielded results, to 
refute the U.S. claim that "trade pacts concluded with Japan so 
far have not produced any results." 
  MITI plans to classify agreements into three categories, 
according to subject, such as those related to deregulation or 
improved transparency in procedures. It will then determine 
what specific action has been taken since the agreements became 
effective, using as evaluation criteria market share figures and 
the rate of growth of purchases. MITI wants to then explain the 
results of this evaluation to the Untied States, even though it 
is far from certain how much understanding the United States 
will show. 
  The United States expressed doubt at the economic framework 
talks that any results have been achieved by the bilateral trade 
accords reached so far. U.S. President Bill Clinton said at a 
news conference held after the Japan-U.S. summit: "Over 30 
agreements have been concluded with Japan since 1980. But its 
market is still more closed than that of any of the seven 
industrialized nations where imports are concerned." 
  Given this situation, MITI has decided to reevaluate the 
achievements of accords concluded so far to create a favorable 
atmosphere for the reopening of talks. A senior MITI official 
explained: "The failure of the past accords is the basis for 
U.S. arguments on setting numerical targets in the future. All 
that means is that even if the framework talks resumed now, it 
would only lead to a repetition of the same kind of 
confrontation." 
  Specifically, the evaluation will be carried out on 22 
agreements between Japan and the United States, plus a further 
five concluded by NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation]. 
  To decide how effective those accords have been, MITI will 
use quantitative results. For example, NTT's procurement of 
foreign products has increased by 46 percent since 1980; imports 
of beef almost doubled from 1988 to 1992; the number of foreign 
lawyers in Japan, which was only 31 in 1988, has increased to 
81. The ministry wants to present these as a concrete basis for 
refuting U.S. claims. 
  Even on the issue of cellular phones, over which the United 
States is now considering taking sanctions, MITI will ask for 
U.S. understanding by explaining that the number of the base 
stations for Motorola-type phones, which was zero when the 
cellular phone accord was concluded in 1989, will reach 189 by 
April this year. 
  Some admit that, in terms of numbers, results are scarce for 
private sector accords, such as those on glass sheets and forest 
products. But MITI wants to seek U.S. understanding, saying: 
"Great results have been produced in areas like government 
procurement where the Japanese and U.S. Governments are 
involved."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Should Be Done To Expand Sales of American </F>
Automobiles?"] 
  [Text] The liberalization of Japan's auto market has 
become a major issue between Japan and the United States. In 
the Japan-U.S. economic consultations that broke down recently, 
the U.S. Government strongly demanded setting targets to expand 
imports of finished automobiles. The U.S. auto industry has 
called on Japan to expand its sale of U.S.-made automobiles to 
100,000 units over the next three years (19,000 units sold last 
year). 
  Certainly, it is difficult not only for foreign companies 
but 
also for domestic companies to break into the Japanese market. 
Commercial practices of a closed nature as well as excessive 
government controls must be remedied. Still, however hard other 
companies may try to pry open the markets of Japan through 
government-to-government treaties, unless they can interest the 
dealers, who sell the automobiles, and the consumers, who buy 
them, business can never materialize. 
  Japanese dealers may be called keiretsu dealers, but they 
are 
different from the past, and they are not bound by contracts 
with manufacturers as to which manufacturers' vehicles to sell. 
Besides, lately, the business of selling domestic automobiles 
is not going well. If the dealers confined themselves as 
keiretsu dealers, their business would only suffer more. 
Individual dealers now need to establish independence for 
themselves, and to get rid of the old way of thinking which took 
controls by keiretsu-connected manufacturers for granted. 
  On the other hand, U.S. manufacturers need to get more 
serious in the efforts to break into the markets. Specifically, 
they should put more efforts into selling to dealers directly. 
Some of the Big Three auto makers are selling their products 
through the sales outlets of Japanese auto manufacturers. This 
means they do not want to develop their own sales outlets and 
instead want to let their competitors sell their products. That 
attitude is too easy-going. 
  Secondly, what needs to be done to get the dealers 
interested, naturally, is to offer commodities which are 
appropriate for, and can be sold in, the Japanese market, and 
also to present attractive business terms. The manufacturers 
need to offer right-hand drive automobiles, ensure high 
performance and good quality products, not overprice the 
products, and be able to provide good after-sales service. 
  Americans consider cars as something like shoes, while 
Japanese value them as if they were part of their own houses. 
The U.S. manufacturers should recognize this different cultural 
view, and pursue efforts to develop markets with the 
business-version perception of "In Rome, do as the Romans do." 
Japanese consumers are prone to buy foreign-made products. The 
Japanese market is worth U.S. manufacturers going after 
seriously. 
  Recently, the results of a joint survey by Japanese and U.S. 
consulting companies at the request of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of 
Commerce were released. The survey analyzed the Japanese market 
with respect to dealer networks, distribution costs, prices of 
cars, purchasing practices, permits, and customer satisfaction. 
  The survey presented an estimate that the U.S. Big Three's 
annual sales in Japan will grow to 57,000 units if all existing 
problems in Japan -- like closed keiretsu relations between 
manufacturers and dealers, and the U.S. manufacturers' 
inadequate efforts -- are resolved. Some of the premises for 
the estimate are questionable, but the survey does show there is 
plenty of room for both Japan and the United States, 
particularly in the private sectors, to make efforts for 
improvement.

<F P=106> ["Editorial": "The Mobile Phone Issue Should be Settled </F>
Through Private Sector Discussion"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government asserts that the Japanese 
market for car phones and other mobile phones is not open 
enough, and that Japan has thus violated the 1989 agreement 
between the two countries. It is now preparing sanctions 
against Japan. 
  Put simply, the U.S. Government complaint, and that of the 
private company involved, Motorola, is that while a U.S. company 
has succeeded in entering the market, its market share is too 
small. They profess particularly strong dissatisfaction with the 
fact that, in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and Central Japan, 
the biggest markets for mobile phones, Motorola is 
overwhelmingly disadvantaged by rival Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation's (NTT) system, and they claim this 
constitutes breaking the promise made in 1989. 
  There is a reason for the Motorola system's minimal share in 
the above areas. In 1987, the mobile phone market, which used 
to be monopolized by NTT, was opened, and the Cellular Telephone 
Group (affiliated with DDI Corporation) and Teleway Japan 
Corporation (later IDO) joined the market. At that time, due to 
government policy which forbade more than two companies 
operating in any one area, NTT was permitted to operate 
nationwide, IDO in the metropolitan area and Central Japan, and 
the Cellular Group in the other service areas. 
  IDO actually started its service under the Motorola system 
in 
November 1991, although it had already begun an NTT-system 
service in late 1988. There was, therefore, a time lag of about 
three years and capital investment in the Motorola system cannot 
be compared with that in the NTT system. The NTT-system service 
can be offered to an area covering 94 percent of the Japanese 
population, while the Motorola system can only service an area 
covering 60 percent of the population. In terms of the number 
of mobile phone units contracted, the Motorola system accounts 
for only 10,000 terminals, compared to the NTT system's 
overwhelming 310,000 sets. 
  The United States sees the failure to set up from the start 
a 
mobile phone company servicing the whole country under the 
Motorola system, and IDO's delay in actually operating the 
Motorola system, even after it was adopted, as deliberate moves 
on the part of Japan to obstruct the opening of the market. 
  An outright purchase system [as opposed to the existing 
lease 
system] for mobile phone terminals will be introduced next 
April, as will a digital service. At a time when the market is 
expected to expand vigorously, whatever the reasons put forward 
by the Japanese, the United States seems to have become 
increasingly irritated by the fact its serious disadvantage in 
market share compared to the NTT system may prove a decisive 
setback in future business operations. 
  The Japanese side reportedly plans to increase 
Motorola-system relay stations by 130 in the next two or three 
years, allowing the Motorola-system service to grow to the same 
level as the NTT-system service. We do not intend to say we 
cannot understand why the United States is irritated. 
Nevertheless, the attitude of the U.S. Government is 
unreasonable in urging Japanese private companies to accept its 
demands and ignore business profitability. For example, the 
United States has demanded that 130 relay stations be 
established in fiscal year 1994 and that Japan procure 225,000 
Motorola-made terminals. 
  The current mobile phone issue seems typical of the Clinton 
administration's political strategy, and was deliberately raised 
to coincide with the summit meeting between the two countries as 
well as negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. Although the Japanese Government needs to take positive 
steps to dispel U.S. misunderstanding, it should not overreact 
to the issue. Both sides should stay calm, and the issue should 
be settled through dialogue at the private sector level. 
Excessive government intervention will only increase confusion.

  [Text] U.S. information and communications companies have 
advanced a request that "the Japanese Government financially 
support private firms in the project to establish 
next-generation communications networks (new communications 
networks that will use fiber optics) in Japan." They have made 
the request because, if the government participates in the 
project, it will become easier for them to obtain "guarantees" 
for orders for necessary equipment to be used in the project. 
The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [PTM] and Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have differing views 
about the project. The PTM has asserted that "the government 
should financially support private firms in the project," while 
NTT has said, "the project should be carried out solely by 
private firms." It is possible the requests from U.S. firms, 
which "reinforce" PTM's assertion, will turn into a demand that 
the government guarantee a certain level of foreign capital 
inflow into the project, thus leading to trade friction. 
  The U.S. firms' intentions were disclosed by John Stern 
[name 
as published] during a recent interview with NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN. Mr. Stern (representative and director of the Japan 
office for U.S. electronics companies) represents U.S. 
information and communications companies in Japan. During the 
interview, Mr. Stern said: "If private companies (such as NTT) 
take total charge of the project, most orders for necessary 
equipment will probably be given to Japanese businesses." He 
added: "If the Japanese Government participates in the project, 
U.S. firms will be able to ask Tokyo to secure the procurement 
of U.S. products (through such things as Japan-U.S. trade 
talks)." 
  The project, which is characterized by the PTM and NTT as 
"an 
important task directed toward the 21st century," is aimed at 
setting up fiber optics communications networks, which are 
capable of sending and receiving voice information and distinct 
moving images, in households and offices all over Japan. The 
project will become the social capital that supports multimedia 
businesses. It is expected that about 30 to 50 trillion yen 
will be invested in the project by the year 2010. 
  The Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the 
posts 
and telecommunications minister), which is studying measures to 
establish the new networks, plans to propose that "private firms 
should be basically in charge of the project and the government 
should financially support them in setting up networks in 
depopulated areas, where communications business will not be 
worth much." The council is to include the proposal in its 
report to be submitted to the posts and telecommunications 
minister in May. 
  The PTM's "idea of the government supporting private firms" 
is also backed by some new common carriers which want to prevent 
NTT from enhancing its superiority in communications business. 
On the other hand, NTT, which opposes government participation 
in the project, and the Finance Ministry, which hopes to cut 
financial expenditures, are supporting the idea of "establishing 
the networks through private firms." Thus, it is likely that 
arguments over the project will continue even after the 
Telecommunications Council submits its report. 
  During unofficial talks with NTT in January, the U.S. Trade 
Representative demanded foreign participation in the project. 
In reply, NTT reportedly simply said: "As in the past, we will 
procure equipment through necessary procedures which are fair to 
both domestic and foreign companies." It is believed that U.S. 
companies are backing the idea of "the government supporting 
private firms" with the hope of obtaining a surer "guarantee for 
foreign participation in the project."

  [Text] Japan has decided to cooperate with China in its 
project for building a new international airport in Shanghai as 
"a key airport in East Asia in the 21st century." A 
fact-finding mission has already been sent to Shanghai early 
this year to arrange for the start of a full-scale research to 
be conducted by the two countries. Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, who will visit Japan on 23 February, will confirm the 
promotion of the bilateral cooperation at his talks with Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. China intends to turn this project into 
one of the major projects for obtaining the next yen-based loan 
(scheduled to last from fiscal 1996 till fiscal 1998) just as in 
the case of the project for building a bullet line between 
Beijing and Shanghai. 
  Hongqiao Airport, which is located about 15 kms west of the 
old downtown section, currently serves the Shanghai area. 
However, due to a rapid increase in the number of flights, this 
airport has become overcrowded. The new airport will be built 
in the Pudong district, where drastic measures have been taken 
to introduce foreign capital, and which is expected become the 
forefront district for promoting the reform and open-door 
policy. The new airport will be built on the bank of the Chang 
Jiang River in the Pudong district, located about 30 kms east of 
the old downtown section. It has been reported that the new 
airport will be built not only as a replacement for Hongqiao 
Airport, but also as a major gateway to the Pudong district in 
Shanghai, where efforts are being made to turn the district into 
an area for promoting the development of finance, business, and 
advanced technology. 
  The government plans to organize a study team mainly 
composed 
of officials from the Transport Ministry and other agencies and 
ministries; start a full-scale study in May; and work out a 
report as early as September. China has already worked out on 
its own a first-phase project for completing one of the runways, 
hopefully, by 1996. By promoting the upcoming cooperative 
plans, the two countries intend to work out both the 
second-phase project, which will be completed by 2005, and a 
long-term comprehensive improvement program which covers the 
period up to 2020. The total cost for the project is estimated 
at approximately 20 billion yuan (equal to 260 billion yen). It 
is expected that while promoting the study of the project, the 
two countries will hold discussions on concrete measures for 
promoting financial cooperation.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 22 Feb 94 Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 21 February that Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa has instructed Satoshi Arai, general secretary 
of the Japan New Party [JNP], and other officials to study the 
possibility of forming a "large floor group" by unifying five 
floor groups of the coalition parties in the House of 
Representatives. This was revealed by several staff members of 
the party. 
  The prime minister so far has said he is for a "moderate 
multiparty system," but he appears to have come to think that if 
the coalition parties are to continue in power by defeating the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next general election 
conducted under the heiritsu-sei combining the single-seat 
district system and the proportional representation system, 
there is no choice but for the coalition parties to come 
together and form a new party. 
  This concept on forming a large floor group shows that the 
prime minister is changing his course toward the "two-party 
system" advocated by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary 
of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. This can be said to be 
proof also that his differences of views with people like Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who support a moderate 
multiparty system, are becoming prominent. There is no doubt 
that this matter will have a large impact on the political scene. 
  It was early this month that the prime minister disclosed 
his 
concept of forming a large floor group. He instructed General 
Secretary Arai and other officials to conduct a study on it. 
According to a JNP staff member, the prime minister asked: "Can 
we not form a large floor group by combining Shinseito, Komeito, 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] as we are forming a joint floor group with 
Sakigake [Harbinger] now?" Subsequently, General Secretary Arai 
reported this to an informal meeting of the JNP Diet members on 
16 February. But by that time it was known that the prime 
minister had decided on an early cabinet reshuffle in order to 
remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from his post. As a 
result, the Diet members in the meeting were more interested in 
maintaining the joint floor group with Sakigake, and failed to 
come up with a conclusion regarding the idea of forming a large 
floor group. 
  The concept of a large floor group stands on the premise 
that 
most of the existing five floor groups will make it through the 
next general election, gathering around Hosokawa as their axis, 
even though some of their members may fail. While this concept 
ties in directly with the idea of a new political party being 
promoted by people like Ozawa, it stands against Takemura's idea 
of "strengthening ties with liberal forces within the LDP, the 
SDPJ and the DSP, while drawing a line with the two parties -- 
Shinseito and Komeito." The concept of forming a large floor 
group is likely to have some influence on the cabinet reshuffle 
which the prime minister wants to bring about later this month.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Forget About Cabinet Reform and Do Everything </F>
To Resolve Economic Issues] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa appears to be 
someone who likes to make abrupt decisions. Barely days have 
passed since the dispute he caused by his out-of-the-blue 
announcement on the national welfare tax has subsided. Now the 
government and ruling parties are being shaken over the cabinet 
reshuffle hassle. 
  In the past, we have often pointed out that Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, his government, and the ruling parties are taking the 
current economic conditions too easily and are being laggard in 
taking measures. While economic conditions are the worst since 
the end of World War II, economic friction between Japan and the 
United States is becoming more serious. 
  Now that the political reform bills -- which were the most 
important pending issue -- have been passed, it is now time for 
the government to tackle economic issues which have been left 
behind. To do so, the government needs to hurry and pass the 
third 1993 supplementary budget, and then deliberate the 1994 
budget; and to do everything to implement deregulation and 
administrative reforms. 
  In view of the given conditions, it is clear how precipitate 
and unnatural the idea of a cabinet reshuffle at this time is. 
If the purpose of Prime Minister Hosokawa's cabinet reshuffle 
is to remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, with whom some 
reports say Hosokawa has not been getting along well recently, 
then the justification for a reshuffle is very weak. It is not 
even worthwhile. 
  Maybe, Prime Minister Hosokawa is overconfident about his 
high public popularity rate. The reason why he was named top 
leader was because the public impression of him as the face of 
the coalition was good and because his clean image -- which is 
different from existing politicians -- was considered as a good 
cap on the "political reform government." The political power 
game and intraparty circumstances of the coalition parties also 
played a role. 
  In the beginning, the prime minister had to go slow. After 
the rice market liberalization and political reform bills issues 
were taken care of and put behind him, he became confident about 
running the political scene -- we can see that. Furthermore, in 
the course of working on the pending issues, the man with whom 
he consulted no doubt changed from Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary 
Ichiro Ozawa. 
  There was a difference of opinion between Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura regarding the key 
questions of formulating the 1994 budget within 1993 and 
instituting a national welfare tax. But, where the two 
questions are concerned, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, who 
wanted the budget to be formulated by the end of 1993 and 
opposed the national welfare tax idea as being too abrupt, was 
after all more rational in his thinking. 
  The prime minister caused political chaos over the two 
issues 
and thus showed the nation and the world he lacked political 
leadership. His political reponsibility for such follies is 
great. A conscientious politician would take some kind of 
responsibility for this. Indeed, the man who should be 
criticized is the prime minister himself. A leader should have 
the capacity to lend his ear to criticism and the advice of his 
housekeeper, the chief cabinet secretary, as well. 
  If the cabinet reshuffle is meant to establish and solidify 
a 
basis for a long-lasting government now that the political 
reform bills have been passed, what the prime minister must do 
first is present the people with the policy issues he wants to 
tackle, including how they will be carried out. 
  The "political reform government" should change its name if 
all it wants to do is decide important matters with only a 
handful of coalition leaders behind closed doors. If Hosokawa 
wants to carry out a cabinet reshuffle, he must clearly explain 
why he needs to do so. And, it is only commonsense to question 
whether now is the appropriate time to do so, with the 1994 
budget needing to be passed. Now is the time to do everything 
to resolve economic issues rather than reshuffle the cabinet.

"How To Effectively Implement Hiraiwa Report: Specific Direction 
of Economic Structural Reforms Through Deregulation"] 
  [Text] The final report of the Hiraiwa Economic 
Reform Research Council which has been mentioned by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa whenever the opportunity presented itself was 
submitted at the end of last year. The report was prepared in 
the short period of three months, thus making it inevitable that 
it is lacking in terms of concrete policy direction. I would 
like to examine the Hiraiwa report in terms of its content, 
covering "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and 
"deregulation" as a means of enhancing its feasibility. 
  The final report (Hiraiwa Report published on 16 December) 
issued by the Economic Reform Research Council, reflecting the 
direction of Japan's medium- and long-term economic structural 
reforms that were announced in December 1993, has met with many 
negative evaluations such as "a report lacking specific ideas 
and strong appeal." However, it should have been obvious from 
the very beginning that, hobbled by an inadequate support staff, 
it would be difficult to develop specific numerical goals in a 
short period of three months. 
  The Hiraiwa Report is often compared with the Maekawa Report 
of 1986, but both reports were prepared with the main objective 
of clarifying basic policies for economic structural reform in 
the midst of expanding imbalances between domestic and 
international economies. In contrast to the fact that the 
earlier Maekawa Report reflected the main objective of 
international cooperation through alleviation of external 
imbalances, the recent Hiraiwa Report reflects the main 
objective of structurally converting the Japanese economic 
system from one dedicated to "catching up with advanced nations" 
to one that "emphasizes consumer interests." Further, a major 
feature of the report is that it takes a positive approach 
toward deregulation as a basic policy for attaining the goals of 
the report. 
  However, the content of the recent "final report" gave the 
impression that it "lacks specifics," not only because it lacked 
numerical goals, but most likely because it provided inadequate 
specifics about policy measures that were necessary to attain 
the report's original objectives. Let us examine the specifics 
of "economic reforms emphasizing consumer interests" and 
"deregulation" presented in the Hiraiwa Report. 
<H5>  Why Is Deregulation Necessary? </H5>
  Logical expectations are that deregulation like 
liberalization of trade will inspire comments from various 
sources reflecting "agreement in principle, but disagreement on 
specifics." Implementation of deregulation under such conditions 
will require specific guidance. 
  First, we must clearly establish awareness of why 
deregulation is necessary. The interim Hiraiwa Report limited 
itself in this respect to "government controls have thus far 
contributed to industrial growth and the stability of national 
lifestyles, but they now obstruct changes in the economic 
structure." However, establishment of national consensus on the 
specifics of deregulation will probably require greater 
clarification as to why once logical government controls have 
come to intensify the rigidity of the economy. 
  In general, the influence of individual consumers on big 
business is much weaker in terms of the ability to gather 
information, raise funds, or have an impact on politics. The 
resulting situation is one in which government is asked to 
exercise control over business as a representative for consumers 
in opposition to big business (New Industrial State 
by John K. Galbraith). Accordingly, more than a few consumers 
would probably feel insecure if the government's role in 
supervising such businesses were to be reduced. 
  In response to such concern, a need exists to explain that 
government controls have certain limitations in protecting 
consumer interests. As an example, consistent with consumer 
interests, government control of railway fares that are strongly 
monopolistic regionally were intended to prevent unilateral 
price hikes by railways. However, in reality, as long as a 
standard for "appropriate fees" cannot be established in the 
absence of market competition, government-controlled rates are 
determined by adding a prescribed margin to cost. Under such 
circumstances, railways are subject controled fare levels 
regardless of their business efforts and it becomes more 
advantageous for them to devote themselves to influencing 
regulators rather than improving productivity. Under government 
controls, businesses tend to "seek economic rent" rather than 
"seek profit," which is a primary cause for consumer interests 
to be sacrificed. 
  What means are available to protect consumer interests in 
lieu of government control? The answer is the perspective that 
"a true ally of the consumer is free competition among 
businesses rather than government control" (Capitalism and 
Freedom by Milton Friedman). 
  An important factor causing an increase in the demand for 
deregulation has been that technical innovation, progress in 
computerization, and economic internationalization have all 
combined to provide for quantum advances in the effectiveness of 
the competitive mechanism in the market place. 
  Regional monopolies are destroyed in areas such as 
communications, thanks to the arrival of new technology or an 
unanticipated new competitor. Further, the speed with which 
information flows among consumers accelerates, enhances the 
presence of potential competitors, and imposes difficulties in 
attempts to raise prices. And, as the scale of Japanese markets 
expands, sales efforts of foreign firms intensify and collusion 
among Japanese businesses becomes difficult. 
  The foregoing thought process clarifies the priorities which 
should be assigned to specific deregulation measures. At this 
point, we can introduce the arguments contained in the Hiraiwa 
Report calling for priority implementation of the "deregulation 
in principle" relative to economic controls in areas where it is 
easy to attain competition among businesses and intensify 
cautionary measures relative to relaxation of social controls 
which are not susceptible to easy attainment of such 
competition. However, at issue is the fact that a distinction 
has not been established between economic controls and social 
controls. 
  Examples are the vehicle inspection system, which is a major 
burden on consumers, and the Fire Prevention Law, which 
prohibits self-service gasoline retailers common in both Europe 
and the United States, which are both social controls and in 
principle are designed to protect the safety of consumers. 
However, in reality, they accomplish the role of economic 
controls protecting the interests of the business world. 
Accordingly, in the absence of a perspective which identifies 
the beneficiary of deregulation, it would be difficult to 
specify the effectiveness of deregulation measures. In this 
respect, we could take the approach of uniformly implementing 
economic deregulation on a nationally uniform basis, while 
examining relaxation of social controls by regional government 
entities on the basis of local conditions. 
<H5>  What Do We Mean by "Emphasizing Consumer Interests"? </H5>
  One of the four goals for economic reform envisioned by the 
Hiraiwa Report is an "economic society that gives priority to 
consumer interests." However, the reports fails to provide a 
definition for the important term, "consumer." In general, all 
people are concurrently producers and consumers. Accordingly, 
unless we define who "consumers" can enjoy "priority" over, we 
would probably be unable to develop an effective policy. 
  A concrete image of the "consumer" that can be built from 
the 
content of the "final report" is reflected in the three aspects 
of consumer, employee, and local resident. First, consumer 
interests can be protected by inter-business competition, as 
discussed earlier. Opening of domestic markets will lead to more 
active competition in the domestic markets, including foreign 
firms, and will be compatible with consumer interests. 
  However, many consumer organizations have opposed from the 
standpoint of safety the liberalization of certain products such 
as agricultural commodities. The original purpose of such 
consumer organizations was to seek abolishment of economic 
controls such as import restrictions while seeking reinforcement 
of social systems that ensure the safety of foodstuffs, but one 
wonders why, in reality, they dedicate themselves to stressing 
restrictions on the import of agricultural products. We believe 
that such an approach is inspired by the fact that there is no 
such thing as a pure consumer, that there is the duality that 
consumers are concurrently producers and their actions reflect 
unspoken antipathy for the increased competition that 
deregulation would release. 
  If that is the case, it would probably be more useful to 
take 
the abstract issue of defining consumer interests and replace it 
with something of more practical significance such as "the 
interests of new market entrants." Increases in the number of 
new market entrants in the market place threaten the rights of 
existing businesses and require businesses to put more effort 
into providing better service to the consumer in terms of price 
and quality. Further, establishment of product safety would have 
to represent the highest level of consumer service. Accordingly, 
as long as consumers have appropriate information, existence of 
new market entrants that threaten existing businesses should be 
compatible with the interests of the general consumer. 
  At this point, we can identify traditional Japanese policies 
about "protection of smaller businesses" as having a trade-off 
relationship with consumer interests. Until recently, assertions 
were made that farmers, small merchants, and financial 
institutions were "economically disadvantaged" and that there 
was social value in protecting the survival of such small and 
midsized businesses from the oppressive competition of big 
business. Such logic served as the reason for existence of the 
Large-Scale Retail Stores Law which protected the interests of 
smaller stores and served as a basis for frequent charges that 
price competition occasioned by the entry of big business in the 
market place violated the Antimonopoly Law in the form of 
"dumping." 
  However, in reality, the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law was 
useful in regulating new market participation by large retail 
stores not only against small stores, but against existing large 
supermarkets. This is a major reason why large supermarket 
operators are not necessarily eager to see the abolishment of 
the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law. Moreover, various financial 
market controls designed to prevent the failure of small 
financial institutions in the cause of maintaining confidence 
and order have functioned to create excessive profits for the 
leading banks. 
  Such measures reflected in government controls have caused 
an 
increase in consumer prices and a transfer of income to 
producers. Considering such conditions, as long as we adhere to 
policies that protect the existing inefficient existing rights 
of small and midsized businesses, we will be unable to dispose 
of a major portion of erstwhile government controls. 
  In the future, as downsizing of businesses progresses under 
technical innovation and computerization and as 
internationalization of business activities progresses, the 
ability of small and midsized businesses to fine tune their 
activities will increase in significance. Deregulation will 
expand opportunities for new businesses, enhance the vitality of 
new small and midsized businesses, and will play an important 
role in expanding the job market. In that sense, the true value 
of the Hiraiwa Report will depend on its ability to divorce the 
so-called disadvantaged small and midsized businesses from the 
sphere of the "consumer" which should be emphasized from a 
policy viewpoint. 
<H5>  Interests of Employees and Local Residents </H5>
  Preserving employment is a major objective of government 
controls, as is maintaining consumer safety. This fact is 
increasingly important in today's recessionary period. At one 
time, the government's role in the labor market was to dedicate 
itself to restraining discretionary actions of big business 
through government controls as a means of protecting employee 
interests. An especially significant example was the Labor 
Standards Law, which regulated occupational sectors and working 
hours for females, who were once considered disadvantaged in the 
work place. 
  However, continuing to regulate labor markets where advanced 
education is stressed through the same regulations that 
prevailed in the days of excess labor and the tragic history of 
female factory workers will not necessarily promote employee 
interests. Restricting potential work categories for females can 
lead to excuses to discriminate between male and female workers, 
and administrative guidance against cash payments for unused 
leave with pay can result in a bonus for employers. 
  Of special note is that once the working-age population 
begins to drop after 1995, the labor supply will tighten despite 
a medium-term drop in the economic growth rate. Once that 
situation arises, competition among businesses will function 
more effectively than government controls in the interests of 
consumers and employees. Increased competition among businesses 
will require workers to be able to resign at will from their 
current jobs. 
  The policy of Japanese employment practices that called for 
preserving employment under all circumstances deprived, as 
compensation, from employees their "job rights" on which 
greatest importance was placed by European and U.S. labor 
unions. As a result, many Japanese salarymen are subject to long 
working hours, frequent reassignments, and transfers, and, once 
they leave work represent impotent company employees who are 
totally alienated from the local society in which they 
physically reside. 
  Moreover, under Japanese employment practices encompassing 
lifetime employment and promotions based on seniority, women 
workers, who must deal with high career interruptions because of 
child-bearing and job transfers by the husband, are handicapped 
and must face large pay differentials between the sexes compared 
to other advanced nations. In this sense, the terms "flexible 
labor markets" and "jointly participating society of the sexes" 
must have identified the employee's position as a "consumer." 
  Assurance of "job rights" enabling the individual to select 
a 
job for which he is best suited and the ability to acquire 
skills that will not be degraded upon departure from a given 
employer will serve as a most effective tool in coping with 
mandatory retirement during recessions. Further, if the scope of 
individual duties for white-collar workers were clearly defined 
as is the case in Europe and the United States, paid leave could 
be used on a programmed basis and adequate time could be 
allotted to local volunteer activities through departure from 
work at predesignated times. 
  Although little is said in the "final report," the 
implementation of decentralized government authority should also 
be a major goal in terms of promoting consumer interests. Under 
current practice, local governments without financial backing or 
substantial authority to establish budgets and tax systems and 
the regional tax allocation system that which compensates for 
losses function to significantly obstruct the growth of 
autonomous local government (quoted from Escape From 
Bureaucratic Concentration of Authority by Kazuo Yoshida). 
Restoration of "consumer" interests for consumers, employees, 
and local residents will probably become specific parts of the 
basic "policy emphasizing the consumer." 
<H5>  Misconception of a "Minor Government" </H5>
  The "final report" also treats financial restructuring as a 
major goal. In the past, Japan has been treated as a "minor 
government" in comparison with those of European nations. 
Certainly, a comparison of Japanese government expenditures and 
ratio of government employees to the overall population 
indicates that they are half those of principal European 
countries. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the 
Japanese Government is backed by a variety of industrial 
protection policies that do not involve government 
disbursements. In that sense, abuses which "exceed those of a 
big government" backed by government spending actually exist. 
  As an example, policies protective of the farm sector are 
broadly practiced not only in Japan but throughout Europe and 
the United States. However, the major feature of Japanese farm 
protection emphasizes the existence of a consumer burden calling 
for stabilization of farm commodity prices at a high level 
rather than a taxpayers' burden in the form of farm subsidies. 
According to an OECD survey that quantifies and makes an 
international comparison of costs associated with farm 
protection using means other than government funds, consumer 
burdens associated with price-support policies in Japan are 
conspicuously higher than those of Europe and the United States 
as shown in Table 1.

Data extracted from OECD Agricultural Policies, Markets, and Trade Report 
of 1993. 


  Farm protection policies of this nature not only obscure 
related costs in comparison to European and U.S. methods 
involving government funding, but the economic costs imposed on 
consumers relative to the variance in domestic and international 
price differentials of farm products has become much larger than 
those associated with subsidies. 
  The same circumstances prevail not only in agriculture but 
are also common in all business protection policies, including 
transportation and marketing. In other words, government funding 
agencies have quietly established price and market participation 
restrictions to prevent increased government funding burdens 
associated with business failures, but the result has been the 
creation of consumer burdens which exceed potential government 
funding burdens. Further, such regulated industries tend to 
pursue selfish interests and corruption becomes a routine matter. 
  If a major factor in the "success" of past government 
funding 
restructuring policies were attributable to automatic increases 
in tax revenues and the transfer of burdens to consumers such as 
discussed above, we must direct greater attention to the 
trade-off relationship between deregulation and government funds 
restructuring. 
  Future deregulation measures in individual sectors will 
probably require temporary government subsidies for small and 
medium businesses which will be adversely affected. 
  Such measures must encompass means that provide for lower 
economic costs for consumers such as tariffs for rice imports 
even if we speak of protective policies of the same nature. 
Although such "subsidization of economic controls" are contrary 
to the major objective of restructuring government funding 
programs, they represent important procedures that cannot be 
avoided in the effort to discontinue government controls which 
are deeply involved with consumer lifestyles. In this sense, a 
review of not only tax reforms, but the merits of past 
government funding policies should serve as a major premise for 
government funding reforms. 
<H5>  Measures Necessary To Realize Structural Reform </H5>
  According to the "final report," the Hiraiwa Report reflects 
the strong "intention" to implement economic structural reform 
and the basic direction of reform, but assigns responsibility 
for development of concrete recommendations concerning 
deregulation to an "influential third-party agency" to be 
established in the future. 
  However, a sector that should be handled with priority by 
such an agency is the quantification of costs for current 
government controls. Generally, serious structural reforms 
require not only the expression of strong intentions to realize 
such reforms, but the indispensable task of detailed 
quantification. 
  In the background of curtailing protective farm measures in 
connection with the Uruguay Round were the political efforts of 
the respective nations and long-term efforts of the OECD 
administrative bureau to quantify agricultural protection costs. 
Further, the Chekini [as transliterated] Report which outlined 
the major plan for integration of Europe encompassed detailed 
estimates of profits to be derived through economic integration. 
Each of those estimates used macro indices to express the 
benefits of economic structural reform. 
  Each of the government controls of the past were based on 
individual reasons and once we enter into a discussion of 
specifics concerning relaxation of controls, many opposing views 
are confronted. Overcoming such opposition requires the detailed 
quantification of the social costs associated with the 
individual controls to the maximum degree feasible. Such 
calculations can serve as a basis for estimating subsidies 
required as compensation for deregulation measures. 
  A permanent agency which has the capability to conduct such 
detailed quantitative analyses is the Economic Council. Further, 
examination of medium-term macro policies and numerical goals 
are the basic missions of the Economic Council, and the active 
use of its services would be desirable. The expressed need to go 
to the extent of organizing a "strong third-party agency" as 
described in the "final report" could be the result of the 
belief that the Economic Council cannot function properly in the 
face of jurisdictional disputes existing among government 
ministries and agencies. However, if that were the case, one 
wonders how a newly established agency could overcome 
interministerial and agency jurisdictional disputes. 
  Generally speaking, if the political leadership of the prime 
minister is weak, the impact will be the same no matter the 
nature of the new government agency established. Contrariwise, 
if political leadership is strong, the issue can be adequately 
handled through the use of an existing administrative agency. We 
should learn from past experience with the former Domestic 
Government Consultation Council and Foreign Relations 
Consultation Council about to the disadvantages of establishing 
a new "strongly integrated coordinating agency" for every 
government reform project undertaken. 
  Finally, the "final report" has a phrase added which is 
identical to that contained in the government reform 
consultation report which reads, "Reinforcement of integrated 
coordinating functions of the cabinet." However, we should 
probably consider why reinforcement of integrated coordinating 
functions could not be realized in connection with government 
reform efforts of the past. 
  Generally speaking, the means for integrated coordination of 
policy matters by a bureaucratic system are found in the 
budgeting, organization, and programming functions. Of those 
functions, coordination through budgeting is handled by the 
Ministry of Finance, organization and personnel affairs by the 
Management and Coordination Agency and National Personnel 
Authority, and programs by the Economic Planning Agency. 
However, in reality, the influence of the Budget Bureau of the 
Ministry of Finance is overwhelming, and that bureau handles 
integrated coordination functions on a de facto basis. 
  Albeit with a variety of stipulations, success attained in 
the difficult project to restructure government financial 
programs in Japan in the 1980's--considered rare even among 
advanced nations--was largely attributed to the formidable 
coordinating capabilities of the Budget Bureau. However, 
although the strong integrated coordinating function of the 
Budget Bureau which is not a part of the cabinet but a mere 
bureau of a single ministry was effectively used in connection 
with the limited objective of restructuring government financial 
programs, it did not give adequate consideration to the 
immensity of economic costs to the consumer. One result of that 
failure is the expansion of the burden imposed on consumers 
through controls which substitute for burdens imposed by 
government funding programs as was typical with agricultural 
protection policies. 
  Whether or not he succeeds in reversing such policies of the 
past and allow for temporary government funding burdens to 
promote a variety of deregulation measures--even after setting 
aside objections of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance 
for the sake of economic structural reforms--will serve to test 
the political leadership of the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Mitsuhiro Ishi, Hitotsubashi University </F>
professor and member of the Tax Commission: "The Way Tax System 
Discussion Should Be Carried Out After Lifting of `Heavy 
Weight'"] 
  [Text] With the change in government, the "heavy 
weight" of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] Tax Commission has 
been lifted from the discussions on reform of the tax system. 
However, there are two deficiencies that current government's 
Tax Commission should overcome. 
  In August 1993, 38 years of monopolistic one-party rule 
ended 
and the Hosokawa cabinet, which is based on coalition of 
parties, was born. Corresponding to this great change in the 
political world, the policy determination process was also 
changed fundamentally. The debate over reform of the tax system 
is no exception. The LDP's Tax Commission, which had exercised 
strong decisionmaking authority, backed by the activities of 
Diet members connected to the tax issue, has also retreated from 
front stage. Taking as its slogan, "correct the direct and 
indirect taxe rates," deliberations on reform of the tax system 
are vying for center stage. Prime Minister Hosokawa has 
entrusted everything to the government's Tax Commission, but I 
would like to examine how the discussion should proceed in the 
future on this issue of change. 
  Currently, in our personal lives, interest in reform of the 
tax system is greatly rising centered on lowering income tax 
rates and on increasing consumption tax rates. Along with 
political reform, this issue is an important problem to be faced 
by the Hosokawa cabinet. The issue of which body takes what 
measures with regard to tax system reform is an extremely 
important question with respect to the formation of the 
country's economic policy. Examining how other developed 
nations are dealing with this problem, I would like to examine 
how deliberation on the reform of the tax system should take 
place. 
<H5>  Japan's Unique Deliberation Method </H5>
  Generally, there are two different ways in which tax reform 
is carried out; the so-called Japanese method and the Western 
method. These two methods are shown in the chart below [not 
translated]. In both of these methods, once the need for tax 
reform is recognized, the prime minister or president first 
submits an inquiry to the appropriate body. Normally, Europe and 
the United States do not use this system of submission of 
inquiries for policy matters in other areas, such as foreign 
relations, national defense, or industrial policy. Why do they 
use this inquiry system for only tax reform? Two reasons come to 
mind. First, the tax problem is closely tied to the people's 
standard of living, and second, it is a problem which requires 
professional study. Japan, which has established consultative 
bodies to study inquiries for all policy matters, not just tax 
reform, is an exception to the rule. 
  After the submission of an inquiry, there are two routes 
that 
deliberations on tax system reform can take. The particular 
characteristic of the Japanese system is that the prime minister 
submits an inquiry to the permanently established consultative 
body, in other words, the government's Tax Commission, and once 
this body receives an inquiry, the deliberation over tax system 
reform begins. Under this system, instead of preparing a 
comprehensive tax report which is based on detailed analysis, 
the commission issues a report, compiling the views of the 
majority of the commission members. The foundation for any 
reform of the tax system is based on this report. 
  In the Western system, however, a task force, which is 
generally composed of experts, is assembled. Usually after two 
to five years of study and repeated discussions, the task force, 
which is led by a well-known researcher, will formulate and 
publish a tax report. Contained in this report, along with a 
statement of the ideals of and goals for tax system reform as 
well as supporting documentation, is a recommendation for 
proposed reform. This document becomes the plan for a revision 
of the tax system which will represent the country in question. 
  This is the method that the Western countries use with tax 
system reform. The tax report plays a very important role in 
this process. In fact, there have been many well-known tax 
reports prepared, such as Canada's "Carter Report" (1966), 
Sweden's "Rodin [as transliterated] Report" (1976), and the U.S. 
"Treasury Department Report" (1984), all of which have been 
highly praised by academia. The Reagan tax system reform of the 
1980's was another such reform that was carried out in this 
manner. It is interesting to note that the "Shoup 
Recommendation" (1949), which established Japan's tax system 
following the war, was also carried out in this western manner. 
This is very easy to understand if one considers the situation 
that existed back then. 
  Therefore, we call the Japanese system the "deliberative 
body 
system," and the Western system the "tax report system." 
Although these tax reports are extremely important documents 
because they cast light on the basic nature of tax system 
reform, they are mere materials on which to start deliberation 
of tax system reform in the national assembly. 
<H5>  The Government Tax Commission Versus the LDP Tax Commission </H5>
  Currently, in Japan, discussions on the tax system are 
carried out by the government's Tax Commission. This Tax 
Commission was formally established in 1962 as an advisory body 
to the prime minister. Since that time, this commission has been 
given the most authority among the numerous other deliberative 
bodies. In addition to 30 formal members drawn from various 
sectors of society, this commission is comprised of some 10 odd 
specialists and about 20 experts (group of scholars). 
  We can say that, during the nearly 20 years since its 
inception, Japan's tax deliberation mechanism, which is centered 
on the government's Tax Commission, has functioned well. The 
government's Tax Commission proceeds with its discussions by 
making adjustments to proposed tax system reform while hearing 
the opinions of officials from organizations which would benefit 
or be damaged because of changes to that system. For that 
reason, the Tax Commission is comprised of representatives from 
various industrial groups, labor unions, consumer organizations, 
etc. As a result of compromise, unlike the Western tax reports, 
the reports proffered by the Tax Commission tend to become 
theoretically ambiguous. 
  However, when one considers the final step in the tax 
deliberation process, namely the step from deliberation in the 
legislature to execution of reform, Japan's deliberative body 
system has performed well, resulting in a clearly higher number 
of proposals being implemented than are adopted under the 
Western tax report system. This means that, during the process 
of preparing their report, the work of making adjustments to the 
plan, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of all of the 
groups affected, including the various ministries and agencies, 
has already been completed. On the other hand, in the Western 
system, things can become confused in the legislature, and 
often, tax reform proposals have a tendency to become 
politically buried without achieving any political results. 
  However, the Japanese practice of giving high esteem to the 
reports from the government's Tax Commission and implementing 
their recommendations within the tax system started to change in 
the 1980's. Of course this is not unrelated to the rise in 
power of the LDP Tax Commission. The situation developed where 
the actual power to create change in the tax system was shifted 
from the government Tax Commission to the LDP Tax Commission. 
Because of the LDP's long run in power, Diet members often 
formed connections with industry and became tied to the creation 
and/or expansion of special tax measures. One famous example of 
these connection is the existence of the "telephone book," a 
list of petitions submitted asking for tax reductions. 
  The specific content of tax system reform, in other words 
the 
determining of the tax rate and the final numerical value of the 
deduction levels, fell under the scope of authority of the LDP's 
Tax Commission. The tax system is surely politics itself. 
Instead of following a logical course based on taxation theory, 
gradually, tax system reform was politicized by the LDP Tax 
Commission, and tied to the advantages and disadvantages of 
special interest groups. The venue for important tax 
deliberations was shifted from the government's Tax Commission 
to the LDP's Tax Commission. 
  The government's Tax Commission's basic philosophy toward 
the 
tax system was to keep its implementation fair, neutral, and 
simple. Subsequently, it generally had the tendency not to 
support measures that would give special treatment under the tax 
system to special sectors. Therefore, the government's Tax 
Commission was often opposed to the expansion or extension of 
special tax measures, and therefore, special interest groups 
would bypass the government's Tax Commission and would take 
their proposed items directly to the LDP's Tax Commission. This 
route was used not only by private groups, but was also 
actively used by various agencies and ministries that were 
trying to use the tax system to attain specific objectives (such 
as increasing savings or social welfare). Indeed, in the world 
of the tax system, adhesion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and 
the private sector" was gradually beginning to develop. Thus, 
the hollowing out of the government's Tax Commission had begun. 
  What promoted this trend was that Japan entered a period of 
restricted finance in the 1980's, which was aimed at financial 
reconstruction, out of a policy of lowered tax rates during the 
high-growth years. The benefits from the expenditures side 
disappeared, but there was an upswing in the demands for "hidden 
subsidies" (special tax measures) on the taxation side. 
Therefore, the LDP's Tax Commission clearly had more 
understanding of this process than did the logical government's 
Tax Commission. It was an era in which officials seeking sweet 
benefits under the tax system turned to the LDP's Tax Commission. 
  Originally, when the proposal for the coming year's tax 
system reform was drawn up at the end of each year, both tax 
commissions frequently made public the reports which contained 
differing views on specific measures. The government's Tax 
Commission would issue a report, and a few days after that, the 
LDP's Tax Commission would issue its report with a differing 
point of view. Under the system of party politics in Japan, it 
is the party in power that pushes bills through the Diet. 
Therefore, it was the LDP's Tax Commission proposals that were 
adopted. However, in the latter half of the 1980's, a kind of 
division of effort was established between the two tax 
commissions. The government's Tax Commission would issue reports 
proposing changes to the basic foundations of the tax system, 
without any detailed information such as tax rates, and the 
LDP's Tax Commission would fill out the specifics of the tax 
policy based on the government's Tax Commission report. It can 
be said that the era of "conflict" was replaced by an era of 
"coordination." It was indeed humiliating for the government's 
Tax Commission, which is a prime minister's advisory organ, to 
be under the policy formulating organ of a single political 
party even though the party in question is the party in power. 
The consumption tax and land price tax were adopted under this 
division of effort. 
<H5>  Tax System Deliberations; Where Do We Go From Here? </H5>
  As mentioned at the beginning of this text, in the midst of 
the political change which is sweeping the nation, the 
competitive relationship between the government's Tax Commission 
and the LDP's Tax Commission has ended. It would be difficult 
for the current coalition government to establish a body such as 
the LDP's Tax Commission. Tax Commission like the LDP's Tax 
Commission cannot be built overnight because the nucleus of 
human resources in that commission is composed of many tax 
system experts who were nurtured by the party in power for many 
years and Diet members who were former officials of Ministry of 
Finance. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa has said on many occasions that, "I 
want to wait for the deliberation of the government's Tax 
Commission," and "I will honor their report" to the letter. The 
deliberation on tax system reform has again moved to the 
government's Tax Commission. I am hearing from Diet members who 
used to belong to the LDP's Tax Commission with whom I am 
personally close, that it had become truly distasteful for them 
to work for the establishment of special exceptions because of 
the prodding of specific industries. Ostensibly, the retreat of 
the LDP's Tax Commission was brought about by political 
confusion; however, it was perhaps a matter of inevitable 
consequences. 
  The problem is, "Where do we go from here?" In the future, 
should Japan maintain its unique "deliberative body system" and 
continue to use the government's Tax Commission as the venue for 
discussions on this issue? The following two deficiencies exist 
in the "deliberative body system." 
  First, it has been difficult to clearly hammer out a basic 
philosophy and vision for reform of the tax system. Furthermore, 
it has also been difficult to formulate a specific reform 
proposal based on this foundation. 
  Because the Tax Commission prepares its report while 
adjusting advantages and disadvantages to various groups, reform 
proposals tend to become a patchwork document that can exist 
only within that environment of compromise. It is nealy 
impossible for the government's Tax Commission to design a 
comprehensive tax system reform proposal that would look across 
the entire tax system. In fact, since the inception of the Shoup 
tax system, it has been difficult to explain on what basic 
posture subsequent reforms to the tax system had been based. 
  Second, the evil practice of back-room decisionmaking is 
inexorably tied to the deliberative body system. Often, not only 
is the amount of information provided to the average citizen 
insufficient because only the results of the discussions are 
included in the published report, but no pipeline exists 
through which the public can press their requests for further 
information. There are no channels available other than petition 
and protest. 
  In the future, it seems that the deliberations of the Tax 
Commission, which will take up issues such as "revision of 
direct and indirect tax rates," will become an issue of great 
interest to the public. Given these developments, is it enough 
to just continue along with the deliberative body system that we 
have had under the government's Tax Commission? However, in a 
society like ours which differs so much from Western nations in 
the area of consensus-building, there would probably be little 
effect if we adopted a tax report system like that of the 
countries of Europe and the United States. It is also 
inconceivable that our politicians would authorize a group of 
experts to formulate a tax report because the politicians would 
not like it if an authorized tax report were published that 
called for reform of the tax system that would be 
disadvantageous for the politicians, or that would contain a 
reform proposal that would be difficult to implement. 
  To promote future tax system reform, however, we should 
incorporate as many elements of the tax report system as 
possible. 
  Specifically, the final report of the government's Tax 
Commission should have the same level of weight and substance as 
those reports had in the 1960's. I think that what is wanted are 
reports such as those prepared during the term in office of the 
first head of the government's Tax Commission, Ichiro Tanaka. 
These reports contained the results of the analysis of all of 
the extended discussions within the Tax Commission, as well as 
all of the data used. This type of document could become the tax 
report for our country. In order to do this, it would be 
desirable that we increase the number of researchers on the 
commission who can view the the tax system as a whole instead of 
representing various interest groups as members. 
  In order to make tax system reform truly a more democratic 
issue, we must make the dissemination and gathering of 
information more open, and we must pursue it more positively. 
One way to do this would be for the Tax Commission to discuss 
all of the tax system reform proposals drawn up and published by 
the various sectors. One result of this would be that the 
proposals raised by various groups could be effectively 
utilized. This would also aid in making the discussions on tax 
system reform within the Tax Commission more constructive. 
  Chairman Hiroshi Kato has repeatedly emphasized that he 
wants 
to open the deliberations of the Tax Commission as much as 
possible to the public. We should also consider ways to make 
materials submitted to the Tax Commission more readily available 
to those who want to utilize them. We should also open "one-day 
Tax Commission meetings" throughout the various regions of the 
country, and positively adopt ways so that we can directly hear 
the views of the taxpayer, the average citizen.

  [Text] A piece of iron hovers in the air... The Kanagawa 
Academy of Science and Technology (KAST), established by 
Kanagawa Prefecture, has discovered a new magnetic levitating 
phenomenon that uses high-temperature superconductors, and 
confirmed that practical uses are possible. Previously, it was 
impossible to levitate something unless a permanent magnet was 
used together with a superconductor. However, this new 
phenomenon has overthrown the beliefs of the past. The new 
technique can keep a piece of iron in the air as if it were 
hanging from something above. Iron is stronger and less 
expensive than permanent magnets, therefore it will be much 
easier than before to find applications for this magnetic 
levitating technique, which uses a superconductor. The KAST and 
a superconductive research institute invested in by the 
government and the private sector, will start a joint project to 
develop magnetic bearings by applying this new phenomenon. 
  The researchers who discovered this new phenomenon are 
Toshiro Toiguchi -- who is Tokyo University Engineering 
Department professor and leader of the Toiguchi project for 
"ultimate mechatronics" [a word made by combining the words 
mechanics and electronics, according to a Japanese dictionary 
issued by Kodansha] -- and Yukio Tsutsui, a researcher with 
Yasukawa Electric Manufacturing Company. 
  The new phenomenon uses a permanent magnet only at the 
initial preparation stage but the permanent magnet is not used 
after the state of superconductivity is reached. To start with, 
a permanent magnet is placed near -- but not in contact with -- 
a high-temperature superconductor as in the conventional method. 
The high-temperature superconductor, when cooled, memorizes the 
magnetic forces emitted by the permanent magnet. Because of 
this, the superconductor and the magnet maintain a certain 
distance without touching each other. The superconductor 
continues to emit magnetic forces even after the permanent 
magnet is removed. 
  After this, the magnet is replaced with a strong 
ferromagnetic substance, such as iron, in this new method. This 
is where it differs from the conventional method -- which 
levitates objects using a permanent magnet, or levitates and 
moves objects along a rail made by placing magnets side by side. 
It is necessary to make the cross section of the iron near the 
superconductor smaller than that of the removed permanent magnet. 
  By doing this, the drawing force -- which is determined by 
the ratio of this cross section, gross weight of iron, and 
magnetic flux density -- becomes stable. It was thought in the 
past that iron would be drawn to the superconductor or fall due 
to its weight. Using the new method, however, it is possible to 
make the iron hover in the air some distance from the 
superconductor. The new method can also prevent the iron from 
sliding sideways. 
  The new technology discovered by KAST can be categorized as 
a 
hanging type. Its drawing force keeps the iron in the air as if 
it were hanging from the superconductor. It may not be called 
levitation. However, it is levitation as far as its practical 
applications are concerned. During the experiment, the 
researchers succeeded in hanging a 79-gram piece of iron, whose 
cross section was 8 mm in diameter, maintaining a distance of 
between 0.5 to 1.0 mm from the superconductor. The levitating 
forces were one-fifth those using a permanent magnet. However, 
it is by no means inferior to levitating forces obtained by 
using a permanent magnet as far as its possible applications are 
concerned.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 23 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
central power system of the Mongolian capital beginning since 
March 1 is likely to have to restrict the electricity 
consumption in pursuant to a specific schedule to be arranged. 
That is connected with the running out stock of coal at the 
electric power stations as well as with the financial 
difficulties. 
  Due to the fact that corresponding payments are not being 
paid timely by its consumers the central power system has had 
arrears of more than four million US dollars ought to have been 
paid to the Russian Federation for the electricity supplied in 
the previous year. Also it failed to pay off its tariffs to be 
paid in advance for electricity for the current year which runs 
to 2.5 million dollars.

  [Text] The outline of Prime Minister Hosokawa's policy 
speech to the Diet was firmed up on 23 February. In the speech, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa will indicate that his government has 
entered its second term of "changes." Hosokawa will make clear 
his government will focus its efforts on "administrative reform" 
and "economic reform" -- the new major policy tasks following 
political reform. The prime minister also will announce his 
government is to put administrative reform at the top of its 
domestic agenda. He will express his eagerness to vigorously 
promote deregulation, decentralization, and the freedom of 
information. The government will submit a budget bill for 
fiscal 1994 to the Diet on 4 March for deliberation. Hosokawa 
is scheduled to deliver his policy speech to the Diet on 7 March. 
  The policy speech will also stress the achievements of the 
coalition government over the six months since it was 
inaugurated last August. These include the partial opening of 
the Japanese rice market, the enactment of political reform 
bills, and a package of stimulus measures which includes a cut 
in income tax. 
  Hosokawa will also unveil plans to: 1) Promote 
administrative reform, especially deregulation; 2) aid the 
recovery of the economy, open Japanese markets, and manage the 
economy and finance; 3) make sweeping changes of the current tax 
system to prepare for a society of senior citizens; and 4) make 
international contributions.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] A news report on 24 February sent off shock waves 
in Nagata-cho [the political center of Japan, in Tokyo], already 
in upheaval over reports of a planned cabinet reshuffle and 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks on forming a unified 
parliamentary group for the ruling coalition parties. It was 
reported that Hosokawa and former Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] leader, had held a meeting on the evening of 23 February. 
Officials of the coalition parties as well as the LDP were sent 
rushing off to confirm the report. Could the prime minister 
have asked Watanabe to join the cabinet? Various speculations 
have made the rounds. Both the prime minister and Watanabe 
flatly denied that a meeting had been held, and refused to give 
any further comments. The truth about the "Hosokawa-Watanabe 
meeting" remains a mystery.

  [Text] News of the Hosokawa-Watanabe meeting, which spread 
quickly in Nagata-cho [the political center of Japan in Tokyo] 
late in the evening of 23 February, immediately after the 
meeting, sent violent shock waves through the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]. 
  Michio Watanabe's [former deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister] home camp, the Watanabe faction, was like a hornet's 
nest from the morning of 24 February. At a meeting of faction 
officials in the morning, Bunmei Ibuki, a close associate of 
Watanabe, was indignant. 
  He exclaimed: "If he is going to cooperate with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, I am going to leave the LDP and form a new 
party." 
  Watanabe faction officials were bombarded with inquiries 
about the truth of the reported meeting. Antipathy to Watanabe 
surged inside the LDP in the belief that the reported top secret 
meeting "demonstrates the close relation between Mr. Watanabe 
and the Hosokawa administration through his intimate links with 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa." 
  LDP leaders were critical, saying: "Mr. Watanabe should take 
into consideration his position in the party in what he does." 
  Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of LDP Political Reform 
Headquarters, spoke to a general meeting of the Mitsuzuka 
faction on the same day. 
  He said: "Right now, we should act consistently as an 
opposition party. It is important to proceed by taking into 
account the overall situation." 
  Mitsuzuka also told reporters: "This is a critical period 
for Mr. Watanabe. I believe he will act maturely." He offered 
this comment to preempt possible action on the part of Watanabe. 
  Meanwhile, Watanabe flatly denied reports of the meeting 
with 
the prime minister, calling it "an illusory meeting." 
  At the general meeting of his faction at noon on 24 
February, 
Watanabe said: "There is nothing wrong with the No. 1 party, 
the LDP, exercising a certain measure of influence over the 
administration." 
  His comments argued the case for the importance of unity in 
national politics. However, he said emphatically: "It is 
completely improbable that I would split the party, or leave you 
all to join the cabinet." 
  There is strong speculation in the LDP the meeting is 
evidence that "Prime Minister Hosokawa aims to bring Mr. 
Watanabe into the cabinet; he is sounding him out about the post 
of deputy prime minister or finance minister." 
  It is believed that Watanabe does not actually plan to join 
the cabinet, but by agreeing to meet with the prime minister, 
"he intends to demonstrate his powerful political influence." 
  However, according to a Watanabe faction official, Watanabe 
did not act entirely innocently at the faction's general 
meeting. He reported Watanabe as saying: "Now you all know my 
worth." 
  However, it is also true that this reported secret meeting 
with the "enemy's commander" -- Prime Minister Hosokawa -- 
represents a serious setback to "calls for Michi's [Michio 
Watanabe] leadership," which have been quite prevalent among the 
electoral reform-shy factions in the LDP. 
  At a time when there are persistent rumors of a "new 
Watanabe 
party" to be formed through cooperation between Ozawa and 
Watanabe in anticipation of the political realignment expected 
after the implementation of political reforms, the Watanabe 
faction is deeply concerned "this has given rise to unnecessary 
suspicions, and added fuel to rumors about the formation of a 
new party." 
  Many believe, "this does not do any good at all for Mr. 
Watanabe."

  [Text] "I have never met with Mr. Watanabe." Prime 
Minister Hosokawa has remained tight-lipped after repeatedly 
denying the reported meeting with Watanabe, former deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, who is affiliated with the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Their reported 
meeting is spawning speculation that the prime minister has met 
with Watanabe with the aim of keeping Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura and other ruling coalition parties members who are 
distancing themselves from him in check and driving a wedge in 
the LDP, which has yet to shape a vision for retaking power. 
One ruling party after another are reacting negatively to the 
reported meeting between the prime minister and Watanabe. Some 
members of the ruling coalition parties are raising doubts about 
the motive behind the meeting, but the truth remains a mystery. 
  On the morning of 24 February, Takemura phoned Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, to ask 
the latter, "Has Watanabe really met with Hosokawa?" On 23 
February, Takemura appeared to have information that "Messers 
Watanabe and Hosokawa are likely to meet." Unable to confirm 
the reported meeting from the prime minister because of their 
chilled relationship, Takemura ran around all morning. In the 
afternoon, Takemura met with the prime minister to discuss the 
issue of reshuffling the cabinet, but the prime minister told 
Takemura, "I have not met with Watanabe." 
  Of course, the prime minister is not at ease. His reported 
meeting with Watanabe has been seen as an attempt to thrust the 
"Watanabe card," as his new partner, at Takemura who has been 
boasting of his close ties with the LDP and revealing his 
resolve to quit the cabinet in a reshuffle. A senior Sakigake 
[Harbinger] member, who has been struggling to patch up the 
Hosokawa-Takemura relationship, is reacting against the reported 
meeting, saying: "If Watanabe joins the Hosokawa cabinet, our 
party would back out of the coalition. With Watanabe in the 
Hosokawa cabinet, the cabinet could not take any steps for 
changes." 
  Political forces exploring the possibility of forging an 
alliance with Mr.Takemura, social democrats, and liberals, are 
reacting against the reported meeting with anger, saying, "It is 
very disgraceful," (according to a senior member of the ruling 
Social Democratic Party of Japan). 
  Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan 
chairman, 
Keigo Ouchi, Democratic Socialist Party chairman, and Nakamur, 
Democratic Reform Federation representative, met with the prime 
minister on the evening of 24 February to urge the latter to be 
cautious about reshuffling his cabinet. In this way, they 
checked the prime minister from contacting LDP people like Mr. 
Watanabe. 
  The reported meeting is sending a complex ripple to 
Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] that 
make up the coalition government. Mr. Watanabe is said to share 
the political belief of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, and it is said that they maintain a behind-the-scenes 
relationship. A politician close to Mr. Ozawa has emphatically 
denied Mr. Ozawa's role in the reported meeting, saying, "Mr. 
Ozawa was not aware of the reported meeting." While the 
"Watanabe card" has the effect of keeping Sakigake in check and 
putting the LDP, which has lost its centripetal force, into 
turmoil, it will complicate the structure of the coalition 
partners, which are now moving toward a bipolar party structure. 
It can be said that it is not a good policy for the prime 
minister to play the "Watanabe card" openly now. 
  Amid moves toward a realignment of the political parties, 
Komeito, which has been vying with Watanabe for support from 
Shinseito, has accused Watanabe, saying: "The ruling coalition 
parties have been attacked so much by him. They cannot forge an 
alliance with him simply because he agrees with their plans for 
resolving the tax system issue and other issues" and raised 
questions about the prime minister's real intentions.

<F P=106> ["Economic Zoom-up" column article: "Rise and Fall of </F>
Kasumigaseki; Changing Relationships of Power"] 
  [Text] Almost half a year has passed since the Hosokawa 
coalition government -- alias the "donosama" [feudal lord] 
government -- came into being. Though it started in high 
spirits, declaring it will "tear up the collusion among 
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen," it is now coming 
under growing criticism for being "led by bureaucrats" in making 
decisions on economic policy matters like economic stimulus 
measures and taxation system reform. Even U.S. President Bill 
Clinton assailed the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] as master 
culprits for rupturing the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. 
But, meanwhile, there have been delicate changes in the 
relationships of power between economic-related government 
offices of Kasumigaseki in Tokyo under the coalition government. 
We have looked into the rise and fall of the major government 
offices. 
  The office which has shown its might under the Hosokawa 
government is the MOF. In addition to Ichiro Ozawa, general 
secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Jiro Saito, 
administrative vice minister of the MOF, was denounced as a 
"behind-the-scenes schemer" in the hassle over the national 
welfare tax concept, but he still caught the attention of the 
nation as he proved capable of moving even the prime minister. 
Of course, even in earlier days the ministry was called the 
"government office within the government offices," and there is 
no doubt that the power of the ministry in charge of state 
finance, including the budget and taxes, stands out among the 
central government's offices. 
  But the weakening of the power of the members of the Liberal 
Democratic Party's [LDP] Research Commission on the Tax System 
as well as the LDP zoku-giin [Dietmen lobbying for interests of 
certain industries or government offices] who built up their 
power under the 38-year rule of the LDP has helped the ministry 
solidify its strength too. One policy-related staff member of a 
coalition member party admitted, "We cannot do without the help 
of the MOF in specialty areas like the taxation system." 
  While there is a view that as a result of the failure of the 
national welfare tax concept the prime minister's "trust" in the 
ministry has been shaken, within the ministry there is an 
unshakable belief in itself as evidenced in a remark by a 
ranking ministry official who asserted, "We have succeeded in 
ensuring that the matter of the consumption tax raise will be 
settled before the end of the year; many people tell us we have 
done well." 
  In contrast, the office which is losing power is MITI. With 
the LDP's commerce-and industry-related zoku-giin having lost 
their power, the ministry has lost supporters for its policies, 
and that has contributed to its weakening as well. On the 
matter of economic stimulus measures and reform of the taxation 
system, there was a time when administrative Vice Minister 
Hideaki Kumano, together with MOF Vice Minister Saito, ran 
around, trying to push for "raising taxes [primarily consumption 
taxes] and reducing taxes [primarily income taxes] in a package 
deal." For a while, the ministry was chided as a "second 
Ministry of Finance" on account of that. 
  The intraministry controversy over the dismissal of Masahisa 
Taito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau, at the end of 
last year and the reports that the ministry carried out 
"publicity campaigns" on economic organizations in an attempt to 
sway public opinion on the general economic stimulus measures 
have also facilitated the sinking of the ministry's power base. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is a ministry which 
brought down its own rating by failing to bring about a 
successful conclusion to the framework talks -- the most 
important area of diplomacy in relations with the United States. 
The fact that shortly before the Japan-U.S. summit, the prime 
minister sent Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France and 
one of his advisers, as his special envoy to Washington to act 
on his own, separate from MOFA, came as a shock as it showed 
that the prime minister did not trust the ministry's diplomatic 
capabilities. Even within the government there is criticism 
that "the MOFA's connections with Washington are too shabby." 
The ministry has to find a breakthrough in relations with the 
United States to regain lost ground. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
[MAFF] is one of those whose power is rising, helped by its 
accomplishments in taking the lead in resolving the issue of the 
partial opening of the rice market. It has actively campaigned 
within the government on the need to take measures to help 
farmers deal with the partial opening of the rice market -- by 
setting up the Headquarters for Emergency Measures on 
Agriculture and Farming Community headed by the prime minister, 
and holding a meeting of the Agricultural Administration Council 
in the prime minister's office for the first time in 14 years. 
But its long-time ally, the Agricultural Cooperatives, rebelled 
against the ministry when the latter engaged in 
behind-the-scenes negotiations with the United States over the 
partial opening of the rice market. The cooperatives for a 
while refused to cooperate with the ministry on the policy of 
reducing rice farm acreage. Now the two parties are moving 
toward reconciliation, but there is a big scar remaining. 
  The Economic Planning Agency [EPA], which is led by a 
cabinet 
member from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], cannot 
be said to have performed its adjustment functions well in 
formulating overall economic stimulus measures, and its value is 
not appreciated. But the work of legislating the Product 
Liability Law, the first mammoth-scale law to be formulated by 
the agency in about 20 years, is being helped by the change of 
government since the prime minister is in favor of protecting 
consumers, and the SDPJ and Komeito are enthusiastic about 
legislating such a law. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] no 
longer 
has the LDP's zoku-giin to support it. A senior ministry 
official lamented, "When we had to negotiate with the Ministry 
of Finance regarding new articles of postal savings, we used to 
have support of the zoku-giin. Now we cannot expect such 
support, and we have a very difficult time." The ministry is 
said to be still groping for a way to establish relations with 
member parties of the coalition. 
  The Ministry of Transportation, on the strength of its 
slogan 
for giving "priority to consumers," succeeded in getting a 
budget allocation for construction of new city railway and 
semi-bullet train systems. Senior ministry officials' visits to 
Shinseito General Secretary Ozawa have also become conspicuous. 
Apparently, they believe, "the coalition is flying toward 
forming a new axis [of policies]." 
  Remarking on this change in the power of government offices, 
a bureaucrat insisted, "It does not mean that the MOF has gained 
more power. It only means that the power of politics has 
weakened. We still need the power of politics -- going over the 
framework of government offices -- if we want to have big 
policies." 
  Political columnist Taro Yayama commented on the rising 
power 
of the bureaucrats, and said: "This is a temporary phenomenon 
that happens in the early stage of a new government. Prime 
Minister Hosokawa wants to break up the collusion between the 
politicians and the bureaucrats which has continued since the 
days of the LDP government. I don't think he will let the 
bureaucrats do as they please in the future."

Minister--All Depends on How Much Budget He Can Acquire"] 
  [Text] Bureaucrats Bewildered by Non-LDP Minister 
  Within the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], 
bureaucrats are unable to conceal their bewilderment at the 
inauguration of its new minister, Takenori Kanzaki. The ministry 
has been so used to serving LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
ministers that the appearance of the new Komeito minister seems 
to be causing constant bewilderment over how to cope with him. 
  Not to mention such operational activities as mail, savings, 
and postal life insurance, the ministry also administers 
telecommunications-related policy fields such as electric 
communications and broadcasts. These telecommunications-related 
activities are the infrastructure for the upcoming 
information-oriented society; therefore, for the time being, the 
ministry does not have any task over which the ruling and 
opposition camps have to confront each other. 
  The Ministry of Education and the Environment Agency have 
been causing sharp ruling-opposition confrontations, the former 
by producing textbooks which show different positions on the 
"war of aggression" as expressed by Prime Minister Hosokawa at 
the Diet and the latter by taking up in its administration the 
position of avoiding Minamata disease [an organic mercury 
poisoning stemming from eating fish polluted by mercury 
discharged into the Minamata River, Kumamoto Prefecture] 
compensations against the will of the coalition cabinet. 
However, such is not the case with the MPT. Yet the appearance 
of a minister from a somewhat mysterious party called Komeito is 
bewildering to MPT bureaucrats who have been accustomed to the 
one-sided rule of the LDP's 1955 system. . 
  Minister Kanzaki is a high-ranking official who is rumored 
to 
be next head of Komeito. What delights the MPT officials is that 
they have a new minister who has a great future as a politician. 
The MPT has been hailed as a government office that has handled 
telecommunications for the last 10 years or so, and the status 
of its ministers has kept rising under the LDP regime. For 
example, its ministerial post has been assumed by those becoming 
a minister for the second time. However, before then, many of 
its ministers were rather secondary in status who retired from 
the political world with service at the MPT as their last post. 
For that reason bureaucrats are not particularly unhappy about 
the young and promising Minister Kanzaki, although he is from a 
different party. 
  Mr. Kanzaki was born in Tianjin, China, in 1943 in the midst 
of the Greater East Asia War. After the war, he returned to 
Japan and was brought up in Chiba City. He was such a brilliant 
student that he passed the national bar examination while he was 
still a junior at the Law Department of the University of Tokyo. 
He has an exceptionally clear head, and at a press conference 
after his first cabinet meeting, he spoke of accumulated 
deficits in posts and telecommunications activities, citing 
exact figures by simply relying on a lecture he had received 
from the administrative staff without a note. Agape with 
surprise were reporters who were used to the notion that it was 
sufficient to remember only approximate figures. 
  Reportedly in the same class with him in the Legal Research 
and Training Institute were reportedly Hokkaido Governor 
Takahiro Yokomichi and United Social Democratic Party 
Representative Satsuki Eda. His judgment as a politician is 
sharp, and he moved up at high speed from the post of deputy 
secretary general to the post of Policy Board chairman, then to 
that of Diet Affairs Committee chairman, and to the post of MPT 
minister. However, as to his career as a Diet member, although 
he was elected to four consecutive terms after his first victory 
in 1983 in the Fukuoka first district, his residence, if he 
were an LDP member with this much experience, he would probably 
have barely become a parliamentary vice minister at best. 
  In the Justice Ministry, he worked as a public prosecutor 
for 
14 years at district public prosecutor's offices in Yokohama, 
Naha, etc. He wrote books such as A Ban on Offering 
Profits. Partly because he was temporarily transferred to 
the Foreign Ministry, he is conversant with the European and 
Middle East affairs. He is thus a man of international 
perspectives who once served as director of Komeito's 
International Affairs Bureau. 
  As mentioned, the minister has a career with which nobody 
can 
argue, and he is a hope of Komeito; however, he has constantly 
bewildered MPT bureaucrats whose contacts so far have been only 
with the LDP. First, concerning his religious belief, when he 
was asked at a press conference, "Are you a member of Soka 
Gakkai [a Buddhist organization whose connection with Komeito 
has been a subject of controversy]?" He quickly responded with 
the following clear-cut answer: "I became its believer when I 
was a middle school student. My parents did not get on well, but 
they reconciled after joining Soka Gakkai. Seeing them restoring 
their good relationship, I also joined it. It was fortunate for 
me to meet Honorary Chairman Taisaku Ikeda. He is my teacher of 
life." 
  No LDP minister revealed his religious beliefs as clearly as 
he did, and so the administrative staff was startled all the 
more. The administrative staff's bewilderment began with its 
preconceived notion that Soka Gakkai rejected the existence of 
other religions. 
  Concerning the NHK [Japan Broadcasting Corporation] morning 
radio gymnastics program, it, in fact, began in the beginning of 
the Showa era at the instruction of the MPT (then the Ministry 
of Communications) to its subordinate organization NHK. For this 
historical background, it is said to be customary that the MPT 
minister attends the "National Radio Gymnastics Festival" held 
every year during the summer. The festival this year opened in 
Hiroshima City, and as customary Minister Kanzaki attended it. 
Local organizations such as the Chugoku Regional Bureau of 
Postal Inspection, the Chugoku Regional Bureau of Postal 
Services, and the Chugoku Radio Regulatory Bureau, and NHK 
opened a welcome banquet to thank the minister for coming all 
the way from Tokyo to visit Hiroshima. 
  This annual banquet is usually held at a first-rate 
restaurant within the compounds of a Shinto shrine in the city. 
However, in consideration of the minister's special background, 
they are said to have changed the place of the banquet to a 
next-class restaurant in a business district in the city. Soka 
Gakkai is a congregation of the Nichiren orthodox sect of 
believers. The Buddhist monk Nichiren criticized other Buddhist 
sects, saying that "the Shingon sect leads the nation to a ruin; 
the Zen sect is a demon; and the Jodo sect deserves no 
mentioning." However, he did not criticize Shinto. On the 
contrary, he adopted the manifestation-of-the-prime-noumenon 
doctrine [which regards Buddha and the national goddess as one 
body], even viewing that the national deity is a guardian spirit 
for Buddha. There is a mountain called Shichimenzan near the 
Kuon Temple built by the Buddhist monk Nichiren on Mt. Minobu in 
Yamanashi Prefecture. It is said that there is even a shrine 
dedicated to this guardian spirit in Shichimenzan. Therefore, 
people say that we should be careful not to hurt the feelings of 
Soka Gakkai when handling Buddhist sects except the Tendai sect 
where the monk Nichiren practiced asceticism; however, we need 
not worry about its feelings too much when handling other 
religions. 
  There are so many religions around the Japanese people that 
they are rather insensitive to them. They should be careful in 
this regard. For example, Daruma, whose formal name is 
Bodhidharma, is the symbol of the Zen sect. Some specific post 
offices place an "eyeless" Daruma statue in an "indoor Shinto 
altar" and pray for achieving savings campaign goals. Because 
"the Zen sect is a demon," Soka Gakkai members dislike this 
practice, and we may say that it is rude to them to follow the 
practice. Minister Kanzaki does not appear to be that sensitive, 
though.... 
<H5>  Need To Change From Manipulated Marionette </H5>
  What has bewildered bureaucrats next is the fact that, 
unlike 
LDP ministers, he is independent, individualistic, and active. 
The LDP ministers studied along a course provided by officials 
and answered at the Diet as instructed by them. Minister Kanzaki 
is different from past ministers in that he is a new minister of 
the Hosokawa coalition cabinet and that he is exhibiting his own 
colors like Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  The places which MPT ministers usually chose to see in their 
observation visits were local post offices in Osaka, etc. Except 
islands in Okinawa, they never visited any remoter places. 
However, Minister Kanzaki expressed the desire to visit both the 
largest and smallest post offices in his local observation trip. 
This indeed startled officials. He thus inspected the "Tokyo 
Central Office," the largest post office located in Ariake, 
Tokyo. Perhaps, this is a common place that a minister would 
like to visit and observe. It has modern zip-code reading 
machines, and one can learn how things flow rationally in the 
mail processing work. Therefore, past MPT ministers unfailingly 
visited this place. This time, too, Minister Kanzaki observed 
the office at the guidance of Ms. Tomoko Samura, director of the 
Postal Division of the Tokyo Regional Bureau of Postal Services, 
who is now climbing the ladder of success ahead of others among 
career women within the MPT. Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked 
quite pleased. 
  However, what annoyed bureaucrats was his visit to the 
smallest post office. It is said that after making extensive 
inquiries, they finally decided to visit the Tomiyama Post 
Office in Tomiyama-mura, Aichi Prefecture, noting that the post 
office could be reached without taking very much time. This 
village has a total population of 210 in 83 households, and this 
means that the Tomiyama Post Office is in a village with the 
second-smallest population in the nation. As if squatting flat 
on the ground, the houses are clustered together in the folds of 
mountains standing along the Sakuma Dam (Sakuma-cho in Shizuoka 
Prefecture), an artificial lake. The visit was reportedly 
realized by the desire of the minister who said that "large post 
offices are important, but I would also like to see with my own 
eyes how usefully very small post offices are working for the 
livelihood of the people." 
  In the early morning of 8 September, the minister and his 
party left the Yudani Hot Spring in Aichi Prefecture where they 
stayed overnight. They drove north and stopped to observe the 
Sakuma Dam. Then they drove the winding lakeside road for about 
two hours. Driving the bumpy road and watching timber-carrying 
trucks running past them on the opposite direction, they finally 
arrived at the village. MPT Minister Kanzaki is the first 
minister to visit the area since the village was built in the 
ninth year of Meiji [1876]. It is said that even LDP ministers 
elected from the local Higashimikawa District have never set 
foot in the village. 
  The Tomiyama Post Office is located in front of the village 
office and has three members, including the office chief. The 
minister observed the activities of the post office and was 
briefed on the conditions of the area under its jurisdiction. As 
for mail collection and delivery, this post office is reportedly 
so situated that the mail-collecting job is quicker if the 
collector comes from the post office in Iida City, Nagano 
Prefecture, rather than from a nearby post office in the same 
Aichi Prefecture. Among those who accompanied the minister was 
Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services Director Hideki 
Teranishi. Since not even its own regional bureau director has 
ever visited this post office before, Minister Kanzaki's 
actions, full of vitality, were all the more encouraging and, at 
times, bewildering to MPT bureaucrats, whose stamina was no 
match for that of the minister. 
  The minister and his party also observed a domed playground 
at the Tomiyama Primary and Middle School. This is a playground 
equipped with a dome system which spreads overhead in case of 
rain. It was built with funds from the MPT postal life insurance 
program. Unfortunately, it rained so hard that the dome's 
spreading and closing operation was not demonstrated, but 
Minister Kanzaki reportedly looked deeply moved upon learning 
that postal life insurance funds were being used for developing 
such a mountain village. 
  For the village, this was indeed the first visit by an 
incumbent minister, and so village chief Yukio Kawakami 
attempted to take this occasion to lodge an appeal. However, the 
regional bureau prevented him from doing that on the instruction 
from the ministry. Yet Minister Kanzaki eagerly listened to him. 
The village chief said: "Ours is a small village, and so we need 
the post office all the more. Not to speak of a city bank, we do 
not even have a regional bank. The post office is the only 
banking institution in this village. We want the post office to 
remain with us forever." Reporting on the present village 
conditions, he added: "Please apply rays of hope equally to the 
countryside as well. Being a village nestling in the folds of 
mountains, radio signals do not reach smoothly, and therefore 
we cannot use pocket pagers or portable phones. The television, 
too, does not throw clear pictures." If the visitor were an LDP 
minister, he would have not lent his ear to the remarks of the 
people in accordance with a scenario prepared by officials. At 
the appearance of a non-LDP minister who actively intends to 
hear the voice of the ministry's service customers, the 
bureaucrats seem to feel that their job has become harder. 
  After finishing about two hours of his inspection, the 
minister expressed the following view: "As a nation, we have to 
value such a village in the underpopulated area. I would like to 
treasure such a contact in the future as well." In response, 
village chief Kawakami reportedly revealed with joy that "the 
mere fact that the minister has visited us is enough to make us 
happy." 
<H5>  Astounded at Unexpected Eagerness To Learn </H5>
  The minister is so eager to learn things that the places he 
visits are quite beyond expectations, and therefore it seems 
that MPT bureaucrats are busy chasing him in hot haste and 
confusion. For example, in mid-September the minister even 
inspected the "library" on the eighth floor of the ministry 
building. The library of an office is its brains. A library does 
not show the list of readers to the public. This is because 
one's creed and ideology can be guessed by learning what books 
one reads. Likewise, a government agency's course to take and 
intellectual level can be guessed by what books its library has. 
Minister Kanzaki, who inspected the library, is indeed no 
ordinary person. We cannot but say that he is a man whose 
intellectual level is high. 
  He also took MPT bureaucrats aback by choosing the MPT's 
Communications Research Laboratory in Kodaira City, Tokyo, as 
the first place to visit among subsidiary organs. An MPT 
minister usually visits such facilities as NHK, NTT [Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation], and KDD [Kokusai Denshin 
Denwa Co.] as his course of study. A leading member of the 
Communications Research Laboratory joyously said that visiting 
the laboratory first of all showed him to be not an ordinary 
minister. 
  This laboratory is the eighth-largest among government 
research organizations, but as the saying goes about piquant 
though small, it has now become an indispensable organ. It 
contributes to foreseeing huge earthquakes by measuring warps of 
the Japanese Archipelago through the length of time in which 
power sources arrive from a volume of radio waves. It also 
tackles a program to develop a system for preventing crashes 
between cars by having weak power sources released from the car 
front. It is thus carrying out varied researches. 
  Deserving particular attention among them is the "atomic 
clock" under the jurisdiction of the Frequency Standard Section 
of the laboratory's Standard Measurement Division. It is 
believed that everyone learned in social science courses at 
primary and middle schools that Japanese standard time defines 
as its noon the moment the sun crosses the meridian line of the 
Akashi Astronomical Observatory located at longitude 135 degrees 
east. We call this the astronomical time. 
  This astronomical time was good enough for our use in a mere 
agricultural/industrial society. The length of time when the 
earth revolves on its axis once was decided to be 24 hours. As 
it is, the center of gravity is not the center of the earth, 
thereby causing a one-second lag every several years. However, 
we have now stepped into an "information-oriented society" in 
which computers are mutually connected by communication 
circuits, and so the astronomical time with such large lags is 
no longer usable as the standard time. 
  In the first place, the computer can make several million 
calculations per second, and astronomical time can no longer 
cope with this tremendous speed. Such being the case, it is said 
that the length of time in which the cesium-133 atom vibrates 
9.192631770 billion times has been defined as a second. It is 
this MPT laboratory that is taking custody of the "atomic clock" 
which used the cesium-133 atom. NHK's timecasts, etc. are said 
to originate in this laboratory and the time signals are sent 
from NTT's shortwave transmitting station in Sanwa-machi, 
Ibaragi Prefecture. 
  Now is an information-oriented society in which computer 
networks constitute the infrastructure, and this is the very 
reason that the atomic time becomes standard and the MPT's 
Communications Research Laboratory controls it. Astronomical 
observatories come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Education. Time in the agricultural/industrial society was 
controlled by the Ministry of Education; however, it comes under 
the MPT's control in the information-oriented society. MPT 
Minister Kanzaki is indeed no ordinary man because he chose the 
Communications Research Laboratory, which is so important to the 
ministry, for his first observation visit. However, not many 
MPT bureaucrats understand the significance of the 
Communications Research Laboratory. 
<H5>  They "Stuck Fast" to LDP, and Are Now Paying for It </H5>
  The fourth reason for the bewilderment of the MPT 
bureaucrats 
regarding Minister Kanzaki was that they could not clearly 
understand his personality at the beginning. High-ranking 
bureaucrats, many of whom are graduates of former imperial 
universities, cannot but view those who passed the national bar 
examination with respect. Many of them, graduates in law, once 
dreamed of taking the examination, but chose the path of career 
bureaucrats because they lacked in both mettle and ability to 
take the examination. 
  Therefore, they cannot hold up their heads before Minister 
Kanzaki, a prosecutor turned politician, in that he passed the 
national bar examination while they could not realize the dream 
of passing it. They are thus "serving him with a feeling of 
awe" (a division chief in the Communication Policy Bureau). It 
is said to be clearly observable among MPT bureaucrats at the 
beginning that they politely shunned him, suspecting that he 
would be a stern man in view of his past service as a public 
prosecutor considered a symbol of "relentlessness." 
  What is more, like a public prosecutor, he has a sharp look 
in his eyes and speaks in a resolute tone; therefore, his image 
rather strongly generates the feeling that he is a "fearful 
minister." However, this impression completely changed during an 
overnight stay in a hotel in the Yudani Hot Spring before his 
visit to the Tomiyama Post Office. He held a social gathering 
with accompanying reporters from private broadcasting stations, 
and is said to have let loose and offered great service as a 
merrymaker. 
  The occasion was also participated in by Mr. Teranishi, 
director of the Tokai Regional Bureau of Postal Services, and 
others. It was the bureaucrats who should have made the 
gathering hilarious, but it reportedly was Minister Kanzaki who 
delighted the attendants by exhibiting his very entertaining 
talent. He appears to have really played merrily as indicated by 
the following remarks by a leading official: "We did not expect 
a prosecutor to make the place that merry." Since then, he has 
been reputed within the MPT to be an understanding person and a 
man of refined tastes. 
  However, when he has something to say, the minister minces 
no 
words and assumes a resolute attitude. For example, at Diet 
committee meetings in the past, bureaucrats in respective 
ministries and agencies concerned answered questions in place of 
their ministers in the capacity of government members of the 
committees. However, the Hosokawa cabinet adopted a system which 
halted the practice of government committee members answering in 
place of their ministers and made the ministers or newly 
established deputy ministers (parliamentary vice ministers) 
answer all questions. Reacting to this step, Minister Kanzaki 
started posing questions and expressed his doubt about the 
system at a ministerial discussion after the 31 August cabinet 
meeting. He asked, "Was the abolition of the government 
committee member system decided at the meeting of the leaders of 
the government and coalition ruling parties on 30 August?" As 
this questioning indicates, he says frankly what he has to say 
and discloses his course of action clearly. On this score, his 
reputation is said to be rising within the ministry. 
  However, the fourth [as published] factor contributing to 
the 
bewilderment of bureaucrats is the fact that they cannot clearly 
understand Komeito policies. In this regard, it is bureaucrats 
who are wrong. It is because they only stuck fast to the LDP 
government and did not study the other parties' policies. MPT 
bureaucrats used to say that "the party's thought is...," but 
when they mentioned the "party" it meant the LDP, not any other 
party. They have thus far ignored the other parties, and they 
cannot but pay for it. 
  Komeito has put forward its proposal to the MPT with regard 
to the budget for this fiscal year, and the proposal clearly 
reveals Komeito's policy directions. First, in Paragraph (A) on 
"the Expanded Improvement of the Information/Communications 
Foundations," the party asks the ministry to: "subsidize the 
local governments' CATV [cable television] establishment 
programs in order to remove multiple radio disturbances"; "plan 
to expedite the improvement of relay stations in order to 
eliminate fringe areas where radio reception is poor"; "strive 
to put to practical use broadcasting and communication systems 
in the underground zone so that people there can hear broadcasts 
and use portable phones without reception problems"; "work to 
strengthen the radio surveillance system and step up control on 
illegal radio waves"; "study and develop new frequency resources 
and their utilization technique"; "promote the practical use of 
the vehicle information communication system (VICS)"; "study and 
develop ozonosphere protection through the use of radio waves"; 
"enlarge expenditures for developing the tropical rainfall 
measuring mission (TRMM)"; "develop a pioneer research on highly 
advanced home medical diagnosis and treatment system, etc."; and 
"develop the communication and broadcasting technology satellite 
(COMETS) and the next-generation COMETS." 
  Next, in Paragraph (B) on "the Improvement of 
Telecommunications Projects," the party asks the ministry to: 
"review the NTT's local-call rate system," "take measures to 
prevent tapping of car and cordless phones," "step up measures 
to support the production of various broadcasting media and 
software," "expand sign-language broadcasting programs as well 
as the character/voice multiplex broadcasting programs," 
"increase broadcasting program libraries," and "improve and 
consolidate international broadcasting." 
  Then, turning to the sector of operational activities, in 
Paragraph (C) on "Postal Services" the party calls on the 
ministry to: "promote the installation of delivery mailboxes"; 
"study and develop a complete automation system in mail 
processing"; "furnish information to local residents through the 
expansion of the post office satellite communication network"; 
"promote diversified use of postal conveniences in a 
highly-advanced manner at each post office in large cities"; 
"build complex facilities including welfare installations"; and 
"develop low-pollution automobiles like methanol-fueled cars." 
  Moreover, in Paragraph (D) on "the Improvement of Postal 
Savings Corresponding to Financial Deregulation" which became an 
issue when Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, former minister, was serving, 
the party asks the ministry to: "improve and consolidate a 
system for lending postal savings to individuals"; "raise 
tax-exemption ceilings for interest income from postal savings 
for aged people, etc."; "expand the framework for independent 
working funds in postal savings"; "work to increase operational 
funds for local bonds and provide loans to local governments"; 
"establish new annuity-type savings"; "abolish the measure to 
impose taxes on the interest from the part of contributions in 
international volunteer savings"; and "install automatic 
remittance machines for exclusive use at windows." 
  Last, with regard to postal life insurance, the party calls 
for "development of new commodities," "improvement of the tax 
system," etc. Minister Kanzaki is expected to make decisions in 
line with these policies. 
<H5>  Nagata-cho Report Card for Minister Kanzaki </H5>
  Just one month after the Hosokawa coalition cabinet started, 
ASAHI SHIMBUN in its 4 September [1993] evening issue rated 
respective ministers under the title, "Report Cards for 
Children's Class in Nagata-cho School." The article, carried by 
the newspaper as its special weekend feature, was quite 
interesting. As to the question, "Does he speak clearly in easy 
language," Minister Kanzaki was rated "average." He was asked to 
"make further efforts" on the following three questions: "Does 
he carry through what he has decided?" "Does he move at 
another's beck?" "Is he willing to tackle new things?" He was 
rated "very good" regarding the last question, "Does he act big 
or do things without much ado?" We might say he received an 
"average" mark as a whole. 
  In the overall estimation, the marker appraised him rather 
severely, saying: "He is a lawyer, and so it is understandable 
that he is prudent. Yet it is hard to rate him because all of 
his utterances show his failure to leave the framework of 
bureaucrats' ideas. His efforts for learning is good, but we 
hope that he will be able to speak in his own language as soon 
as possible." Conversely, this means that he enjoys the trust of 
bureaucrats. As stated in the beginning, he has no confrontation 
with bureaucrats, and so it appears that his mistakes do not 
show. However, as a former bureaucrat, he must be aware of 
bureaucrats' tricks. A voice has been rising among mass media 
calling on him to see through their tricks. 
  For example, concerning the issue of easing regulations, 
Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations] and others are 
requesting that "measures be taken for CATV businessmen so that 
they can operate business by leasing circuits from 
telecommunications enterprises." A responsible division 
director made the following answer in this regard: "There are no 
CATV businessmen who want that kind of thing. So there is no 
need to ease regulation." There can be no need because it is the 
very division director who has carried out the administrative 
guidance, saying that "they must not lease circuits." 
  There is a strong voice saying that, as an ex-public 
prosecutor, the minister should have an eye with which to see 
through those deceptive answers by bureaucrats. When he develops 
such an eye, the low rating he received from ASAHI SHIMBUN will 
be obliterated. There is a strong voice of the people who pin 
hopes on MPT Minister Kanzaki, a nice fellow.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, February 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
central Mongolian newspapers are paying a great attention to the 
official visit of the Mongolian President P. Ochirbat to India, 
Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, which began yesterday. As the 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs, the President P. Ochirbat sent 
telegrams of greeting to the chairman of the PRC Jiang Zemin and 
the Chairman of the State Council on Restoration of Law and 
Order of the Federal State Myanmar [Burma] Than Shwe. 
  The newspaper informs that before leaving on a visit to the 
countries of Asia the President P. Ochirbat has received the 
representatives of Bayanhongor Aymag at their request. They 
have acquainted the president with their life and activity, in 
particular, with the course of realization of a number of 
production programmes. 
  The newspaper notes that the President P. Ochirbat during 
the 
meeting with the representatives of Bayanhongor Aymag has 
pointed out to a special importance of development of 
infrastructure. As the newspaper informs, the representatives 
of Bayanhongor Aymag have been received by the Prime Minister P. 
Jasray. The newspaper publishes an information about the 
government sitting. At the sitting the basic attention has been 
paid to training and retraining of lawyers. 
  The newspaper of the Mongolian capital ULAANBAATAR publishes 
an article devoted to problems of debt of Mongolia to Russia. 
In the article it is noted that, according to the calculations, 
a debt worth of 850 grams of gold to Russia falls on each 
citizen of Mongolia. 
  In other words, Mongolia is in the debt to Russia worth of 
1700 tonnes of gold. The newspaper notes that gold at present 
is still in popular demand at the world market. 
  The newspaper publishes an article about the wellknown 
figure 
Dambiijantsan, about whom the wellknown Mongolists A. Pozdneyev, 
O. Lattimore and other scientists have been writing. 
Dambiijantsan, who is from western Mongolia, was a prominent 
figure of liberation movement. 
  The newspaper publishes an article devoted to creative 
activity of markes [as received], problems of modern literature.

<F P=106> [By Paul Jacob] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto, whose recent remarks 
on his tenure as Indonesian leader fuelled speculation that he 
might be preparing to step down, said yesterday that no one 
should make an issue of the political succession question. He 
said the procedures for determining the country's political 
leadership had long been in place and had been implemented at 
presidential elections every five years since 1968. 
  Speaking to Religious Affairs Minister Tarmizi Taher at the 
Istana yesterday, Mr Suharto said he was a man who abided by the 
constitution and its provisions, which include one which states 
that a President is elected to serve a five-year term. Mr 
Suharto, 72, pointed out that having been entrusted with the 
position by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) last year, 
he would end his term "in accordance with the Constitution". The 
provisions also say that a candidate can be re-elected and no 
limit is stipulated. 
  In keeping with his long-held position on the leadership 
succession issue, Mr Suharto did not say whether he intended to 
seek re-election for a new term in 1998, but said he intended to 
serve out the current term. The closest he had come to saying 
that he might step down was in a biography released in 1989. But 
in view of the support given to him by political parties and the 
military in late 1992, he said that such endorsement and support 
was a call to duty and service which he could not dismiss. He 
then went on to accept the nomination and was elected last March 
to his sixth straight five-year term. 
  Mr Suharto has maintained at each occasion that it is the 
people, through their representatives in the MPR -- the 
country's highest legislative body -- who decide every five 
years who their future leader should be. 
  Mr Tarmizi, who met the President to report on his visits to 
Saudi Arabia and Malaysia recently, used the occasion to raise 
the succession question on behalf of a number of local religious 
leaders. These leaders had questioned Mr Tarmizi about Mr 
Suharto's earlier remarks that he would not be President for 
life and that he knew when to step down. 
  Mr Suharto responded by pointing out that procedures for 
determining the country's political leaders were in place. He 
also urged against too uninhibited a discussion on the issue. 
  Political scientist Amien Rais first suggested last December 
that the succession issue should be discussed openly. After some 
initial reaction, the move died down when the ruling Golkar 
[Functional Group] party, of which Mr Suharto is de facto 
leader, rejected the idea. It resurfaced last week after 
American academic Donald Wilson told reporters after meeting Mr 
Suharto that the Indonesian leader had said he did not intend to 
be President for life and that "I will step down right on time".

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, Feb 24 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto 
said Thursday he would continue to fulfil his constitutional 
obligations given by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) as 
its mandatory [mandate holder] for the 1993-98 presidential 
tenure. "I will fulfil my constitutional duties," the president 
was quoted as saying by Religious Minister Tarmizi Taher. 
  The head of state made the remarks in response to questions 
of a number of ulemas put forward by the minister on the 
implementation of his task as the MPR mandatory. Tarmizi Taher 
said that a number of ulemas raised concern that Suharto would 
leave his post before his tenure is completed in 1998. The 
minister said he had received a number of telephone calls from 
ulemas asking clarification on rumors that President Suharto 
will leave his post before completing his presidential tenure. 
He said that the telephone on this question also came from the 
Indonesian Ulemas Council's (MUI) Chairman Hasan Basri. 
  On the occasion, the minister also reported on his recent 
visit to Saudi Arabia to observe preparations for the 1994 
pilgrimange season. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In a reception given to the Vietnamese Ambassador 
Le Cong Phung in Bangkok on Tuesday [22 February], Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai said: Thailand-Vietnam relations will 
now have a more favorable environment to consolidate and 
develop. Here is our comment. 
  In the past two years, Vietnam-Thailand relations have 
consolidated and developed in many fields. Exchange visits by 
many high ranking delegations have been made. On 15 October 
last year, party General Secretary Do Muoi went to Thailand 
after a visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. On 3 February this 
year, President of the Thai Parliament Mr. Marut Bunnak visited 
Vietnam, and, most importantly, Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai said he will make an official visit to Vietnam. 
  During summit meetings within the two countries, mutual 
understanding has been strengthened, contributing to the 
development of bilateral relations in many fields. The Thai 
prime minister as well as industrial, academic, and business 
leaders in Thailand all expressed admiration for Vietnam 
political developments and social stabilization. The coming 
visit to Vietnam by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai comes 
after lifting of the American embargo. He said: Relations will 
be strengthened between the two countries. 
  In economic relations, Vietnam and Thailand have concluded 
exchange agreements including agreements on avoidance of double 
taxation and investment protection. Bilateral trade relations 
have developed rapidly from $65 million in 1990 to $158 million 
in 1993, and 30 Thai investment projects capitalized at over 
$120 million have been licensed by Vietnam. Many Thai senior 
government leaders have called on Thai businessmen to increase 
investment and trade activities in Vietnam. 
  At a workshop held in Bangkok on Monday by the Thai 
newspapers THE NATION and BANGKOK BUSINESS [KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT], 
Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri called for closer 
cooperation between his country's government and private sector 
to improve Thai competitiveness in Vietnam and Indochina. 
  Meanwhile, Thai businesspeople in Vietnam urge the Thai 
Government to promote an intergovernmental agreement on an 
Indochinese fund to help Thai businessmen in their competition 
and speed up the development of a system of road and maritime 
transport linking Thailand and Vietnam in order to promote trade 
and tourism. 
  The Vietnamese Ambassador Le Cong Phung told the Bangkok 
workshop that the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo and step by 
step moving towards normalisation with Vietnam would not derail 
Vietnam foreign policy and its external economic relations, 
particularly those towards countries in Southeast Asia.
