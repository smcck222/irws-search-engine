<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Dao Nguyen] </F>
  [Summary] "Dear friends, on the occasion of the Vietnamese 
traditional new year, comrade General Secretary Do Muoi paid a 
working visit to Nam Ha and Thai Binh Provinces on 16-18 
February. Accompanying the general secretary were Dang Vu Chu, 
minister of Light Industry; Hoang Qui, deputy minister of Heavy 
Industry; Nguyen An, deputy chief of the party Central Committee 
Organization Department; assistants to the general secretary, 
and leading cadres of departments and branches of the party 
Central Committee." 
  During the visit, General Secretary Do Muoi welcomed 
achievements scored by these two provinces in socioeconomic 
development and agricultural production, especially Nam Ha which 
attained an average yield of 10 tonnes of rice per hectare in 
1993. People in the province are doing well and the number of 
prosperous families is on the increase, 95 percent of villages 
have been supplied with electricity, 85 percent of villagers 
live in brick houses, and fresh water supply has reached the 
rural area. 
  In a meeting with the local cadres and people, comrade 
General Secretary Do Muoi said: 
  [Begin Do Muoi recording] "The party and state are very 
pleased to see changes for the better in Nam Ha Province thanks 
to efforts by the local people. Generally speaking, our people 
are still very poor. We are a lot better now in comparison with 
the era under French domination. We, however, are still far 
behind if we compare our people's standard of living with people 
in other countries. As a result, we must strive to improve our 
socioeconomic development. Our party has set lines and policies 
to firmly maintain national independence and called all people 
to integrate efforts to build the nation, strive to extricate 
the nation from poverty and backwardness; work hard to make our 
people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and 
civilized. We must strive to ensure happiness and a better life 
for all people including ethnic minorities and religious groups 
throughout the country. To fulfill this task, first of all, we 
must strive to enhance the people's intelligence, provide them 
with better education, and enhance their background and 
capability. Moreover, we must strive to practice thrift and 
work hard to amass wealth while enhancing unity to ensure our 
happiness. Uncle Ho taught us: Unity, unity, great unity; 
success, success, great success. As a result, we must strive to 
enhance unity among people of various nationalities, religious 
groups, and within the entire party for the sake of national 
independence, freedom, and happiness of the people so as to 
write new pages of our glorious history. I hope that Nam Ha 
Province will be able to overcome all difficulties, extricate 
itself from poverty, and soon enjoy prosperity. On the new year 
occasion, I wish all comrades and countrymen in the province a 
happy and prosperous new year and success in building the 
party." [applause] [end recording] 
  In his talks with leading cadres and the executive committee 
of Nam Ha party organization, Comrade Do Muoi urged them to 
satisfactorily renovate the provincial economic structure in the 
direction of promoting agro-industry, export-import, and 
business. Nam Ha must strive to firmly grasp the spirit of the 
midterm national party conference resolution and turn it into 
concrete programs of action. 
  Dear friends, during his stay in Thai Binh Province, Comrade 
Do Muoi visited the Doan Ket Engineering Enterprise, the Hong 
Quan Textile Enterprise, and the Tien Hai Industrial Complex. 
  "At the Doan Ket Engineering Enterprise, Comrade Do Muoi was 
pleased to learn that during the past 35 years, the enterprise 
has firmly maintained and expanded production, producing various 
high quality bicycle spare parts. He urged the Ministry of 
Heavy Industry to help the enterprise especially in supply it 
with modern equipment. 
  "At the Hong Quan Textile Enterprise, Comrade Do Muoi highly 
appraised the enterprise's efforts in producing goods for export 
using the old machine and equipment left over by the Central 
Textile Factory." 
  Dear friends, Comrade Do Muoi also visited people in Le Loi, 
Lam Canh, and Khong Thai Villages in Kien Xuong District and 
heard their briefing on daily life activities and their 
production. 
  "In his talk with leading cadres and the executive committee 
of the provincial party organization, Comrade Do Muoi urged them 
to strive to promote modern agriculture on the basis of 
improving cultivation patterns to attain high economic results, 
develop processing industry, and help peasants to sell their 
products. He stressed that since the province has various 
favorable conditions, it must strive to develop the rural 
economy while promoting aquaculture and fishery to help the 
local people and fishermen increase their output and amass 
wealth."

<F P=106> [By Richard Breeze] </F>
  [Excerpt] SUVA, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Fiji's sharpest politician, 
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, took centre stage here Friday 
as voting in a week-long general election closed amid deep 
uncertainty. Most observers considered it unlikely that either 
of the rival Fijian groups would emerge from the poll strong 
enough on its own to provide this Pacific republic with a stable 
government. 
  Mara's job would be to hammer out a compromise agreement on 
a 
premier and a government as soon as possible after counting is 
complete, probably early Sunday. 
  Under a constitution stemming from a 1987 army coup, ethnic 
Fijians have a lock on the politics of this sugar-producing 
archipelago, with 37 seats in the 70-seat House of 
Representatives. 
  Ethnic Indians have 27 with five for European, Chinese or 
mixed-race members and one for the autonomous island of Rotuma. 
The same constitution says the president picks the premier, who 
must be a Fijian and have the support of the majority of the 
multi-racial parliament. 
  The big question Friday was how many votes the Fijian 
dissidents grouped in the Fijian Association (FA) would take 
from the ruling Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party. 
The dissidents broke from the SVT over controversial budget 
proposals in November. 
  This split among the Fijians has spurred regional rivalries 
and SVT leader and premier Sitiveni Rabuka fears the election 
could further deepen divisions between Fijians. Rabuka says the 
SVT should win around 33 seats but shaky economic policies and 
criticism of Rabuka's mercurial management style could cost it 
votes. 
  Josevata Kamikamica, the FA's leader, is confident of 
wounding the SVT. "We are going to do well. We will get around 
12 seats," he told AFP Friday as he sat quaffing kava with 
supporters outside a Suva polling station. "I would be quite 
happy to be premier. And we could look at having Rabuka in a 
goverment which I lead, but I won't serve in a government led by 
Rabuka," he said. 
  Mara, a 73-year-old veteran former premier, is Fiji's most 
seasoned politician and is one of the last of the great 
paramount chiefs. He sees himself in a role as father of the 
nation. 
  Political sources expect the hard-headed chief to move 
swiftly and decisively to get an agreement from Fiji's political 
party leaders on an acceptable premier. He seeks prompt 
agreement on a solidly-based government so as to boost both 
local and international confidence in the country, the sources 
said. "He could summon Rabuka and Kamikamica and tell them that 
he wants a quick agreement on a premier and a government," one 
Fijian source said. 
  One suggestion in political circles is that Fiji may emerge 
from the election with a minority government which had an 
understanding with other groups in parliament, particularly the 
Indian-dominated parties. The long-established National 
Federation Party (NFP) is widely expected to emerge stronger 
from the vote at the expense of its rival for the Indian vote, 
the National Labour Party. 
  NFP leader Jai Jam Reddy is seen as a Kamikamica backer, but 
it is suggested that his party could cut a deal with Rabuka if 
they thought him more open to their policy views. Top among 
these is a review of the constitution which has to be completed 
by July 1997. Nine parties and 23 independents contested this 
poll in the country's scattered islands. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The abbot of Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi 
yesterday said he had closed his drug rehabilitation centre to 
new Hmong arrivals, as the Interior Ministry announced it was 
considering a plan to wipe out the remaining anti-Vientiane 
movement allegedly operating from the temple. 
  Phra Chamrun Panchan said he regretted the decision not to 
admit more Hmong drug addicts for treatment. [passage omitted] 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, who did not 
provide details of the plan to put an end to anti-Vientiane 
activity based in Thailand, yesterday said some of the Hmong at 
the drug treatment centre are connected with right-wing 
anti-Vientiane rebel leader Vang Pao. 
  Deputy Interior Ministry Permanent Secretary Chaloem 
Phromloet said that 6,052 of the 10,000 Hmong at the temple are 
illegal immigrants from Laos, not from northern Thailand as are 
the others who are known as Thai Pukhao [Thai mountain people]. 
According to the ministry's figures, there are less than 200 
drug addicts at Wat Tham Krabok. The National Security Council 
last year asked the Interior Ministry to screen residents of the 
temple to separate the drug addicts from the alleged Hmong 
rebels in disguise. The ministry was also asked to take 
necessary action against those using the temple for reasons 
other than drug rehabilitation. 
  Phra Chamrun said provincial authorities had deployed 
militiamen around his temple for several weeks after a report 
last year that the sprawling compound had been used by rightwing 
Hmong opposed to the Lao government as a staging area for 
sabotage and acts of terrorism inside Laos. 
  "But the militiamen have since been recalled because they 
did 
not find any illegal activities committed by the Hmong people," 
he said. 
  He said he wanted the provincial authorities to send in 
observers to monitor the work of his staff at the drug 
rehabilitation centre to make sure no illegal activities took 
place. 
  The abbot complained that the authorities tended to regard 
him and his staff with suspicion. 
  Phra Chamrun said although the number of Hmong hilltribe 
people undergoing treatment was small, the majority of the close 
to 10,000 Hmong at the temple were their family members and 
relatives. 
  The abbot denied that any of the Hmong residing at his 
temple 
had anything to do with Gen Vang Pao, the leader of a Hmong 
armed force opposed to Vientiane.

  [Excerpts] On 23 February, Lieutenant General Thiradet 
Miphian, director of the Supreme Command Intelligence 
Department, petitioned the Police Department to take legal 
action against Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun of 
the Lao National Liberation Army [LNLA] on charges of violating 
national security. 
  The purpose of the petition is to have the two Lao generals 
investigated in accordance with government policy, because they 
support the organization of illegal movements on Thai territory 
opposing the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The LNLA 
secretly gathered men, weapons, and food supplies in areas of 
Chiang Kham District in Phayao Province and Thung Chang, Mae 
Rim, and Tha Wang Pha Districts in Nan Province to launch 
several armed operations in the LPDR. [passage omitted] 
  In October 1993, the Thai Supreme Command stated that action 
was being taken against some of the 6,096 Lao refugees living at 
Tham Krabok temple in Saraburi Province when it was discovered 
that they were followers of Vang Pao. 
  The Thai Government's harsh policy against Generals Vang Pao 
and Thonglit and their followers -- charging them with national 
security violations and illegal entry -- will help eliminate the 
LPDR Government's suspicions and contribute to stronger 
relations between the two countries.

  [Text] The DPRK's purchase of 50,000 tons of rice and its 
plan to buy 2,000 tons of smoked rubber sheets amount to a 
beginning of trade relations between the Thai and DPRK 
Governments. According to Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Laksanawisit, the past volume of trade between the two countries 
has been relatively small. He feels that the new trade contacts 
will contribute to greater bilateral trade volume. 
  [Begin Churin recording] I believe there is potential for 
expansion of trade with the DPRK. To date, we import yarn, 
steel pipe, machinery, and chemical products. Our exports to 
that country are gas, gypsum, clothes, auto parts, and so forth. 
There were discussions on rice, tapioca, and natural rubber. A 
couple of days ago the DPRK signed a contract to buy 50,000 tons 
of our 15-percent [broken grain] rice. I just completed a 
discussion on tapioca and natural rubber. The DPRK does not 
know much about uses of tapioca flour. They will probably 
import the flour to process into pellets, to coat textiles, and 
to produce toothpaste, an essential product. The DPRK has been 
using wheat flour and has no experience in the uses of tapioca 
flour. The DPRK official said he is interested in Thai tapioca 
flour. Therefore, it has been agreed that the Commerce Ministry 
will quickly send samples of tapioca flour and relevant 
specifications to the DPRK Government for experimental uses. 
The ministry will then follow up to try to turn the DPRK into 
another market for Thai tapioca flour. [end recording]

  [Text] Thailand is calling on the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade to stop linking trade issues to environmental 
concerns. The deputy minister for science, technology, and 
environment, Pricha Musikun, made the request at an informal 
meeting on trade and the environment in Geneva, Switzerland, 
attended by more than 20 nations. 
  The gathering was organized as a brainstorming session ahead 
of the signing of the new Uruguay GATT agreement in April. 
Thailand and Malaysia attended the meeting as representatives 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. Mr. 
Pricha said developed nations should not make environmental 
demands as part of any trade negotiations with developing 
countries. He said it is important that all nations be allowed 
to develop at their own pace.

of bartering Thai products with foreign weapons. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says the defense 
minister has explained the thinking behind the principle and 
ways and means to proceed in arms deals. Mr. Aphisit says only 
major arms purchases will be subject to barter trade policy. He 
says the government does not intend to interfere in regular 
operation of the Armed Forces and small purchases will not have 
to be negotiated. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri says the Armed Forces' plan 
to buy transport planes from Italy has to be delayed until Italy 
has a new government. 
  Deputy Minister of Commerce Chaiyot Sasomsap also says the 
armed forces should ask Italy to remain committed to the quota 
prices until April as there will be a trade meeting between the 
two countries next month. He expects the meeting to be 
beneficial to the arms deal as well. Deputy Minister Chaiyot 
says his ministry has invited the Thai Chamber of Commerce and 
the Federation of Thai Industries to consult on trade measures 
and cooperation with Italy on February 24.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Set up forum to boost ties with Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] The sea battle last week in the Gulf of Thailand 
between Thai and Cambodian navies was the latest and probably 
the most serious in a series of conflicts which flared up this 
year between the two countries. The brief skirmish led to the 
sinking of two Thai fishing boats and a Cambodian vessel and the 
capture of 14 Cambodian sailors. It also prompted Cambodia's 
Koh Kong provincial administration to close the border opposite 
Thailand's Trat Province. 
  Shortly before Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's historic visit 
to Cambodia last month, the Cambodian Information Ministry 
accused some "bad seeds" in the Thai military of assisting Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas -- a charge that was categorically denied by 
the military and the Government. Thai businessmen in Cambodia 
were also accused by Finance Minister Sam Rangsi of behaving 
like "cowboys" because of their alleged exploitative business 
practices. 
  Although limited in scale and gravity, the armed conflict 
and 
exchange of acrimonious rhetoric between the two countries 
reflects the deep-seated mutual distrust between Thais and 
Cambodians which dates back to history. In the minds of many 
Cambodians, there is a negative attitude and suspicion that 
Thailand is a bully attempting to carve up their country in 
unwitting concert with the Vietnamese on the other side of the 
border. There is also a feeling that Thailand is ready to 
exploit Cambodia's wealth whenever an opportunity arises for 
that country to become strong, particularly at a time when 
nationalistic pride is being revived and reconstruction is under 
way. On the other side of the coin, several Thais still regard 
themselves in a "Big Brother" light vis-a-vis their Cambodian 
neighbours and expect the latter to show their respect. On 
occasion Cambodians have been branded as ungrateful and 
untrustworthy for their attempts to break free and be treated as 
equals. 
  Mutual distrust was cast aside to pave the way for mutual 
interest when the Thais supported the anti-Vietnamese Cambodian 
factions in their liberation struggle against the Vietnamese and 
their puppet regime in Phnom Penh during the 80's. And when 
mutual interest is no longer the case, suspicion and racial 
animosity rear their ugly heads as was witnessed in the recent 
flare-up between the two countries. Yet, this destructive 
attitude which seems to lie dormant in the subconsciousness of 
the two peoples waiting for a time to be reactivated is not 
insurmountable if the two parties are just prepared to sit down 
together to talk matters over in a sincere manner rather than 
trading bullets or exchanging angry rhetoric. 
  The undemarcated land border between Thailand and Cambodia 
and the overlapping territorial waters claimed by both sides are 
triggers for potential conflict -- and a flare-up in fighting in 
a worst case scenario -- between the two countries. The sea 
battle in the Gulf last week which was reported to have been 
provoked by an incident involving one Cambodian vessel and two 
Thai fishing trawlers in an area still contested by the two 
countries represents a glaring example of the kind of hostile 
situation that Thailand and Cambodia will find themselves in. 
And given the notorious reputation of Thai fishermen for 
opportunism, the risk of such confrontations will undoubtedly 
increase. 
  The latest armed conflict underscores the need for the two 
countries to quickly set up a joint border committee similar to 
the ones that exist between Thailand and Burma, Thailand and 
Laos and also between Thailand and Malaysia to resolve border 
disputes across the negotiating table. 
  It is true that there were bad times in the past when 
Thailand was viewed as the aggressor and Cambodia the victim or 
when the two countries saw themselves as racial enemies. These 
bitter experiences should now be put behind us so that the two 
countries can cultivate a new relationship based on mutual 
respect of territorial integrity, common interests, mutual 
prosperity, equality and non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs.

  [Text] Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas made a 
stopover at Bangkok's international airport yesterday, during 
which he held an hour-long informal discussion with Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri. 
  The Indonesian foreign minister said Indonesia had no 
objection if Thailand wants to invite Burma to attend the July 
ASEAN foreign ministers meeting in Bangkok as Thailand's guest. 
Alatas said it is a common practice within ASEAN for the host 
country to invite other countries to attend the meeting. He 
said that Indonesia is pleased to see the economic and political 
developments in Burma as the country becomes more open. 
Indonesia welcomes Burma's decision to strengthen its ties with 
ASEAN. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, meanwhile, stressed the

  [Text] This afternoon, the Mongolian president -- on an 
official visit to Thailand from 25-28 February as the guest of 
the government -- and his wife called on the prime minister at 
Government House. Speaking to reporters afterward, Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said this is the first 
visit to Thailand by such a high-ranking Mongolian official. He 
said there were broad discussions on political, economic, and 
social issues between the Thai and Mongolian leaders, who agreed 
that those issues have progressed well: 
  [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...called on our 
prime 
minister. They discussed political, economic, social, and trade 
issues. They agreed that Thai-Mongolian relations have 
proceeded well and will improve further. He asked us to 
consider Mongolia's wish to join ASEAN or APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] activities. The prime minister informed 
him that he has no objection in principle. Because those 
organizations include other countries, though, they will have to 
be consulted. On economic and trade issues, both sides agreed 
to increase the trade volume. Although the two countries are 
located far away from each other, communication between them is 
good. If the private sectors of both countries meet, there will 
be good prospects for greater trade. 
  Thailand offered scholarships for Mongolian students and 
invited Mongolian monks to study Buddhism in Thailand. A few 
Mongolian students and monks are already studying here. We 
offered several scholarships for Mongolian students, 
particularly in the field of public health. [end recording]

  According to Meciar, Slovakia's international trade volume 
has grown considerably. He said he was interested in signing 
two agreements with Thailand -- to avoid double taxation and to 
protect investments. "We welcome Thai investors," he said. 
  Slovakia exports steel and chemicals and is in need of 
consumer products like canned food, he said. Opportunities also 
exist for foreign investors in the hotel and tourism sectors.

<F P=106> ["President Kim Il-song's Work `For the Ultimate Solution of </F>
the Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural 
Theses'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song sent to the National Agricultural 
Conference a letter entitled "For the Ultimate Solution of the 
Rural Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" 
on February 24, 1994. 
  The letter reads in full: 
  The grand National Agricultural Conference which is open on 
the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the publication of the 
socialist rural theses, arousing keen interest and expectations 
of our agricultural working people and the whole nation, is a 
matter of great jubilation and a momentous event. 
  I extend warm congratulations to you who are present at the 
National Agricultural Conference and to all the agricultural 
working people, who have worked devotedly to implement the 
socialist rural theses under the leadership of our party, and 
express my heartfelt gratitude to our working class and our 
people for the active assistance they have given to the rural 
communities. 
  This conference will review the great victory which has been 
achieved by our party and our people in the struggle to carry 
out the socialist rural theses and will mark a new milestone in 
advancing the construction of socialist rural communities to a 
higher stage. It will be a historic conference which will 
powerfully demonstrate the validity of our party's socialist 
rural theses and the advantages of the socialist agricultural 
system in our country and inspire our people to a fresh success, 
the people who safeguard the socialist cause of chuche and bring 
it to consummation. 
  The rural question occupies a very important place in 
realizing the people's cause of independence, the cause of 
socialism. 
  The rural question encompasses the peasant question and the 
agrarian question. The peasantry, along with the working class, 
is a component of the main force of the revolution, and 
agriculture, along with industry, is one of the two major 
sectors of the national economy. Finding solution to the rural 
question is a long-drawn-out, very complex and difficult task 
because of the social and economic characteristics of rural 
communities and their age-long backwardness. As historical 
experience shows, success in the revolution and construction 
depends largely on how the rural question is resolved in each 
stage of the developing revolution. 
  Ever since the initial period of building a new society 
after 
liberation, our party has always paid a deep attention to the 
rural question. In each stage and in each period of the 
development of the revolution, our party has put forward a 
correct line and policy on the rural question from the 
standpoint of chuche and carried them out. As a result, it has 
been successful in finding a smooth solution to the rural 
question without committing any deviation. 
  The completion of agricultural cooperativization on 
socialist 
lines and the victory of the socialist revolution were great 
events which brought about a radical change in the peasants' 
social and economic position and in the development of 
agricultural productive forces. 
  The completion of the socialist cooperativization of 
agriculture is a historic turn in resolving the rural question, 
but it does not immediately mean the ultimate solution of the 
rural question. Because of the backwardness of rural 
communities, a vestige of the old society, the differences 
between urban and rural communities and between working class 
and peasantry remain even after agriculture has been 
cooperativized on socialist lines. So long as these differences 
exist, we cannot say that the rural question has been resolved 
completely. In order to find the ultimate solution to the rural 
question, it is necessary to go through another revolutionary 
stage after the socialist cooperativization of agriculture, a 
stage of revolution to assimilate the peasantry to the working 
class, put agriculture on an industrial basis and modernize it, 
bring cooperative ownership under all-people ownership and thus 
eliminate the differences between urban and rural communities 
and between working class and peasantry. 
  Speeding up the construction of socialist rural communities 
to solve the rural question ultimately is a link in the historic 
cause of achieving the complete victory of socialism; this is an 
important task of uninterrupted revolution to be carried out in 
the period of transition from capitalism to socialism. 
  After completing the socialist cooperativization of 
agriculture, our party advanced the ultimate solution of the 
rural question as a major strategic task in building socialism 
and published the socialist rural theses and has worked hard to 
put them into effect. 
  The theses on the socialist rural question in our country 
are 
our party's programme of building socialist rural communities, 
which is an embodiment of the chuche idea. The theses provide a 
scientific elucidation of the direction, basic principles and 
fundamental methods of solving the socialist rural question. 
Our party's rural theses are an absolutely correct guideline to 
the solution of the socialist rural question as well as the 
banner of struggle to safeguard the socialist principles in 
rural communities and achieve the complete victory of socialism. 
  The road traversed by our party and our people under the 
banner of the socialist rural theses for 30 years has been a 
road of an arduous struggle and yet a road of glorious victory. 
Formerly our country was a colonial agricultural land, so that 
even after agriculture was cooperativized the rural communities 
lagged far behind the urban communities in all fields of 
ideology, technology and culture, and the material and technical 
foundations of agriculture were very weak. Worse still, we have 
had to build socialist rural communities and socialism as a 
whole in the complex and acute situation in which the country is 
divided into North and South and the imperialists and 
reactionaries have been resorting to ceaseless manoeuvres 
against socialism and our Republic. All this has created 
immeasurable difficulties and obstacles to the struggle of our 
party and our people to implement the rural theses. Under the 
leadership of our party, our agricultural working people and all 
the other people have advanced vigorously along the road of 
building socialist rural communities as indicated by the rural 
theses without the slightest vacillation in spite of many 
difficulties and trials. 
  Our party's correct leadership, powerful urban support for 
the countryside, and the devoted struggle of the agricultural 
working people have resulted in a great success in the 
implementation of the socialist rural theses, and the looks of 
the rural areas have changed beyond recognition. 
  As a result of the vigorous ideological and cultural 
revolutions in the countryside, the agricultural working people 
in our country have become reliable masters of socialist rural 
communities who have attained a high level of ideological 
consciousness and creative ability. 
  Everyone of our agricultural working people, like the 
working 
class, leads a very valuable socio-political life, and a radical 
change has taken place in their ideological and mental features. 
Firmly equipped with the chuche idea, the revolutionary idea 
of our party, and united solidly behind the party, our 
agricultural working people loyally support the party's 
leadership and are displaying a high degree of revolutionary 
enthusiasm and creativity in the struggle to build socialist 
rural areas as elucidated by the rural theses. Thanks to our 
party's tireless ideological education and through their 
practical lives under socialism, they have rid themselves of the 
small-holder mentality of their former days, have learned 
collectivist spirit and nurtured it systematically. Collectivism 
has now become the predominant feature of their ideology and 
manner of life. The agricultural working people now highly 
display the beautiful communist trait of helping and leading 
each other forward, devoting themselves for the good of their 
society and collective on the principle of one for all and all 
for one. They work, live and fight on the collectivist 
principles, united single-heartedly behind the party and the 
leader and holding the socialist banner of chuche high. This is 
precisely the ideological and mental features of our 
agricultural working people. This high ideological level 
attained by our agricultural working people proves the brilliant 
victory of our party's policy on the ideological revolution; it 
is an epoch-making success in the transformation of the 
peasants' ideology. 
  The technical and cultural levels of our agricultural 
working 
people have risen very high, and the conditions for the cultural 
life of the rural inhabitants have greatly improved. The new 
generation which has received eleven-year compulsory education 
constitutes the main force in our rural communities, as in the 
urban communities. The standard of general knowledge of all the 
agricultural working people has reached that of senior middle 
school leavers or a higher level. They have acquired new 
technology; they do all kinds of farm work scientifically and 
technically by the use of modern technical means and in 
accordance with the chuche farming method. A great army of 
rural technicians and specialists has been prepared in 
accordance with our party's correct policy on the training of 
our own cadres, and they manage and operate the socialist rural 
economy excellently. Large numbers of modern houses and 
cultural and welfare facilities have been constructed in the 
rural communities, running water, bus and television services 
have been introduced, clinics have been developed into hospitals 
in the rural areas. As a result, the difference in the 
conditions for cultural life between urban and rural communities 
has been reduced considerably. Outmoded and backward notions 
and conventions have all disappeared from among our farmers, a 
sound and optimistic emotional life is flowering among them, and 
the socialist way of living is being established. 
  Man plays the decisive role in the transformation of nature 
and society, and agricultural working people are responsible for 
the construction of the socialist countryside. The fact that 
our agricultural working people have been trained into socialist 
working people with a high standard of political and ideological 
awareness as well as a high level of technical and cultural 
development is the most important guarantee for the complete 
solution of the rural question. 
  Under the powerful support of the chuche industry, a 
brilliant victory has been attained in the rural technical 
revolution. 
  The tasks of irrigation and electrification of agriculture 
were carried out in our country a long time ago. In recent 
years, great projects for harnessing nature, among them the 
construction of the west sea barrage, and the laying out of 800 
kilometres of canals in the western region, which are aimed at 
perfecting the irrigation of agriculture on a higher level, have 
been carried out successfully, so that our country can be proud 
of the powerful irrigation system in the eyes of the world. 
  The tasks of introducing machinery and chemicals in 
agriculture have also been implemented. A large number of 
tractors, lorries and various other kinds of modern farm 
machinery have been produced for the rural areas with the result 
that the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture has reached 
the level where all the major farm operations ranging from 
ploughing to threshing can be done with the help of machines. 
The amount of use of chemical fertilizers has greatly 
increased, the quality of their properties has improved, and a 
scientific system of manuring has been established. Highly 
effective insecticides, disinfectants, and herbicides have been 
produced and supplied in large quantities so as to protect farm 
crops better from insect pests and to kill weeds by chemical 
means. The independent and modern tractor and lorry production 
centres, farm machinery production centres, fertilizer factories 
and other chemical industry bases which have been established in 
our country provide a sure guarantee for the completion of the 
mechanization of agriculture and a sufficient use of chemicals 
for farming. 
  With the realization of irrigation, electrification and 
mechanization of agriculture, and with an extensive chemical 
application in farming the historic task of the rural technical 
revolution set forth in the socialist rural theses has been 
basically carried out. We have laid solid material and 
technical foundations for freeing the farmers from difficult and 
exhausting work and increasing agricultural production to a 
great extent by industrializing and modernizing agriculture with 
our own efforts and techniques. 
  As a result of the rural technical revolution and the full 
implementation of the chuche farming method, all branches of 
agriculture including grain production have developed rapidly, 
and last year, too, we reaped an unusually rich harvest despite 
the unfavourable weather conditions. 
  Under our people-centred socialist system the material and 
cultural standards of the farmers have radically improved 
through the implementation of the rural theses. Our cooperative 
farmers live in cosy modern houses built at state expense, free 
from worries about food and clothing in the modern socialist 
countryside that has been built up splendidly, and the standard 
of living of the farmers is improving with the passage of time 
like that of the workers and office employees. In our country 
the cooperative farmers also enjoy all the state benefits such 
as free compulsory education, free medical care and advanced 
social security. Our farmers who were oppressed, maltreated and 
poverty-stricken for centuries, now enjoy, along with the 
working class, a secure and happy life free from all worries as 
the full-fledged masters of the state and society. In addition 
to the change in the social and economic position of the 
farmers, the conditions needed for their material and cultural 
life have completely changed and the former looks of the 
backward old country areas disappeared long ago. 
  As a result of the energetic promotion of the ideological, 
technical and cultural revolutions in the rural communities and 
thanks to effective guidance and assistance given by the party 
and the state to the countryside, our socialist agricultural 
system has been consolidated still further. 
  A chuche-oriented system of agricultural guidance, the major 
component of which is the county cooperative farm management 
committee, has been firmly set up, its function and role has 
been enhanced and the level of the management of cooperative 
farms has been brought closer to the advanced level of 
industrial management. The state's effective material and 
technical assistance to the agricultural cooperative economy has 
strengthened the productive ties between industry and 
agriculture, organically linked public ownership and cooperative 
ownership and enabled the material and technical means of public 
ownership to hold an overwhelming proportion in agricultural 
production. This shows that our agricultural cooperative 
economy has been consolidated and developed still more and that 
the conditions needed for gradually turning the cooperative 
farms into those under all-people ownership are maturing. 
  Socialism has now struck deep roots in our countryside and 
become inseparable from the destiny of our agricultural working 
people, who hold the socialist agricultural system as dear as 
their own lives. Our agricultural system is a chuche-orientated 
socialist agricultural system, which develops on collectivist 
principles, and under which the agricultural workers are the 
masters of production and management, public ownership and 
cooperative ownership are closely combined, and the state takes 
responsible care of the production and management activities of 
the cooperative farms and the lives of the cooperative farmers. 
Our socialist agricultural system is the most advanced system; 
it not only provides an independent and creative life for the 
farming population but also facilitates the assimilation of the 
farmers to the working class, the development of agriculture 
into an industrial process and a gradual and smooth conversion 
of cooperative ownership to all-people ownership. Under the 
banner of the socialist rural theses, our socialist agricultural 
system clearly shows its superiority and unbreakable vitality, 
and opens up a bright future for socialist rural construction 
and an avenue for the ultimate solution of the rural question. 
  Through their own experience in the struggle and life, our 
cooperative farmers and all the other agricultural working 
people are firmly convinced that the road indicated by the 
socialist rural theses, the road to socialism alone, is the road 
to a genuine life and happiness and to victory and glory. They 
are working hard to defend the gains of socialism they have 
already won and develop them still further. 
  The road of capitalism leads the rural workers to 
degradation 
and the country areas to backwardness. In capitalist society, 
owing to its inherent law, the rural workers cannot prevent 
their differentiation, and the overwhelming majority of them 
cannot free themselves from rightlessness and poverty. The 
historical lesson of building socialism clearly shows that in 
the country areas, too, defence of socialism means victory and 
its abandonment means death. 
  We have won a decisive victory in our efforts to implement 
the socialist rural theses, and the building of socialist 
countryside in our country is entering a new stage of its 
development. The main task in the solution of the socialist 
rural question is to eliminate the ideological, technical and 
cultural backwardness of the rural communities in comparison 
with the towns. We have solved the basic problem in the 
building of socialist countryside by pressing ahead with the 
ideological, technical and cultural revolutions in the 
countryside and achieving remarkable successes in these fields; 
we are on a high peak which affords the prospect of ultimate 
solution of the rural question. If we consolidate the position 
we have already taken up and launch a new battle by making more 
strenuous efforts, we will win a historic victory in the 
solution of the rural question, the most difficult question in 
the building of socialism. 
  We are now faced with the honourable task of finally 
solving the rural question by following up the success we have 
achieved in our efforts to implement the socialist rural theses. 
  Whether we finally solve the rural question under socialism 
or not is an important matter which affects the future of 
socialism. It is only when we ultimately solve the rural 
question by accelerating the building of socialist countryside 
that we will be able to achieve the complete victory of 
socialism, display its superiority and indestructibility and 
increase its attraction. It is a solemn duty we have assumed to 
the present times and history to solve the rural question 
successfully in our country which, under the socialist banner of 
chuche, is defending and developing the socialism of our own 
style. 
  Today our party and our people are struggling to build 
socialism in the most complex internal and external situation 
and in a sharp confrontation with our enemies. We have to carry 
out the task for the high stage of socialist rural construction 
in a grave situation and push our way along an untrodden path by 
overcoming all the difficulties and trials we will encounter in 
solving the rural question. 
  As long as we are led by the great party and have the heroic 
people who are solidly united behind the party in mind and 
purpose as well as the people-centred socialist system of our 
own style and a powerful independent national economy with the 
chuche industry as the mainstay, we will unfailingly carry out 
this difficult and yet honourable task with credit. Upholding 
the banner of the socialist rural theses, all the agricultural 
officials and farming population must energetically promote the 
building of socialist countryside, full of confidence. Our 
working class and all the other working people throughout the 
country must turn out in the sacred cause of solving the rural 
question ultimately by carrying out the rural theses. 
  We must further develop the ideological and cultural 
revolutions in depth to meet the requirements of the new, 
advanced stage of socialist rural construction. 
  It is our party's consistent line of building socialism to 
give precedence to the work of capturing the ideological 
fortress while giving a strong impetus to the struggle to take 
both the ideological and material fortresses. It is only when 
we prepare our farming population more firmly in terms of their 
ideological and mental qualities, technical and cultural 
standards as required by socialism that we can find ultimate 
solution to the rural question. Our task is to develop the 
ideological and cultural revolutions in greater depth in the 
rural communities and definitely raise the ideological, 
technical and cultural levels of the farmers to those of the 
working class and completely eliminate the ideological and 
cultural backwardness of the countryside. 
  It is difficult to transform the ideology of the farmers and 
revolutionize them and assimilate them to the working class. 
Selfishness lingering in the minds of the farmers is very 
conservative and obstinate. It cannot be eliminated easily in a 
short time. Moreover, in view of the imperialists' ceaseless 
attempt to blow the wind of libertarianism into our ranks, we 
must not slacken ideological work even for a moment. Experience 
shows that if the ideological revolution is neglected in 
socialist society, it will be impossible not only to consolidate 
and develop the socialist system but also to defend the gains of 
the revolution that have already been attained, because outmoded 
ideas will revive and the ideology of the working people will 
become paralysed. When the new generation which has not 
experienced the trials of the revolution has emerged as the 
master of socialist construction and people enjoy a prosperous 
life without any worries, and especially when the imperialists 
resort to intensive manoeuvres to undermine socialism 
ideologically and culturally, we must further the ideological 
revolution and conduct ideological work among the working people 
in depth and substantially. This is the most important and 
essential requirement in the struggle to defend and accomplish 
the socialist cause. 
  By holding fast to the party's policy of ideological 
revolution and pressing ahead with ideological work among the 
agricultural working people, we must train them into 
revolutionaries, assimilate them to the working class and model 
them on socialism and the chuche idea. 
  The essential thing in the ideological revolution is to 
fully 
equip all the agricultural population with the chuche idea, the 
revolutionary idea of our party. The chuche idea is a 
revolutionary and scientific world outlook which the people, who 
strive to safeguard independence and realize it, should possess. 
Education in the chuche idea should be conducted with the main 
emphasis on education in the principles of the chuche idea and 
in breadth and depth in close combination with a variety of 
forms of ideological education including education in the party 
policy, the revolutionary traditions and socialist patriotism. 
  We must step up education in the chuche idea among the 
agricultural working people to ensure that they acquire a firm 
chuche-orientated revolutionary outlook on the world and are 
unfailingly loyal to the party and the revolution. We must 
ensure that they all strive through thick and thin to defend and 
carry out the party's lines and policies upholding the 
leadership of our party, and fight for the victory of the cause 
of socialism full of confidence and optimism. We must encourage 
the agricultural working people to perform their 
responsibilities and play their role as masters of the 
revolution and construction with a high degree of consciousness 
of being masters of the state, society and the socialist 
countryside. Along with this, we must prevent the bourgeois 
ideology and all other reactionary and counterrevolutionary 
ideas, alien to the chuche idea, from making inroads into our 
ranks. 
  In ideological work great efforts should be channelled into 
education in class consciousness and collectivism. 
  Class education is an important requirement for training the 
farmers into revolutionaries and assimilating them to the 
working class. We must equip the agricultural working people 
fully with the consciousness and revolutionary spirit of the 
working class so that they always adhere to the revolutionary 
principle and fight against imperialism and class enemies of all 
shades without compromise. In particular, we must pay close 
attention to intensifying education in class consciousness among 
the new generation in the countryside to enhance their class 
consciousness. 
  Socialism is the lifeblood of our people including the 
agricultural workers, and collectivism is the basis of the 
socialist society. Our agricultural working people, the masters 
of the socialist countryside, must rid themselves of the 
outdated ideological remnants of individualism and equip 
themselves fully with the spirit of collectivism. Education in 
collectivism must be intensified in the countryside to give them 
a clear understanding that their individual interests are 
derived from those of the society and the collective, and that 
the worth of their life and happiness consist in the development 
of their socialist motherland and the prosperity of the 
socialist countryside, so that they give full play to their 
patriotic enthusiasm and devotion in developing socialist rural 
communities. Our agricultural working people must live up to 
collectivism in and out of work and thus make it a rule and 
their habit to take part in communal labour voluntarily and 
honestly, treasure communal property and take care of it with an 
attitude befitting masters, and manage all farm work and 
activities of the collective economy assiduously and 
methodically. 
  The ideological work of transforming the ideas of the people 
must be pushed forward persistently with a correct methodology. 
  The method of influencing the people by popularizing 
positive 
examples is the most powerful method of mass education suited to 
the intrinsic nature of the socialist society. We must give 
wide publicity to the good conducts displayed among the working 
people so that a noble communist morality comes into full bloom 
in all families in the countryside as well as in all 
sub-workteams, workteams and farms. 
  We must continue to develop the three-revolution red flag 
movement and other mass movements in the countryside to ensure 
that ideological transformation becomes the concern of the 
agricultural working people themselves and that the mass 
movements have a greater effect on socialist rural construction. 
  We should intensify their life in the party and working 
people's organizations in order to give them ceaseless 
revolutionary education, train them ideologically and heighten 
their sense of organization and discipline, through the life in 
their organizations. 
  The first and foremost task of the rural cultural revolution 
at present is to improve the technical and cultural standards of 
the agricultural working people to meet the requirements of 
making the whole society intellectual. 
  Making the whole society intellectual is a strategic target 
of our party's policy of cultural revolution and a lawful 
requirement for the building of socialism and communism. We 
must develop the cultural revolution in depth in the rural 
communities and improve the technical and cultural 
qualifications of the agricultural working people. In this way 
we will carry out the new tasks in the socialist rural 
construction with success. 
  In order to raise the technical and cultural levels of 
agricultural working people, we must develop our most 
advantageous socialist educational system to suit the rural 
situation. We must modernize the rural schools and further 
improve their quality of education. We must strengthen the 
regular system of higher education and set up a large number of 
study-while-you-work institutions such as farm colleges and 
agricultural colleges so as to build up the ranks of 
agricultural technicians and agronomists systematically and push 
ahead with the work of making all agricultural workers 
intellectuals on a long-term basis. 
  Farms must equip their halls for the propagation of 
agricultural science and technology properly, run them on a 
regular basis, and step up technical study and the imparting of 
technical skills among farmers so that they can acquire the 
latest achievements of agricultural science and technology, 
operate modern technical means efficiently and master our 
party's chuche farming method. 
  An important task of the cultural revolution in the rural 
areas is to establish a cultural and hygienic practice in and 
out of work in the countryside and abolish the difference 
between urban and rural communities in the cultural conditions 
for the working people. 
  To raise the standard of clean and hygienic practice in 
production in the rural communities is very important in 
increasing agricultural production and establishing the habit of 
taking good care of communal property. All the farms must 
treasure the land, the main means of agricultural production, 
and cultivate it neatly, take good care of the tractors and 
various other farming equipment and materials and construct 
production facilities neatly and manage them with care. 
  A cultural and hygienic way of life must be established 
throughout the modern socialist countryside in keeping with its 
new features. Community centres at every ri and farm villages 
must be laid out neatly, roads managed carefully, dwelling 
houses and villages kept clean and neat, and a cultural and 
hygienic way of life developed. Mass culture and art must be 
developed and physical culture and sports promoted on a mass 
basis, all sorts of outmoded habits of life and asocialist 
expressions opposed, and a socialist way and tone of life 
established throughout the rural areas. 
  We must build a larger number of modern houses and cultural 
and welfare facilities in the rural areas. In order to 
eliminate the difference between urban and rural communities in 
living conditions, it is essential to introduce electrification, 
running water and bus services, central-heating and gas systems 
in the rural areas. To follow up the success in 
electrification, water supply and bus service to complete them 
at a higher level in the rural areas, and introduce 
central-heating and gas systems in the rural villages -- these 
are the five major tasks to be carried out within the next few 
years in eliminating the difference between urban and rural 
communities with regard to their living conditions. 
  We must step up health and hygienic service in the rural 
areas and improve the medical care of the agricultural 
population. We must equip the rural hospitals better and 
develop the doctors' area responsibility system, so as to raise 
the level of medical service. 
  We must consolidate and develop the successes achieved in 
the 
rural technical revolution. 
  The four major tasks of the rural technical revolution set 
by 
the socialist rural theses--irrigation, electrification, 
mechanization and an extensive use of chemical means--are of 
paramount importance in eliminating the backwardness of the 
countryside in the sphere of technology and in putting 
agriculture on an industrial and modern basis. Irrigation, 
electrification, mechanisation and application of chemical means 
constitute the material and technical basis for modernized 
agriculture, and apart from them it would be impossible to 
effect industrialization and modernization of agriculture. We 
have fulfilled the four major tasks of the rural technical 
revolution by and large and thus achieved a remarkable progress 
in the struggle to put agriculture on an industrial and modern 
basis, and laid solid foundations for modern agriculture. Our 
task at the present stage is to follow up the success in the 
rural technical revolution to advance the industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture to a high level. 
  We must, first of all, consolidate the success achieved in 
irrigation, electrification, mechanization and chemical 
application so that their effectiveness can be displayed to the 
full. Thanks to the rural technical revolution, our countryside 
has been equipped with an enormous amount of material and 
technical means that serve agricultural production. To take 
good care of them and make an effective use of them is now the 
first and foremost task in promoting the industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture. In the field of irrigation it is 
necessary to maintain in a good state of repair and reinforce 
the irrigation facilities, structures for water conservation, 
reservoirs, canals and all other means of irrigation on a 
planned basis and conserve water scientifically and technically, 
so that damages from whatever drought and flood can be prevented 
and the water problem solved completely in farming. We must 
regularly repair and maintain tractors and other modern farm 
machines, effectively use them and improve the system of 
supplying electricity to rural areas. We must supply a good 
assortment of chemical fertilizers, chemicals and herbicides to 
meet their demands and set up a scientific fertilizing system to 
improve the efficacy of fertilizers. We must ensure that all 
the valuable successes achieved in the rural technical 
revolution by the joint efforts and wisdom of our working class, 
cooperative farmers and all the other people and on the strength 
of self-reliance and fortitude under the leadership of the 
party, prove very effective and bear fruit in the development of 
our socialist rural economy. 
  We must raise the level of industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture steadily by further expanding and 
developing the successes registered in the technical revolution 
in the rural areas. 
  Since irrigation and electrification have been completed at 
a 
high level, we must concentrate our efforts on expanding and 
developing the successes in mechanization and chemical 
application. It is only when we develop the comprehensive 
mechanization of agriculture and the application of chemical 
means to the rural economy onto a high level that we can carry 
out successfully the political and economic tasks of the rural 
technical revolution aimed at freeing the agricultural workers 
from backbreaking labour and augmenting agricultural production 
continuously. Only when we develop mechanical techniques in the 
countryside and supply larger numbers of various machines to the 
rural areas, can we consolidate the success achieved in 
irrigation, perfect the irrigation system further and follow up 
the success in electrification. We must mechanize all farm work 
ranging from the major operations to auxiliary jobs in 
crop-raising; we must also work hard to effect mechanization in 
fruit-growing and other branches of the rural economy. It is 
necessary to use chemicals to kill weeds in all paddy and 
non-paddy fields, prevent damage by all insect pests and raise 
the per-hectare crop yields. On the basis of our developing 
chuche-based industry, we must invent and manufacture larger 
numbers of tractors and lorries, and other kinds of effective, 
modern farm machines suited to our countryside and supply them 
to the rural areas, and develop new varieties of effective 
chemical fertilizers and chemicals and produce them for the 
countryside. 
  An important task in consolidating and developing the 
success 
scored in the rural technical revolution is to complete the 
realignment of land and to solve the problem of fuel needed for 
the mechanization of the rural economy. To complete land 
realignment is a gigantic project to transform the surface of 
the land, widen the area of farm land and raise the level of 
mechanization of the rural economy. The people in the rural 
economy must work out annual plans for land realignment and 
concentrate machines and other technical means and manpower on 
large-scale land realignment so as to change small plots of 
paddy fields and slopping fields in a short period into 
large-sized standardized fields for mechanized farming. We must 
set up solid bases for the production of such fuel substitutes 
as methane gas or chip-briquettes in county towns and ri of the 
countryside and produce large quantities of fuel substitutes and 
use them widely for tractors, lorries and various other farm 
machines. 
  We must develop agricultural science and adopt its success 
widely, and implement the chuche farming method of our party 
thoroughly to make agricultural production more scientific and 
intensive. 
  We must establish solid agricultural research institutes and 
intensify research into agriculture, and step up the green 
revolution. In particular, we must, on the basis of the success 
in cell engineering, gene-engineering and other spheres of 
modern biology, obtain good, high-yielding seeds and develop the 
techniques of crop raising and livestock breeding. 
  The chuche farming method created by our party is a 
scientific and technical method of farming suited to the 
climatic and soil conditions of our country and the biological 
characteristics of crops; it is a method of growing farm crops 
in a highly intensive way on the basis of modern science and 
technology. Drawing on the success in agricultural science and 
technology, we must develop and enrich the chuche farming method 
and, in accordance with it, do all farm work in a scientific and 
technical manner. 
  We must put agriculture on an industrial and modern basis 
and 
develop farming methods and the system of crop growing so as to 
eliminate the distinctions between industrial labour and 
agricultural labour gradually and raise the efficiency of 
agricultural labour decisively. In future, we must ensure that 
a farmer manages at least ten hectares of paddy and non-paddy 
fields. 
  On the basis of success achieved in the rural technical 
revolution and the development of agricultural science and 
technology, we must continue to increase agricultural production. 
  Grain production is the basic element in farming. Our party 
has already set the target of producing 15 million tons of 
grain. We must increase the per-hectare yield of rice and maize 
to at least eight tons each in all areas and on all farms in the 
near future, and then to ten tons or more. In addition, we must 
reclaim tideland energetically, protect farm land and obtain new 
land, so as to expand the area under cultivation. Thus, we will 
fulfil and overfulfil the target of grain production set by the 
party in the near future. 
  We must develop all branches of agriculture including 
stockbreeding, fruit-growing and silkworm-raising as well as 
grain production to find a better solution to the problem of 
food for the people and supply an adequate amount of raw 
materials from agriculture to meet the demands of industry. 
  Assistance to the rural areas must be further stepped up in 
keeping with the development of socialist rural construction 
onto a new high. 
  Guidance of the working class to the peasantry, industry's 
assistance to agriculture and the support given by the towns to 
the countryside are the intrinsic requirements of the socialist 
society and a fundamental principle of solving the socialist 
rural question put forward in the rural theses. Under socialism 
assistance to the rural areas should be strengthened without 
letup until the countryside reaches the level of the town in all 
aspects. We must further intensify assistance to the rural 
areas in political, economic, cultural and other fields in 
accordance with the present requirement of socialist rural 
construction. 
  It is the historical mission of the working class not only 
to 
free the farmers from exploitation and oppression by leading 
them along the road of socialism but also to eliminate the 
distinctions between working class and peasantry and build a 
classless society by training them into revolutionaries and 
assimilating them to the working class. We must ensure that the 
working class further improve their revolutionary character, 
sense of organization and cultural refinement to set an 
excellent example in transforming the peasantry after the 
revolutionary and working-class pattern and enhance their 
leading role in socialist rural construction. 
  What is important in socialist rural construction at present 
is to intensify industry's material and technical assistance to 
agriculture. In socialist society agricultural productive 
forces develop in the wake of industrial productive forces, and 
industry's material and technical assistance is the prerequisite 
for putting agriculture on an industrial and modern footing. We 
must increase the capabilities of the chuche-oriented industry 
and further develop the industrial branches directly serving 
agriculture, particularly those which produce tractors, lorries 
and other modern farm machines and chemical fertilizers, so that 
our industry vigorously promotes the industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture. All the industrial sectors must 
give active material and technical assistance to agriculture as 
required by the agriculture-first policy of our party and on a 
preferential basis produce the fuel, power, equipment and 
materials needed for agricultural production and rural 
construction. 
  Commodity supply for the rural communities should be 
improved. Only when an adequate amount of industrial goods is 
turned out and supplied to meet the demands of the countryside, 
can the economic ties between towns and countryside be fully 
guaranteed, the farmers' standard of living be systematically 
improved and their zeal for production be further heightened 
through the correct implementation of the socialist principle of 
distribution in the countryside. We must step up the revolution 
in light industry, produce a wide variety and larger quantities 
of industrial goods for the countryside to fill the rural shops 
with high-quality household utensils and articles for cultural 
use as well as daily necessities so that the rural population 
can buy at any time whatever goods they need. 
  In addition, it is important to fix the prices of industrial 
products supplied to the countryside and the purchasing prices 
of agricultural products reasonably. In our country the state 
uniformly fixes the prices of industrial products and the 
purchasing prices of agricultural products and these prices 
serve as an important economic lever that ensures the production 
and commercial ties between towns and countryside in a planned 
way and urban support for the countryside. We must properly fix 
and apply the prices of industrial products and the purchasing 
prices of agricultural products on the principle of 
strengthening industry's assistance to agriculture and urban 
support for the countryside to ensure a balanced development of 
industry and agriculture and an equitable improvement of the 
living standards of workers and farmers. 
  We must firmly adhere to the principle of giving assistance 
to the countryside, always pay close attention to the 
development of agriculture and the lives of the agricultural 
workers, accelerate the industrialization and modernization of 
agriculture on the basis of industrial development and take 
positive state and social measures to provide the farmers as 
well as the workers with better working and living conditions. 
  In order to eliminate the distinctions between towns and 
countryside and finally solve the rural question, we must, on 
the strength of the success in the ideological, technical and 
cultural revolutions, eliminate the distinctions in the standard 
of economic management between industry and agriculture, and 
turn cooperative property in the countryside gradually into 
all-people property. 
  The basic method of eliminating the distinctions in the 
standard of economic management between industry and agriculture 
is to bring the management method of the agricultural 
cooperative economy close to the advanced enterprise management 
method of industry as indicated by the rural theses. 
  After the cooperativization of agriculture in the 
countryside, our party established the chuche-orientated system 
of agricultural guidance centring on the county cooperative farm 
management committee, and ever since it has steadily improved 
its guidance and management of the socialist rural economy. The 
reality of our rural communities clearly shows that the system 
of agricultural guidance established by our party is the most 
effective way of giving industrial guidance and the state's 
material and technical assistance to the cooperative rural 
economy. 
  We must build up the county cooperative farm management 
committee and other agricultural guidance organs in keeping with 
the requirement of the developing situation and enhance their 
functions and role to improve the guidance and management of the 
rural economy. 
  Now that the material and technical foundations of the rural 
economy have been consolidated incomparably and the level of 
industrialization and modernization of agriculture is rising 
every day, we must improve technical guidance to agricultural 
production decisively. The technical guidance of agricultural 
production is the main task of the county cooperative farm 
management committee which gives direct guidance to the 
production and management activities of cooperative farms in the 
field. The management committee must establish a well-organized 
system of technical guidance, give scientific and technical 
guidance to all the processes of agricultural production as 
required by the chuche farming method and ensure that the 
cooperative farms make effective use of the modern farming 
machines and farming materials. The management committee must 
also build up the state enterprises that serve the rural 
cooperative economy and manage them skilfully so that they play 
a greater role in the agricultural production of cooperative 
farms and realize the state's material and technical assistance 
effectively. 
  In the guidance and management of the rural economy, it is 
necessary to raise the level of planning and ensure the economic 
effectiveness of production. The state planning institutions 
and the agricultural guidance organs must draw up a dynamic and 
feasible agricultural production plan and assess its 
implementation substantially so that the agricultural workers 
display a high sense of responsibility and great enthusiasm for 
carrying out the plan. They must work out an accurate, 
well-coordinated plan of material supply and technical 
assistance for the rural economy, and supply all the farming 
equipment and materials punctually as planned. The agricultural 
sector must make strenuous efforts to save manpower to the 
maximum, make rational use of the farming equipment and 
materials and increase the economic effectiveness of production. 
  The management of cooperative farms must be improved. The 
cooperative farms must organize farm work rationally to suit the 
natural and geographical conditions and their specific farm 
situation and coordinate correctly the farming processes, the 
organization of labour and the utilization of the equipment and 
materials in a comprehensive manner so that all the farming 
operations are carried out qualitatively in the right season. 
The cooperative farms must manage manpower, equipment, 
materials and funds efficiently and observe the principle of 
democracy strictly in their management. 
  Cooperative farms must organize workteams and sub-workteams 
in a rational way and run them efficiently; they should also 
apply the workteam premium system and sub-workteam management 
system properly. A sub-workteam is a cell of communal labour and 
collective life; the sub-workteam management system is an 
excellent mode of production organization and management method 
which ensures that the farmers take a sincere part in production 
and management as masters with affection for the communal 
economy. The superiority of the system should be given full 
rein so as to improve the cooperative farms' production and 
management steadily and cultivate the sense of collectivism 
among the farmers. 
  Cooperative ownership should be switched over to all-people 
ownership with success by consolidating and developing the 
agricultural cooperative economy. 
  The switchover is a historic event of completely 
transforming 
the farmers' socio-economic relationships. This is a great 
social change; nevertheless, unlike the switchover of private 
ownership to socialist ownership, this is a development of the 
lower stage of cooperative ownership to the higher stage of 
all-people ownership, in the framework of the same socialist 
ownership; this work must, to all intents and purposes, be 
carried out gradually in keeping with the maturity of all the 
conditions and possibilities. 
  The fundamental prerequisite for the switchover is to raise 
the level of ideological consciousness of the cooperative 
farmers and consolidate the material and technical foundations 
of the cooperative economy. A vigorous drive should be launched 
in socialist rural construction to capture the ideological and 
material fortresses and thus train the cooperative farmers into 
revolutionaries and assimilate them to the working class and put 
the rural economy on a high industrial and modern footing; only 
on this basis can cooperative ownership be elevated to 
all-people ownership. If cooperative property is made the 
property of the entire people too hastily without sufficient 
ideological, material and technical preparations, it will give 
rise to an unhealthy tendency to eat the bread of idleness in 
the countryside, decrease agricultural production and cause a 
great hindrance to the overall construction of socialism. We 
have been creating favourable conditions for switching 
cooperative ownership over to all-people ownership in the future 
by carrying out the ideological, technical and cultural 
revolutions in the countryside while closely combining the two 
forms of ownership and steadily improving the leading role of 
all-people ownership in conformity with the basic principles of 
solving the socialist rural question, the principles elucidated 
in the rural theses. 
  We must consolidate and develop the success already 
achieved in socialist rural construction and efficiently perform 
the task of switching cooperative ownership over to all-people 
ownership without any deviations. 
  Cooperative farms should be converted into all-people 
property with the county as a unit. In our country the county 
is the base for linking the towns with the countryside in all 
spheres of politics, the economy and culture and serves as the 
basic unit for the direct guidance and management of the rural 
economy. A county has the farm machine stations, farm implement 
factories, irrigation administration offices and other state 
enterprises which serve the rural economy, and equipment and 
farming materials are supplied to cooperative farms with the 
county as a unit. Therefore, cooperative ownership must be 
transformed into all-people ownership with the county as a unit. 
Even after cooperative farms are converted into the state farms 
of all-people ownership, the rural economy must be developed on 
a county basis. 
  The forms and methods of converting cooperative property 
into 
all-people property, too, must accord with the socialist rural 
economic system of our country and the specific situation in our 
rural communities. 
  Since a well-organized agricultural guidance and management 
system has been established with the county as a unit in our 
country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert 
cooperative farms in the county into state farms under 
all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified 
guidance and management. This will make it possible to manage 
satisfactorily the farms which have come under all-people 
ownership, using and strengthening further the comprehensive 
guidance and management system of the rural economy and the 
material and technical means that serve agriculture, which have 
already been prepared in counties. In this case, the county 
cooperative farm management committee may be changed into a 
state farm management committee, an agricultural guidance body, 
or into an agricultural complex. If the management committee is 
transformed into an agricultural complex rather than an 
agricultural guidance body, this will enhance its sense of 
responsibility and role in agricultural production and improve 
its industrial direction of the farms. 
  When the county cooperative farm management committee is 
transformed into an agricultural complex, the state enterprises 
that serve agriculture and state farms will come under its 
jurisdiction, and both the complex and the enterprises and farms 
under it must operate by the self-balancing system and they all 
will become involved in the dual self-balancing system. We have 
introduced the self-balancing system with the county as a unit 
in Sukchon County to set an example in anticipation of the 
transformation of cooperative property into all-people property. 
  When converting cooperative farms into the state farms under 
all- people ownership, we should somewhat enlarge the size of 
farms by their reasonable merger and adjustment so as to make 
effective use of land, irrigation facilities, tractors and other 
production means. 
  In a county of moderate size where the level of management 
of 
the county cooperative farm management committee and cooperative 
farms is high, all the cooperative farms and the state 
enterprises that serve agriculture in that county may be merged 
into a state farm with the former cooperative farms made its 
branch farms and the former enterprises its workshops. If this 
is done, the cooperative farms and agricultural enterprises in 
the county will come under a general state farm and may 
facilitate the effective use of manpower, land, equipment and 
materials. 
  The general farms, which have been organized as model units 
in Sonbong and some other counties through the merger of not 
only agriculture but also local industry, goods distribution, 
education, culture, health care and all other local 
administrative and economic functions, must continue to operate, 
further improving their management. With the development of the 
farms of all-people ownership and with the accumulation of 
experience in the operation of state farms of different forms, 
the number of such general farms may be increased. 
  Even after cooperative ownership is converted into 
all-people 
ownership, all state farms should be managed under the self- 
balancing system and the socialist principle of distribution 
should be thoroughly implemented. This is an important 
requirement for managing the state farms of all-people ownership 
rationally and stimulating the farmers' productive enthusiasm to 
give full play to the advantages of state farms. 
  We must define correct forms and methods of transforming 
cooperative ownership into all-people ownership, by drawing on 
the advantages of the socialist agricultural system of our style 
and on the success in the building of the socialist countryside, 
in such a way as to preserve the existing guidance and 
management system of agriculture without changing it too much 
and by taking each local situation into careful consideration. 
The work of converting cooperative ownership into all-people 
ownership should be started on a trial basis in some counties 
where all conditions including the ideological level of farmers 
and the material and technical foundations of the rural economy 
have fully matured, and then should be extended to other 
counties gradually as experience accumulates. This will enable 
us to avoid possible deviations and loss in the process of 
transforming cooperative ownership into all-people ownership, 
carry out this task smoothly and further develop the rural 
economy without any turns and twists. 
  Because cooperative farms are to be switched over to state 
farms of all-people property on a county basis, the county will, 
in the future, too, play an important role as the base which 
links town and countryside and as an all-embracing unit of 
guidance and management to the rural economy. Therefore, it is 
necessary to build up the county, develop local industry 
further, and improve education, culture, health care and public 
welfare. The county must expand and strengthen the enterprises 
and the production establishments serving the rural economy to 
speed up the development of agriculture. All the counties must 
make it their major task to develop agricultural production and 
improve the living standard of the rural population and must 
push forward the construction of socialist countryside. 
  The complete conversion of cooperative property into 
all-people property will establish an undivided sway of 
all-people property in our country. We must brilliantly fulfil 
the historic tasks of eliminating the distinctions between urban 
and rural communities, between working class and peasantry, of 
solving the rural question ultimately and realizing a classless 
society, by advancing along the road indicated by the socialist 
rural theses, along the road of our socialism. 
  In order to solve the rural question successfully, the party 
must strengthen its guidance of socialist rural construction. 
  Party leadership is the lifeline of socialist rural 
construction and the building of socialism as a whole. Without 
party leadership, it would be impossible to solve the difficult 
and complex problems of socialist rural construction with 
success. 
  The party organizations in the agricultural sector must 
strengthen organizational and political work and ensure that all 
the officials and working people of the rural economy accelerate 
socialist rural construction under the leadership of the party. 
Party organizations and party officials must pay deep attention 
to the rural question, mobilize the party's effort to give a 
strong impetus to rural work and encourage the masses to give 
active assistance to the countryside. 
  It is important to enhance the role of the county party 
committee in improving party guidance to the rural economy. 
  The county party committee is the lowest leadership unit of 
our party, and it must work mainly among the rural communities. 
Our party's policy is amplified by the county party committee 
to suit the specific local situation and implemented under it 
guidance. Enhancing the role of the county party committee is an 
important factor for success in the building of the socialist 
countryside. 
  The county party committee must put great efforts into 
implementing the party's rural policy. It must hold fast to the 
party's rural policy and define the direction and methods of its 
implementation correctly, intensify political work among the 
masses as required by the chongsanri spirit and chongsanri 
method, and vigorously mobilize them in the implementation of 
party policy. It must encourage the officials of the county 
cooperative farm management committee and other administrative 
and economic bodies to do all work of socialist rural 
construction in a responsible manner by displaying a high 
revolutionary spirit, party spirit, working- class spirit and 
the spirit of service to the people, true to the party's rural 
policy. 
  It is now an important task of the county party committee to 
strengthen the rural bulwark of socialism politically, 
ideologically and from the class point of view. The county 
party committee must intensify party work, work among the 
people, in the countryside and rally the broad masses more 
closely behind the party by thoroughly implementing the mass 
line of the party, so that they share life and death and destiny 
with the party and support party leadership loyally. The county 
party committee must strengthen the ri party committees and 
rural party cells and help and lead all rural party 
organizations to perform their functions and role properly. 
  The struggle of our party and our people to build the 
socialist countryside is a glorious and fruitful struggle. We 
must continue to innovate and advance to speed up the 
development of the socialist countryside and hasten the complete 
victory of socialism. 
  I believe that you who are present at the national 
agricultural conference and all the agricultural working people 
throughout the country will bring about a new revolutionary 
change in socialist rural construction by working hard, holding 
aloft the banner of the socialist rural theses.

<F P=106> ["Report by Premier Kang Song-san at National Agricultural </F>
Conference" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- Kang Song-san, 
Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' 
Party of Korea [WPK] and premier of the Administration Council, 
made a report "on the great victory of the socialist rural 
theses and future tasks" at the national agricultural 
conference which opened here today with a large attendance. 
  The reporter said that the publication of "Theses on the 
Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" authored by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song 30 years ago was an event of 
historical significance in achieving the victory of the chuche 
cause of socialism and the eternal prosperity of the country 
and the people. In the period, he noted, our party and people 
have made big strides along the road shown by the theses, 
bringing about phenomenal changes in all spheres of socialist 
rural construction. 
  He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "In the `Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our 
Country' our party illuminated the basic principles and ways for 
finding the final solution to the peasant and agricultural 
questions after the establishment of the socialist system, and 
roused the whole party, the whole country and the entire people 
to implement them." 
  The rural theses are a great programme of socialist rural 
construction which was worked out on the basis of the 
man-centred chuche idea and a classical work which was the first 
in history to give correct answers to all theoretical and 
practical questions arising in the solution of the rural 
question and break a new ground in the development of the 
revolutionary idea of the working class. The rural theses of our 
party opened a broad road for revolutionizing the peasants and 
assimilating them to the working class, industrializing and 
modernizing agriculture to elevate the agricultural productive 
forces to a high degree and building the socialist countryside, 
affluent and civilized, where the agricultural working people 
will enjoy an independent and creative life to the full. 
  According to the report, first of all, remoulding of man has 
been successfully pushed ahead in the countryside and the 
ideological and cultural life of the agricultural working people 
improved in all aspects through the vigorous efforts to carry 
the theses into practice. 
  Ideological education for revolutionizing and 
working-classizing the peasantry was intensified in the course 
of fulfilling the task to give priority to the ideological 
revolution laid down in the rural theses, with the result that 
all our agricultural working people have been firmly armed with 
the socialist idea of chuche, the revolutionary idea of our 
party, and the chuche idea has become predominant in rural 
communities. The great changes in the ideological and moral 
traits and manner of work of our peasants are the most precious 
success achieved in our efforts to implement the theses, which 
is incomparable even to millions of tons of rice. 
  As a result of the active cultural revolution along with the 
ideological revolution, our peasants have grown to be more 
powerful beings and their cultural living conditions have been 
fundamentally improved. 
  Regular universities and colleges of agriculture and such 
study-while-working centres for training technical personnel as 
farm colleges have been firmly built up in each province, at 
which a large number of agro-technicians and experts are being 
trained. Under the popular policy of our party, tap water, bus, 
wire radio and television services have been introduced, clinics 
developed into hospitals and cosy modern dwelling houses built 
in the rural areas. Newspapers, magazines and various books find 
their way to each peasant household. Thus our countryside has 
turned into a prospering modern socialist countryside good to 
live and work in, which is little different from towns. 
  With the successful fulfilment of the four major tasks of 
the 
rural technical revolution--irrigation, electrification, 
mechanization and an extensive chemical application--through the 
energetic efforts to implement the rural theses, solid material 
and technical foundations of socialism have been laid in the 
countryside and, on this basis, the peasants are satisfactorily 
provided with independent and creative living conditions. 
  As a result of the completion of irrigation and 
electrification of agriculture on a high level, our country has 
a most advanced and powerful irrigation system under which rich 
and stable harvest is reaped in any weather, and the yearly 
electricity consumption in the rural areas has increased 8.6 
times the 1963 figure. 
  Over the past 30 years the number of the tractors and 
lorries 
engaged in agriculture has increased respectively six and five 
times, with the result that the comprehensive mechanization of 
agriculture in the country is reaching a high level where all 
categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to sowing, 
rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, thrashing and carriage 
are done with the help of machines. 
  An extensive use of chemicals in farming has been realized 
to 
sharply increase the supply of chemical fertilizers. Now, in 
our country the amount of chemical fertilizers applied to each 
hectare of paddy and non-paddy fields has reached more than two 
tons, far surpassing the target set by the theses, and the 
quality of their properties has improved with the rational 
combination of various kinds of them. 
  A great progress has been made in the transformation of 
social relations in the countryside in conformity with the 
requirements of socialism. 
  Through the efforts to give full play to the advantages of 
the new agricultural guidance system, the major component of 
which is the county cooperative farm management committee, such 
a difficult and complex problem as guiding and managing the 
rural economy has been successfully solved on the principle of 
collectivism in conformity with the nature of socialism and 
industrial guidance and the state's material and technical 
assistance strengthened through the committee. 
  As a result, the advanced industrial management and 
production culture have gained a wide scope in the rural 
communities and distinctions between industry and agriculture in 
industrial management and ownership of the means of production 
are diminishing fast. 
  Over the past 30 years since the publication of the rural 
theses, grain production has jumped 1.9 times, of which rice 1.8 
and maize 2.2. Our agriculture reaped an unusually rich harvest 
last year, the year before the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the rural theses, by effecting a new upsurge, 
despite a long spell of frost and abnormal low temperature. The 
principle of the right crop on the right soil and in the right 
time and an intensive farming method based on tending each 
plant with care have been applied on a full scale and the 
demands of the chuche farming method for each stage and process 
of farming thoroughly met, with the result that we now gather in 
8,9,10, and even 15 tons of rice and maize per hectare from 
fields which yielded two or three tons in the past. 
  With the fast progress of ideological, technical and 
cultural 
revolutions in the countryside, the level of ideological 
consciousness of the peasants and their technical and cultural 
standards have been enhanced, the material and technical 
foundations of agriculture consolidated and the gaps between 
industry and agriculture and between towns and rural areas 
narrowed in all spheres, creating more satisfactory conditions 
for converting cooperative property into all-people property. 
  The socialist rural economic system in our country is 
neither 
an invention of an alien nor an imitation of other's. It is a 
most independent and popular system of the rural economy which 
our people, notably the agricultural working people, have 
established for themselves to suit their faith and demand by 
applying the rural theses under the leadership of the party. 
And it is a most solid and viable system which is advancing 
confidently towards socialism on the basis of collectivism. 
  The 30 years of efforts for building the socialist 
countryside and all the historical gains in this course, the 
reporter said, prove that "Theses on the Socialist Rural 
Question in Our Country" authored by the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song shows the only correct guideline for clearing away 
the leftovers of old society in the rural areas after the 
establishment of the socialist system and finally solving the 
rural question, and that only under the wise leadership of the 
party and the leader is it possible to successfully accomplish 
the cause of the socialist rural construction without any 
deviation and turns and twists and well build an ideal socialist 
society of chuche desired by the entire people. 
  We can say with pride and honor that we have created a model 
of socialist rural construction by successfully solving the 
peasant and agricultural questions, the difficult and intricate 
problems in building socialism, from an independent stand under 
the wise guidance of the party and the leader, he noted. 
  Outlining tasks to give full play to the advantages of the 
socialist agricultural system of chuche, he said: We should, as 
in the past, so in the future, too, invariably advance along the 
road of continued revolution indicated by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song in the theses. 
  He further said: 
  We must continue to push ahead with the ideological 
revolution in the countryside so as to more closely unite all 
the agricultural working people behind the party and the leader, 
strengthen the singlehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks 
and rear all of them better to be ardent revolutionaries 
faithful to the cause of socialism. 
  An important task in the ideological revolution at present 
is 
to ensure that all the agricultural working people have a firm 
faith and will for the victory of the cause of socialism and 
highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
strenuous efforts. 
  While consolidating the achievements in irrigation, 
electrification and mechanization of agriculture and an 
extensive use of chemicals in farming, we must increase the 
state investment in agriculture and further strengthen the 
material and technical foundations to bring another epochal 
change in agricultural production. 
  And we should continuously push on the cultural revolution 
in 
the rural areas to raise the level of technical and cultural 
standard of the agricultural working people and build a more 
cultured countryside. 
  The industrial guidance of agricultural production must be 
strengthened in conformity with the realistic demand of the 
developing rural economy, the leadership of all- people property 
over cooperative property constantly enhanced and measures taken 
for gradually converting the cooperative farms into farms of 
all-people ownership in order to establish the single ownership 
of the whole people in future. 
  The internal and external situation of our revolution 
remains 
grim and complex and our people's struggle is difficult and 
arduous, but no imperialist reactionary force can bring into 
submission the Korean people who are advancing courageously with 
conviction of the validity of their cause or deprive our people 
and agricultural working people of their independent and 
creative life which they are enjoying in the most advantageous 
socialist society of chuche, the reporter concluded.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] sent a 
congratulatory message to the national agricultural conference 
which opened in Pyongyang today with a large attendance. 
  The message said the conference which is open in a 
significant year in which falls the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the socialist rural theses is a historical 
conference which will proudly review the great victory in 
brilliantly fulfilling the tasks set by the rural theses and 
display the validity of the theses and the vitality of the 
socialist agricultural system in our country and a glorious 
conference which will demonstrate the invincibility of our-style 
socialism. 
  With the chuche-based socialist rural theses carried into 
reality under the wise guidance of the party and the leader, a 
brilliant example has been set in the solution of the rural 
question and a change of the century has taken place in our 
countryside, the message noted, and stated: 
  With the ideological revolution carried on vigorously in the 
countryside, our agricultural working people are being prepared 
to be dependable chuche-type revolutionaries who always breathe 
and struggle as intended by the party, regarding loyalty to the 
party and the leader as their life and soul, and are honestly 
working for the country and the people, the society and the 
collective under the slogan "One for all and all for one!" 
  As a result of the successful implementation of the party's 
policy of the rural technical revolution, irrigation has been 
completed on a high level and electrification realized with 
success in the rural communities, and a great progress has been 
made in the mechanisation of agriculture and extensive use of 
chemicals, enabling the farmers to do farming easily and 
efficiently with the help of machines and chemicals. 
  And the chuche farming method has been strictly applied, 
with 
the result that agricultural production is rapidly developing on 
the basis of modern science and technique. And the vigorous 
rural cultural revolution has helped remarkably enhance the 
level of general knowledge and technical and cultural standard 
of the agricultural working people and turn our countryside into 
a cultured and affluent modern socialist rural areas. 
  With the constant improvement of the guidance and management 
of the rural economy and enhancement of the guiding role of 
all-people property over cooperative property, a great success 
has been made in eliminating the distinctions between towns and 
the countryside in the form of management and ownership. 
  The WPK Central Committee in the message noted that our 
agricultural working people in the past 30 years have made great 
contributions to the building of a new socialist life in the 
motherland and to the prosperity and development of the country 
and a greater happiness of the people with their devoted 
struggle and creative labour, cherishing in their hearts the 
firm faith in socialism, and highly estimated their feats in 
labour. 
  Calling upon the entire party members and working people in 
the agricultural domain to make redoubled efforts to effect a 
new upswing in rural construction and agricultural production in 
hearty response to "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural 
Question Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses", the 
historical letter sent by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
to the conference, the message elaborated on the tasks for this. 
  It said: The ideological revolution must be deepened, first 
of all, so as to push ahead with the work of arming the party 
members and other working people with the great chuche idea and 
the chuche-based idea of rural construction of the party and 
assimilating the farmers to the working class and 
revolutionizing them. And the technical revolution must be 
powerfully pressed ahead on a higher stage, to ensure that the 
material and technical foundations of agriculture are further 
consolidated and a constant upsurge is effected in agricultural 
production. 
  Through a more dynamic cultural revolution, the number of 
agro-technicians must be largely increased, the technical and 
cultural level of the agricultural working people who are 
directly responsible for agricultural production be lifted to a 
higher stage and a cultural and hygienic practice in and out of 
work be developed to build up our socialist constryside into 
ideal villages good to work and live in. 
  The WPK Central Committee in the message expressed the hope 
that all the agricultural working people, united behind the 
party and the leader as firm as a rock, will determinedly 
struggle to firmly defend and further glorify Korean-style 
socialism under the banner of the chuche idea and thus 
creditably live up to the deep trust and expectation of the 
party.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorials to the 30th anniversary of the publication 
of "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country", an 
immortal classical work of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song. 
  NODONG SINMUN in an editorial headlined "30 Hears of Victory 
and Change Along the Road Indicated by Great Rural Theses" says 
that the publication of the socialist rural theses 30 years ago 
was a historical event which is of weighty significance in the 
revolutionary struggle of our people for a victory of the 
socialist cause of chuche. 
  Noting that a national agricultural conference was grandly 
opened in Pyongyang on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of 
the publication of the rural theses, the paper says: 
  The conference will be a rally of victors powerfully 
demonstrating the greatness and invincible vitality of our 
party's programme of socialist rural construction and a new 
milestone in developing our socialist rural economy onto a 
higher stage. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical 
letter 
"For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the 
Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" to the national 
agricultural conference. 
  The great leader in his letter proudly reviewed the victory 
of our party and people in the struggle to implement the rural 
theses and put forward the militant tasks to effect a new 
upswing in the rural construction. The letter is a fighting 
banner to win a historical victory in finally solving the rural 
question, the most difficult one in the socialist construction. 
  The period since the publication of the theses was 30 years 
of victory in which a most brilliant example was set in the 
solution of the socialist rural question, the paper notes. It 
refers in detail to the achievements in the final solution of 
the rural question. 
  It stresses that the great victory and achievements in the 
struggle to implement the rural theses in the past were entirely 
a brilliant fruition of the wise guidance of the respected 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Noting that we are now faced with the honorable tasks to 
further consolidate and develop the socialist rural economic 
system in our country and effect a new upswing in the 
agricultural production on the basis of the great victory 
achieved in the socialist rural construction, the paper outlines 
these tasks. 
  An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that our socialist 
countryside which is advancing along the road indicated by the 
rural theses, holding the illustrious leader in high esteem, 
will boundlessly prosper and the socialist cause of chuche will 
make a long drive forever.

<F P=106> ["`Theses on Socialist Rural Question in Our Country Is </F>
Great Programme for Rural Construction'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The world public is 
unanimously praising the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question 
in Our Country" published by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song as a great programme for the socialist rural 
construction which gives a perfect scientific exposition of all 
the theoretical and practical questions arising in the solution 
of the rural question for the first time in human history. 
  Aubrey G. Thomas, chairman of the group for the study of the 
chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Goedverwagting, Guyana, 
said that the ideas expounded by respected President Kim Il-song 
in the rural theses were the unique idea elucidating a clear 
vista of solving the rural question and great idea indicating 
the right way of completely liberating the farmers freed from 
exploitation and oppression even from the fetters of old ideas 
and nature. 
  The Egyptian paper AKHER SA'A wrote that President Kim 
Il-song created the chuche method of farming after his earnest 
study while personally raising crops in the garden for the 
settlement of the rural question and applied it to farming. 
  The Central African news agency said that the development of 
agriculture in Korea was made entirely by the wise guidance of 
the respected leader President Kim Il-song, adding that Korea 
has firmly laid the powerful material and technical foundations 
which make it possible to endlessly increase agricultural 
production, unaffected in any unfavourable condition. 
  The Syrian paper NIDAL PALYAHIN said that the farmers of 
Korea are now leading a rich and cultural life; like in towns. 
  The Zambian paper ZAMBIA DAILY MAIL in an article stressed 
that the countryside of Korea built by the great President Kim 
Il-song reminds us of paradise or utopia pictured by ancient 
people to themselves.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Red Cross Society Hits at S. Korean Authorities' </F>
Scheme To Take Away Koreans From Sakhalin" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea released a statement on February 24 denouncing 
the crafty and insidious scheme of the South Korean authorities 
to take Korean residents in Sakhalin, Russia, to South Korea in 
conspiracy with the Japanese Government as a treacherous act 
selling off the dignity and interests of the nation for a few 
amount of money. 
  The South Korean authorities, absurdly contending that the 
issue of Korean residents in Sakhalin had been a political one 
but it is now purely a humanitarian issue, revealed their 
intention to settle this issue by receiving a few amount of 
money from the Japanese Government as traveling expenses for 
their immigration, the statement says: 
  The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin resulted from the fact 
that when the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea, 
they forcibly took them away by issuing an outrageous "general 
mobilization order" and overdrove them before leaving them in 
Sakhalin. 
  The Japanese Government has neither officially apologized to 
the Korean people nor compensated for Japan's past crimes. 
Then, how can the problem suddenly become a mere humanitarian 
problem, losing its political nature? 
  The problem of Koreans taken to the Far East by the Japanese 
imperialists is not a matter confined to the 40,000 Koreans 
resident in Sakhalin but a serious matter which can be solved 
only when the Japanese Government make an apology and 
compensation to nearly 500,000 Koreans who are living in the 
former Soviet Union. 
  Our nation has the right in view of the international law to 
get an apology and claim compensation from the Japanese 
Government for the national misfortune and sufferings 
experienced by all the Koreans overseas, not to speak of those 
living scattered in the former Soviet Union, for nearly one 
whole century. 
  This notwithstanding, the South Korean rulers, under the 
humanitarian [word indistinct] have launched a deceptive 
"charity" offensive among the Sakhalin-resident Koreans. This 
is motivated by a sinister intention to [words indistinct] 
"foundation" in the Far East of Russia and foster discord and 
confrontation within the nation by winning over them, thus 
perpetuating the division of the country. 
  As all Koreans overseas who visited South Korea confirmed, 
the South Korean society, a corrupt and ailing society where the 
rich is getting richer and the poor poorer, provides no 
political and economic guarantee for the life of those who 
return to South Korea from foreign countries. 
  We believe that all the Koreans in Russia and other areas 
(?of the) former Soviet Union will rise up as one in the staunch 
struggle to reject the insidious and crafty moves of South 
Korean and Japanese authorities to bring them to South Korea and 
defend the dignity and interests of the nation. 
  Our nation will settle scores to the last for all the crimes 
committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and will 
never pardon the traitors who are selling the interests of the 
nation to Japan, courting its favor. 
  The South Korean and Japanese authorities must be mindful 
that if they persistently resort to base plots to bring 
Sakhalin-resident Koreans to South Korea, ignoring our solemn 
warning, they will by no means evade the possibility for such a 
crime as insulting and abusing the noble humanitarian idea and 
will bring a greater disgrace to themselves under the eyes of 
the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam Monday decried the demand of people of all walks of 
life for another "Uruguay Round [UR] negotiation" concerning 
agricultural market opening, and ruled out the possibility of 
another negotiation, claiming that the demand came from 
ignorance of "diplomacy," according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  It was outrageous of the traitor to try to justify the 
kowtowing diplomacy and treacherous diplomacy yielding to the 
brigandish demands of foreign aggressors and call for accepting 
it. 
  He openly broke his "election commitment not to open the 
rice 
market" when it was still vivid in people's memory. This 
revealed once again the true color of the poor fellow who has 
prolonged his life with perfidy and treachery.

  [Text] On 25 February, the South Korean puppets committed a 
grave military provocation by firing a large-caliber artillery 
gun against the areas on our side. 
  Around 1053 [0153 GMT] today, the armed rascals of the South 
Korean puppet army, who were entrenched in Taeyongpyong Island, 
fired a 155 mm gun against Changje Island at our side on the sea 
off (Pokpo) in Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province. 
Because of this, fishermen of our side, who were catching fish 
in the area, were gravely threatened. 
  Such action by the South Korean puppets has not escalated 
into an armed conflict between the two sides. This is totally 
due to our People's Army soldiers' high sense of patience and 
self-control. 
  The dangerous military provocation by the South Korean 
puppets -- which was committed in broad daylight -- is a 
deliberate provocation to lead the Korean peninsula to 
confrontation and war. 
  We regard such provocation by the South Korean puppets as 
even more grave because they committed it at the same time of 
their persistent strategy and war maneuvers in order to crush 
[apsal] our Republic, the socialist fortress, in collusion with 
outside forces under the pretext of our non-existent nuclear 
issue. 
  With a high sense of the revolutionary alertness, our people 
and the People's Army soldiers are keenly watching out the new 
war provocations by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets. 
  Because of the U.S. imperialists' and the South Korean 
puppets' continuous new war provocations, a grave touch-and-go 
situation has been created on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, 
they must clearly see it and must not act recklessly. 
  Despite our repeated warnings, if the South Korean puppets 
continue to embark upon the road of confrontation and war, 
warmongers cannot avoid the stern punishment.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Commit Grave Military Provocation" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets committed a grave provocation today by firing a 
large-calibre gun into the area of the North side. 
  At around 10:53 the armed bandits of the South Korean Puppet 
Army entrenched on the Taeyonpyong Islet fired their 155 mm gun 
toward the Changjae Islet of the North side on the West Sea of 
Korea off Pupo, Kangnyong County, South Hwanghae Province. 
  In this the safety of the fishermen of the North side 
engaged 
in fishing around the islet was seriously threatened. 
  It was entirely thanks to the great patience and 
self-control 
of soldiers of the Korean People's Army that the artillery fire 
of the South Korean puppets did not expand into an armed 
conflict between the two sides. 
  This dangerous military provocation committed by the South 
Korean puppets in broad daylight was a premeditated act intended 
to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to confrontation 
and war. 
  We cannot but take a serious view of the South Korean 
puppets' provocation because it was timed to coincide with 
their tenacious plots and war moves to stifle the DPRK, the 
bulwark of socialism, over its fictitious "nuclear issue", hand 
in glove with outside forces. 
  The Korean people and People's Army soldiers are sharply 
watching with heightened revolutionary vigilance the new war 
provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must 
refrain from rash acts, looking straight at the touch-and-go 
situation on the Korean peninsula caused by their continuous 
provocations for a new war. 
  If the South Korean puppets keep to the line of 
confrontation 
and war, defying our repeated warnings, those warmaniacs will be 
sternly punished.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "War Frenzies of Civilian </F>
Warmongers"] 
  [Text] The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets 
are more viciously maneuvering to provoke a new war as time goes 
by. According to reports, on 21 February, the U.S. imperialists 
flew an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, stationed in a 
base in Okinawa, Japan, over the skies of Pochon, Yanggu, 
Kansong, and other areas of South Korea and conducted aerial 
photographing and electronic reconnaissance over the strategic 
depth and inland areas [chollyakchok chongsimjidaewa 
naeryukchidae] on the northern half of the Republic. 
  That night, puppet Army ground units based in Ha-ri and 
Wondang-ri of Yonchon County fired approximately 50 rounds of 
flare bombs into the skies, conducted a war exercise for 
northward aggression, and indulged in war frenzies. Also, 
puppet Army large-caliber artillery units and armed bandits 
which had been deployed in Nosang-ri in Paju County; Chungsa-ri 
in Yonchon County; and Chorwon-up in Chorwon County of South 
Korea incited a war atmosphere, firing hundreds of bullets and 
shells in the areas adjacent to the DMZ. 
  Also that day, the armed helicopters and transport 
helicopters of the puppet armed forces, which were deployed to 
the skies over Chongwon-ri in Paju County and Majon-ri of 
Yonchon County, frantically conducted an exercise to support and 
transport ground attack units. These war commotions by the U.S. 
imperialists and South Korean puppets are very ominous 
[simsangchi annun] movements that can take place only on the eve 
of war. They also clearly show how frantically the bastards are 
maneuvering to provoke a new war. 
  As everybody knows, all fellow countrymen in the North and 
South and abroad who pursue to achieve reunification in the 
nineties declared this year to be a year of great national unity 
and are making every effort to ease tension on the Korean 
peninsula and achieve national unity. 
  Peace-loving people from all strata of life in the world 
earnestly hope that tension will be eased and that a new phase 
will open for the fatherland's reunification this year. 
However, the South Korean puppets' policy of doing something 
about someone else by using military forces has not changed. 
Rather, they turn a blind eye to the fellow countrymen's 
earnest desire for peace and reunification, babble about someone 
else's armed provocations, and more frantically maneuver for 
arms buildup and northward invasion. 
  As a matter of fact, it is the South Korean puppets who 
attempt armed provocations on the Korean peninsula. Talking 
about preparations for actual warfare or preparations for quick 
reaction, they hold confabs to prepare the regular armed forces 
for combats and prepare the paramilitary forces for combat 
mobilization. They also accelerate the maneuvers to increase 
war budgets and bring Patriot missiles into South Korea, and 
plan to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise or any 
other large-scale military exercises. 
  As a matter of fact, even though it calls itself a civilian 
regime, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique pursues confrontation and 
war more persistently than the previous military dictatorial 
regimes. 
  The war exercise commotions which the South Korean puppets 
are successively kicking up in the DMZ and in its vicinity are a 
deliberate provocation maneuver to further aggravate tension on 
the Korean peninsula and, thus, ignite a fuse to war. They are 
also a vicious challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspirations 
for peace and peaceful reunification and an unforgivable 
antinational, antireunification crime. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique is kicking up war commotions 
to pursue other purposes, as well. The Kim Yong-sam ring is 
denounced and condemned and in deep crisis, because of its 
antinational, treacherous opening of the rice markets; the 
dirty-water scandal, which erupted early this year; a 
large-scale fraudulence case, and a series of gang robberies. 
  The daily growing resistance and anger of the people, along 
with the struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification, are further driving the traitorous Kim Yong-sam 
group to a predicament. Therefore, the puppets are kicking up 
war commotions daily to suppress the people's growing struggle 
and resolve an aggravating crisis facing its rule. This is 
proven by the fact that by mobilizing the puppet armed forces in 
downtown Seoul, the Kim Yong-sam ring conducted an exercise 
involving the movement of armored personnel carriers and 
military vehicles of various other sorts, paraded troops [tobo 
haengjin], and fired blank shots at random. 
  However, the puppets' dirty plot to find an exit in beefing 
up their war maneuvers against their fellow countrymen and their 
fascist rule will never work. The youth and students and people 
from all other walks of life in South Korea are vigorously 
waging an antiwar struggle against the reckless maneuvers by the 
civilian warmongers to provoke a new war. 
  The war maneuvers by the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique which 
challenge the people's aspirations and earnest desire will 
arouse great anger from the people and hasten their destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean 
puppets staged a trial on February 21, wielding the `National 
Security Law' and cried that the North, though it is a 
`dialogue partner,' is `an anti-state organisation' in every 
respect. It is a mockery of and insult to the North," says the 
Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland [CPRF] in its Information No. 644 published 
Thursday. 
  It notes: 
  "As for the `National Security Law' in which the South 
Korean puppets define the North as `an anti-state organisation', 
it is an anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law which 
should have been thrown into the dust bin of history long ago. 
  "We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the 
South 
Korean puppets made the rude remarks blatantly getting on our 
nerves when they were talking about the resumption of the 
North-South dialogue. 
  "Entirely attributable to the South Korean authorities' 
dishonest stance of dialogue is the grave situation in which the 
North-South agreement and the joint declaration on 
denuclearization have not been implemented and all dialogues 
between the North and South have been totally broken up. 
  "If the South Korean authorities truly want the improvement 
of the North-South relations and dialogue, they must change the 
confrontation policy into a reconciliation policy and abolish 
the fascist `National Security Law' against the nation and 
reunification."

<F P=106> [News conference by President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and </F>
domestic reporters on 25 February at the presidential residence, 
Chongwadae, on the occasion of the first anniversary of his 
inauguration--live ] 
  [Text] [Reporter Kim Chung-il from the KYONGHYANG SINMUN] 
The North Korean nuclear issue which, as you said, is closely 
related to the destiny of 70 million fellow countrymen has now 
been handed over to the talks between the United States and 
North Korea, let alone the issue of North-South dialogue. 
However, in view of the positions and attitudes of North Korea 
and the United States toward these negotiations, it seems very 
difficult to expect that the nuclear issue will be completely 
resolved at an early date. Are you ready to hold summit talks 
with North Korean President Kim Il-song in an effort to settle 
such a deadlock and to Koreanize the nuclear issue? Also, 
various reports and speculations regarding the North Korean 
issue have run rampant recently, and this has driven the people 
into confusion. So, Mr. President, please make public before the 
people, if possible, any intelligence concerning North Korea's 
nuclear development. 
  [Kim Yong-sam] Thank you. Regarding the North Korean nuclear 
issue, I received reports even until right before I came to this 
news conference room. I mean I received reports from the United 
States on the U.S.-North Korean contact which is now being held 
there. The U.S.-North Korean contact which was scheduled to be 
held this morning has been delayed. In the relations between the 
ROK and the United States I can clearly say that the ROK and 
U.S. Governments have maintained and are maintaining closer and 
friendlier relations more than ever before. The two governments 
are fully consulting with each other on all issues under the 
pricinciple of mutual respect. Regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue, in particular, the United States has fully 
consulted with the ROK in advance and sometimes in the course of 
its negotiations with North Korea. So, the two countries have 
made full discussions and consultation before and after the 
United States held negotiations with North Korea. Therefore, 
there is no case where our sovereignty is ignored or anything 
like that. In other words, I can clearly say that our opinions 
have been reflected. 
  Let me mention something about nuclear intelligence. As you 
know, as the president I hear and receive much intelligence from 
various channels at home and abroad. Summing up numerous 
intelligence reports we have received so far we have been unable 
to find clear evidence that North Korea has nuclear weapons. We 
cannot clearly say that North Korea has nuclear weapons. 
Another clear fact is that North Korea has continuously pushed 
ahead with nuclear development without renouncing it and without 
delaying it. This is also a clear fact. 
  By the way, although no agreement was reached until this 
morning, North Korea is destined to accept the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections, and North-South 
dialogue and exchange of special envoys will be realized after 
all. 
  On the question on summit talks with President Kim Il-song, 
I 
will push ahead with holding summit talks with President Kim 
Il-song only when holding the talks is considered to be 
conducive to making North Korea renounce its nuclear development. 
  [KBS reporter Kim Hong] You said that you will hold summit 
talks with President Kim Il-song when it is judged to be of help 
in restraining the nuclear issue. Does that mean that 
South-North summit talks can be held with the exchange of envoys 
of the South and North in addition to the contacts that have 
been held heretofore, even before the nuclear transparency is 
guaranteed? 
  [President Kim] Yes. Originally, the North Korean side 
proposed the exchange of envoys of the South and North. The 
exchange of envoys was a precondition to holding summit talks. 
Therefore, the exchange of envoys itself is part of holding 
summit talks. 
  [KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter Kim Chung-il] The proposal for 
summit talks is an epoch-making proposal that may even be said 
to be a change in our policy toward North Korea. Was there 
special background to this matter? Also, how do you view the 
timing of summit talks against the backdrop of proposing the 
South-North summit talks? 
  [President Kim] I believe that you all know of the 
tug-of-war that was carried out during the past year to resolve 
the nuclear issue. However, the most important duty for me as 
president is to defend the country, protect the people, and to 
protect the 70 million people of the Korean peninsula from war. 
Therefore, one of my important goals was to prevent nuclear 
development at all costs. At the same time, I was of the strong 
will that a war must not break out on the Korean peninsula. 
This is a very difficult issue. Therefore, there are aspects 
that need to be strongly pushed ahead as well as other aspects 
that we need to strategically withdraw on. I believe that the 
most important duty of the president is to allow the people to 
live in security. Therefore, we must prevent North Korea's 
nuclear development for strategic reasons. This must be 
achieved not only for peace on the Korean peninsula but also for 
peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. It is also 
necessary for South-North co-existence and prosperity. I have 
deeply contemplated over this matter from various aspects. 
  [HANGUK ILBO reporter Choe Kyu-sik] Can your remark on the 
South-North summit be explained as acceptance of the proposal 
made by President Kim Il-song last year? Also, the South-North 
summit talks brought up by President Kim Il-song is centered on 
the reunification issue. Do you plan to include economic 
cooperation and your three-stage reunification plan in addition 
to the nuclear issue in the discussion? 
  [President Kim] If summit talks are held, we cannot just 
talk about one issue. All issues as well as the nuclear issue 
will be discussed. I believe that a deep exchange of opinions 
on all issues including the issue of economic cooperation and 
reunification can be held for South-North co-existence and 
prosperity. 
  [CHUNGANG ILBO reporter Kim Hyon-il] You said that there 
have been sufficient consultations between the ROK and the 
United States on all issues. However, there have been various 
rumors as to the deployment of Patriot missiles, which are 
defensive weapons. Will you please tell us about the reason of 
such rumors? You also said that if the North Korean nuclear 
issue is resolved, the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended. 
Please tell us whether there will be no problem in our security 
posture even in time of emergency, if the exercise is suspended. 
  [President Kim] Some press organs have publicized this issue 
in various forms. However, there are many incorrect reports. 
Some papers even reported that the ROK wants to receive Patriot 
missiles. However, we have never asked them. I want to clarify 
at this point that the ROK has no plan to purchase Patriot 
missiles. 
  The ROK and the United States have been conducting close 
consultations on this issue, including the time of introduction. 
As you know, Patriot missiles are not offensive. They are 
totally purely defensive. Therefore, this is not an issue to 
which one, including North Korea, should pay sensitive 
attention. I believe, however, that the issue should be decided 
from the political point of view, instead of the military 
aspect. Thus, discussions are ongoing on this issue. I think 
there will be no great problem pertaining to this, because the 
United States fully respects our sovereignty. Unlike the past, 
cooperation is being attained 100 percent. 
  As for the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, we conducted 
the exercise every year in the past. However, we are 
tentatively withholding it in order to make North Korea accept 
IAEA inspections and to hold sincere North-South dialogue. 
Therefore, in the event that all these conditions are met, the 
ROK Government will announce the suspension of the exercise. The 
suspension will be announced on certain conditions. We do not 
mean complete suspension. Only when everything is met, the 
exercise will be suspended completely. 
  We can conduct the Team Spirit exercise at any time we want. 
As the exercise usually begins in March, a considerable amount 
of troops and weapons should have already departed from the U.S. 
mainland if the exercise is to be conducted. However, it is 
being withheld tentatively, not being suspended forever. We will 
start it again if the conditions are not met. Therefore, even if 
we announce the suspension, there will be no problem in the 
defense of the ROK. 
  [MBC reporter Cho Chong-min] I would like to ask a few 
political questions. A survey revealed that the degree of 
support for the president, which reached 90 percent after your 
inauguration, recently declined to 60 percent. This means that 
the critical view is increasing, although the figure of 60 
percent itself is enormous. What reason do you see for this? 
In particular, some people observe that those who were your 
supporters from the past are leaving your (?camp). How do you 
assess all of this? 
  [President Kim] I thank you the people for your continuous 
over 90 percent support for me since my inauguration. It's 
amazing that one could get over 90 percent support from the 
people. The support was so dazzling that I felt an enormous 
burden and pressure. I felt it somewhat abnormal. I thought it 
should be lower than that. There should be a certain degree of 
opposition in a democratic society. Now, therefore, it is 
returning to normalcy. I, therefore, feel gratified for it. I 
think I can work with a sense of relief now. The decisive 
contributing factors to the dwindling of my popularity were the 
major accidents, the contamination of drinking water from the 
Naktong River--which have in fact been the result of undesirable 
practices over the past 30 years--and particularly the recent 
hike in the cost of living, in which the people are concerned 
about most. 
  What I would like to say to your question is that, since I 
am 
not going to run for the presidency four years from now and 
since my convictions do not allow me to do anything for the sake 
of winning temporary popularity, if I think something is right 
and is necessary for the people, I will not hesitate to do it. 
This is what I have done in the past as well. As for the real 
name financial transaction system, for instance, it was far from 
a policy of attracting popularity. Many around me then advised 
me against the real name financial transaction system, on the 
ground that it should be instituted after the recovery of our 
then slack economy. I turned down the idea because it would 
postpone the system indefinitely, perhaps for good. I stressed 
that we should do it for the sake of economic justice. We 
should do it to justify wealth. We should institute the real 
name financial transaction system, the key point of reform. We 
should not postpone the system until the economy recovers, to 
win the people's popularity. Thus, we implemented the system. 
  The term of the U.S. President is four years. Although one 
can remain in the office for a second term, there were quite a 
few presidents who did not serve a second term. For instance, 
President Bush and President Carter. Today, I begin the second 
year of my office as if I were making a new start. I will not 
do anything to seek temporary public popularity. If I think it 
beneficial to our country and people, I will not shrink from 
doing it. 
  [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-on] I will ask you a 
question on reform as a whole. Despite the sweeping audit and 
inspection activities for the last year and despite the general 
reform you have conducted for society as a whole, the people do 
not feel tangible effects of reform in such areas as the cost of 
living, environment, and transportation. Some also noted the 
lack of the general program for reform. Please give us a 
general outline of the program for reform for the next four 
years of your term, giving us the priority list and the method 
of reform. 
  [President Kim] Many references are made to the lack of a 
program, civilian dictatorship, and one-man rule. I much doubt 
the credibility of such references. During the era of military 
dictatorship, dictatorship was enforced. The government of 
civilian democracy is the government given birth to by the 
people. It is literally the government of civilian democracy. 
Under a president-centered government, the president takes the 
responsibility and leads the state. The president is the person 
who takes the supreme responsibility for managing the state. He 
is responsible for leading the state. If anyone says this is 
civilian dictatorship and uses the description One-Man Politics, 
I can hardly understand it. Does he mean that we should return 
to dictatorship under which we were in the past? I hope that 
you will make efforts to help the people properly appreciate 
matters related to this question. 
  As for the issue of the rise in the cost of living, I am 
very 
sorry that there was such an increase. The government will 
concentrate its efforts to check the increase in the cost of 
living. An important reason for the increase in the cost of 
living was that the cold weather last year caused an increase in 
farm produce prices. That has had a lot to do with the present 
situation connected with the hike in the cost of living. 
  As you well know, some increase in prices is a common sight 
in January every year. I think it is very difficult to assess a 
price increase in one full year based on the price increase in 
such a short period of time, that is, January. So, our 
government is making every possible effort to prevent price 
increases. However, what is important here is the people's 
cooperation with the government's efforts. In other words, the 
people should not perpetrate the practice of cornering goods or 
being indisposed to sell goods. Early in January a phenomenon of 
excessive spending was seen among the citizens. We can say such 
a phenomenon is an act of hoarding goods and being indisposed to 
sell goods. Therefore, if our people are to worry about an 
increase in prices they should join the government's efforts in 
settling the price problem. I urge our people's cooperation in 
settling the price problem. 
  In dealing with economic matters, I think that we should set 
priority according to the degree of importance. In connection 
with the Uruguay Round issue, in addition to 42 trillion won 
annually, the government plans to invest 1.5 trillion won each 
year in the structural improvement project for our rural 
villages by establishing special purpose taxes. At the same 
time, the Agricultural Development Committee has been formed. 
So, we will see to it that this committee will study in detail 
how to use these funds for rural villages. Of course, in the 
rural improvement project, too, we will set priority. 
  [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-ho] I will use the term 
one-man rule in the form of a different expression because I 
know you dislike that term. During the past year you have 
directly and personally dealt with everything, and as a result, 
the word of politics devoid of power was spreading among the 
people. What do you say on this? What is your plan, if any, for 
the revitalization of politics? In your opening remarks you 
stressed the need for creative relations between the government 
ruling party and the opposition party. You also urged the 
opposition party to become a sincere partner for reforms. For 
this end, do you think it necessary to hold talks between the 
leaders of the ruling and opposition parties? 
  [President Kim] It has been one year since I was 
inaugurated. However, I told you that this one year seems to be 
10 years for me. I come to my office in Chongwadae between 0720 
and 0740 every morning. That is when my work begins. My work 
varies greatly. There are many, many things for which I as the 
president should be responsible. This situation has made it 
inevitable for me to directly and personally deal with 
everything. However, I did these things according to my 
conscience. As you know, right after my inauguration I declared 
that I will never receive money, not even a coin, from anyone in 
five years while staying in the presidency. I will keep this 
promise. While staying in the presidency I will never be 
involved in any concessions. My faith is that I should become a 
clean and morally dignified president. By becoming so, I think, 
I can dignifiedly ask and appeal to the people to do for the 
country. This is why I have such faith. 
  I have mentioned many times the need for clean politics and 
for the revitalization of politics. Spending money for politics 
is a bad thing and should be done away with thoroughly. A 
genuine democracy cannot be expected in those countries where 
people spend money in politics. Only when clean elections are 
conducted can genuine democracy be enforced. I would not point 
out the name of a specific country which has been known to spend 
much money in elections. Those countries which spend money in 
politics are corrupt countries. This finally leads to 
dictatorship. It also leads the people to ruin. So, politics 
should be clean, and elections should be clean. 
  On the issue of our political party, the Democratic Liberal 
Party, I have already handed all and absolute power over party 
management affairs and other affairs regarding the National 
Assembly within our party over to Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the 
party. I have transferred all powers over to Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil. I will not meddle in the management affairs of the 
National Assembly. So, Chairman Kim Chong-pil has been operating 
our party with all authority. 
  Speaking of the matter on meeting the representative of the 
opposition party, I think we can meet any time, if necessary. 
  [Reporter Ed Paisley for FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in 
English] I would like to ask you questions about the 
government's privatization program. You have an ambitious 
schedule of selling all state-owned companies. Will the 
Federation of Korea Industries be involved in this process as 
they are now in telecommunications industry privatization or 
will the (?industries) be excluded from the process, leaving the 
decision-making in the hands of some self-interested bureaucrats? 
  [President Kim] Our government will decide on the 
privatization plan. I think the operation of state-run 
enterprises in our country may have been loose or faulty in the 
past. Therefore, I plan to actively push the privatization 
program. You asked about the issue of the second mobile 
telecommunications corporation. I see many Japanese reporters 
here. For example in Japan, this issue was not handled by the 
government but autonomously by the National Federation of 
Japanese Business Corporations. Believing this method to be very 
desirable, our government plans to remain detached from this 
issue and to leave the decisionmaking in the hands of the 
Federation of Korea Industries. 
  [Reporter Kim Chang-ki for CHOSON ILBO] In your opening 
remarks earlier, you pointed out that political reform is most 
urgent, and in fact, many people sympathize with this. Reform 
of the system is also important to political reform. However, 
many people emphasize that people must be replaced first of all. 
Will you tell us of your plans, if any, to foster a new 
political generation for political reform, as well as your plans 
on the succession structure [hugye kudo]? The issue of 
reorganizing political circles and of revising the Constitution 
to institute a cabinet system has recently been raised among the 
people. I would appreciate hearing your opinion on these issues. 
  [President Kim] You have asked several questions at once. 
People are key to all work. Through lessons learnt from 
history, we know that the history of a nation can change 
according to who becomes the leader of that country. World 
history shows that a nation's history changed according to who 
its leader became. Therefore, the issue of the leadership of a 
nation, which includes assemblymen, dominates all problems. 
Because the previous era of dictatorship lasted so long in our 
country, various improper customs and practices of the people 
were propagated. Values have now changed. I hope that more 
reform-oriented, progressive figures who can dedicate themselves 
to the nation will come forward in political circles. 
  I was asked some time ago about the succession structure, 
but 
I am being asked again today. One year has passed since I came 
to office, and four years, the length of a president's term in 
office in the United States, still remains. If one were to 
think about one's successor only one year into one's term with 
four years remaining, that person would be considered strange 
indeed. It is a little too early to bring this issue up. Allow 
me plenty of time to think over this issue. 
  Currently I am not considering political realignment at 
all. This is not a matter which can be solved artificially. 
Also, I believe that the parliamentary government system is not 
at all appropriate in our country's situation. If our country 
carries out a responsible parliamentary system, it will only 
result in misfortune in a situation in which our country is 
already divided. I believe that this system is of absolutely no 
value to us. I'll be frank with you. When I met Hosokawa in 
Kyongju and at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, 
he said to me that he earnestly felt a president-centered system 
to be favorable in politics. 
  [YONHAP reporter Kim Song-su] I would like to ask you two 
questions regarding the election of chiefs of regional 
autonomous bodies. The 1995 election of chiefs of regional 
autonomous bodies can be regarded as an important election that 
will prove the success or failure of political reform. 
Nevertheless, there is already concern regarding elements of 
corruption in regions on the issue of candidates. Do you have a 
measure to deal with such corruption? Also, in connection with 
the election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies, is there a 
more desirable way to restructure the administrative district 
and regulate the government structure? 
  [President Kim] I think the most important aspect in the 
election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies is to carry out 
clean elections. Only then can the chiefs of regional 
autonomous bodies sincerely and honestly work for that region. 
I will mobilize all of our administrative power to strictly 
punish those carrying out illegal elections. I would like to 
say that confidential inquiries are being made on rumors that 
candidates are carrying out corrupt acts. The issue of 
restructuring the administrative district is an issue to be 
decided upon at the National Assembly. I hope that political 
circles will deal with this matter in a just way and in 
accordance with the people's interest. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN reporter Kim Yong-man] I would like to ask you 
a question on the economy. As you noted, many people are 
worried about price instability. The government's policy on 
price control is moving from indirect regulation to direct 
regulation. What is the government's policy on prices and can 
this year's inflation be kept at six percent? What is your view 
on this? 
  [President Kim] I talked about the price issue a short while 
ago. The government regards the price issue as its most 
important task. We are making utmost efforts. I mentioned that 
the people's decisive cooperation is necessary. Related to 
this, certain people are talking about the issue of carrying out 
tax investigations. Tax investigations are carried out on 
businesses that unjustly raise prices. Such tax investigations 
are not illegal, and must be carried out. Also, public utility 
charges of those that were inevitable were raised. We will 
continue to work to control various matters that stimulate price 
increases such as the rise in public utility charges. The rise 
in public utility charges will be absorbed through 
rationalization of management. The government will exert 
efforts regarding this matter but we also need the people's 
voluntary cooperation. 
  [SBS reporter Chon Yong-hak] You talked about measures for 
price stability. You said that tax investigations will be 
carried out on unjustly raised prices. However, measures that 
are being taken resemble those of the past which contradict 
overall economic liberalization. What is your view on this 
matter? Late last year you said you would reduce land prices, 
interest rates, and wages and work to revitalize the economy. 
However, recent trends indicate that these prices are also on 
the rise. What is the reason for this? Also, do you have any 
measures for this? 
  [President Kim] I think that the issue of price stability is 
of great interest. As I said before, I apologize to the people 
once again regarding this matter. I had expressed a strong will 
to be absolutely intolerant of unearned income [pullosotuk] and 
increasing land prices. I believe that the three elements [land 
prices, interest rates, and wages] were kept considerably under 
control last year and expect that to be the case this year also. 
I will take strict measures regarding this matter. 
  Also, workers have shown a tendency to restrain themselves 
in demanding wage increases. We must cooperate at this 
important time when we must improve the nation's competitive 
edge. I have met numerous workers and talked with them over 
lunch many times. I have visited many small- and medium-size 
business corporations, though I have visited a few big ones, as 
well. Officials in those small and medium-size corporations 
have told me what difficulties they are facing. During my 
recent regional tours, I have witnessed many changes that the 
small- and medium-size corporations are undergoing. 
  I have always thought that small- and medium-size 
corporations form the foundation of our economy. They play a 
very important role in our economy. They employ over 50 percent 
of our workers. 
  Some people say the government has been negligent in 
assisting small- and medium-size corporations. This is not 
correct. Last year, we completely froze the wages of government 
officials. I am very sorry for the government officials and 
their families. The government assisted small- and medium-size 
corporations with 1.3 trillion won, a portion of the funds saved 
by the wage freeze. 
  When the government heard that they were facing very serious 
difficulties because of the implementation of the real-name 
financial transaction system, it assisted them with another 2.2 
trillion won. No other regime has given such a massive monetary 
assistance to small- and medium-size corporations. 
  As a result, small- and medium-size corporations have become 
very active, and many companies have declared that this year 
will be the first year of labor-management harmony. I am very 
pleased to see many companies where management and workers are 
working in a family-like atmosphere. 
  [Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL in English] Thank 
you, Mr. President. I am Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL. You have made internationalization a prominent theme of 
your administration in your speech this morning. As you know, 
that means Korea will have to open its markets to foreign 
competitors, goods, and services. That could create some 
business failures here and rising employment. And, I am 
wondering if you are willing to accept short-term sacrifices for 
long-term benefits of internationalization. I would also like 
to ask you if labor relations this year do not proceed as 
smoothly as you would like, would you be willing to reform the 
labor code? 
  [President Kim] Globalization and internationalization 
constitute a trend that we cannot reserve. All countries of the 
world are moving in this direction. And, I think this is a road 
we must move along without fail. And, we are at an important 
point at which we must win victory without fail on this road. 
  The point is: Even though our markets have been opened, 
markets of other countries have opened even wider. Winning 
through competition in these widely open markets is the only way 
for us to survive. We must win in the competition by 
manufacturing the best- quality goods in the world. Given our 
people's potential and ability, I am confident we can win. 
Having confidence is the most important thing. Being confident 
in what we can do is the most important, I think. Having a 
dream is also very important. I think we can win in worldwide 
competition. I think both long-term and short-term prospects 
are not grim. 
  As for labor-management relations, because both businessmen 
and workers firmly believe they must win in this difficult era 
of international competition, they declared this year would the 
first year of labor-management harmony, while restraining 
themselves, seeking common interests, and seeking national 
interests. I hope labor-management relations will go smoothly 
this year. I do not plan to reform the labor code for now. 
  [KUNGMIN ILBO reporter Kim Song-chin] Just now, you 
mentioned internationalization. Therefore, I would like to ask 
you about two matters regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations. 
First, what measures will the government take against the 
possible strong pressure by the advanced countries, including 
the United States, to open the banking and service markets, in 
addition to the agricultural field? Second, now the National 
Assembly must ratify the Uruguay Round negotiations: How do you 
persuade the opposition parties or farmers' organizations to 
support it? If you have any plans, will you please tell us 
about them? 
  [President Kim] You used the term pressure of opening. This 
does not mean that we will give in to other countries' pressure. 
We will decide on a policy to meet the interest of our nation. 
I believe that we will never give in to pressure. It is 
unthinkable. Our country's position is very firm. It is not the 
position of our country to give in to pressure. We could not 
but to decide, however, if we were to become an isolated state 
or compete with other countries in the international arena. 
During the Uruguay negotiations, we had to consider the 
national interest. I hope you can understand it. 
  Furthermore, I have been to rural communities on many 
occasions. I found that there were many changes in farmers' 
position. They have greatly changed. Of course, farmers must 
change on their own. It is an indispensable global trend to 
adopt the so-called Uruguay Round negotiations. Therefore, we 
must survive, at any cost, in the international arena by raising 
competitiveness. In this respect, we must change our thought. 
As mentioned earlier, we will provide support to rural 
communities by establishing a special tax bill to save 1.5 
trillion won per year. By forming the agricultural development 
[nongbalwi] committee, the government will make every effort to 
provide support to rural communities based on the idea that to 
save the rural communities is to save the country. I believe 
that our farmers have a considerable understanding of this and 
have changed on their own everyday. In this respect, I think, 
it is very fortunate. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUM reporter Kuroda] Thank you. I have two 
questions for you. You have strongly stressed 
internationalization. However, there is an argument regarding 
the introduction of the Japanese culture. What do you think of 
it, upon your upcoming visit to Japan? First, do you think that 
Japan must be excluded from the internationalization of your 
country? Second, the ROK papers reported that North Korean 
loggers escaped from a lumber camp in Russia, and that they have 
asked the ROK Government for asylum. However, your government 
refused it. What do you think of it? 
  [President Kim] Thank you. In moving forward the 
internationalization, as I mentioned earlier, it is our position 
that we will open all markets. There may be problems in opening 
the markets. I believe that it is right to open the market. 
However, we must carefully consider the method and time of the 
opening. As you talked about my upcoming visit to Japan, I will 
visit Japan and China next month. Of course, needless to say 
that our relations with the United States are very important, 
but, at the same time, our relations with the three countries, 
such as Japan, China, and Russia -- which are neighboring 
countries -- are very important as well. I believe that it is 
very significant for me to visit the two countries, Japan and 
China. Not only for the common interest between the ROK and the 
two countries, but also for the settlement of the nuclear issue, 
economic cooperation with them, and the cooperation between 
their people -- in particular, Japan and China are members of 
the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] -- my upcoming 
visit to the two countries is very significant. 
  Regarding your last question on the North Korean workers' 
request for asylum, I have received the detailed reports. As of 
present, a great number of people are engaged in lumber cutting 
work in Russia. It is true that North Korea have sent many 
people there. Many of them have visited our country's embassy 
or consulate in Russia and asked for asylum. The number of 
people who asked for asylum is tremendous. However, the 
majority of them do not have passports. In order words, they are 
stateless. This is strange. We may think that they are Koreans 
because they speak the Korean language. It is very easy and 
simple for us to accept their asylum if they ask for it directly 
from North Korea. In this case, we can easily decide on it. 
Because they have asked for asylum from other country's 
territory, the so-called Russia, there are many international 
problems. Therefore, we must consider those international issues 
in the light of international law. However, we are basically 
carefully and positively dealing with them in the light of 
humaneness and human rights. 
  [Kim Ki-ung from HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN] Mr. President, 
since being sworn in, you have paid particular attention to 
economic affairs. Every time such serious problems as the 
opening of the rice markets, the shortages of the social 
overhead capital, and the contamination of portable water arose, 
you said solving those problems would be the top priorities in 
state affairs. Some people wonder whether these problems can be 
solved at a time no budget is appropriated for solving those 
problems. Would you comment on this? Also, many people point 
out some government ministries announce new policies without 
coordinating views with other pertinent ministries. Would you 
comment on this, as well? 
  [President Kim] Each project is being carried out depending 
on its priority. We have established a special tax for solving 
the rice problem. We have also proposed a bill on inducing 
private capital. As for the social overhead capital, we will 
decide on which infrastructural problem should be solved first 
and which should be later. The water problem and the 
agricultural problem must be solved on a priority basis. I 
again say people will help the government solve these problems. 
  [Yun Chang-chung of SEGYE ILBO] I will ask you a question on 
your philosophy on operating the national economy. In the early 
days of your presidency, you repeatedly stressed the spirit of 
sharing pains. However, you have recently given us the 
impression that you attach importance to big businesses. What 
is your genuine philosophy on operating the national economy? 
Seeing the economy not improving, some people say the efforts 
to share pains have reached their limit. They also criticize 
the government for not presenting concrete goals, for example, 
the goal of national economic growth. Would you comment on this? 
  [President Kim] I think I have answered a similar question. 
I have stated I attach importance to small- and medium-size 
corporations. I have also stated how much the government 
assisted them. My government has attached the greatest 
importance to small- and medium-size corporations. I have met 
more workers than any other president. I have had lunch with 
them and talked with them wherever I have gone. I think you 
cannot stress too much the importance of small- and medium-size 
corporations. I hope you understand this. 
  Why do we not have goals? We are going toward the set goals. 
The goal of economic growth for this year is 6 percent. The 
notion that there is no philosophy on operating the national 
economy is not correct. We will make every effort to fulfill 
those set goals. 
  [Andrew Steele of REUTER, in English] Mr. President: We 
have heard many times now the government's plans for 
liberalizing the economic markets. But, recent events have 
shown that the government has, in fact, been intervening heavily 
in the economy. I mention two factors here: price controls and 
the recent measures to cool the stock exchange, which has, in 
fact, infuriated a lot of foreign investors who are barred even 
further from getting into the Korean markets. Why is the 
government saying one thing about liberalization when, in fact, 
it continues to intervene heavily. Thank you? 
  [President Kim] As for the market opening, we are planning 
to 
open everything to ensure that foreigners think Korea is the 
best place to do business. I think providing conditions to 
ensure that foreigners invest in Korea without anxiety is very 
important. 
  The government facilitates utmost autonomy in all sectors. I 
think the notion that the government heavily intervenes in 
everything is a misunderstanding. 
  Some people tend to suspect that if anything happens, the 
government must have done something. Those days have passed. I 
hope there is no misunderstanding on this matter. 
  [Shinogawa of MAINICHI SHIMBUN] During your news 
conference held at the beginning of this year, you said signs of 
peace were visible in North Korea. What has happened to those 
signs of peace? And, what do you mean by signs of peace? 
  [President Kim] Though I have much information on this, I 
think it is not good to tell you about it here. As you know, 
changes are taking place in North Korea, are they not? North 
Korea, which had stated it would never receive inspections from 
the IAEA, notified the IAEA and the United States that it would 
receive inspections from the IAEA and issue visas in a few days. 
This was unimaginable last year. I once said North Korea would 
change. I think this [acceptance of nuclear inspection] in 
itself is a great change. 
  [Han Myon-taek of the Christian Broadcasting System] My 
question concerns educational reform. The Education Ministry 
and the Educational Reform Committee will map out reform plans. 
What is your basic plan on the high school and college entrance 
examination systems, foreign language education, and other 
matters? 
  [President Kim] I think education is the most important in 
our society. I know the quality of education determines the 
destiny of a country. I realized this upon reading a book 
written by Paul Kennedy. Someone says Korea owes its current 
prosperity to education. 
  There are daunting problems in education not only in Korea 
but also in the advanced countries in the world. We have 
reporters here from Japan and the United States. The United 
States has very difficult problems in education. Japan is no 
different. 
  Because educational reform is very important, it took almost 
one year to form the Education Reform Committee. Education is 
not a matter on which decisions can be made quickly. It takes 
much time to decide on educational reform. I think we must 
examine various factors to map out far-reaching plans. I have 
my own ideas. I will fully discuss this matter with the newly 
established Educational Reform Committee and the education 
minister. We will make decisions on how to reform education to 
ensure that our country survives. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You will soon visit China. 
Telephone exchange systems, automobiles, and aviation are 
matters of concern between the two countries. Would you tell us 
if it is possible to reach any agreement on these matters? 
People say the Chinese leader should visit our country this 
time because President No Tae-u visited China the last time. 
What do you think of this? 
  [President Kim] I and the Chinese leader met during the APEC 
summit talks and discussed telephone exchange systems and 
aviation. It is not correct to mention these issues now. As for 
protocol, I think you should know which leader should visit the 
other is not that important of a matter. Since the two countries 
established diplomatic relations, the Chinese head of state had 
never sent a letter, for example, a letter of invitation, to the 
ROK. This time, China sent an official letter of invitation for 
me to visit China. China invited me to visit China as a state 
guest. During a news conference held early this year, I told 
people that I would go anywhere in the world as a salesman if it 
is beneficial to our state and people. I will go anywhere if it 
is beneficial to our country. 
  As I told you before, now is a very important time, I think. 
Therefore, visiting Japan and China in the era of the Pacific 
basin is very significant. Thank you.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
remarks on the promotion of an inter-Korean summit, made in his 
press conference on Friday, embodied the president's positive 
intent of resolving the nuclear question by all means, a ranking 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign 
affairs and national security, said President Kim meant to say 
he could promote a summit meeting if a summit is determined to 
be helpful to the resolution of nuclear and other inter-Korean 
issues. "We therefore expect that if and when the exchange of 
special envoys are realized, they would have talks so that the 
nuclear and other pending questions could be successfully taken 
up at a summit meeting," Chong said. 
  Another senior Chongwadae official said chances for the 
realization of a summit would depend on overall conditions such 
as the progress of U.S.-North Korea talks and the exchange of 
special envoys between the two sides of Korea. He stressed that 
President Kim's proposal for a summit does not run logically 
counter to the government's policy toward North Korea. "A 
summit was proposed with emphasis on the resolution of the 
nuclear question. But, once a summit meeting takes place, it 
could discuss overall issues pending between the two sides," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Mun Chae-chol from Washington] </F>
  [Text] North Korea has agreed to resume the North-South 
dialogue at the same time nuclear inspections begin, and, as a 
result, it is expected that the North and South will be able to 
exchange special envoys soon. 
  In the working-level contact which continued for the second 
day in New York this morning, Korean time, the United States and 
North Korea reportedly have virtually finished drafting the 
letter of agreement which contains the four principles: The 
International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear 
inspections on 1 March; at the same time, the discontinuation of 
the Team Spirit exercise for this year will be announced; 
North-South dialogue for the exchange of special envoys will 
start; and the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks 
will resume next month. 
  In drafting the agreement, the United States and North Korea 
had different views on the timing of the North-South exchange of 
special envoys and on the third round of U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks. However, North Korea agreed that it would 
affirmatively examine the North-South contact for the exchange 
of special envoys in case South Korea so proposes. As a result, 
a compromise was reached. 
  The United States agreed that the third round of U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks would be held late March on the condition 
that North Korea resumes the North-South dialogue. 
  If North Korea obtains approval for the agreement with the 
United States from the Pyongyang authorities, the sides are 
expected to exchange the final letter of agreement at the 
third-day working-level contact which will open late this 
evening Korean time. However, Washington and New York sources 
have said that the sides would not release a joint communique 
because their meeting is a working-level contact.

  [Text] Washington, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korean 
officials failed to appear at the negotiating table with their 
U.S. counterparts on Thursday in New York, prompting the 
Americans to return to Washington in the evening. The U.S. 
officials' departure may cause a delay in nuclear inspections of 
North Korean facilities. 
  The American officials, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Tom Hubbard, were to 
meet with North Korean officials, headed by Deputy Chief of the 
North Korean mission to the United Nations Ho Chong, Thursday 
for the third consecutive day. The two sides were to discuss 
follow-up measures after Pyongyang permits nuclear inspections 
on March 1. 
  A spokesman for the State Department said the U.S. 
officials, 
who waited all day at the negotiating table, were back in 
Washington and the U.S. side currently has no plans to meet 
again with North Korea. Upon returning to Washington, the U.S. 
negotiators expressed disappointment that North Korea is not 
ready to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency next week, the spokesman said. 
  Diplomatic sources here said the North Korean officials 
failed to show up because they had not received instructions 
from Pyongyang, adding that if the North Koreans want to hold 
another meeting, even on Friday, it will likely take place. The 
issue of the Koreas' exchanging special envoys is reportedly 
hampering negotiations between the United States and North 
Korea. Under a prior agreement with Seoul, the U.S. side has 
said that in order to hold a third round of high-level talks 
between Washington and Pyongyang, the North should accept an 
exchange of special envoys with the South, a condition that 
North Korean officials have strongly rejected.

  [Text] The working-level contacts, which were held one 
after another in New York between the United States and North 
Korea surrounding the issue of the entry of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team, faced difficulties 
[nangwane pongchakhada], including the abrupt return of the U.S. 
delegation to Washington amid attempts of the two sides to shift 
the responsibility onto each other. 
  Correspondent Nam Son-yong reports from New York. 
  [Begin Nam recording] Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant 
secretary for East Asian-Pacific affairs who is a working 
delegate from the U.S. side, said that he was disappointed by 
the fact that North Korea did not agree on the date of 
inspection, and suddenly returned to Washington this morning 
Korean time. 
  Noting that he was returning to Washington because there was 
no reply from North Korean authorities to the proposal by the 
U.S. side, delegate Hubbard said that he has no plan at present 
to meet the North Korean delegation. 
  In particular, Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard warned 
that 
if nuclear inspection is not conducted at an early date, the 
IAEA Board of Governors will review the next steps against North 
Korea within next week. He stressed that all responsibility 
rests on the North Korean side. 
  In a telephone conversation with KBS a reporter, Han 
Sung-yol, councilor and delegate of the North Korean side, said 
that because the U.S. side put forward the resumption of 
North-South dialogue as a precondition even after North Korea 
decided to accept the IAEA inspection, the step to issue visas 
has not been taken. He then claimed that all responsibility 
rests on the U.S. side, thus suggesting that the issue of 
resuming North-South dialogue has emerged as the core issue in 
the working-level contact. 
  However, a reliable source said that the North Korean side 
has not received the instruction from Pyongyang on adjusting the 
date after the meeting took a recess, and is now waiting for the 
instruction. As soon as the North Korean side receives the 
instruction, it will hold a working contact tomorrow. Thus, 
there is a possibility that the two sides may reach a basic 
agreement on issuing visas, on the third round of U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks, and on North-South working contact for 
the exchange of special envoys. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said Friday that uncertainty clouds the North Korean 
nuclear issue because Pyongyang has yet to follow up on its 
decision to permit nuclear inspections last week. 
  Han told the National Assembly Committee for Foreign Affairs 
and Unification that North Korea's acceptance of International 
Atomic energy agency (IAEA) inspections provided the world with 
an opportunity to continue efforts to solve the problem through 
dialogue. However, he said, if North Korea does not issue visas 
to IAEA inspectors soon, the IAEA will inevitably have to take 
strong steps. 
  "North Korea is delaying the issuance of visas, linking the 
start of IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear sites to the 
third round of high-level talks with the United States," Han 
said. 
  The foreign minister told lawmakers that North Korea and the 
United States met Tuesday and Wednesday after holding a contact 
on Feb. 15, the day that North Korea announced its acceptance of 
nuclear inspections, to arrive at some kind of understanding. 
  Han said: "At the recent contacts, Washington told Pyongyang 
that the IAEA nuclear inspections should be completed 
satisfactorily and that suspension of `Team Spirit,' the South 
Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, should be realized only 
after an exchange of special envoys between South and North 
Korea. Only then, U.S. officials stressed, can North Korea and 
the United States hold the third round of high-level talks. But 
North Korea is insisting that the third round of high-level 
talks be held at an early date." 
  Once Pyongyang and Washington meet for the third round, 
inter- Korean dialogue on pending issues including 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula can start. In 
addition, consultations between the IAEA and North Korea on 
instituting full nuclear safeguards can move forward. He 
emphasized that to solve completely the nuclear problem, IAEA 
inspection of Pyongyang's two undeclared nuclear sites and 
mutual inspections by South and North Korea should be carried 
out. 
  "If it is disclosed that North Korea diverted nuclear 
material for other than peaceful purposes as a result of the 
IAEA inspection, or if it is deemed unsatisfactory, then North 
Korea will again face a serious situation," Han said. 
  The goverment expects North Korean action to enable the IAEA 
to begin nuclear inspections immediately, so that a solution to 
the problem can be found, according to Han.

  [Text] A 29-man North Korean military delegation led by 
Cho Myong-nok, commander of the North Korean Air Force, returned 
home last week from its long visit to Iran for the promotion of 
Iranian-North Korean military and nuclear cooperation, agreeing 
on the promotion of mutual military, nuclear cooperation, an 
Arab weekly published in Paris reported. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reported that the North Korean delegation 
consisting of experts in military technology returned home after 
signing an agreement for the promotion of new military, nuclear 
cooperation with Iran, but did not provide details. The North 
Korean Government news agency KCNA reported on 12 January that 
the North Korean delegation led by Commander Cho Myong-nok was 
visiting Tehran but neglected to mention the purpose of the 
delegation's visit. The Iranian Government press made no 
mention of the North Korean delegation's visit. 
  Western and Arab sources reported that during the North 
Korean delegation's visit to Iran, the two sides probably 
conducted intense discussion on the issue of test launches in 
Iran of the Nodong-1 medium-range missiles that have been 
developed by North Korea with Iran's financial assistance. 
Diplomatic sources speculated that the North Korean delegation 
may have visited Iranian military and nuclear facilities, 
including the (Shad) missile test base located 320 kms east of 
Tehran.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- China has invited 
North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit Beijing some time 
this year after March, a month when top South Korean and 
Japanese leaders would visit China, the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST 
reported on Friday. The daily, quoting Chinese diplomatic 
sources, said Kim Chong-il, the heir to and son of Kim Il-song, 
would also visit China before summer this year. The sources 
observed it is almost certain that Kim Il-song would accept the 
Chinese invitation. 
  The paper quoted the sources as saying that China is 
inviting 
the top leaders of South and North Korea and Japan in a move to 
demonstrate its influence in Northeast Asia. It seems Kim 
Il-song would ask for China's economic aid and cooperation and 
also its support for Kim Chong-il as the next ruler of North 
Korea, the POST said. Kim Il-song is also interested in meeting 
China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to affirm the "lips and 
teeth relations" between China and North Korea, said the paper 
adding that Deng would agree to meet Kim on a private basis.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning 
chief called for effective use of both macroeconomic and 
microeconomic measures Friday [25 February] as a way to reduce 
the nation's huge current account surplus. The large Japanese 
surplus is not "satisfactory" for the global economy, Manae 
Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA], 
told a regular press conference. 
  As one of the macroeconomic measures, the EPA will hammer 
out 
ways to shift huge individual savings in Japan to housing 
investment and social infrastructure, Kubota said. 
  The booming housing sector has a great potential for further 
demand, she said. 
  Quicker improvement regarding the current account balance 
could come with deregulation and other microeconomic policies 
that have "sharper" effects on a short-term basis, she said. 
  Kubota cited import promotion and government procurement as 
possible microeconomic areas in which the government could take 
more action. She said the EPA will include these macro and 
microeconomic measures in a market-opening package to be 
unveiled by the government by the end of March. 
  Kubota reiterated that the 2.8 percent forecast by the 
government as the ratio of the current account surplus against 
gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, 
is not a target but is only a reference figure. Such an area is 
not within government control, she said, noting that a country's 
trade balance is affected by external factors such as the 
international situation and economic activities of foreign 
countries. 
  She said Japan's current account balance figures have failed 
to meet original government projections in most years since 
fiscal 1955. 
  Kubota called for effective use of her agency's trade 
ombudsman system in monitoring Japan's trade balance changes. 
The office of trade and investment ombudsman was inaugurated 
Friday as a way to gauge the openness of Japan's markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa wants measures on further liberalizing the Japanese 
market to be decided by the end of March, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters Friday [25 February]. 
  Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, 
gathered at Hosokawa's official residence Friday to start 
determining the specifics of an earlier-announced government 
plan to open up the domestic market. 
  Aimed at overcoming the deadlock in Japan-U.S. "framework" 
trade talks, the plan includes encouraging imports and 
investment, lifting regulations, facilitating the procedures 
involved in government orders and spurring competitive policies. 
The government hopes the measures will help allay criticism 
mounting in the United States over Japan's huge trade surplus, 
and stave off the possibility of U.S. retaliatory measures. 
  The Japanese officials started discussions on the 
government's policy to introduce liberalizing measures for the 
automobile, auto parts and insurance markets -- three areas in 
which Japan spurned U.S. requests to set "numerical import 
targets."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Japan will formulate a set 
of fresh measures to open its markets further to foreign 
competition by the end of March, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Friday [25 February]. 
  The decision emerged at a meeting of related cabinet 
ministers held at prime minister Morihiro hosokawa's official 
residence. 
  The top government spokesman quoted the premier as telling 
the meeting that it is natural for Japan to take necessary 
market- opening steps on its own volition, regardless of its 
trade negotiations with the United States. 
  Takemura told a news conference the planned government 
package will not only cover four areas pinpointed earlier but 
will also include other necessary measures to further open 
Japan's markets. 
  The government said last week it will map out a program to 
speed up deregulation, strengthen import and investment 
promotion steps, revamp competition policy and improve 
government procurement processes. 
  Friday's meeting brought together Hosokawa, Takemura and 
chiefs of the foreign, finance, trade, posts, health and 
transport ministries, as well as those of the Economic Planning 
Agency and of the Management and Coordination Agency. 
  The schedule of the next such cabinet meeting is not yet 
fixed, Takemura said. 
  The cabinet meeting came as the U.S. is increasing pressure 
on Japan to slash its huge trade surplus following the collapse 
of bilateral trade talks. 
  On February 11, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
failed to strike a deal on ways to cut Japan's trade surplus 
with the U.S. Tokyo spurned a demand from Washington to set 
numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to 
imports. 
  Asked if Japan will maintain its position of refusing 
numerical targets in working out a fresh market-opening package, 
Takemura said, "of course, that's our basic stance." 
  He said no ministers referred in their meeting to an idea of 
setting nonbinding targets for measuring progress in opening 
Japan's markets. 
  Takemura also said they did not discuss a proposed dispatch 
of a special envoy to the U.S. to break the deadlock over trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Friday [25 February] 
Japan needs to show it is making efforts to open its markets if 
it is to avoid a trade dispute with the United States. 
  Kumagai was asked at a news conference to comment on a move 
by some U.S. lawmakers to introduce a bill aimed at reducing the 
U.S. chronic trade deficit with Japan. 
  "The move had been expected in the aftermath of Japan saying 
`no' (to U.S. demands) at the Japan-U.S. Summit. It is 
important for Japan to demonstrate it is making efforts to open 
its markets so that we can avoid an exchange of retaliatory 
measures," Kumagai said. 
  Kumagai revealed he has urged the auto industry to map out a 
voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto components. 
  Washington's displeasure over Japan's stance has been 
"significantly strong," he said, adding that the industry should 
play a leading role in improving the situation. He said he 
expects automakers to make "a wise judgment" on the matter. 
  Kumagai also voiced the government's resolve to do whatever 
it can do to expand Japanese auto imports from the U.S. He said 
it is not convincing to ignore everything that the U.S. says 
about the matter by citing the principle of free competition.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Japan will devise a package 
of measures to further open its markets by the end of March in a 
move to head off further conflict with the United States, 
government officials said Friday [25 February]. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said the package will feature 
a 
plan to whittle down Japan's current account surplus to 2.8 
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the new fiscal 
year. "As long as Japan runs as much as 59.3 billion dollars of 
surplus with the U.S., we cannot have understanding from the 
international community," he told reporters after a special 
cabinet meeting on the trade dispute with the U.S. 
  Hata quickly added that the figure is a goal, not a pledge. 
"We cannot make a pledge on such matters because of volatile 
factors such as foreign exchange and interest rates," he said. 
  The proportion cited by Hata is an official target announced 
earlier in the government's economic forecast which covered a 
broad range from economic growth, to prices, to trade balances. 
  Japan's current account surplus was 3.32 percent of the 
gross 
national product (GNP) in fiscal 1992 and 2.62 percent in 1991. 
The proportion is estimated at 3.1 percent for the year ending 
March 31. GDP represents GNP minus net inflow of income from 
abroad. 
  At a press conference after the special cabinet meeting, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quoted Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa as saying it is natural for Japan to 
voluntarily do what it can, regardless of its trade negotiations 
with the U.S. 
  The collapse of the bilateral "framework" trade talks 
earlier 
this month refueled U.S. anger over what it perceives as 
exclusive markets in Japan. A couple of days after the talks 
broke down, Washington threatened to impose sanctions over a 
bilateral feud concerning Japan's cellular phone market. 
  Washington is moving to revive the Super 301 provision of a 
1988 trade act which authorizes the government to identify and 
retaliate against "unfair" traders. Refusing to yield to such 
pressure, at least on the surface, Hosokawa has repeatedly said 
Japan will pursue market liberalization regardless of external 
prodding. 
  The newly planned market-opening measures will not only 
cover 
the four areas pinpointed earlier but contain other necessary 
steps such as a review of Japan's 10-year plan to spend a total 
of 430 trillion yen on public works projects, Takemura said. 
  The earlier-announced measures involve further deregulation, 
promotion of imports and foreign investments, acceleration of 
government procurement processes, and revamped policy on 
competition. 
  Friday's meeting brought Hosokawa together with Takemura, 
Hata, and other chiefs of the ministries of finance, trade, 
posts, health and transport, as well as chiefs of the Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA) and the Management and Coordination Agency. 
  Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also told a separate press 
meeting that the need to draft the package had been felt since 
the moment the prime minister said "no" to the U.S. demand to 
fix quantitative targets for Japan's imports at the February 11 
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Kumagai reportedly told the cabinet that not only 
market-opening steps, such as deregulation, but macro-economic 
steps should be included in the package. 
  EPA Chief Manae Kubota opposed the proposed inclusion of the 
2.8 percent surplus-to-GDP proportion in the package. She told 
a press conference that few of past government surplus targets 
have been realized since the agency started compiling such 
figures in 1955.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The Japanese Foreign 
Ministry on Friday [25 February] rapped moves in the United 
States to draw up a bill targeting trade with Japan, saying it 
is "unproductive" that Washington would draw such a bill 
unilaterally. 
  "We think it is unproductive that the United States would 
draw up these bills unilaterally," Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Terusuke Terada said. He said the Japanese Government is making 
efforts to hammer out voluntary measures to open up its market, 
holding a cabinet-level meeting earlier in the day to discuss 
the matter. 
  Terada was commenting on moves by a group of U.S. lawmakers 
led by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt Thursday to 
introduce legislation requiring the U.S. Government to retaliate 
against Japan unless the Japanese meet some U.S.-set import 
targets. 
  The bill, or the Fair Market Access Act of 1994, requires 
the 
Commerce Department to define "objective criteria" for what the 
U.S. feels would be a fair market share in Japan for U.S. 
products. The bill was the second salvo this week from Congress 
on the troubled U.S.-Japanese trade relationship. 
  On Tuesday, two key U.S. senators on trade matters submitted 
legislation to revive the so-called "Super 301" trade law, a 
measure that would require the U.S. Government to cite unfair 
foreign trade practices on an annual basis and retaliate if no 
settlement is reached through negotiations. 
  Terada said the U.S. understanding that past bilateral 
agreements with Japan have had no results at all is wrong, 
saying there is "clear proof" that the two sides have made 
steady results out of the past arrangements. 
  As such proof, he cited that Japan is the second largest 
market for exports of U.S. products and that NTT's [Nippon 
Telegraph &amp; Telephone] procurement of foreign goods has 
increased 46 times over 13 years ago when an agreement was made. 
  He also said there were 11 cases in 1993 in which Japan 
purchased supercomputers and that six of them were U.S.-made 
supercomputers. 
  "So we can't understand the discussion on the other side of 
the Pacific Ocean that the past arrangements were ineffective, 
or that there were no results," Terada said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 
2318 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a 
live 33- minute interview with Former Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, 
political commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University 
Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo, with 
frequent and lengthy commercial messages. 
  Asked by Kuroiwa about the present state of Japan-U.S. 
relations, Miyazawa says: "I am worried about the relations. 
This is not the time for the prime minister to say that an 
adult Japan-U.S. relationship has been built. It is important 
to bring Japan-U.S. relations back to a normal state." Miyazawa 
also says: "Japan-U.S. relations are important to the two 
countries and the two countries should give consideration to 
their importance." 
  Asked by Kuroiwa to comment on the breakdown of the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks, Miyazawa says: "It is wrong for the 
United States to stick to its demand for setting numerical 
targets. I told President Clinton when we met last April that 
numerical targets are no good. The President expressed an 
understanding of my view. It is said that the President did not 
ask for numerical targets at a meeting with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa." Miyazawa also says although he does not know the 
details, the President and Prime Minister Hosokawa had enough 
time to bridge the differences between the bureaucrats of the 
two countries. On the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. framework 
talks, Miyazawa says, "Given the importance of Japan- U.S. 
relations and the responsibility of the two countries to the 
international community, the breakdown of the framework talks is 
not a good thing." 
  After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified 
American researcher on future Japan-U.S. relations, the subject 
returns to Japan-U.S. trade friction. Discussing the trade 
friction, Miyazawa says, "Japan must keep in mind that relations 
with the United States have reached the point where the United 
States is now applying pressure on Japan to change its trade 
stand." 
  Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says: "I 
believe that what is at issue is the relationship between the 
leaders of the two countries. Since Japan and the United States 
are contacting each other in a broad range of areas, some 
problems are bound to arise in certain areas and I believe it is 
normal that such problems are arising. It is important for the 
two countries to restore a venue for dialogue." 
  Miyazawa also says: "I believe that Japan should expand its 
domestic demand. Taken individually, Japan has no choice but to 
deal positively with the issue of automobile, government 
procurement, and insurance one by one. The figure of $50 
billion or $60 billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United 
States cannot be drastically reduced. Japan has no choice but 
to take efforts to reduce the trade surplus and work to have the 
United States understand its efforts." 
  Asked by Murayama to comment on Japan's moves to take its 
case to GATT if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, 
Miyazawa says: "It is good for Japan to do so. What the latest 
GATT multilateral negotiations concluded is that the 1988 
Omnibus Trade Act's Super 301 provision runs counter to GATT 
rules. The United States has been told by GATT not to restore 
the provision. Nonetheless, the United States still intends to 
restore the provision, and this is problematic. I believe that 
it is good for Japan to take its case to GATT if the United 
States slaps sanctions on Japan." 
  Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says: 
"European nations think that numerical targets are ridiculous. 
If Japan takes its case to GATT and a GATT arbitration panel is 
set up, Japan can win. European nations are saying that $60 
billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United States is too 
huge and the Japanese market should be opened wider." 
  After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified 
American researcher, the subject returns again to Japan-U.S. 
trade friction. Asked by Takemura to comment on U.S. criticism 
of the Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "This time, the 
President criticized the Japanese bureaucracy. It is reasonable 
for the President to intend to accomplish a lot during his term 
of office. The President criticized officials of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. I think his criticism was an 
expression of his view that Japanese politics should exercise 
leadership more aggressively." 
  Discussing future Japan-U.S. relations, Miyazawa says: 
"Trade relations between the two countries are a part of 
Japan-U.S. relations. What is most important for Japan's 
diplomacy is to maintain friendly relations with the United 
States. The United States places its relations with Japan at the 
top of its foreign policy agenda. Since the two countries have 
contacts in a broad range of areas, some problems are bound to 
arise and the problems will not disappear. The two countries 
are aware of this. Leaders of the two countries should work to 
prevent the people of the two countries from feeling unfriendly 
toward each other." 
  Commenting on Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "The 
Japanese bureaucracy is very good at doing what is precedented, 
but it is not good at doing something new. I think that doing 
something new should come from the political leadership." 
  Discussing a realignment of the political parties, Miyazawa 
says, "There will be no realignment of the political parties 
within this year." Miyazawa also adds: "Some have argued for 
amending the Constitution to promote Japan's military buildup. 
I think that the economically effective military buildup is the 
development of nuclear weapons and this is what Japan can do. 
If Japan posses the nuclear weapons, it should not use them. 
If it does not use them, it would serve nothing. The 
management of nuclear weapons is very difficult. If Japan was a 
dictatorial nation, it could easily develop them. Japan should 
not become such a nation. It is very difficult for any nation 
to keep its deterrent without using the nuclear weapons. I 
believe that Japan should not develop such nuclear weapons." 
  The interview ends at 2351 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The United States could 
face unexpected economic problems if interest rates continue to 
rise amid inflationary concerns, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said 
Friday [25 February]. 
  The U.S. economy "remains in a steady growth trend" since it 
posted a six-year high growth of 5.9 percent in its real gross 
domestic product (GDP) in the final quarter of 1993, the 
Japanese central bank said in its monthly overseas economic 
report. 
  But with the strong growth increasing inflationary pressure, 
the Federal Reserve Board recently announced a "preemptive" 
monetary policy change, sending short- and long-term market 
rates higher, the report said. 
  The best scenario the U.S. appears confident to attain is to 
slow down real GDP growth to the 3 percent level in 1994 with 
stable prices, a BOJ economist said. 
  But that "scenario could fail if long-term rates continue to 
rise firmly," he said. 
  Turning to European nations, the central bank said in the 
report that the British economy is maintaining a "moderate 
recovery led by personal consumption." 
  Germany and France "have yet to grasp clear clues for an 
economic recovery with domestic demand again turning stagnant 
since early autumn amid continued tough labor adjustments," the 
report said. 
  The BOJ official said both nations could see some bright 
signs again in summer, particularly in Germany, where the 
Bundesbank is expected to maintain its "cautious" credit easing 
to support the economy while preventing inflation, he said. 
  Asian nations are continuing to grow strongly led by China, 
the report said. 
  China is maintaining "high growth driven by capital 
investment," posting a hectic 13 percent expansion in 1993. But 
inflation also remains over 20 percent. 
  This was despite Beijing's efforts to stem overheating to 
stop inflation. 
  South Korea is posting a "clearer recovery, bolstered by 
increased exports and construction spending," the report said. 
  Other newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and countries 
of 
the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are 
maintaining "relatively high growth on the whole, supported by 
expansion of intra-regional trading and of 
infrastructure-related investment."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Honda Motor Co. will try to 
boost exports from its U.S. Ohio transplant this year by 80 
percent from last year to 75,000 vehicles, positioning it as the 
largest auto exporter in the United States, a company official 
said Thursday [24 February]. 
  "We will be increasing exports to Japan of our Accord and 
Civic models from Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. Our 
decision was backed by strong demand in Japan, as well as by the 
appreciation of the yen against the dollar," the official said. 
  The decision was also made in line with the commencement of 
sales in Japan on March 1 of Ohio-made Accord wagons and Accord 
coupes, he said. 
  Honda of America's top export regions will be Japan, 
followed 
by Taiwan, Europe, Israel and Latin America. A few more 
countries in Latin America could be added to the U.S. unit's 
current list of 28 export countries, bringing the total as high 
as 32, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The Food Agency said 
Friday [25 February] it has found mold or discoloration in 141 
tons of imported table-use rice out of 50,000 tons of rice 
distributed to local prefectures in February. 
  Of the total, the agency found that of 14,000 tons of rice 
imported from California, 1.7 tons had mold. 
  Such rice was found in local bureaus in Chiba, Gifu, Aichi, 
Kochi and Kagoshima Prefectures. 
  The agency said the rice in question reached Tokyo and Kobe 
ports in December. 
  As for imported rice from China, the agency found mold in 
0.6 
tons of rice out of 16,000 tons. It also found discolored rice, 
which had turned brown or black, in 139 tons of rice from China. 
  Such Chinese rice was found in bureaus in 11 prefectures, 
including Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka and Saga. 
  No problems were found with Thai rice in local bureaus as 
the 
produce had been checked before being sent to outlying areas. 
  The agency said the amount of problem rice was within the 
expected limit, noting, "it is inevitable to have (some) mold 
after transportation on the sea surface." 
  It said problem rice has not been passed on to consumers. 
  Japan recently began importing rice on an emergency basis 
due 
to a bad crop last year owing to unusual summer weather.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will visit Russia from March 19 to 21 for talks with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, government officials said Friday [25 February]. 
  Japan and Russia have been working out the schedule for the 
trip after Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and 
his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Panov earlier this week agreed 
on Hata's visit in March. Fukuda and Panov agreed during two 
days of meetings in Moscow to promote political dialogue between 
the two nations and continue talks on a long-standing 
territorial dispute involving four Russian-held islands off 
Hokkaido. 
  Conditions for Hata's visit were set after Yeltsin vowed 
Thursday in an address to Parliament to continue efforts to 
settle the territorial row with Japan and conclude a peace 
treaty, the officials said. 
  Japan claims sovereignty over Etorofu, Kunashiri and 
Shikotan 
islands and the Habomai group of islets, which the former Soviet 
Union seized at the end of World War II. The dispute has 
prevented the two sides from concluding a peace treaty. 
  But analysts say Tokyo and Moscow are unlikely to achieve 
any 
major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's visit 
because ultrarightists and conservatives, opposed to returning 
the islands to Japan, dominate the new Russian Parliament. 
  During his visit, Hata may also meet Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of Parliament, the 
officials said. 
  Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for Russia's 
reform 
efforts and shift toward a market-oriented economy in his talks 
with Russian leaders, they said. 
  He is also likely to discuss promoting personnel exchanges 
between the two nations, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Russia on Friday [25 
February] released 21 Japanese fishermen detained for 
encroaching in its territorial waters off Japan's northernmost 
main island of Hokkaido since last May, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Patrol boats from Japan's Maritime Safety Agency escorted 
the 
fishermen from the Russian side off Shikotan Island, one of four 
disputed Russian-held islands, at around noon, the officials 
said. 
  The two patrol boats returned to Nemuro, Hokkaido, on Friday 
night. 
  The release brought the number of Japanese fishermen still 
detained in Russia to 23, the officials said. 
  Of the 21 fishermen, four were detained May 18, one May 22 
and the other 16 February 7. 
  They were detained in waters near the four disputed islands, 
the officials said. 
  The first four fishermen were captains of No. 3 Shoryo Maru, 
No. 8. Ryuho Maru, No. 23 Shinei Maru and No. 11 Hirafu Maru. 
  Another captain of No. 51 Seisho Maru was detained May 22. 
  Those detained earlier this month were crew members of No. 
58 
Aiei Maru and No. 53 Kimi Maru, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Commericial air traffic 
over Siberia is being limited by the need for translators by 
officials in Khabarovsk to communicate with airline pilots, 
officials said Friday [25 February] at the close of talks aimed 
at relaxing restrictions in Russian airspace. 
  Russian officials attending the four-day talks explained 
that 
to ensure the safety of flights over Siberia it is necessary to 
limit the number to six per hour, even though new facilities 
have been built to enhance the reliability of communications 
equipment. 
  The Russian officials suggested that a parallel route could 
be established over Siberia that would allow nine filghts an 
hour, but Japan said the proposal would require building new 
radar facilities. 
  However, Japan said it would consider the proposal. The two 
countries will meet again in mid-March. 
  A Japanese Transport Ministry official said Friday that 
officials were unaware that translators were being used. They 
stressed that the need for improved traffic control in the 
Siberian route will increase with the opening of the Kansai 
International Airport in September. 
  Russia, citing the diminished reliability of its 
communication facilities, has been restricting the number of 
commercial flights over Siberia since December to six per hour, 
only a third of the previous volume of traffic. 
  The restriction initially caused delays of as much as two 
and 
a half hours for flights in and out of Narita Airport, and even 
though the situation has improved since then, flight delays of 
30 to 40 minutes are still common, officials said. 
  The Siberian route is the main air route linking Japan and 
Europe, used daily by some 40 to 50 airliners both into and out 
of Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Japan and Europe differed 
Friday [25 February] over prospects for Japanese auto exports to 
the European Union but agreed to follow up talks as early as 
next month. Europe expects demand to remain flat this year in 
the 12-nation union, while Japan expects a "slight increase," 
both sides said after two days of preliminary talks in Tokyo. 
  Neither side would specify their differences over Japan's 
export quota for this year. 
  While minimizing the discrepancy over overall market 
forecasts, chief European auto negotiator Guy Clauser said the 
two sides "certainly" differed over how many vehicles Japan 
should be allowed to export for the year. 
  "The question of a gap is a matter of perception," he said. 
"I shall refrain from giving you my perception." 
  Clauser and an official of Japan's Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry told separate press briefings that both sides 
agreed to meet again soon. Clauser said they would try to meet 
by mid-March to respond to each other's projections. 
  The talks are part of an annual monitoring of Japan's 
exports 
to Europe through 1999, when export limits will be phased out. 
They do not cover "transplant" cars made in Europe by Japanese 
manufacturers, which Clauser said are free and "welcomed." 
  European passenger car and light commercial truck sales fell 
15.9 percent to 11.74 million vehicles last year, while Japan 
cut its exports by 18.5 percent to 980,000 vehicles. 
  Clauser said those figures, showing a bigger proportional 
cut 
in Japanese exports than the total market decline, did not 
necessarily mean that Europe is seeking further cuts for this 
year. 
  The 1993 results matched a September revision of an April 
plan to cut Japanese exports 9.4 percent for a market originally 
expected to decline by just 6.4 percent. 
  The different views of the European auto market for this 
year 
stem from divergent views of the region's economic conditions, 
the Japanese official said. For example, Europe insists that 
even if its economy should pick up, unemployment will not fall 
easily, he said. 
  The trade official also said Japan called for quick 
unification of Europe's various auto certification standards. 
Clauser said the 12 nations have agreed to unified 
certification by 1996 but that not all the countries have 
enacted laws to that effect.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO --- Air Canada will open 
routes to Japan after the new Kansai International Airport opens 
in September, the Transport Ministry said Friday [25 February]. 
  Ministry officials said the two countries agreed at 
bilateral 
talks held in Tokyo that Air Canada will operate four Boeing 747 
flights weekly between Canada and the new airport. 
  Air Canada thus follows Canadian Airlines International, 
which already serves routes between Japan and Canada.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0030 GMT on 20 February, in its weekly 75-minute 
"Discussion" program which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a 
15-minute live interview with Sakigake Secretary-General 
Hiroyuki Sonoda on the prime minister's planned cabinet 
reshuffle, regrouping of parties, and other political issues. 
The interview is conducted by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto 
and Tokyo University professor Takeshi Sasaki. 
  Asked how he views Prime Minister Hosokawa's planned cabinet 
reshuffle, Sonoda says he believes the prime minister is hoping 
to change the chief cabinet secretary. When Yamamoto asks what 
are reasons for the reported discord between Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, Sonoda says 
"their relationship remains unchanged" although their positions 
in the government are different. Asked to comment on a reported 
crack in cooperative ties between the Japan New Party [JNP] and 
Sakigake, Sonoda says it is necessary to coordinate views within 
the two parties on any future merger. Asked when is the 
appropriate timing for cabinet reshuffle, Sonoda says: "It is 
desirable to reshuffle the cabinet after the ordinary Diet 
session because he will have enough time." Asked if Sakigake is 
opposed to an immediate cabinet reshuffle, Sonoda replies: "I am 
sure that if he really wants to reshuffle the cabinet, the prime 
minister will consult not only with Sakigake but also with other 
parties. Our party will present our view when consulted by the 
prime minister." Sonoda also notes: "We have never thought of 
leaving the ruling parties." He then discusses what Sakigake 
head Takemura has done in the cabinet as Chief Cabinet 
Secretary, noting: "I think it is most desirable that Mr. 
Takemura remain in the cabinet if Prime Minister Hosokawa really 
needs Sakigake as a prop for his cabinet." 
  Yamamoto asks about the possible formation of a new 
political 
force involving Sakigake, Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and 
the SDPJ, [Social Democratic Party of Japan]. Sonoda says there 
are many things to be carried out before the formation of a new 
political force, saying: "I do not think we should decide at 
present on the formation of a new political force." 
  Asked if he supports the idea of establishing a "tripolar" 
structure among the SDPJ-DSP-Sakigake, Shinseito-Komeito, and 
the LDP, Sonoda says: "I am of the opinion that under the 
single-seat constituency system, the political world will be 
dominated by two big political forces in the future." He adds: 
"What is most important is that the ruling parties should 
cooperate with each other in the next election so that the 
coalition government will be further stabilized."

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa reiterated Friday [25 February] he will canvass leaders 
of the seven coalition parties before deciding on any cabinet 
reshuffle, denying he has already decided on the timing for a 
realignment. "I have not yet considered (the timing of a 
cabinet reshuffle). It is too early," Hosokawa told reporters at 
his official residence. 
  Hosokawa said he will soon confer again with Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo 
Ouchi, both of whose parties belong to the coalition. 
  In a meeting Thursday, Murayama and Ouchi told Hosokawa that 
an immediate cabinet reshuffle is unnecessary. They renewed 
their opposition to a shakeup expected to center on removing 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. 
  Hosokawa denied reports that he has asked Foreign Minister 
and Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata to assume the post of chief 
cabinet secretary and Hiroyuki Sonoda, a member of Sakigake 
(Harbinger), to take the post of deputy chief cabinet secretary. 
"I have never asked them, nor yet considered it. It's too 
early," Hosokawa said. 
  Government sources said Hosokawa is likely to hear from the 
ruling party leaders separately sometime over the weekend or 
early next week. 
  The cabinet reshuffle, if realized, will be the first since 
Hosokawa launched the coalition government last August after 
ousting the now-opposition Liberal Democratic Party after its 
38-year rule. 
  Ouchi, also health and welfare minister, told a regular 
press 
conference he is opposed to any early cabinet reshuffle that 
could "crack the foundations of the coalition government." 
  Of the coalition's seven parties, the SDPJ, the DSP and 
Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the 
restructuring plan while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and 
Komeito [Clean Government Party] support it. 
  Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's 
political future. Hosokawa has reportedly considered working 
toward the two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito, 
but Takemura has voiced objections. 
  In Oita, southern Japan, Murayama said Hosokawa is likely to 
renew his consultations with ruling party leaders, including 
himself, in early March to discuss the possible cabinet 
reshuffle. 
  Citing Hosokawa's remarks Thursday that he may consider a 
reshuffle after the Diet passes an amendment to the political 
reform package, Murayama said, "in case there is a reshuffle, 
the premier said he will surely consult (with us)." 
  Murayama, who was speaking to a labor union's local 
convention, said that when he meets Hosokawa again he will 
repeat his stance of opposing an early cabinet shakeup. 
  The chairman of the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling 
parties, also denied that he would enter a new cabinet, saying 
"the SDPJ is not in such a position now." 
  Murayama said he supports labor leader Akira Yamagishi's 
idea 
of forming a new liberal party to compete against two 
conservative parties expected to be established before the next 
general election. 
  Yamagishi, head of the eight-million-strong Rengo labor 
organization, reached a broad agreement on Thursday with 
Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to aim at establishing a new 
liberal party. 
  The new party is likely to be formed by uniting the SDPJ, 
the 
DSP and Sakigake, possibly under the leadership of Yokomichi, 
who once served as SDPJ's House of Representative member before 
becoming the governor of Japan's northernmost prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will likely launch a political shake-up next week, an 
action that could weaken his political leverage and pave the way 
for a split in his six-month-old administration. 
  Political sources said Hosokawa has decided to carry out a 
reshuffle of his 21-member cabinet sometime next week, possibly 
around Thursday [2 March], despite strong objections from some 
of his main coalition partners. 
  Speaking to a group of reporters at his official residence 
Friday, Hosokawa denied that he has already decided on the 
timing of the cabinet reorganization. 
  "I have not yet considered (the timing of a cabinet shake- 
up)...It is too early," the prime minister said. 
  At issue is whether Hosokawa will sack or remove to an 
alternative important cabinet post Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, nominally his top aide. 
  The sources said Hosokawa wants to take such action because 
of the recent emergence of differing political ideas with 
Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), a small partner in the 
seven-party coalition. 
  The early cabinet reshuffle is favored by two other 
coalition 
parties -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), co-headed by the 
coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, and the 
Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  It is opposed by Sakigake, the Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest component in the coalition, and 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  Rivalry between the two blocs intensified this week as 
Hosokawa proposed a parliamentary alliance of the ruling parties 
to compete with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) in the next general election, likely to be called this 
fall. 
  The election for the House of Representatives will feature a 
new electoral system with 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 
seats chosen by proportional representation. 
  Hosokawa's new proposal marks a departure from his 
previously 
stated desire to establish a multiparty system in Japan and 
signals his inclination to work for a two-party system. 
  The two-party system is advocated by Shinseito and Komeito 
but is opposed by Sakigake, the SDPJ and the DSP, which favor a 
"moderate multiparty system." 
  The new proposal was apparently made because published media 
simulations have shown that the LDP, ousted from power last 
August, will dominate the lower chamber unless the ruling 
parties act as one and run only one candidate in each 
single-seat constituency. 
  The alliance proposal immediately came under fire from 
Takemura, who called it "imperialistic" and "expansionist," 
leaving a deeper crack between him and Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa was hit by another shock wave this week in the form 
of an announcement that a rising political star and a top labor 
leader have basically agreed on the formation of a new liberal 
party. 
  The agreement was reached between Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro 
Yokomichi, once dubbed "prince of the socialists," and Akira 
Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong Rengo labor 
federation. 
  The accord calls for the unification of the SDPJ, Sakigake 
and DSP into a "Democratic Liberal Party." 
  Yokomichi, elected to the lower house four times since 1969 
and the governorship three times since 1983, is poised to return 
to the central political stage, probably to head the new party. 
  Yamagishi said Japan's political parties will be molded into 
three forces -- the conservative LDP, a new conservative party 
and the new liberal party. 
  On the economic front, a high-ranking U.S. trade official 
will arrive in Tokyo on Friday to resume subcabinet-level 
negotiations with Japan on automobile and auto parts trade 
between the two countries, informed sources said. 
  Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for internal 
trade, is now on an export promotion mission in Asia. 
  The auto and auto parts trade is viewed in Washington as the 
key focus in the "framework" trade talks between the United 
States and Japan. 
  The coming Tokyo consultations follow ruptured trade talks 
in 
Washington earlier this month between Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  Garten is expected to reiterate the U.S. demand to set up 
"objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese 
market, which Tokyo strongly opposes, describing it as "managed 
trade." 
  Important economic indicators to be released next week 
include housing starts for January, a quarterly business outlook 
(tankan) by the Bank of Japan, foreign currency reserves as of 
the end of February and governmental fiscal 1994 economic 
outlook figures. 
  On Monday, the Japan Sumo Association will announce the list 
of rankings for the spring grand sumo tournament. 
  On Wednesday, a World Boxing Association (WBA) junior 
featherweight title match will be held in Tokyo between champion 
Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto Rico and challenger Yuichi Kasai of 
Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan's steel exports in 
1993 rose 23.8 percent from 1992 to 23,506,000 tons, exceeding 
20 million tons for the first time in four years, an industry 
group said Thursday [24 February]. The Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation [JISF] said the exports, on a shipment basis, also 
posted the third consecutive year-on-year rise. 
  It attributed the sharp export growth to increased exports 
early in the year to China, whose economy is sharply expanding. 
  The dollar value of the exports rose 9.3 percent, but the 
yen 
value dropped 4.1 percent, due to the yen's appreciation against 
the dollar, the federation said. 
  The unit price of all exports dropped to 73,400 yen per ton, 
down 21,400 yen from the previous year. It was the lowest 
average unit price in six years. 
  Despite an increase in export volume, export earnings showed 
little growth, industry officials said, predicting exports in 
1994 will level off from 1993 both in volume and value. 
  The federation also reported exports to China increased 
2.9-fold to 6,910,000 tons. 
  Shipments to Taiwan rose 19.0 percent to 2,910,000 tons and 
those to South Korea increased 1.5 percent to 1,670,000 tons. 
But exports to the United States plunged 30.6 percent to 
1,820,000 tons. 
  Steel imports in 1993 increased 3.6 percent to 9,185,000 
tons, the federation said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 24 KYODO -- Japan's imports of crude 
oil in January fell 3.7 percent to 151.71 million barrels for 
the sixth consecutive month of decline from year-earlier levels, 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Thursday 
[24 February]. 
  The United Arab Emirates was the biggest supplier of crude 
oil to Japan with 38.43 million barrels, followed by Saudi 
Arabia with 30.95 million barrels, Iran with 15.91 million 
barrels and Indonesia with 11.95 million barrels. 
  The amount of crude oil processed in January came to 140.14 
million barrels, up 2.3 percent from a year earlier. 
  Production of fuel oil increased 4.2 percent to 127.50 
million barrels, rising for the sixth straight month. 
  Domestic sales of fuel oil edged up 0.7 percent to 132.97 
million barrels, gaining for the second consecutive month. 
  Fuel oil imports dropped 4.1 percent to 17.30 million 
barrels, affected by sluggish imports of C-type fuel oil. Fuel 
oil exports jumped 53.2 percent to 11.45 million barrels.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The Postal Ministry said 
Friday [25 February] it will raise postal insurance premiums by 
an average 10.3 percent, effective April 1. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said a ministry 
advisory panel, the Postal Services Council, approved on Friday 
the first premium increase in 46 years for new postal insurance 
policies. 
  The raise is necessitated by a fall in interest rates, which 
has cut the estimated yield on investments of insurance funds, 
ministry officials said. 
  They said the premiums will be increased by 9.7 percent for 
ordinary postal insurance and by 17.3 percent for annuity 
insurance. 
  Under the plan, the monthly premium payment for a 10-year 
savings-type endowment insurance, which pays 1 million yen for 
death or at maturity, will be hiked to 7,940 yen for a 
40-year-old male, up 8.3 percent. 
  The monthly payment for life annuity contracts, which start 
pension payments at age 60, will be raised to 34,722 yen for a 
50- year-old female, up 37.6 percent. 
  The estimated yield on investments of postal insurance funds 
in fiscal 1993, ending next March 31, has fallen to about 5 
percent from 5.8 percent the previous year and is likely to drop 
to a range of 4 to 5 percent in fiscal 1994, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Defense Agency chief Kazuo 
Aichi said Friday [25 February] his agency will set up a nine- 
member panel to review Japan's 1976 basic defense policy, called 
the National Defense Program Outline. 
  The outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense 
policy 
since 1976, calls for the government to maintain security 
arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up 
Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale 
invasions. 
  Aichi told a news conference that the panel will review the 
outline in line with the debates of a similar advisory panel to 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which will hold an inaugural 
session on Monday. 
  Aichi said, "We must review the outline from both the 
medium- 
and long-term points of view." 
  The Defense Agency panel, chaired by Aichi, comprises 
parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Natsuo Yamaguchi, Vice 
Defense Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama, four top uniformed officers 
and two administrative officials, officials said. 
  Hosokawa's nine-member group will discuss ways to adapt to 
the changed international situation following the end of the 
Cold War. 
  Since his inauguration in August last year, Hosokawa has 
advocated that with the Cold War now ended, Japan should trim 
the size of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and review the outline.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki said Friday [25 
February] his ministry will decide on what system to use for 
high-definition television (HDTV) within a year, instead of by 
summer as earlier planned. 
  Kanzaki said he has asked Akimasa Egawa, director general of 
the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, to launch a private 
advisory group to discuss how to proceed with the HDTV project 
from now on. 
  The minister's advisory group will include representatives 
from the electronics industry, the private broadcasting industry 
and Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), the public broadcasting 
network. 
  NHK already uses analog technology for high-definition 
television broadcasts. HDTV offers crisper images than 
conventional TVs. 
  Egawa caused a stir earlier this week when he said the 
ministry is considering abandoning the analog system in favor of 
digital technology, which would make possible more advanced 
functions, but later reversed his position in response to 
protests from NHK and consumer electronics companies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Breakdown of Japan-U.S. Framework </F>
Talks -- Frantic To Search for `Culprits'"] 
  [Text] Moves are afoot to "search for culprits" 
responsible for the breakdown of Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
Now that the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks, which Prime 
Minister Hosokawa had boastfully described as a venue resulting 
in an "adult relationship" between Japan and the United States, 
have created a situation that is casting a dark cloud over 
bilateral relations between the two countries. As usual, there 
are strong signs that government leaders are trying to shift the 
responsibility for the breakdown of the talks onto others. This 
phenomenon can be regarded as an expression of their irritation 
at their failure to find effective ways to soften the U.S. stand 
on Japan, which is increasingly hard-line. 
  On the evening of 11 February right after the breakdown of 
the Japan-U.S. framework talks, a dinner party was held at the 
official residence of Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kuriyama 
in Washington. The dinner party was attended by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Matsuura, who was in charge of administrative matters 
in the talks, and Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the 
president. At the dinner party, Mr. Matsuura asked Cutter, "How 
do you feel now?" In response, Cutter said "it was horrible." 
  Why did Mr. Cutter said "it was horrible?" An informed 
source in the Clinton administration on 17 February told a 
Japanese Government official whom he has known well for a long 
time: "Mr. Cutter and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Barshevsky have reported to the president that the Japan-U.S. 
framework talks will hammer out agreements. They have reported 
to the president to that effect after a "Japanese close to 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata" had hinted to 
them that the Japanese side was willing to make concessions. 
  On the evening of 7 February, the foreign minister talked 
over a dinner with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale in the 
Foreign Ministry's Iikura Hall. It has been speculated that 
during the dinner party, the foreign minister might have hinted 
that Japan would make concessions and the speculation has 
sparked allegations that the foreign minister is a "culprit" 
responsible for the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
The foreign minister has continued to take a stand against 
numerical targets that have become the hot point of dispute 
between Japan and the United States. 
  The foreign minister was still negative about Japan's 
acceptance of the U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets 
when Deputy Foreign Minister Matsuura reported by telephone to 
him for nearly one hour just before he left on 5 February for 
the United States to begin final negotiations with U.S. 
officials. 
  The prime minister met with cabinet ministers in charge of 
the Japan-U.S. framework talks in his official residence just 
before the foreign minister departed for Washington. During the 
meeting, the Foreign Ministry asserted: "The foreign minister 
will visit Washington for talks with the U.S. side prior to 
Japan-U.S. summit talks, but he will carry no card to play at 
the talks. International Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai 
should go to Washington for the talks." The prime minister and 
the foreign minister came to a final conclusion that the foreign 
minister, who is also "deputy prime minister," will visit the 
United States. Shortly after the meeting at the prime minister's 
official residence, the foreign minister met with senior Foreign 
Ministry officials; the meeting was held in a gloomy atmosphere. 
At the meeting, the foreign minister said: "At the present 
stage, we have no choice but to oppose the U.S. demand for 
setting numerical targets to the last" and then decided to leave 
for Washington with empty hands. 
  A government official who is well aware of these events has 
said: "It had been speculated that at the Hata-Mondale meeting, 
Mr. Hata hinted that Japan would make concessions, but the 
speculation has been exhausted. A senior Foreign Ministry 
official was present and the Foreign Ministry kept a record of 
the meeting. The United States might have misunderstood that if 
it pulled the foreign minister out of Japan to Washington, he 
would certainly come here with a compromise proposal." 
  A Foreign Ministry official has pointed out: "The foreign 
minister simply met with the American ambassador, but the 
meeting has spawned speculation. Ichiro Ozawa met with the 
American ambassador on 7 February and the international trade 
and industry minister met with him on 8 February." 
  Who is the "Japanese person close to the foreign minister"? 
There is a rumor that he is an influential politician who has 
nothing to do with the Foreign Ministry, but the truth still 
remains unclear. This type of approach to the United States 
smacks of the "dual diplomacy" that was often noted during the 
period the Liberal Democratic Party was in power. 
  The United States has complained that Japan plans to cut the 
income tax only for one year, and the foreign minister has been 
criticized for his failure to assuage U.S. complaints at talks 
with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor. In response, the Foreign 
Ministry has refuted the criticism, saying: "The foreign 
minister has stressed that, as a realistic issue, it is 
impossible to cut the income tax for only one year." 
  Recently, President Clinton harshly criticized the Japanese 
bureaucracy as standing in the way of the prime minister's 
reform efforts, while supporting steps taken by the prime 
minister for reforms. In this way, the President made clear 
"his strategy to separate politics from bureaucracy." The 
government and ruling coalition parties are still continuing 
their "research for culprits," and this could make the U.S.'s 
tough trade stand on Japan "effective."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 February Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] In order to bring about a breakthrough in the 
rough-going Japan-U.S. economic consultations, the government 
plans to announce import promotion measures on automobiles and 
auto parts -- the sector of most concern in the talks. 
  In an action with respect to the standards and 
authentication 
system, the Ministry of Transport [MOT] will station officials 
in the United States on a permanent basis to help facilitate 
U.S. auto manufacturers' acquisition of "model certification" 
from Japan. The government will also study how it can support 
import car exhibitions held by the private sector. These plans 
will be incorporated into the "general measures on foreign 
trade" [taigai sogo taisaku] which will be finalized in the 
middle of March. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan 
Motor Company have decided to prepare voluntary import plans 
primarily aimed at buying U.S.-made auto parts in 1995. These 
plans will be announced in March. The government wants to 
secure understanding of the United States by emphasizing that 
both the government and the private sector are making efforts -- 
toward reopening the talks. 
  The government measures will give priority to creating 
circumstances which can contribute to promoting purchases of 
U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts. 
  Model certification is a system whereby the MOT will check 
and determine whether the models of vehicles [to be imported] 
meet the safety criteria of Japan or not. Once certification is 
issued, vehicles of the certified models can be sold in the 
Japanese market without inspection in the country. Since 
inspections of individual vehicles by the government are not 
necessary, the system will contribute to lessening 
manufacturers' burdens. The MOT has decided to give 
preferential treatment to stationing its inspectors in Detroit 
beginning in April to deal with applications for model 
certification by U.S. manufacturers. 
  As far as U.S. demands for easing the standards and 
authentication system are concerned, specific plans will be 
worked out by increasing the frequency of meetings of Japanese 
and U.S. transport authorities' specialists on standards and 
authentication, and by setting a deadline for arriving at a 
conclusion in the meetings. The auto maintenance service 
industry will be advised not to discriminate against 
foreign-made parts. The possibility of the government providing 
support for imports -- in the form of the Japan External Trade 
Organization (JETRO) backing up import car exhibitions and 
business conferences -- is also being considered. 
  With respect to the framework talks on automobiles and auto 
parts, Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan Motor Company will 
prepare and announce their voluntary plans on procurement of 
U.S.-made products in March. They are studying whether to 
indicate procurement plans in monetary amounts. 
  They will also make public details of already-agreed-on 
cooperation projects including sales plans in Japan of vehicles 
from the U.S. Big Three. 
  It is likely that other companies like Honda Motor Company 
and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation will eventually prepare 
similar plans, even though the companies will be presenting them 
as the companies' own purchase plans, and not as "pledges" to 
the United States. 
  Regarding four [as published] other areas including 
government procurement, competitiveness, and deregulation, a 
meeting of cabinet members concerned will be held to finalize 
specific plans on 25 February. The specific plans will include 
adoption of a general evaluation system in some parts of the 
telecommunications, medical equipment, and government 
procurement, and an announcement of the plans will be made on or 
around 10 March.

  [Text] On 22 February, a Foreign Ministry source disclosed 
that the ministry has made firm its decision to tentatively put 
a freeze on internal debates over whether it would be proper for 
Japan to participate in the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC). 
  The Foreign Ministry has made this decision in consideration 
of Japan's relations with the United States, which is strongly 
opposed to the establishment of the EAEC. Circumstances are 
such that even if debates on this issue are resumed in the 
future, it cannot be predicted whether Japan will decide to 
participate in the organization. Thus, Japan's currently 
strained relations with the United States are affecting its 
Asian policy, too. 
  The EAEC plan is aimed at unifying nations in the East Asian 
region. It has its origins in the East Asia Economic Group 
(EAEG) plan proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed 
Mahathir. The United States is strongly opposed to the plan 
because it excludes such nations as the United States, Canada, 
Australia, and New Zealand.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has compiled a tentative set of rules on copyrights 
pertaining to software for multimedia use to help promote the 
growth of the multimedia business which is considered to be the 
most promising field in information-related industries in the 
future. The ministry's proposal includes a plan to set up a new 
"digital information center" where video and audio information 
will be centralized, and their copyrights managed. It also 
provides for database users to freely copy and edit accessed 
data whose authors have registered their copyrights with the 
information center, simply by paying a compensatory fee. MITI 
plans to shortly urge the Agency for Cultural Affairs to make 
revisions to the Copyright Act. So far, producers of multimedia 
software have had to get approval separately from several 
authors to use their data. This has been very time consuming. 
Should MITI's plan materialize as envisioned, the groundwork 
would be completed toward promoting the multimedia business. 
  Multimedia techniques allow free editing of audio and video 
data by computer. For example, it is possible to create a piece 
of work that has a different appearance or capabilities compared 
to the original by changing the colors of a visual image or 
pasting a different image. However, the concept of multimedia 
has yet to be clearly defined. There may be broader 
applications depending on future technological advances. 
  However, audio and visual data which serve as the raw 
materials in the production of multimedia software are protected 
by copyrights. Before multimedia software producers can use 
such data, they must get approval from the respective copyright 
holders. Particularly since multimedia software is 
characteristically produced by combining a wide variety of 
copyrighted data, it is necessary for users to locate all the 
copyright holders and negotiate with them on royalties. 
Therefore, it has been very time and money consuming. 
  According to MITI's proposed set of rules, authors can 
voluntarily register their copyrights with the digital 
information center, and prospective users can go to the center 
where they will have access to a complete list of available 
copyrighted data along with their respective royalty fees. 
These fees paid by users will be collected by the information 
center which will in turn reimburse the copyright holders. In 
this way, users will be relieved of having to search for 
individual copyright holders. 
  MITI's plan also calls for revision of the current Copyright 
Act regarding a provision which prohibits editing an item in a 
manner not in line with its author's beliefs. Specifically, the 
plan calls for permitting free editing of data as long as such 
editing does not discredit its author who can file a suit with 
the court to forbid objectionable acts only when he judges that 
he has been discredited. 
  Other major industrialized nations are also faced with 
difficulties regarding the handling of copyrights on 
multimedia-related items. An idea which is very similar to 
MITI's plan to set up a centralized body to handle such 
copyrights has surfaced in the United States. 
  However, it is still uncertain whether MITI's plan will 
simply be accepted as it is by the Agency for Cultural Affairs 
and its Copyright Council, which are reviewing whether it would 
be necessary to revise the Copyright Act.

  [Text] It has been learned that U.S. Secretary of Energy 
Hazel O'Leary has sent a letter to the Power Reactor and Nuclear 
Fuel Corporation [PRNFC] regarding a video which the 
organization produced to promote the use of plutonium as nuclear 
fuel, according to information received by the Citizen's Nuclear 
Information Center from a U.S. civic group on 21 February. In 
the promotional video entitled "The Plutonium Story: Pluto-Boy, 
Our Reliable Friend," there is a scene where an animated 
character representing a little boy drinks water containing 
plutonium. In her letter, O'Leary has urged the PRNFC to 
withdraw its videotapes. The PRNFC has admitted receiving the 
letter. 
  The PRNFC produced 200 videotapes last spring to publicize 
the current situation regarding its use of plutonium as nuclear 
fuel. In the video, an animated character called "Pluto-Boy" 
appears and explains the harmlessness of plutonium. There is a 
scene where Pluto-Boy drinks water containing plutonium, saying 
that "even if plutonium is ingested along with water, the body 
discharges it, hardly absorbing any of it." 
  O'Leary sent a letter dated 7 February to Takao Ishiwatari, 
president of the PRNFC, urging him to consider withdrawing the 
videotapes. In the letter, O'Leary said: "There have been 
reports (about the videotapes) in many U.S. newspapers. To say 
that it is safe to drink water containing plutonium is a gross 
underestimation of the dangers of plutonium. It is potentially 
dangerous, even in very small amounts, whether it is ingested or 
inhaled. It is urged that an advertisement be produced to 
publicize that strong measures are being taken to prevent the 
release of plutonium into the environment, instead of an 
advertisement that may mislead the public about the dangers of 
plutonium." 
  In response, a spokesman for the PRNFC said: "It is known 
that plutonium is discharged from the body even when ingested, 
and there are hardly any effects of its radiation on the body. 
Details of the videotapes are accurate, and we have no 
intention of withdrawing them." 
  Experiments with animals have shown that when inhaled in 
powder form, plutonium adheres to the surface tissue of lungs 
and bones, leading to cancerous growths. The element is said to 
have strong radioactive toxicity, with one gram equivalent to 
the maximum tolerable intake for tens of millions of people in 
one year.

<F P=106> [By Tetsuro Hanari] </F>
  [Text] There are growing concerns within the government 
over arguments in the United States and South Korea that "Japan 
may arm itself with nuclear weapons." Some officials just laugh 
off the arguments because in actuality, there is absolutely no 
possibility of Japan's altering its "three nonnuclear 
principles." However, a senior official at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "So far, 
relations [between Japan and the United States] in the security 
arena have been stable. But if they become unstable, bilateral 
economic issues will also become complicated." It is feared that 
the nuclear arguments might become a factor to further intensify 
trade frictions between the two countries. 
  A MITI source, who recently was asked in an unofficial 
meeting about the possibility of Japan's arming itself with a 
nuclear arsenal, pointed out, "It will be no surprise to the 
United States and European nations to see Japan, an economic and 
technological superpower, beginning to develop nuclear weapons." 
  Since the cold war era, the United States and European 
nations have dangerously confronted each other backed by their 
nuclear deterrents. It seems that they never understand the 
special feeling, or antipathy, that the Japanese have toward 
nuclear weapons as the people of a nation that suffered an 
atomic attack. 
  One of the reasons that the nuclear arguments have surfaced 
is the foreign countries' lack of understanding and their 
distrust of Japan's nuclear energy policy, which permits the 
nation to bring in plutonium from France and store it. The 
aforementioned MITI source said he was asked "why Japan has to 
store plutonium when it has no intention of developing nuclear 
weapons." 
  In addition, the fact that Japan initially did not give its 
full support to an indefinite extension of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) has spurred the arguments. The 
NPT, which expires in 1995, allows only the current nuclear 
powers to possess nuclear weapons. Because of this, some 
Japanese Government officials and Liberal Democratic Party 
members asked, "Is it right for Japan to abandon a nuclear 
option while the DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear 
weapons?" 
  The Foreign Ministry persuaded those who opposed the NPT's 
indefinite extension to agree to a plan to announce Japan's 
support for the indefinite extension at the G-7 summit meeting 
(Tokyo summit) last July. The ministry, however, failed to 
change Japan's conventional and vague stand on the NPT. 
Although the present coalition government decided to "support" 
the indefinite extension after it was inaugurated, this fact 
seems not to be fully known to foreign countries. Also, a 
successful launch of the H-2 rocket has deepened foreign 
suspicions because the rocket can be converted into a missile. 
  Besides such developments, it has long been rumored in the 
United States and the ROK that Japan might equip itself with 
nuclear arms because of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program. 
  Washington officially takes the stand that "Japan will not 
turn to developing nuclear weapons." However, U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry recently stated that Japan and the ROK 
might begin to develop nuclear arms once the DPRK succeeded in 
its nuclear development. 
  The problem is that such arguments have surfaced at a time 
when the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks have broken down. 
The Clinton administration, which is irritated by the chronic 
trade deficit with Japan, is calling on Tokyo to accept its 
"numerical target" proposal. The administration's distrust of 
Japan has deepened. So far, bilateral relations in the security 
arena have remained stable, but the aforementioned senior MITI 
official noted, "Japan should express its intention to not 
develop nuclear weapons not only in words but also in deeds."

  [Text] Ruling coalition parties and the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] held the fourth meeting of the "Consultative Council 
on political reform" on and off at the Diet building on 22 
February to discuss details of a joint amendment draft of the 
Political Reform Law. The ruling parties basically agreed to 
accept the LDP's proposal that a regulation on a limit on the 
public raising of funds for political parties should be included 
in the Law on Fund Raising for Political Parties. However, the 
ruling parties and the LDP failed to agree on the LDP's other 
proposal that "corporate status should be given to political 
parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which 
will receive subsidies. They will discuss this issue again and 
also the issue of the regulation on funding limits on 24 
February. 
  Regarding an issue of setting a limit on the public raising 
of funds for political parties, both sides basically agreed on 
the LDP's proposal that the amount of public funds allowed to be 
raised should be limited to less than two-thirds of the amount 
of revenue -- which does not include the amount of funds 
political parties raised publicly during the previous year. 
Concerning the issue of giving corporate status to political 
parties, they failed to reach an accord because participants 
from the ruling parties, one after another, said: "Giving 
corporate status to political parties would invite intervention 
by the administration. There is a possibility that `the freedom 
of association' will be violated by restricting political 
parties' activities. This issue should be cautiously discussed."

<F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, president of the Japanese </F>
Confederation of Trade Unions (Rengo), by MAINICHI SHIMBUN; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you envision the future 
realignment of political parties? 
  [Yamagishi] I anticipate the present political parties will 
ultimately merge into two political parties. Given the 
diversified values of the people, the present political parties 
should be merged not into two conservative parties, but into one 
conservative party and one nonconservative party. I anticipate 
the realignment of the present political parties will go through 
a tripolar party structure under which Conservative Party A, 
Conservative Party B, and one nonconservative party coexist. 
Conservative Party A is like the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] and Conservative Party B is a non-LDP conservative 
party or a new conservative-oriented party. They will be formed 
by social democrats, centralists or liberal forces. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you elaborate on the 
nonconservative 
forces? 
  [Yamagishi] They are the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party, the United Social 
Democratic Party, Sakigake [the Harbinger Party], the Japan New 
Party, and reformist members of the LDP. Conservative Party B 
must be formed on the premise that it does not take a hostile 
and confrontational stand against the other parties, but 
cooperates with them and shores up the framework of the 
coalition government. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you anticipate the political 
parties will be realigned? 
  [Yamagishi] I think the present political parties will be 
merged into two political parties late this century or early in 
the 21st century. It is highly possible that the tripolar party 
structure will emerge after the next general elections. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the next general 
elections will be held? 
  [Yamagishi] From a commonsense point-of-view, I think they 
will be held after next autumn. Next year, local elections and 
lower house elections will be held. The ruling coalition 
parties opposed the simultaneous elections for both houses of 
the Diet as a violation of the Constitution when they were 
opposition parties in the past. The political parties will be 
unable to fight in the general elections immediately after the 
upper house elections because of the limit of their financial 
capabilities and energy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you think the ruling coalition 
parties will fight in the next general elections? 
  [Yamagishi] It is better for them to uphold their present 
coalition framework. They should not fight in the next general 
elections with their policy differences unbridged. Their 
coalition might be seen as a common-law marriage [yago]. Two or 
three ruling coalition parties should aim for high-level 
electoral cooperation by concluding a policy agreement. They 
should make utmost efforts to coordinate their views so as to 
field a single candidate. Political forces that oppose the 
concept by (Shinseito and Komeito) of forming a new party cannot 
come to power. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of moves to reshuffle 
the cabinet? 
  [Yamagishi] The moves are presumptuous. It is said that the 
cabinet reshuffle is surfacing because of emotional 
confrontation between Mr. Hosokawa (the prime minister) and Mr. 
Takemura (the chief cabinet secretary), but I believe the 
cabinet reshuffle is surfacing after two political forces in the 
ruling coalition parties clashed. I have high expectations of 
Mr. Hosokawa as a leader of the liberal forces. Their emotional 
wrangling will never be a plus for Japanese politics. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What policy will become a watershed for 
the realignment of the political parties? 
  Yamagishi: The policy must define how Japan should share 
international responsibility. The policy should also place its 
priority on people who work by the sweat of their brow. 
Specifically speaking, the policy should place its priority on 
the direction of promoting social fairness, decentralization, 
and democracy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi a 
leader of the nonconservative forces? 
  [Yamagishi] It is good for the new party to maintain a 
collective leadership system. There are many candidates for 
leader: Satsuki Eda (director general of the Science and 
Technology Agency), Mr. Takemura, Mr. Hosokawa, and defectors 
from the LDP. It is impolite to call Mr. Ozawa leader of the 
nonconservative forces because he pursues the new conservatism. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do the policies of those leaders not take 
on an anti-Ozawa tinge? 
  [Yamagishi] Mr. Yokomichi and other former governors are all 
qualified to become a leader of the nation. I believe they are 
able to fashion comprehensive policies and come up with 
ideologies to prepare Japan for the 21st century. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not time for you to play a role in 
the political world? 
  [Yamagishi] If I am asked to cooperate, I will cooperate 
within the permitted limits.

  [Excerpts] The final-year students from training course 
No.25 of the University for Development of National Races [UDNR] 
paid a courtesy call on Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and 
commander of the Defense Services, at the Pyithu Hluttaw 
Building's Mingala Hall at 0900 this morning and received the 
words of advice from him. [passage omitted] 
  At the ceremony, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the SLORC 
and commander of the Defense Services, acted as a chairman while 
Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, director general of the Office of 
the SLORC, acted as master of ceremonies. [passage omitted] 
Continuing, he said the Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and 
National Races and Development Affairs was founded, and this 
ministry was given the sole responsibility to implement the 
development activities. The separate ministry was founded 
because the government has a genuine goodwill for the rapid 
development of our people. We are carrying out these 
development activities because we want the people in the remote 
areas to be like us. 
  These development activities are being implemented with this 
objective. We are in a position to implement these activities, 
and some people understand about this. That is why the armed 
organizations are joining us. At the same time, there are some 
armed organizations who have yet to understand our efforts. 
That is why we, with genuine goodwill, are inviting these 
remaining groups at the present by making the utmost efforts. 
However, we have a problem because the fixed political belief 
still prevails among our national races and the armed 
organizations. That is, the enemy still sticks to the old 
political idea that its enemy is weak or there is a withering of 
strength within its enemy, and it can exploit politically and 
militarily when its enemy makes a proposal for negotiations and 
for making peace. We honestly invited them, but they still 
continue to hold on to the old political idea by thinking that 
we are facing crises and problems, and they can establish 
political and military exploitation; they ignored the 
development of their own country, and they are trying to exploit 
the situation to benefit their own party or organization. They 
do not understand. 
  That is why we are patiently inviting certain organizations. 
For instance, we are still inviting the KNU [Karen National 
Union] and Mon. We are inviting them with good intentions and 
goodwill. We are doing so not because we do not have enough 
strength. We are doing it to stop the bloodshed and killing 
among the national races. Our country obtained independence 
more than 40 years ago. What is going to be the position of our 
people in the present situation? Although our country is rich, 
we are poor due to the lack of peace and unity. 
  If our country is peaceful, and all of us work together, 
then 
our people will become prosperous, and our country will become a 
peaceful and modern state because of the wealth of our country. 
We have been fighting for about 40 years. We are all national 
brothers. Enough is enough. One should see the mistakes by 
now. One should see the right things by now. One should 
consider the country. We should work for the development of our 
country. It is time to repay the historical debt owed the 
country because one should understand by now that even though 
there were chances for our country to become rich, it was left 
undeveloped because of the killings and fighting. By 
understanding this, one should say to oneself that we owe the 
country and will repay the historical debt by working toward the 
establishment of peaceful and modern state. However, some do 
not have this kind of goodwill. [passage omitted] 
  The ceremony ended at 1000.

  [Text] The following is a report on the attack and 
complete destruction of the first major military campaign 
launched by the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government on the Anlung Veng battlefield. 
  I. The Anlung Veng battlefield command and the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] General Command wish to announce 
that the first major military campaign launched by the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government on Anlung 
Veng Battlefield was attacked and smashed to pieces at 1330 on 
24 February 1994, repeat, at 1330 on 24 February 1994. 
  II. The attack and destruction of the offensive constitutes 
destruction of the first major military campaign conducted by 
the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government. 
  III. It is worth recalling that the campaign aimed at 
destroying the liberated area of Anlung Veng was launched in 
September 1993 while the two-headed government leaders went to 
the UN Headquarters in New York. 
  After a battle of over one month, the troops of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were 
routed completely. Many of them were killed or wounded, but they 
all were privates because their commanders were staying away in 
Siem Reap or on Route 68 in Samraong. This first major military 
campaign considered by the Vietnamese communist puppets and 
two-headed government to be a final battle was planned for 
November 1993, but it was repeatedly postponed because there 
were not enough troops. It was only at the end of December 1993 
that a second major dry-season offensive on the Anlung Veng 
battlefield began. After six or seven days of fighting, the 
so-called second major offensive was completely defeated. 
  IV. Since then, especially in January 1994, a final major 
military campaign was planned to destroy the Anlung Veng area 
from all directions; that is, two directions from Route 68 
[words indistinct], one direction from Sre Noy, one direction 
from Rum Chek, and one direction from Kulen. The plan was 
repeatedly revised by the Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese 
communist puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government. 
They were busy purchasing ammunition; mustering troops from all 
provinces and districts; gathering all available armaments, 
tanks, armored carriers, trucks, multiple rocket launchers, and 
cannons [words indistinct], mobilizing their troops, and so on. 
The plan was to destroy or force Democratic Kampuchea to 
surrender and accept their three conditions by ignoring the five 
points of the king; it constituted the most serious crime and 
was aimed at doing away with the Cambodian nation and people in 
accordance with the strategy of swallowing Cambodia via the 
Vietnamese communists' military and human war. 
  The plan can be summarized as follows: 
  1. 70 or 80 percent of important troops nationwide were 
mobilized; 
  2. 70 or 80 percent of assorted light and heavy armaments 
nationwide were deployed; 
  3. 90 percent of commanders -- most of them are generals 
-- nationwide were gathered on the battlefield [words 
indistinct]; 
  4. The alliance exerted its all-out effort in maneuvering 
according to its ability and the situation. 
  5. The alleged major campaign of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets, two-headed government, and the alliance began at the 
beginning of January 1994. After nearly 30 days of fighting, it 
was, however, destroyed for the third time. On 9 February, they 
marshaled all their troops to launch a fourth assault. The 
battle was hardfought, and it was only on 18 February that the 
invaders were surrounded by the NADK and people near Anlung 
Veng. Their troops have remained in the death square as the 
nearly 400,000 troops of Marshal [name indistinct] were routed 
[words indistinct] in a manner recalling Stalingrad in World War 
II and the fate of the more than 80,000 French troops of Gen. 
[Ducas] destroyed at Dien Bien Phu. After six and a half days 
of fighting, the invaders were destroyed. 
  6. This is the greatest defeat of the Vietnamese 
communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, the two-headed 
government, and the alliance, which continue the strategy of 
destroying Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and national 
reconciliation, opposing the king, and promoting war with the 
aim of swallowing Cambodia once and for all. It constitutes a 
defeat for the clique and a victory for our entire nation and 
people and the peace-loving countries of the world. It also 
represents a success for the five-point national reconciliation 
force of the king. 
  7. Nevertheless, our nation and people's enemies have 
never renounced their strategy. Therefore, we should heighten 
and reinforce our vigilance to decimate their criminal stratagy 
for the sake of our nation's reconciliation and genuine peace.

<F P=106> [By Aris R. Ilagan] </F>
  [Text] The right wing Young Officers Union (YOU) accused 
the government yesterday of insincerity and unpreparedness in 
the ongoing talks with the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
(RAM) [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance], resulting in a 
deadlock in the peace negotiations. 
  In a statement signed by Captain Magtanggol Santos, YOU 
spokesman, the group accused the government of resorting to 
propaganda tactics in discrediting the rebel movement. "Some 
people tend to believe or, in fact, delude themselves into 
believing, that we have agreed to participate in the peace 
process because, according to them, we are already a spent 
force, weak, marginalized, irrelevant, and needing only a 
graceful exit to save our face," Santos said. "This is 
self-serving government propaganda line. The fact is, we are 
now ahead and right at the center of our people's hearts and 
minds," he said. 
  Since the signing of the preliminary cease fire agreement by 
the representatives of the government led by Defense Secretary 
Renato S. De Villa and the RAM last 23 December, the peace 
negotiations between the two parties "have not even reached a 
substantive portion of our talks because of the unpreparedness 
of the government to set up the grievance mechanism and 
seriously discuss the issues," he said. 
  Government representatives in the peace talks with right 
wing 
rebels have called on the RAM-YOU leadership to return to the 
negotiating table for the resumption of the talks. 
  In their message for the 8th anniversary celebration of the 
EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] Revolution the YOU called 
on the leaders of the government and the civilian sector to 
reflect since the country is still suffering from economic and 
social difficulties. 
  They also criticized the national leadership for its alleged 
failure to curb graft and corruption and lavish government 
expenditure. The YOU faction of the right wing group is 
believed to be composed of junior officers who took part in the 
failed December 1989 coup.

  [Text] The Supreme Command has asked the United States to 
consider legal action against anti-Vientiane fighters Gen Vang 
Pao and Gen Khonglit Chokbengbun for alleged illegal activities 
in Thailand. An Army source said the two, now naturalized 
Americans who were named in a Supreme Command complaint to the 
police on Wednesday, were believed to be in the United States. 
  The request was conveyed through the US embassy in Bangkok 
as 
well as through the Thai military attache in Washington, the 
source said. He said a similar request was conveyed to Canberra 
on Wednesday through the Australian Embassy's military attache 
here in case the two might be in Australia. 
  Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Laotian border after 
the 1975 defeat of the US-backed Hmong guerrillas by the 
Communist government in Vientiane. He then migrated to the 
United States from where he frequently returned to Thailand, the 
Army source said. 
  According to the source, the United States could possibly 
arrest the two generals and extradite them to Thailand under a 
law which prevents Americans from trying to subvert foreign 
governments. However, the Supreme Command's Intelligence chief 
Col Chanya Warakhamin said the Army had not yet asked the United 
States to arrest the two. But he said the United States had 
made suggestions on legal angles which could be used to allow 
action to be taken against them. He did not explain. 
  The Supreme Command on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the 
Crime Suppression Division asking the police to arrest the two 
for violating Thailand's national security laws by organizing 
the United Independent Front and Laos United Independent Force 
and making forays into Laos to carry out sabotage. The 
complaint also covered Vang Pao's followers in Thailand. 
  The move signalled the Army's complete break from the 
generals who in the past were allies to the Thai Army and 
American troops in the anti-Communist movement along the 
Thai-Laotian border. 
  Washington had always refused Thai requests for cooperation 
to stop Vang Pao, saying the US government did not support him. 
  On Aug 20 last year, the supreme commander ordered that 
action be taken against anti-Vientiane guerrillas residing in 
Thailand, Col Chanya said. 
  The Army has mounted a campaign to suppress the guerrillas 
during the past two years which led to the arrests of dozens of 
Vang Pao's supporters and members. Legal action has been 
limited to immigration law violations. 
  "Most of them were arrested, checked for possession of 
weapons and sent back to whichever country they had come from," 
Chanya said. 
  Chanya said the Army had run out of patience in trying to 
thwart the group's activities so it had to resort to asking for 
the arrest of the two leaders under criminal law. 
  Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday said there was 
evidence that the two generals had raised money from Lao 
expatriates in the United States on a monthly basis to help the 
Lao liberation movement in Thailand. 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he believed 
the police would be able to trace the movements of the group as 
its members frequently crossed back and forth along the 
Thai-Laotian border.

<F P=106> [Report on the meeting between Lieutenant General Khin </F>
Nyunt, secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, and Kachin Independence Organization leaders in 
Myitkyina, Kachin State, on 23-24 February] 
  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the 
Work Committee for Development of Border Regions and National 
Races and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council [SLORC], and his entourage left Yangon [Rangoon] on the 
morning of 23 February in a military airplane and arrived at 
Myitkyina Airport in Kachin State at 1015. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt was accompanied by Lt. Gen. Maung Thint, 
minister of progress of border areas and national races and 
development affairs; Lt. Gen. Kyaw Min, minister of mines; Vice 
Admiral Than Nyunt, minister of health; Brigadier General Myo 
Thant, minister of information; Colonel Pe Thein, minister of 
education; U Soe Tha, minister of communications, post, and 
telegraph; responsible officials from the Office of the SLORC; 
directors general and managing directors from departments 
concerned; and other responsible officials. [passage omitted] 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and his entourage proceeded to the 
Northern Military Command headquarters where they were welcomed 
by Kachin national leaders. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, SLORC 
secretary-1; and Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin 
State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the 
Northern Command, then held a separate meeting with the KIO 
[Kachin Independence Organization] leaders -- U Mali Zut Zaw 
Mai, U Lamon Tu Jai, U Gori Zaw Saing --and intermediaries -- U 
Lawan, U Sabwegyun, and U Khun Myat in the office of the 
commander. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Khin Nyunt] Today can be described as an 
auspicious day for the Union of Myanmar [Burma], for the entire 
national people, for Kachin State, and for the indigenous people 
residing in Kachin State. I describe today as auspicious 
because the peace talks between our SLORC delegation and the KIO 
delegation have reached a successful conclusion [nyein-chan-ye 
sway-ne-hmu aungmyinhmu ya de achay-ahne myo yauk te atwet]. 
  This is attributed to our mutual consultations and talks 
following the state's goodwill invitation to the armed 
organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. The 
KIO held honest and sincere talks after realizing the genuine 
goodwill of the state. Following these talks, our two sides 
reached an understanding and we were able to realize peace as a 
result. [end recording] 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that since Myanmar's 
independence 40 years ago, there has been armed conflict with 
the KIO for over 30 years due to differences of views. However, 
conditions have changed under the SLORC administration. He said 
there can be a problem in a family due to differences of opinion 
among the family members, but such a problem is only temporary 
and they are not antagonisms which last for a lifetime. 

    He said it is our conviction that the time has come for 
indigenous people to reunite and reconcile. Therefore, the 
SLORC has invited the indigenous armed organizations to return 
to the legal fold. He said the two sides have reached 
agreements and achieved peace because the KIO, which welcomed 
the government's invitation, has held honest and sincere talks 
with mutual understanding. 
  [Begin Khin Nyunt recording] We have reached this stage. 
So, what do we do for the next stage? We must work for 
progress and development of the Kachin State and the ministers 
and senior departmental heads have come along with me to do this 
work. We will work for the progress and development of Kachin 
State with these persons. 
  I estimate that Kachin State has lagged behind in 
development 
for over 20 years. We will all work in unison with momentum and 
cooperate in order to make up for the backwardness. The 
government will provide assistance and the indigenous people 
residing in the Kachin State as well as the KIO must cooperate. 
I dare say that if the three sides cooperate and work in 
unison, the development of Kachin State, which has lagged 
behind, will accelerate. [end recording] 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that in setting 
priorities for development projects, priority will first be 
given to construction of roads and bridges, opening of hospitals 
and clinics under the health sector and schools under the 
education sector, and promotion of appropriate technology and 
crops which are suitable to local conditions under the 
agriculture and livestock breeding sector. He said there is 
plenty of land suitable for forestry and cultivation of crops in 
Kachin State, but land has not been cultivated due to armed 
conflict. If these lands are reclaimed and put under 
cultivation, the economy of the state will develop at an 
accelerated rate. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that endeavors for national 
development schemes and national unity during the SLORC 
administration of over five years are known to all. Endeavors 
are being made with the objective of developing Myanmar into a 
modern and developed nation on one hand, while efforts are being 
made for the emergence of a firm constitution while upholding 
the three cardinal causes -- nondisintegration of the union, 
nondisintegration of national unity, and perpetuation of 
national sovereignty. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that 
priority is being given to border region development with a view 
to promoting unity among national people while drug eradication 
is also carried out. At the same time, he explained, the state 
has been working for peace with genuine goodwill by inviting the 
armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. 
  He said mutual understanding has been reached with the KIO 
today and that outstanding success has been achieved and he 
attributed the success to the mutual goodwill and sincere 
efforts of the state government and the KIO. He said he 
believed that peace could certainly be achieved if the remaining 
Karen, Mon, and Karenni armed organizations in the jungles hold 
frank, cordial, and sincere talks with the state government with 
genuine goodwill. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the KIO will have to continue 
to work in order to participate legally in the process of 
emerging a firm constitution. He said once there is a 
constitution, Kachin State will be led by Kachin nationals and 
other states will be led by their nationals concerned. In order 
to have such leadership, it is necessary for all nationals to 
participate in working for a firm constitution. 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the National 
Convention has obtained 104 basic principles on which such a 
firm constitution should be based and that panel discussions are 
being held to discuss details of the basic principles relating 
to each chapter. Once the discussions are completed, [the 
reports] will be submitted to a plenary session of the National 
Convention. Details relating to the 104 basic principles such as 
the chapter heading on the state, state structure, and head of 
state are currently under discussion. He said the KIO needs to 
observe the National Convention. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said the ministers and departmental 
heads 
in his entourage have prepared for the development of Kachin 
State. He disclosed that the Ministry of Progress of Border 
Areas and National Races and Development Affairs has allocated 
over kyat 20 million for building Myitkyina-Tanai-Nanyun Road, 
Mogaung-Kamaing-Longin Road, Hopin-Kontha-Nyaungbin Road and 
that electric generators, motor vehicles, and assistance have 
been collected for distribution. He said priority will be given 
to agriculture in working to develop Kachin State and the state 
will provide technology, machinery, seeds, and fertilizers in 
the areas where the state wants the KIO to give priority. If 
the peasants work hard the development of Kachin State, which 
has fertile lands, will accelerate. He said the state will set 
up economic enterprises which are viable. He explained that as 
Kachin State becomes peaceful and prosperous, travel throughout 
the state will become possible and international tourism will 
develop. He said international tourists will be interested in 
Indawgyi region and confluence point [of Irrawaddy River] and if 
these areas are made attactive, the development will take place 
in a short time. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that if the people of Kachin State 
endeavor and work together in unity, and if the KIO cooperates 
in areas where it is able, then Kachin State will certainly 
develop. 
  In conclusion, he said, the SLORC is striving with genuine 
goodwill to reestablish solidarity among the national peoples, 
ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, prevent any 
loss of national independence, and strive toward the emergence 
of a modern and developed nation. He said now that the KIO has 
joined hands with the SLORC in these endeavors, there will be 
greater momentum in our work. He said he could see that the 
Union of Myanmar will emerge as a modern and developed nation in 
the near future if the remaining indigenous armed organizations 
come to realize the genuine goodwill of the national government, 
as the KIO has, and work hand in hand with honesty and 
sincerity. Therefore, he said, the time has now come for the 
national peoples and indigenous armed organizations to join 
hands with the state government with genuine goodwill, the 
correct attitude, and honesty. 
  Next, Kachin national leader U Zaw Mai [KIO deputy chairman] 
delivered a speech. He said the KIO took up arms and went 
underground in the jungle in 1960-61 when its demands for the 
rights the Kachins lost prior to 1962 and during the era of the 
AFPFL [Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League] government were 
rejected. He said there was a plan to establish a separate state 
at that time. After much political experience, however, we 
conducted a review to determine whether our policy was correct. 
We then adopted a policy of not seceding from the union. But 
there are still groups that have not accepted this decision. 
They are observing the situation. They will gradually develop 
faith in the government when they witness the success of 
projects carried out with genuine goodwill by the state 
government. 
  [Begin Zaw Mai recording] What kind of goodwill does the 
SLORC government currently have toward the country? We will 
observe whether these are only words or if they are carried out 
in practice. I have studied the state leaders' speeches in 
detail. I have also studied the radio and newspapers as well as 
the (?personalities). Only after four or five years, the SLORC 
government's goodwill toward the national peoples and the 
nation. [sentence as heard] Of course, there is one thing: The 
SLORC government is human; we are all human. We cannot say 
everything done by humans is correct and complete. 
  Then there was the state government's invitation to the 
armed 
organizations in the jungles to come out and hold talks. They 
went to the extent of saying that if we did not like it we could 
go back and continue to fight. At first, I thought they could 
possibly be correct. U Bran Seng, our chairman, submitted it to 
the Central Committee, and it was discussed thoroughly at the 
central level. We deliberated whether the time had come to make 
peace; whether it was supported by the people. The government 
side welcomed it, but what was the people's view? We 
deliberated for two years, considering what our views were 
toward the present government. We sent people throughout Kachin 
State. We sent them everywhere -- Putao, (Hopet), Tanai, 
Mogaung, Mohnyin, Bhamo, Shwegu, and the Kachin region in 
Northern Shan State -- and asked for the people's views. We did 
not ask everyone. We asked people who had political knowledge or 
were interested in politics. These people included veteran 
politicians, former senior public servants, and educated people. 
The general view was that the situation was good, and we were 
urged to try. We were advised to watch what they were doing, 
and if it did not work to go back to the jungle, as allowed by 
the Myanmar Government side. We were urged to try, and our 
Central Committee took the matter under consideration. 
  After that, our Central Committee adopted a policy that 
said: 
Do not promise what you cannot fulfill, but once a promise is 
made follow through; that is, do not go back on your word. Once 
we decided to undertake something, we must implement it 
accurately. Once we decided to undertake something, we must 
adopt a policy -- a plan -- on how to proceed from one step to 
another. We must set a goal. We adopted a policy of 
participating in some capacity in an endeavor to obtain genuine 
peace and establish a new nation. It is believed that a 
peaceful and prosperous Kachin State will contribute to the 
union. We decided to begin in accordance with this policy. Now 
it has been over a year since we began the peace talks with the 
government. The government and our intermediaries -- three 
people -- patiently initiated this work. That is why, at this 
moment, I would like to say that I will work for the peace and 
prosperity of the entire Kachin State as well as the peace and 
prosperity of the entire union. [end recording] 
  Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman of the Kachin 
State Law and Order Restoration Council, then explained about 
the renovation and construction of roads and bridges in Kachin 
State. After his explanation, the secretary-1 presented gifts 
to the Kachin national leaders and took a group photograph with 
them. 
  The State Law and Order Restoration Council, with a view to 
reestablishing national unity and building peace, held sincere 
and frank talks with the KIO delegation that were marked by 
perseverance and mutual effort. The two sides held five rounds 
of talks in 1993 in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State. 
Understandings and agreements on a cease-fire were reached on 
the morning of 23 February 1994 [apyit-akhat yat-saing-ye 
saing-yar nar le thabawtunhyi-hmu-myar ko]. 
  In the evening, Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman 
of 
the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council, hosted a 
dinner at the Malihka Mansion in honor of the secretary-1, 
ministers, and national leaders. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As negotiations to end the protracted war of more 
than 40 years between the ethnic minorities and the Burmese 
Government were about to bear fruit, news from the Thai-Burmese 
border near Kanchanaburi said that a faction of the New Mon 
State Party led by Lieutenant Colonel Saw and Lieutenant Colonel 
Win Aung -- who control about 5,000 troops -- refused to 
negotiate a cease-fire with the Burmese Government. This is 
despite the fact that Nai Shwe Kyin, leader of the New Mon State 
Party, already agreed to conditions for cease-fire talks with 
the Burmese military junta. 
  A highly-placed source in the New Mon State Party told 
PHUCHATKAN there is a conflict within the party between the new 
generation of leadership led by Nai Thein Aung, which wants a 
cease-fire with the government, and the older generation led by 
Nai Tala Saw Kya. Nai Tala Saw Kya, the group's number three 
leader, does not want to negotiate a cease-fire because he 
thinks it would mean surrender and compromise with the Burmese 
Government. Those who oppose the cease-fire talks are trying to 
gain control of the party's leadership by boosting the role of 
the Mon State Revolutionary Council as the representative of the 
Mon people's struggle. 
  There was a vote on a cease-fire at an earlier meeting of 
the 
party central committee. The majority supported Nai Thein 
Aung's proposal for a cease-fire with Burma because the armed 
struggle has dragged on for decades without any success. To 
them, peaceful negotiations would be a better option. Nai Shwe 
Kyin, chairman of the New Mon State Party, had to accept the 
majority's decision despite the fact that he does not agree with 
a cease-fire. 
  Also according to the source, in mid-February three 
companies 
of Burmese troops launched an attack on the Mon stronghold in 
Daingpu District, in the town of Ye in the south of Burma, close 
to the Thai border at Kanchanaburi. Five Mon soldiers were 
killed and some others were wounded, but the Mon troops were 
able to hold on to the stronghold. There was no report on 
losses among the Burmese troops. 
  The source said the Burmese assault on the Mon stronghold 
could have been an attempt to pressure the Mons because of their 
refusal to negotiate on a cease-fire. Besides, the Burmese 
Government is building a railway from Ye to Tavoy and it has to 
do something to keep the Mons out of its way. 
  Nai Tala Saw Kya, the number three man in the New Mon State 
Party, told PHUCHATKAN that the Mon Revolutionary Council will 
not accept the Burmese Government's cease-fire conditions, 
although it may come under pressure from the Burmese as well as 
the Thai Government, which also wants to see a cease-fire. He 
said a cease- fire with Burma would be a betrayal of the 
national cause. The Mon State Council will pursue the armed 
struggle. He was confident of keeping about 5,000 men under his 
control for the armed struggle. 
  Security officers in Thailand think that the real reason Nai 
Tala Saw Kya rejected a cease-fire with Burma was because he was 
afraid of losing the income he earns from transit fees collected 
from Thai businessmen in logging and fishing deals in Burma. 
This amounts to dozens of millions of baht per year.

  [Text] A total of 500 Malaysian troops serving with the 
United Nations, UN, have been deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
after being delayed in Croatia. Defense Minister Datuk Sri 
Najib Tun Razak said 65 men in two platoons were deployed around 
the Mount Igman area overlooking the besieged capital of 
Sarajevo while the rest were in Konjic and Visoko. 
  He said the delay was due to the land route through 
neighboring Croatia to Bosnia proper being blocked by obstacles 
and the winter weather conditions. He told this to reporters 
after receiving 7,200 packets of goodies for the end of Ramadan 
celebration. The goodies will be flow by Hercules transport 
aircraft to the Malaysian troops in Bosnia. 
  A total of 2,555 Malaysian military personnel are serving 
with the UN peacekeeping operation worldwide, including Somalia 
and their staff officers at the world body headquarters in New 
York.

  [Text] Singapore -- A new bank, Singapore Commercial Bank 
Ltd (SCB), opened recently in Phom Penh, becoming the second 
Singapore bank to do so. SCB pipped five other Singapore firms 
which have been given in-principle approvals to start banks, but 
have not yet done so. SCB's general manager Teoh Sam Ming told 
BUSINESS TIMES that the bank got its licence last December from 
the National Bank of Cambodia, the central bank, and started up 
soon after with a paid-up capital of U.S.$3 million. It offers 
savings and fixed deposit accounts. 
  SCB occupies five shophouses on the prestigious Monivong 
Boulevard, formerly known as Achar Mean Boulevard. SCB, 
registered in Phnom Penh, is owned by Singapore property 
developer Kong Look Sen, who is behind various residential 
buildings and real estate developments in Johor Baru. Mr Teoh 
said that Mr Kong views Cambodia with the same optimism as he 
does China when it began liberalising its economy in 1980s. 
  Mr Teoh said, however, there are operational problems as 
Cambodians are wary of banks because of a massive scam when the 
Khmer Rouge guerillas banned money after capturing power in 
1975. Many Cambodians lost money when banks closed down during 
the rule of the Khmer Rouge. "People still don't trust banks. 
We'll be there first to install safe deposit boxes in Phnom 
Penh, and this will be a major service," Mr Teoh said. 
  He hopes that a new land law will come into force so that 
foreign banks can extend loans and accept land as collateral. 
"Currently, loan applicants are required to transfer their land 
to the bank. But in reality, the applicants have many copies of 
their land titles which they pledge to many banks," he added. 
  About 20-odd foreign banks are operating in Phnom Penh. The 
first Singapore-backed bank opened for business last May just a 
few days before the national elections. 
  Four Singapore businessmen involved in property, diamonds 
and 
pottery invested U.S.$16 million to set up the Singapore Banking 
Corporation Ltd (SBC Bank). The four are Lim Kim Chong, Kun Kay 
Hong, Tay Ah Kiang, and Kwek Meng Kwang. 
  Mr Lim -- who is SBC Bank chairman -- is also chairman of 
Singapore-registered Diamond Industries Pte Ltd, and is involved 
in the property and diamond trade in Singapore, Malaysia and 
Australia. SBC Bank's managing director Mr Kun is in the 
property business. 
  The five Singapore firms given in-principle approvals to set 
up banks are Maya Manufacturing and Trading Pte Ltd , Goodhill 
Enterprise (S) Pte Ltd, Broadland Enterprises Pte Ltd, Wiselink 
Pte Ltd, and a project by Singapore businessmen Khoo Lim Leng 
and Eng Liat Kiang who plan to set up the Euroasia Bank Ltd.

<F P=106> [Opening remarks by ROK President Kim Yong-sam at a news </F>
conference on 25 February at the Chongwadae presidential 
residence on the first anniversary of his inauguration--live] 
  [Text] Dear fellow countrymen: Today is the first 
anniversary of my inauguration as president. On this date last 
year, our people established in this land the government of the 
people and by the people, to which they have ardently been 
aspiring. 
  As president, I eradicated irregularities and corruption 
that 
had been prevailing in this land. 
  I worked with all my heart for the recovery of the economy, 
which had fallen into a swamp of stagnation. I made every 
effort to establish the national discipline so that no one who 
used unjust means could have both power and honor. As 
president, I dedicated all my spirit and strength to push ahead 
with change and reform in this country. 
  Today our society is changing. The people's awareness of 
wealth and honor is also changing. Their awareness of a 
worthwhile human existence is expanding, and they are freeing 
themselves from the way of life of pursuing only material 
abundance. 
  The Chongwadae presidential offices have become closer to 
the 
people. The economy is recovering. The nation's position is 
being enhanced. 
  Clean and healthy energy is springing from the lowest 
stratum of society. We now have hope and confidence for the 
future. However, our reality is still far from the goal we have 
to achieve. You all know that the deep-rooted evils accumulated 
for over 30 years cannot be cleaned up in one day. Corruption 
accumulated for over 30 years is being exposed in various 
incidents and accidents. 
  We have a long way to go and many things to change. The past 
constitution and practice are holding us up. However, I will 
continue with change and reform bearing the historic burden 
entrusted to me. National competitiveness, which we set as the 
goal of this year's national administration, can only be 
achieved externally through opening and competition and 
internally through change and reform. 
  Dear fellow countrymen, I have already talked about the new 
year national administration policy in the New Year's news 
conference and I will only talk about a few points today. 
  First, it is deplorable that national understanding and 
consensus of internationalization is still not sufficiently 
achieved. A hundred years ago, we could not become 
internationalized by self-determination but were forced to open 
the country by external control. Therefore, we fell behind and 
were turned into a colony. In order for us not to repeat the 
mistake we made a hundred years ago in the first opening 
process, we have to spontaneously carry out the second opening 
through internationalization. 
  We have to learn from history. We should not deplore the 
door opening but should open the door ourselves and advance to 
the wide-open world. We have no reason to feel defeatism or 
persecution about the outside. I sincerely felt it last year 
through the Asia Pacific Economic Council summit meeting and my 
visit to the United States. 
  We have the vitality of a cultural nation that has lived on 
for 5,000 years. We have the potential to create miracles on 
the ruins of colonization and war. We are becoming more 
dominant in the world through the establishment of a civilian 
government and reform. Let us all be confident. There is 
nothing for us to envy. No one can block our nation's advance. 
  Second, we have to renew the officialdom. Some of our public 
officials who should lead the change and reform of our community 
are refraining from actions being preoccupied by an easy-going 
attitude and opportunism. 
  Change and reform of officialdom society has become a task 
that cannot be delayed any more. Overweight organizations and 
functions should be boldly reduced. Useless administrative 
regulations should be resolutely abolished. 
  We should turn administration from reigning over the people 
into providing service. 
  The administration field should also introduce the 
management 
concept of business, namely management with high efficiency at 
the least expense. 
  Third, the government will more powerfully push ahead to 
strengthen international competitiveness through economic 
revitalization. This does not mean ignorance of economic 
justice or balanced development. Prompted by the settlement of 
the Uruguay Round negotiations, the government has directed 
profound attention and energy to farmers and fishermen. 
  We will provide intense financial and systematic support in 
order to build rich farms and fishing villages. A new, creative 
farming movement to cope with the challenge of opening up 
started in the rural communities across the country. I consider 
this a very encouraging phenomenon. 
  I would like to make another appeal for management-labor 
harmony in order to realize an economic upsurge. Management 
should make all sincere efforts to make labor--a field of 
technological development and quality promotion--a working site 
full of vigor and excitement. Enterprises that cannot satisfy 
their employees, can neither produce goods that satisfy its 
customers, nor be successful. Workers should set the target of 
their labor movement on upgrading productivity and the standard 
of technology. The issue of wage increases cannot be the only 
goal of the labor movement. The labor movement should be 
consistent with national competitiveness. 
  The government will exert utmost efforts to stabilize price, 
to improve income distribution, and to expand social security. 
Only when the workers, the management and the government form a 
sound trinity, can our international competitiveness be upgraded 
drastically. 
  Fourth, today's civilian government is not yesterday's 
authoritarian government. It is a government with morality and 
legitimacy. The channels and methods for the people to present 
their political opinion have been sufficiently guaranteed. The 
time when illegal struggle was regarded as just has passed. I 
want to make clear that under a civilian government chosen by 
the people, lawlessness and violence will not be accepted under 
any pretext. It is the essential responsibility of the 
government to protect the people from violence and lawlessness. 
  Fifth, I will humbly accept constructive criticism and 
advice 
pertaining to the president and the government. Our government 
and I hope that the opposition party becomes a genuine partner 
in reform, by getting rid of the ruling-opposition party 
relations of discord and confrontation as seen in the past. We 
are looking forward to creative relations between the ruling and 
opposition parties which sincerely strive for and discuss the 
interests, justice, and the future of all of our communities. 
Those who cry for justice should be considered just persons by 
others. When talking about reforms, the person who has set 
examples in reform is persuasive. 
  What we want is the true reform partner and advice on 
reform from the true heart. What we urgently need is reform in 
the field of politics. As long as politics remain in the marsh 
of underdevelopment and nonefficiency, thereby hindering the 
development of other fields, we cannot maximize the strength of 
the country. We cannot advance forward. We cannot win the 
fierce international competition. I hope that clean and 
productive politics in its true sense will be restored in this 
land as soon as possible. I hope, with the people, that 
systematic reform for it will be made as soon as possible. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: Assuming office as president, I 
promised the people that I would devote all my powers to 
national reconciliation and reunification, fulfilling the 
mission entrusted to me by history and the nation. I have never 
for a moment forgotten this promise. In particular, I have been 
doing my best with patience for the peaceful resolution of the 
North Korean nuclear issue. In this connection, I think it a 
very fortunate development that North Korea agreed to permit 
nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  The North Korean nuclear issue is not only a problem 
connected with the survival of the 70-million-strong nation but 
a stumbling block that could stand in the way of reunification 
for good. Therefore, the government has undergone again and 
again the conflicting anguish that we should maintain a resolute 
attitude but should avoid a situation of extremity [kukhan 
sanghwang]. 
  I clearly declare here that if North Korea renounces nuclear 
development and selects the road of genuine dialogue between the 
North and the South I am ready to accelerate North-South joint 
economic development for North-South coexistence and 
coprosperity in the manufacturing, agricultural, construction, 
and energy fields. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: I thank you the people for your 
support and encouragement so that I may carry out my duty as 
president with flawlessly clean morality in view of history, the 
people, and my own conscience. In the future as well, I will 
devote myself to the country and the nation without selfishness, 
devoting all my wisdom and passion for it. 
  What has sustained me over my 30 years of struggle for 
democratization has been my trust in you, our great people. The 
people, together with me, were able to establish a government of 
civilian democracy in this land, so I, with the people, will 
solidify the foundation of a new Korea. This is my hope and my 
dream. A new Korea is my dream and a dream for all of us. The 
dream of the 70 million people will certainly be realized by the 
strength of the 70 million people. 
  A great history can only be made by the sweat, tears, and 
passion of the great people. I will work with perspiration to 
pioneer the glorious future of the fatherland, sharing joy and 
sorrow with the people, toward the new Korea and toward the 
world. 
  The energy of spring is rising up from deep in the earth in 
this land. On this day last year, we started anew with new 
resolutions. Today, we must open a new spring of pioneering 
national destiny. Spring is for the person who sets off in 
search of it. Let us all pioneer a new spring of national 
history. 
  Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday [25 February] he does not plan to discuss 
specific prospects for reducing Japan's current account surplus 
when he meets U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen this weekend 
at a conference in Germany. 
  The government's forecast for the surplus, as a percentage 
of 
gross domestic product, "is not something to discuss" with 
Bentsen or at Saturday's meeting in Frankfurt of finance leaders 
from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations, Fujii 
told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Fujii said he expects to meet his U.S. counterpart 
"face-to-face" before the multilateral meeting and will explain 
the recent 15.25 trillion yen economic-stimulus package, which 
includes 6 trillion yen in tax cuts. Deregulation and measures 
such as the tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand "will have a 
great significance" in the medium term to reduce Japan's 
surpluses, he said. 
  Some government and ruling coalition leaders have recently 
hinted that the surplus forecasts could be used as "effort 
targets" in Japan-U.S. trade talks, which bogged down over 
targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets. 
  Instead, Fujii said he plans to explain the stimulus plan to 
Bentsen. 
  "If there is a misunderstanding" that the 6 trillion yen tax 
cuts are a one-time measure, Fujii said, he would try to explain 
that the cuts are to be part of a full-fledged tax reform. 
  Fujii noted that the coalition agreed, and the cabinet 
endorsed, a plan to enact balanced tax reform by the year's end 
that will reduce the burden of direct levies such as incomes 
taxes and increase indirect taxes such as the consumption tax. 
  "As fellow human beings, if we meet face-to-face, I think I 
can get him to understand how we feel," he said. He said he has 
been in contact with Bentsen on "various matters" but declined 
to elaborate. 
  Asked how much understanding he could expect from his U.S. 
counterpart with reports circulating that Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa plans to reshuffle the cabinet, Fujii said he 
would ask Bentsen to trust him as finance minister. 
  Fujii said the bilateral meeting might take place Saturday 
morning before the G-7 talks begin, adding that it would be 
"rude" to ask Bentsen to meet the night before. 
  Asked about the high yen, Fujii repeated that G-7 finance 
ministers and central bankers have agreed that rapid currency 
fluctuations are undesirable and that foreign exchange rates 
should reflect economic fundamentals. It is their "common 
understanding" that drastic swings in a single nation's currency 
rate are undesirable not only for that country but for the world 
economy, he said. 
  The major topic of the G-7 talks will be aid to Russia, with 
discussions to include conditions for disbursement of 
multilateral aid, he said. Large chunks of already-approved aid 
funds have been held up over Moscow's political and economic 
turmoil. 
  Russian representatives are to meet with G-7 finance 
officials after the G-7 talks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The head of the 
delegation of the measure committee for compensation to "comfort 
women for the army" and the victims of the Pacific war of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a speech on February 
15 at the 50th meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights 
held in Geneva. 
  Noting with indignation that the present Japanese 
authorities 
are still unwilling to admit to the issue of "comfort women for 
the army", he said such attitude of theirs proves that they too 
are little different from their predecessors who had committed a 
crime by contriving the system of "comfort women for the army". 
  Pointing out that the sexual slavery forced upon Korean and 
other Asian women by the Japanese Army is a criminal act against 
mankind and it showed that Japan could not evade its 
responsibility for it either in view of the international law or 
in view of morality, he continued: 
  The Japanese authorities must comprehensively and quickly 
probe the truth behind the "comfort women for the army", such as 
the total number of "comfort women", their composition of 
nationalities and lists of victims and make public its results. 
Japan must make adequate compensations to victims and their 
families as the greatest token of its will to clearly liquidate 
its past, its will not to repeat such crimes. 
  At the same time, it must be accompanied by criminal 
punishment upon those who are responsible for it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- Guy Dupre, 
secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for 
Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) issued a statement on 
the situation on the Korean peninsula on Feb. 14. 
  The enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the 
Cilreco held in Paris charged that the United States was 
carrying the tensions on the Korean peninsula to extremes with 
provocative acts, while refusing to improve relations with the 
DPRK and calling for "sanctions" against it, noted the 
statement, and continued: 
  "The United States has suspended DPRK-U.S. negotiation and 
is 
zealously pursuing a policy of pressure on and threat to the 
DPRK under the unreasonable pretext that the DPRK is refusing to 
accept the high-handed demand of the Internatiomal Atomic Energy 
Agemcy for inspection. 
  "The hypocritic attitude of the United States is so 
dangerous 
that it may lead the situation to a hopeless phase. 
  "The United States must immediately stop its reckless 
attempt 
at isolating and stifling the DPRK and come out without delay to 
the DPRK-U.S. negotiation for a final solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  "The Cilreco calls on world public to watch the U.S. 
attitude 
with vigilance and put a strong pressure on [words indistinct] 
so that it may look straight at the trend of the times and act 
with discretion."

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 25 February editorial: "Thirty Years of </F>
Victory and Change Advancing Along the Road Elucidated by the 
Great Rural Theses"] 
  [Text] Overflowing with great dignity and pride, our 
people today are significantly commemorating the 30th 
anniversary of the publication of the immortal classical work of 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, "Theses on the Socialist 
Rural Question in Our Country." 
  On the occasion of this historical day, the national 
agricultural conference will be magnificently opened in 
Pyongyang, the revolutionary capital, amid the great interest of 
all the people and agricultural workers. This conference will 
be a rally of victors vigorously demonstrating the greatness and 
invincible vitality of our party's program of socialist rural 
construction, and a new milestone in developing our country's 
socialist rural economy onto a higher stage. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical 
letter, "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under 
the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," to the national 
agricultural conference. In the letter, the respected and 
beloved leader proudly summed up the victorious achieved by our 
party and people in the struggle to implement the rural theses, 
and presented a militant task to bring about a new upsurge in 
the rural construction. 
  This letter is a banner of struggle which makes it possible 
to achieve a historical victory in ultimately solving the rural 
question which is the most difficult problem in socialist 
construction. On the day of the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the rural theses, we have once again received the 
great classical work which brilliantly elucidates the future of 
our socialist farms. This is a great happiness for our people 
and agricultural workers. 
  Our people and agricultural workers are looking back with 
pride at the historical course that achieved great victory and 
change in the socialist rural construction under the leadership 
of the party and the leader. The socialist rural theses 
published 30 years ago, was a historical event greatly 
significant for the revolutionary struggle of our people for the 
victory of the chuche socialist cause. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out: The 
"Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country," 
provided by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's 
program of the rural construction, and a magnificent blueprint 
to ultimately solve the rural question. 
  Correctly solving the rural question is a fundamental 
problem 
related to the success or failure of the socialist cause. The 
work to firmly consolidate politically, ideologically, 
materially, and technically the socialist system and to achieve 
complete victory in socialism are greatly dependent on how to 
solve the rural question. 
  From the early days, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
put 
great emphasis on the question of farmers and agriculture and 
put forth all his energy to solve it. He published the rural 
theses at a historical period when it was imminently demanding 
to elucidate the correct road in the socialist rural 
construction. Thus, he gave a complete explanation in this 
important question of the era. 
  The rural theses is a chuche-oriented rural construction 
program which wholly elucidates all theoretical and practical 
problems that arise in the socialist rural construction such as 
the essential content of the socialist rural question, the 
fundamental principle in solving it, and the basic task and 
method to carry out the rural construction. 
  With the presentation of the rural theses, the road to 
industrialize and modernize agriculture, revolutionize and 
achieve working classification of the farmers, and to create 
farms, which were dominated by century-old backwardness, into 
abundant and civilized socialist farms, were clearly elucidated. 
The publication of the theses was an event of the era which 
provided a shortcut in constructing a classless society and a 
completely successful socialist society which man had so 
earnestly desired. 
  In the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's ideological and 
theoretical achievements, he pioneered a new turning point in 
the socialist construction theory because he put forth a 
magnificent program in the socialist rural construction from the 
early days, and embraced faith in socialism to the world's 
revolutionary people. This cannot by any means be weighed at any 
cost. 
  The 30 years from the time of the publication of the theses 
up until the present were 30 years of victory and traits in 
which the most brilliant examples were created in solving the 
socialist rural question. 
  The circumstances of our socialist construction in the past 
were not smooth at all. We accelerated socialist rural 
construction under a difficult condition in which the nation was 
divided and the imperialists' vicious aggressive maneuvers 
prevailed. However, thanks to the great rural theses, our 
people and agricultural workers could brilliantly resolve 
difficult and gigantic tasks raised in socialist rural 
construction. 
  The great vitality of the rural theses has been fully 
demonstrated in the fact that our socialist rural economic 
system has been firmly consolidated politically, ideologically, 
materially and technologically. 
  As the result of brilliant implementation of the three lines 
of the revolution--ideological, technological and cultural--put 
forward by the rural theses, our peasants' political and 
ideological outlook and our farms' material and technological 
foundation have been changed beyond recognition. 
  Today our agricultural workers, assuming the chuche 
idea--our 
party's great revolutionary ideology--as their firm faith, have 
been united with the party and the leader [suryong] more firmly 
than ever, and are highly displaying the noble fine communist 
customs. 
  Even amid antisocialist maneuvers unprecedentedly 
intensified 
by the imperialists and reactionaries in recent years, our 
agricultural workers firmly defended the agricultural front by 
absolutely trusting only the party and the leader without a 
slightest degree of wavering. This clearly demonstrates their 
noble spiritual and moral outlook. 
  The great changes effected in our peasants' ideological and 
mental world and work-style are the most precious achievement 
incomparable to several million tons of grains. 
  A great advance was registered in implementing the rural 
technological revolution through the struggle to carry to 
accomplishment the rural theses. The task of introducing water 
utilization system and electrification was realized a long time 
ago, and the task of mechanization and chemicalization was also 
achieved. As the result, the historic task of rural 
technological revolution set forth in the socialist rural theses 
has been accomplished basically. 
  Last year, in the wake of the 30th anniversary of 
publication 
of the theses, we attained a unprecentedly good harvest by 
overcoming serious phenomena of abnormal weather. This clearly 
proves how mighty the material and technological foundation of 
our farms is. 
  With brilliant achievement of tasks of rural cultural 
revolution, the peasants' civilized life has been brought into 
full bloom and our farms became more look like cities in the 
cultural field. 
  The political, ideological, material and technological 
foundation which our people provided amid the struggle to carry 
to accomplishment the rural theses is very firm. Today socialism 
takes deep root in our farms and became something indispensable 
to the life of our agricultural workers. 
  The great vitality of the rural theses has been clearly 
displayed in the fact that an epoch-making turn was effected in 
our people's historic advance to achieve the complete victory of 
socialism. Achievement of complete victory of socialism is a 
strategic goal which we must attain without fail in socialist 
and communist construction. The key to accomplishing this task 
is to remove the class difference between the working class and 
peasants by solving rural problems. 
  Industrialization and modernization of agriculture and 
revolutionization and classization of peasants have been 
vigorously pushed ahead under the banner of the theses. As the 
result of this, the differences between cities and farms were 
drastically reduced. In addition, the standard of management and 
operation in cooperative farms came closer to the advanced 
management standard of industry. Thus, material and 
technological means in ownership by all of the people came to 
have overwhelming weight in agricultural production. 
  All this illustrates that the condition is becoming mature 
for gradually turning cooperative farms in our country into 
farms owned by all of the people. 
  We have already solved basic problems in socialist rural 
construction. We can proudly declare that we have now occupied a 
lofty peak looking at final solution of agricultural problems. 
  The socialist rural theses also displayed great might in 
fully demonstrating the superiority of socialism of our own 
style by smashing the imperialists' antisocialist maneuvers. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries have historically 
carried out vicious slanderous and smear campaigns against the 
socialist rural economic system which was established by 
reflecting the aspirations and desires of the popular masses. 
  Taking advantage of the collapse of the socialist system in 
some countries, the imperialists carried out antisocialist 
maneuvers more viciously. The great victory we attained in the 
struggle to accomplish the rural theses in the past 30 years 
proved that antisocialist sophism disseminated by the 
imperialists is a total falsehood. 
  The socialist rural economic system in our country is a most 
superior rural economic system of our-style which has embodied 
the chuche idea and is a most solid and vigorous rural economic 
system that is advancing along the road of socialism based on 
collectivism. 
  With the brilliant embodiment of the rural theses, 
agricultural production constantly developed and the peasants' 
independent and creative life fully bloomed in all domains of 
politics, economy, and culture in our country. Through the 
reality of socialism, people came to believe firmly that only 
socialism can achieve the peasants' long-cherished desire. 
  Indeed, the socialist rural theses put forward by the great 
leader are an immortal militant banner which enabled us to 
strengthen our-style socialism into an indomitable stronghold 
and which provided us with a firm guarantee for the final 
victory of socialism. The great victory and achievements we 
attained in the struggle to carry to accomplishment the rural 
theses in the past are a brilliant fruition of the wise 
leadership of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Traces of the leadership of the great leader, who led the 
rural economic work with tireless and sleepless energy, are 
embroidered on the road of socialist economic construction in 
our country. 
  By always putting forward the agricultural front as one of 
the major offensive fronts in socialist construction, the 
respected leader personally became the commander and brilliantly 
resolved all problems--large or small--raised in rural economy 
and agricultural production. 
  By constantly giving on-the-spot guidance to farms 
throughout 
the country, he created the chuche agricultural method--a most 
scientific farming method suitable to practical situation in our 
country--and led our agricultural workers to implement the 
party's agricultural policy. The energetic guidance of the 
respected leader was a source for us to effect an epoch-making 
advance in agricultural production. 
  The guidance of the party and the leader over socialist 
rural 
construction has been consistent with firm principles. The 
principle of giving priority to the ideological revolution, 
which the great leader consistently maintained; the principle of 
strengthening the guidance of peasants by the working class, the 
support for agriculture by industry, and support for farms by 
cities; and the principle of strengthening the party's guidance 
on rural economy, worked as the banner consolidating our 
socialist rural positions into indomitable strongholds. 
  Even in recent years when the imperialists' antisocialist 
maneuvers were carried out more disguisedly, the party and the 
leader led us so that we can highly demonstrate the superiority 
of socialist collectivist economy by firmly maintaining the 
principle of socialism in management and operation of rural 
economy without a slight degree of wavering. This is a brilliant 
achievement made by the party and the leader in rural 
construction. 
  The entire course of socialist rural construction in our 
country eloquently shows that only by the great party and the 
great leader with uncommon wisdom, outstanding leadership and 
firm principle, can the socialist rural problems be brilliantly 
resolved without a slight deviation and vicissitudes. 
  Today we are faced with the honorable task to consolidate 
and develop our country's socialist rural economic system and to 
effect a new upsurge in farm production, based on the great 
victory we achieved in the socialist rural construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his recent 
letter: All functionaries of the agricultural sector and working 
people should vigorously accelerate the socialist rural 
construction with exalted faith, upholding the banner of the 
socialist rural theses. We should, above all, deeply bear the 
great pride in having the most correct program [kangnyong] for 
the socialist rural construction and should stoutly carry out 
the struggle to implement it. 
  The ideological and theoretical policy linked with the great 
rural theses is our firm guideline for today and tomorrow. All 
party members and working people should stoutly struggle, being 
deeply aware of the fact that they can make a new upsurge in the 
rural construction and farm production only when they advance 
along the single road elucidated by the theses without 
deviation. By doing so, they should endlessly glorify the 
leadership achievements that the great leader have made without 
sleep or rest for a long time in solving socialist rural 
problems. 
  All party members and working people should learn in depth 
the great leader's historical work, "For an Ultimate Solution to 
Rural Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," 
make it their bones and flesh, and stoutly carry out the 
struggle to implement programmatic tasks presented in the work. 
  In order to implement the heavy task faced by the rural 
economy today, it is important to intensify and develop the 
three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in 
accordance with the demand of the socialist rural construction 
in a new stage. 
  We should intensify indoctrination of the agricultural 
working people on principles of the chuche idea and should 
effectively carry out ideological indoctrination, including 
class and collectivism indoctrination, for them so that they can 
arm themselves firmly with our party's revolutionary ideology 
and the chuche idea and can firmly establish a revolutionary 
view of leader. 
  By doing so, we should make all agricultural working people 
become resolute fighters who devotedly struggle to protect and 
defend the socialism of our own style under any situation, with 
firm faith in the victory of the socialist cause. 
  We should consolidate the results achieved in irrigating, 
using electronics, mechanization, and the application of science 
in rural areas and fully demonstrate the might of the results as 
well as thoroughly implement the chuche farming method, so that 
we can further develop all domains of farm production, including 
grain production. 
  All agricultural working people should achieve, without 
fail, 
the high goal of grain production presented by the party this 
year, the first year of the adjusting period [wanchunggi], by 
greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude, upholding the party's agriculture-first policy. 
  We should continue to concentrate great efforts in elevating 
the agricultural working people's technological and cultural 
levels and making our rural areas more civilized, in accordance 
with the demand of the intellectualization of the entire society. 
  We should vigorously carry out the three revolutions in 
rural 
areas, strengthen our support for rural areas, and constantly 
improve and intensify the guidance and management of rural 
economy, so as to brilliantly implement the historical task of 
turning the cooperative property into the all-people property 
[hyoptongjok soyurul choninminjok soyuro nomginun yoksajok 
kwaop] in the future. 
  It is important to enhance party organizations' militant 
functions and role in order to constantly consolidate and 
develop our socialist rural economic system and to vigorously 
accelerate the agricultural production. 
  All rural party organizations should intensify ideological 
indoctrination of a broad range of agricultural working people, 
unite them more firmly around the party, and actively agitate 
the masses to implement our party's agriculture-first policy and 
the chuche farming method. 
  Party organizations should actively help and lead all 
functionaries of the agricultural economic sector, so that they 
can deeply bear their honorable duties and missions for the 
party and the revolution, constantly revolutionize themselves, 
and vigorously push ahead with the work of implementing the 
rural theses at the front of the masses. 
  The socialist rural construction, which has entered a new 
higher stage today, has the endlessly bright future. We will 
brilliantly achieve the ultimate solution to socialist rural 
problems in the near future, as long as the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song, who is leading the chuche socialist cause along the 
single road of victory, stands at the forefront, and as long as 
the glorious Workers Party of Korea leads us. 
  Let us all stoutly struggle to achieve the ultimate solution 
to socialist rural problems and to consummate the chuche 
revolutionary cause, firmly united around the party Central 
Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim 
Il-song. 
  Hurrah for the 30th anniversary of the publication of the 
great socialist rural theses!

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- "For the ultimate 
solution of the rural question under the banner of the socialist 
rural theses", a letter sent by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song to the national agricultural conference, is evoking 
widespread repercussions upon officials and working people in 
Korea. 
  Kang Ung-chae, vice-chairman of the State Planning 
Commission, said: "The letter of the great leader is a highly 
important guideline which we must always follow unswervingly in 
the efforts for the ultimate solution of the rural question 
under the banner of the socialist rural theses. 
  "Officials of our commission, bearing deep in mind their 
heavy duty for the times and the revolution, will map out plans 
in detail and dovetail them to ensure that raw and other 
materials are supplied in time to chemical fertilizer factories." 
  Yu Si-yong, vice-president of the University of National 
Economy, had this to say: 
  "The letter of the great leader is an immortal classical 
work 
which consummates all the theoretical and practical questions 
arising in making a new advance in the socialist rural 
construction of our country and a great programme of rural 
construction which clearly indicates the way of socialist rural 
construction. 
  "We will deeply study and grasp the ideas and theories laid 
down in the letter and thoroughly apply them to scientific 
research, teaching and education, thus firmly preparing the 
students to be true revolutionaries and competent economic 
management officials who resolutely struggle for socialist rural 
construction and for the accomplishment of the cause of 
our-style socialism." 
  Chairman of the management board of the Changchon 
cooperative 
farm in Sadong district, Pyongyang, Kim Myong-yon, said that the 
officials and agricultural working people of the farm who 
received the letter of the great leader with deep emotion and 
joy are filled with an ardent resolve to carry through the 
agrarian policy of the Workers' Party of Korea under the banner 
of the socialist rural theses. She said they would bring about 
a greater upsurge in agricultural production this year in which 
fell the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses. 
  Yi Chong-chun, chief secretary of the Kaechon City, South 
Pyongan Province, committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, said 
the city party committee would firmly unite the agricultural 
working people around the party and the leader and consolidate 
the party's rural foundation by carrying through the rural 
policy of the party pursuant to the tasks laid down in the 
letter of the great leader, so that uninterrupted innovations 
may be effected in agricultural production.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- Thirty years have 
passed since the great socialist rural theses was published in 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  In this period, the ideological revolution has been carried 
on vigorously in the countryside to bring a phenomenal change in 
the mental traits of the agricultural working people. 
  They have made strenuous efforts to implement the rural 
theses under the socialist collective economic system, helping 
and leading each other forward under the slogan "One for All and 
All for One!" 
  In this course, more than 20 units including the 
Mangyongdae, 
Chongsan and Yongnim cooperative farms, the Pyongyang fruit farm 
and the Chaeryong farm machine station and many agricultural 
workers were awarded "Order of Kim Il-song." And more than 400 
people have become labour heroes and many others have been 
decorated by the state. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
published "Position and Role of the County in Socialist 
Construction" in March 1964, "On Stepping Up the Work of the 
Union of Agricultural Working People" in December 1985 and many 
other immortal classical works and gave on-the-spot guidance to 
agricultural domain, through which he has wisely led the 
agricultural working people to carry out the tasks set by the 
great leader President Kim Il-song in the rural theses. 
  The remoulding of man has been successfully promoted in the 
countryside over the last three decades, with the result that 
the peasants have fully discharged their duty as the masters of 
rural construction with noble ideological and mental traits 
befitting socialist agricultural working people. 
  They do farming with a strong sense of responsibility as the 
ones in charge of the nation's granary under the slogan "I tend 
the farm's fields as my own!" 
  Last year, too, cooperative farms in Sokchon, Mundok, Unjon, 
Yonan, Paechon and other areas of the country reaped bumper 
harvests. 
  Agricultural working people are fully displaying beautiful 
traits of devoting their all to the society, the collective and 
comrades. 
  In recent years, Pang Yong-pok of the Taechon-up cooperative 
farm, Taechon County, North Pyongan Province, Kim Chae-nak of 
the Naenam cooperative farm, Sunchon City, South Pyongan 
Province, Yi Chin-su of the Chonnae-up cooperative farm, Chonnae 
County, Kangwon Province, and many other peasants performed 
feats in protecting people's lives and property. 
  Agricultural working people are also bringing into full play 
such beautiful communist traits as bringing up orphans as their 
own children, marrying disabled soldiers and donating surplus 
rice to the country. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated their beautiful 
communist traits and sent his thanks and gifts to them. 
  With the reliable agricultural working people dynamically 
advancing along the road indicated by the socialist rural theses 
under the wise guidance of the illustrious leader, the socialist 
rural stronghold of Korea is being further consolidated.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- This is the year in 
which falls the 30th anniversary of the publication of the great 
socialist rural theses in the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  In this period, a remarkable progress has been made in the 
comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, the number of 
tractors increasing 6 times, lorries 5 times, weeding machines 
5.6 times, harvester combines 7 times and rice harvesters 1.5 
times. 
  Each subworkteam of the cooperative farms across the country 
has one or more rice-transplanting machines and rice-seedling 
pullers, putting the mechanisation of farm work on a high level. 
  In "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country", 
the great leader President Kim Il-song set the task to carry out 
the comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, a part of the 
rural technical revolution, and indicated ways for its 
implementation. 
  He saw to it that many industrial establishments engaged in 
agriculture such as tractor, spare part, farm machine and farm 
tool plants and farm machine stations were built in all parts of 
the country. 
  Thus, the Kumsong general tractor works, the "chungsong" 
tractor plant and several hundred trailing machine factories and 
farm machine stations have made their appearance in many places 
of the country. 
  With the brisk training of agrotechnicians, experts and 
tractor drivers the number has markedly increased. 
  Under the bright rays of the rural theses, the agricultural 
working people of Korea now do all farm work ranging from 
ploughing of paddy and non-paddy fields to sowing, 
rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport 
with the help of machines.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences is situated on the outskirts of Pyongyang. 
  The academy, a centre of the development of the chuche-based 
agro-science, was founded on December 29, 1948. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song who is always deeply 
interested in the agricultural development of the country, 
visited the academy on some 110 occasions and indicated the 
direction of comprehensively developing all fields of 
agricultural sciences and has wisely led the work for its 
realization. 
  Today the academy has more than 30 central institutes 
specialized in rice, maize, soil, cultivation, agrobiology, 
agro-chemistry and agricultural irrigation. 
  There are over 180 scientific research bases including 
branches of agricultural science and experimental farms in each 
province. 
  Thousands of scientists work there. 
  Among them are Kim Sang-yon and Kim Chong-hui, authoritative 
academicians, professors and doctors in the field of rice 
breeding and veterinary science, Yi Pong-hwi, a famous doctor in 
the field of maize breeding and hundreds of other people with 
academic degrees or titles. 
  According to data available, scientific research bases and 
ranks of scientists have increased tens of times and ranks of 
people with academic degrees or titles hundreds of times 
compared with the early period of its founding. 
  The academy has registered a large number of successes in 
the 
development of agricultural science of the nation since its 
foundation. 
  Upwards of 600 varieties bred introduced by researchers are 
now introduced. 
  They have rounded off farming methods suitable to region and 
soil on the principle of right crop in right time and proper 
crop in proper area. 
  It is noticeable in the field of cultivation that a signal 
success is recorded with the completion of a farming method in 
highland 1,000-1,400 metre high above sea level and double 
cropping method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and 
other mild climate areas. 
  And different kinds of chemical fertilizers suitable to 
growing condition of crops have been studied and developed and 
their qualitative composition improved. 
  Now fertilizers are applied to all crops in the Korean 
countryside on the principle of complete manuring system. 
  Besides, a large number of farm machines have been invented 
and introduced by researchers of the Academy of Sciences. As a 
result, all farming work has been mechanized and a great success 
garnered in developing overall fields of agricultural production 
including soil and irrigation. 
  Researchers are now directing great efforts to getting new 
strains of rice and maize for a higher and stable yield and 
researching and completing a variety of fertilizers with 
domestic resources.

  [Text] Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- There is a cosy 
people's hospital taking care of the health of farmers in 
Migam-ri, a remote mountainous area of Kim Hyong-kwon County, 
Yanggang Province, in the northern inland of Korea. 
  The hospital has an internal treatment department, a 
surgical 
department, a pediatric department and other specialized 
departments equipped with modern medical facilities, a 
laboratory, a dispensary and sick wards. 
  Doctors take charge of all people under the section doctor 
system. Doctors frequently call at farmers' houses to prevent a 
disease and take measure for patients. 
  As soon as children were born they are under the care of 
doctors and undergo regular medical examination, preventive 
inoculations and other systematic medical care. 
  The hospital has created thousands of acres of herb fields, 
produced different tonics to supply them to people. 
  Before the liberation of the country, Migam-ri was a place 
far behind from modern civilization. In those days there was no 
doctor. Endemic disease and other contagious diseases took a 
heavy toll of lives. But this has become the past thing forever. 
  Today Migam-ri has turned into a paradise of longevity where 
all the farmers are leading a happy and civilized life in good 
health. This represents all the rural villages of prospering 
Korea. 
  The policy of turning ri clinics into hospitals put forward 
by the great leader President Kim Il-song at the fifth congress 
of the Workers' Party of Korea (November 1970) was implemented 
across the country during the six-year plan. 
  There are hospitals and medical networks with modern medical 
equipment and apparatuses in all places, a solitary islet as 
well as a mountainous village, where the people live and they 
protect the health of the people.

  [Text] The Australian foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
his government hopes the massacre of Palestinians in the West 
Bank town of Hebron leads to a new sense of urgency in peace 
negotiation. Senator Evans has condemned the massacre in which 
more than 50 Palestinians were killed by a Jewish gunman and 
extended Australia's sympathy to all the bereaved or wounded. 
He has urged both Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization to intensify their efforts for peace and says it is 
particularly important for the all sides use restraint to avoid 
further bloodshed.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans has written 
to the federal Labor [Party] caucus strongly defending the 
government's decision to recognize the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia [FYROM]. The move has drawn threats of a political 
backlash from Australia's large Greek community which objects to 
the use of the name, Macedonia, also the name of a Greek 
province. 
  A protest rally by the Greek community in Melbourne 
yesterday 
attracted a crowd of about 60,000. Senior Liberal Party figures 
joined the rally, condemning the government's recognition of the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- speeches described by 
Senator Evans as the worst kind of dangerous political 
opportunism. 
  Sen. Evans has told his caucus colleagues the government 
will 
always conduct Australia's foreign policy to advance and protect 
Australia's national interests. He also told them the 
government will govern for all Australians, not just those who 
shout or threaten the lives, he said.

  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, has named 
his new cabinet on the island after being sworn in following 
last week's snap election. In two surprises, Mr. Rabuka did not 
name a deputy prime minister and in addition he has announced 
that he will now take responsibility for foreign affairs and 
external trade. Mr. Rabuka has also reduced the size of his 
cabinet from 18 to 12. Ashran Singh reports: 
  [Singh] Paul Manueli, the only member of parliament from the 
island of Rotuma, returns as minister of finance. A member of 
Fiji's highest chief's assembly, Adi Samanunu Cakobau, is the 
minister responsible for Fijian affairs, a key ministry. In 
this capacity she will also be chairperson of the powerful Great 
Council of Chiefs. 
  The other ministers are: 
  Harold Powell, minister for commerce; 
  Kelemedi Bulewa, attorney-general; 
  Ratu Ovini Bokini, minister for agriculture, fisheries and 
forests; 
  Ratu Jo Nacola, minister for multi-ethnic affairs; 
  Taufa Vakatale, minister for education; 
  Ratu Timoci Vesikula, minister for lands; 
  Lieutenant-Colonel Jonetani Kaukimoce -- responsible for 
health, social welfare and housing; 
  Ratu Josefa Dimuri, minister for information; 
  Berenado Vunibobo is the minister for home affairs, 
immigration, labor, industrial relations, youth and employment. 
  Reflecting on the fact that there are no Indians in this 
cabinet, Mr. Rabuka said he wants to seriously consider 
expanding his coalition to include the National Federation 
Party, which has 20 Indian members in Parliament. Ashran Singh

  [Text] In Fiji, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has won a 
convincing victory in the country's 1994 snap election. South 
Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports that Fiji's 
Constitution guarantees indigenous Fijians political dominance 
over the country's Indian population. 
  [Reddan] Rabuka called this snap election just 18 months 
into 
his five-year term after a leadership challenge last November. 
He returns to parliament with the same number of seats in his 
coalition, counting two independents and four general voter 
seats, but his SVT [Fijian Political Party] party is down by two 
seats to 31. Josevata Kamikamica, who mounted the leadership 
challenge, has lost his seat, but his newly launched Fijian 
Association did pick up five seats. The anti-Indian Nationalist 
Party lost all of its five seats and the All Nations Congress 
won one seat. 
  Rabuka says he'll find it easy to work with the National 
Federation Party, which won 20 seats at the expense of the Labor 
Party, which is down from 13 to seven seats. 
  Prime Minister Rabuka says he's very happy with his win. 
  [Begin Rabuka recording] Well, any victory is good. I had 
hoped that we would get 33 or 34 seats. A four majority in the 
house is still enough to run a government and its very, very 
satisfying, very comforting to know that people still have a lot 
of confidence in the party. [end recording]

  [Text] The newly reelected prime minister of Fiji, Sitiveni 
Rabuka, says he will consider asking for the republic's 
readmission into the Commonwealth. 
  The former army general, who was sworn in earlier today for 
another five-year term as prime minister, has also said he would 
capitalize on his election victory by taking on a higher 
international profile. Mr. Rabuka told a news conference in 
Suva he believed the time had come for him to visit countries 
other than those in the Asia-Pacific region. Noting that Fiji's 
traditional authority, the Great Council of Chiefs, supported 
the island's re-entry into the Commonwealth, Mr. Rabuka said 
this was one issue he would look at in his portfolio as foreign 
minister. 
  Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after 
the first of two military coups led by Mr Rabuka, which 
overthrew an Indian-dominated government. India is opposed to 
Fiji returning to the Commonwealth because of its 
racially-biased constitution which has ensured ethnic Indians 
are a minority in Parliament, but Mr Rabuka said he would like 
ethnic Indians to be included in a government within the next 
five years. At the same time he renewed his commitment to 
review Fiji's constitution by 1997.

  [Text] APIA, Feb 25 (AFP) -- The seeds of violence and 
possibly war are being sown in Western Samoa by forces trying to 
bring down the government, the head of the Roman Catholic church 
here, Cardinal Pio Taofinuu, said Friday. 
  In an unprecedented move, he "begged" the government in a 
pastoral letter not to introduce a value added tax on food and 
school supplies. In the letter he said he had heard that a 
people were organising an anti-tax march on Wednesday with an 
aim of shutting down the country's ports and international 
airport. He called the march organisers "selfish and abusive 
people" who were trying to fan the fires of other people's 
suffering for their own motives. 
  "It appears to me now that a real effort is being made to 
bring the present government to its knees," he said in the 
letter to Catholics. "Some would say simply 'that's politics' 
but something more is happening that is truly troubling for our 
future." He said the people behind the march seemed willing to 
do anything to reach their goals. "Do they lust for raw power, 
regardless of the consequences for the country?" 
  He said recently that when Prime Minister Tofilau Eti 
Alesana 
spoke he was booed, demonstrating the "ugliness that has now 
been unleashed. 
  "What happens is that we lose our self-respect as citizens 
of 
Western Samoa, who have an ancient tradition of civility, and we 
sow the seeds of violence and possibly even war," the letter 
said. He advised Catholics not to join the protest march, 
although he added that the tax was unacceptable and too high. 
  "Do not listen to other voices that promise peace but speak 
of war, voices that speak of hope but act to destroy," he said. 
"It is urgent that the present taxes on foodstuffs be removed. 
That act, in itself, will be a major source of peace for all 
our people. 
  "A just tax, imposed fairly, is a shared sacrifice. And 
people are willing to share sacrifice," the cleric said. "At 
the same time, the sacrifice of the many for the enrichment of 
the few cries to heaven for vengeance."

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb 25 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
received here this morning a delegation of the Cuban National 
Bank led by its First Vice President Osvaldo F. Torres, now on a 
working visit to Vietnam. While here, the delegation paid a 
floral tribute to the late President Ho Chi Minh at his 
mausoleum. It has working sessions with officials of the State 
Bank and the Commercial Bank of Vietnam during which the two 
sides affirmed their determination to continue broadening their 
cooperation and exchanging experience in the field of banking 
activities in each country in order to effectively implement the 
agreements between the two countries signed during Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Cuba last year. Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet hailed the results of the two sides' working 
sessions as a new manifestation of the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the fraternal and reliable peoples of Cuba and 
Vietnam. He said the friendship, cooperation and mutual 
assistance between the two countries were elements of important 
significance to the national construction and defence of each 
country in that cause and would learn much from Cuba's valuable 
experience. 
  Vice President O.F. Torres highly appreciated the 
achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in the renovation 
process which he said would be an encouragement to the Cuban 
people in its struggle to overcome immediate difficulties and 
firmly safeguard its revolutionary gains in a new stage. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet also 
received 
an Austrian trade mission led by Leopold Maderthaner, president 
of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, and representatives of 
45 Austrian major companies who arrived here on Feb. 23. While 
here, the Austrian mission compared notes with Doan Duy Thanh, 
president of the Vietnam Commerce and Industry Chamber, and 
other ministries and branches concerned on possibilities of 
expansion of economic and commercial cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  At this reception, Mr Maderthaner stressed that the 
cooperation development between Austria and Vietnam was in the 
right direction. Besides expanding trade ties, his country would 
assist and cooperate with Vietnam in manufacture of machines in 
service of agriculture and water resources, equipment for water 
supply, and training personnel for economic management. 
  Mr. Maderthaner informed Prime Minister Kiet of his 
government's decision to sponsor a seminar on economy to be held 
in Vietnam and to finance a feasibility study in manufacturing 
machines. Speaking to his guests, the Vietnamese prime minister 
said that Vietnam welcomes and is ready to create favourable 
conditions for Austrian businessmen to come to inquire into 
possibilities and carry out investment projects in the interest 
of the two countries. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed his 
hope that Austria would be a reliable partner of Vietnam in 
economic, trade cooperation and investment in future.

  [Text] Cambodian National Assembly Chairman Samdech Chea 
Sim will visit Vietnam early next month and Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet will visit the Kingdom of Cambodia. Radio 
the Voice of Vietnam correspondent has interviewed Vietnamese 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who has just returned from a 
visit to Cambodia, on the relations between the two countries. 
Asked about the exchange of visits of the leaders of Vietnam 
and Cambodia, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam, in Vietnamese fading into English report] 
With a view to constantly consolidating and strengthening the 
friendship and cooperative ties in all fields between Vietnam 
and Cambodia, both countries have agreed to promote the exchange 
of visits of delegations at different levels, including the top 
one. In this spirit, the official visit to Vietnam by Samdech 
Chea Sim and that to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will 
open a new stage in bilateral relations. Both sides are making 
active preparations for the success of these visits. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam also said his recent visit 
to Cambodia, the first one, was aimed at preparing for the 
coming visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The 
foreign minister said: 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam, in Vietnamese fading into English report] 
Cambodian leaders have given us a warm, solemn, and friendly 
welcome. Besides the talks with Foreign Minister Prince Norodom 
Sirivut, we were received by the chairman of the Cambodian 
National Assembly and the second and the first premiers of 
Cambodia. Everyone expressed the determination to strengthen 
friendship and good neighborliness and broaden multifaceted 
cooperation for mutual benefits. This was according to the 
principles written in the joint communique issued in January 
1992 by the Vietnamese foreign minister and Prince Sihanouk, who 
was then the chairman of the Supreme National Council, and also 
in a joint communique signed by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
the two Cambodian co-premiers during their visit to Vietnam in 
August last year. These principles include respect for each 
other's independence, sovereignty, the right to 
self-determination and territorial integrity, and cooperation 
for mutual benefits. Both sides exchanged views on measures to 
promote economic, trade, and educational ties. In this 
direction, both sides agreed to make active preparations for the 
signing of necessary agreements during the upcoming visit by 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to lay legal grounds for long-term 
cooperation. 
  Concerning existing problems, including border issue and the 
issue of Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia, both sides agreed to 
solve them through negotiations. They agreed to set up a 
necessary mechanism to enter into negotiations soon to solve 
those issues on the basis of respect for each other and mutual 
understanding and in accordance with the law of each country and 
international practice. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said he and Cambodian 
Foreign Minister Sirivut signed an agreement on cooperation 
between the two Foreign Ministries aimed at promoting relations 
between the two countries.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA February 28 -- One hundred and five 
foreign-investment projects have been licensed in Hanoi since 
December 1987 when the law on foreign investment of Vietnam came 
into being. 
  In 1993 alone nearly 50 projects were licensed with a total 
capital of more than USD 700 million, accounting for a half of 
the total amount of foreign capital invested in projects in the 
capital city. 
  Different from previous years when foreigners focused on 
tourism service, one-third of the 1993 capital was invested in 
industrial production. Prominent among these projects are the 
Oriow-Hanel picture tube plant (a joint venture with S. Korea) 
which has a prescribed capital of USD 170.5 million and the 
(?Dkhha) Business Centre (a joint venture with South Korea), USD 
64 million. 
  Leading the 24 foreign investors in Hanoi is South Korea 
which has invested in six projects with a total capital of USD 
43.8 million France, nine projects and USD 132,782,377 followed 
by Taiwan, and Singapore. Of these foreign-invested projects, 
totally or partly funded by foreigners, a large number are 
operational, while some are still under construction. Vietnam by 
collaborating with foreign partners in the past six years, has 
gained a work force which is now accustomed to modern industrial 
and management style. A number of managers have learnt both 
foreign languages and business administration. Also, joint 
ventures have created jobs for Vietnamese, contributing to 
efforts to reduce unemployment in the capital city. 
  Some joint ventures have brought about evident 
socio-economuc 
effects and made considerable profits. They are the 
Thai-Vietnamese joint venture to produce adhesive bands for 
women, the Vietnamese-Danish joint venture to brew Carlsberg 
beer, and so on. 
  Foreign investors are now inclined to invest in the north, 
Hanoi in particular. To encourage this inclination, the 
Vietnamese Government, besides simplifying the procedure for 
issuing licences, [words indistinct] upgrade the Noi Bai 
International Airport, the highway no. 5 that links Hanoi and 
the port city of Haiphong, and the Haiphong harbour.

  [Editorial Report] On 15 December 1993, the Ho 
Chi Minh City People's Court tried Nguyen Thanh Van and his 
accomplices on charges of sabotaging security and disturbing 
public order. The presiding judge was Le Thuc Anh, deputy chief 
judge of the Municipal People's Court; the prosecutor was Truong 
Hoang Minh, chief of the security investigations bureau of the 
Municipal People's Organ of Control. 
  Defendants Trinh Van Thuong, Nguyen Thanh Van, Nguyen Duc 
Loi, Nguyen Van Trong, and Nguyen Huu Son were military officers 
under the former regime. In 1978, while undergoing 
re-education, they created the so-called Vietnam People's Party 
under the leadership of Trinh Van Thuong with objective of 
overthrowing the "revolutionary government." After leaving 
re-education, they helped Nguyen Thanh Van flee to contact 
reactionary groups overseas in order to organize forces to 
oppose and sabotage the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. 
  In November 1990, Van returned from the United States, 
re-established contact with Thuong, Loi, and Son, and helped set 
up the "Hung Gia Dai Viet United Front," chaired by Son. They 
launched their "Nguyen Trai campaign" but did not achieve the 
desired result. Next, Thuong discussed with Loi the idea of 
exploiting some unresolved complaints about ricefields by a 
number of peasants from Gia Tan 3 Village, Thong Nhat District, 
Dong Nai Province, to incite them to oppose the authorities. In 
May 1991, Van returned to Vietnam and planned with Loi and 
Thuong to organize the Gia Tan 3 peasants to demonstrate in Ho 
Chi Minh City. Van intended to photograph the demonstration as 
evidence that he could take abroad in order to seek support from 
exile groups. On 16 June 1991, Nguyen Van Chinh and La Thi Na 
organized about 100 peasants who gathered at Office 2 of the 
Council of Ministers; Van, Thuong, and Loi were also there to 
observe and take pictures. All three were uncovered and 
arrested afterwards. 
  The Municipal People's Court ruled that Van, Thuong, Loi, 
Son, and Trong were reactionaries who had carried out many acts 
against the people's government. Chinh and Na, though knowing 
the five were "bad elements", had cooperated with them to 
organize two demonstrations. After discussing the defendants' 
roles and degrees of guilt, the court handed down prison 
sentences: Nguyen Duc Loi, 11 years; Trinh Van Thuong, 10 
years; Nguyen Thanh Van, nine years; Nguyen Huu Son, six years; 
Nguyen Van Trong, three years; Nguyen Van Chinh, 32 months; La 
Thi Na, 30 months.

  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, the Bao Loc bauxite 
ore enterprise has mined almost 900 tons of ore, a very small 
amount compared with the enterprise's capabilities (each year, 
it mines approximately 15-16,000 tons). 
  For lack of markets, the enterprise has mined only moderate 
amounts. At present, the only market for this ore is the 
Southern Chemicals General Corporation. This is a great loss for 
this abundant mineral. 
  Based on surveys, Bao Loc and nearby areas have 
approximately 
a billion tons of bauxite, of which approximately 220 million 
tons is concentrated around Bao Loc City. In particular, the ore 
at Bao Loc has a very high alumina (AL2O3) content, 45-50 
percent. On the other hand, the ore has a hardened, weathered 
structure and is easy to mine and transport. 
  The industrial-mineral sector must make plans to exploit 
this 
very abundant natural resource.

  [Text] During the 3 months it has officially been in 
operation, the Austinh-Ha Tinh (Austinh Ltd) Ileminte 
Corporation has attracted many new customers, including those 
from Japan, Taiwan, Spain, and Malaysia. It has exported almost 
30,000 tons of Ilmenite. In particular, in August 1993, the 
corporation exported 22,800 tons, 80 percent of the 1993 plan. 
The ilmenite ore found in Ha Tinh has a high content, and there 
are large reserves. Thus, the corporation should be able to 
attract many customers. In 1994, the corporation hopes to export 
60-80,000 tons with ore grading systems at the mines able to 
handle 120,000 tons. 
  In the past, because mining operations were not organized, 
damage was done to the environment. Today, the Austinh 
Corporation is using new techniques and purchasing ore only from 
individuals extracting ore from within designated zones. As a 
result, the above situation has been overcome. 
  Austinh is the economic spearhead of Ha Tinh. During the 3 
months the corporation has been in operation, revenues have 
exceeded $3 million, more than 1 billion dong has been paid into 
the budget, $15,000 has been contributed to the people of Ha 
Tinh, 12 beds have been contributed to the provincial hospital, 
and 100 million dong has been invested to repair roads and 
bridges and help three villages build schools.

  [Text] Recently, digging and panning for gold has reached 
fever pitch in Ha Tinh. People are not only panning for gold but 
also digging for gold ore, primarily in Ky Anh and Huong Khe 
districts. 
  At the Hoa Hai gold mine in Huong Khe District, people from 
various localities have come to dig for gold ore using a variety 
of implements such as rock crushers and manual grading machines. 
At times, thousands have come, with the average being 200 
people with about 40 rock crushers in operation. There have been 
reports that Nguyen Van Dai, a local person, extracted 40 kg of 
gold ore, which is the equivalent of 26 ounces of gold. After 
mining this gold, he abandoned his tools and left the area, 
fearing that he would be robbed. One person was murdered while 
digging for gold. 
  Village authorities collect 1.2 million dong for each gold 
excavation pit without giving any attention to how the land is 
dug up. This has had a serious impact on the environment.

  [Text] Although there is no basis for affirming this, 
public opinion holds that there are a number of individuals in 
Hanoi whose "wealth" is tied to the smuggling of rubies. Because 
of this, they have become wealthy very quickly. 
  But the truth is, most of those engaged in smuggling rubies 
out of Vietnam are foreigners. An Indian businessman said that 
he had purchased a 50-carat Vietnamese ruby in Bangkok for 37 
million baht ($1.5 million). After cutting the stone, he sold 
the 27.5-carat ruby for $3 million. This is not, however, the 
largest. Nguyen Xuan An, the director general of the Vietnam 
Gemstone Corporation, said that a rough ruby weighing 57.6 
carats is now being kept at the state storehouse. 
  In 1984, with the help of Czech specialists, Vietnamese 
geologists discovered the first ruby in Luc Yen in Yen Bai 
Province, 275 km northwest of Hanoi. This is an alluvial area 
containing Burmese-colored rubies, purple sapphires, and a 
number of other colored stones. People have surveyed a number of 
zones and preliminarily evaluated the distribution of rubies 
here. In their survey, geologists zoned the Khoan Thong Valley, 
creating the preconditions for the birth of a joint gemstone 
venture with the Thai B.H. Corporation. In a number of other 
valleys such as Nuoc Ngap and Lung Cay, the locations of 
gemstones, mainly rubies, were determined. In 1987, geologists 
found another alluvial mining area containing rubies in Quy Chau 
in Nghe An Province, 250 km southeast of Hanoi. By chance, 
several rubies were discovered in the waste disposal yard of the 
Chau Cuong tin mine. The survey program here revealed the 
presence of rubies over a broad area. A broad zone running 
parallel to Highway 48 was zoned for geological surveys. Because 
the secret got out, at the end of 1990, large numbers of people 
started coming here, with the number sometimes reaching several 
tens of thousands. They dug everywhere in this zone, which gave 
rise to the names Doi Ty [Billion Hill] and Doi Trieu [Million 
Hill]. Some were lucky, but hundreds of others died in the pits. 
Doi Ty became Doi Tu [Death Hill], with almost 100 people buried 
alive. Robbery, gambling, and prostitution became rampant and 
could not be controlled. With the help of the central echelon, 
after 2 years of great effort, the local authorities managed to 
reestablish order there. 
  The government has promulgated many policies to expand the 
ruby mining and processing industry. This includes organizing 
bidding on plots of land ranging in size from 1-5 hectares, 
allowing various economic elements, including individuals, to 
participate, encouraging foreign corporations to invest together 
with domestic corporation, and lowering the export tariff on cut 
rubies from 5 percent to 1 percent. However, out of concern that 
the masses will carry on mining activities spontaneously outside 
the control of the various-echelon authorities, the government 
has yet not lifted the ban on conducting gemstone surveys, which 
was promulgated in September 1991, except in zones adjoining 
mines now in operation. If this problem is resolved soon and 
control over this valuable resource is organized well, the 
Vietnamese gemstone industry will develop rapidly, creating jobs 
for hundreds of thousands of laborers, particularly in the 
processing sector.

<F P=106> [Article by Khong Doan Hoi from 25 February NHAN DAN: </F>
"Opening, But Not Losing Ourselves"] 
  [Excerpts] Every nation, on its path to historical 
advancement, must organize its social economy for commodity 
production. The national door must be opened even wider when 
market-oriented production is the common trend in the world. In 
this trend, the thought of producing everything for our 
consumption is not beneficial. [passage omitted] 
  How can we change social production to a social possession 
form? Historical reality shows that it is a natural development 
process of the production force. Only the strong development of 
the production force can create the absolutely necessary 
requisite conditions for socialism. Marx said poverty will be 
common if these requisite conditions do not exist. Deprivation 
will exist and the need to fight for necessary materials will 
return. People will plunge into their old garbage dump. 
  Our country is transitioning to socialism without a 
capitalist regime. It means that we do not have enough of those 
absolutely necessary requisite conditions. These conditions 
must be understood in light of the background that the world is 
entering its third millennium. We must open our door because of 
that very basic reason. Determination, even iron-like 
determination, is not enough to build the necessary material 
requisite conditions. Worse still, it is too little. Together 
with that iron-like determination, we must have giant material 
establishments, hundreds of billions of dollars in capital, and 
modern techniques and technologies. Otherwise, economic lagging 
will be certain. We must also have a broad external market and 
socioeconomic management knowledge that is suitable to 
civilization. But these are things that our country is severely 
deprived of at the moment. And the opening of the door is 
mainly to reduce deprivation or, as Lenin said, it is a method 
to seek the contribution of external hands to our undertaking. 
  But will we be able to implement our intention? The 
historical reality and results of years of renovation have given 
us an affirmative answer. During the Leninist era, while Russia 
was in the aiming sight of imperialism, there were people 
entering the country, not from their charity, but from their 
greed. 
  Today, according to the French Communist Party's judgment, 
imperialism is still an economic and political imperialism. 
Moreover, it is also a justice imperialism, as remarked by 
Ramsay Clark, former U.S. attorney general. [passage omitted] 
  A special character of our living at this time is the world 
economic race in the background of competition and cooperation 
on the basis of mutual existence. This background, together with 
challenges, is creating favorable opportunities for us. The 
increasing dependence among different nations means that we need 
them, but that they need us as well. 
  Therefore, opening the door is necessary and possible. But 
how to open so the owner is not blown away by hurricanes and the 
house does not become a hut in the wilderness? What can we do 
so that we do not lose ourselves? That is where the key issue 
rests. Can we manage in a way such that only we receive the 
benefits? Lenin denounced this idea by saying that whoever 
wants to sign a land lease agreement on the basis of communist 
principles should be put in a mental hospital. 
  According to a review of the Committee for International 
Processing Zones, good processing zones must have favorable 
labor conditions such as low wages, good workers, and 
concessional taxes. In conclusion, both economic and political 
benefits must be favorable. And this should be made clear. 
Even former U.S. President Richard Nixon, in his strategy to 
destroy the USSR, said clearly in 1988 that the requisite for 
material aid and its use was aimed at provoking the fight for 
national rights in the USSR; if the devil of self-esteem and 
national hatred was aroused, the door for peaceful evolution 
would be widely open. 
  Everybody must seek their own benefit. Therefore, the 
dominating principle is bilateral benefit. There can be winners 
and losers when the door is already open. The important thing 
is that we have to realize the changelessness and the content 
and limit of the benefit upon which the two sides have agreed. 
We need to have a clear concept of our benefit, realizing 
temporary and long-term benefits and fundamental and secondary 
benefits. The fundamental and long-term benefit to our country 
is that we have to develop our production force at all means to 
build socialism. That means that we cannot fall on the concept 
of one-sided economy and one-sided marketing. Every economic 
development step must be a better step for the implementation of 
social fairness to strengthen economic independence and social 
stabilization. [passage omitted] 
  Under present conditions where our country is adopting a 
market-oriented economy and an open-door policy, the legislative 
system must create a safe corridor of laws for various trade 
activities to create a favorable and safe environment for 
foreign investment in Vietnam and to maintain order in economic 
management. It is necessary to make extensive use of principles 
in civil laws by harmoniously combining the long-lasting 
character of principles with necessary institutional renovation 
to suit changes in economic relations and to ensure the 
feasibility of projects, and so forth. [passage omitted] 
  We need laws and also economic strength to protect 
ourselves. 
We must create economic spearheads in the context of 
interdependence and in the internationalization of production. 
Although we need the assistance of other countries, we should 
not allow ourselves to be viewed as less important by them 
because this will make it impossible for us to avoid being 
dependent on the outside. The self-governing character in the 
open-door period must also be guaranteed for various substantive 
issues. In his time, Lenin came up with many specific 
stipulations such as on the question of land lease; on how to 
improve the livelihood of workers; restore and develop the 
working class, market products, and fix sale prices; on 
conditions for hiring local and foreign workers and for ensuring 
their material life and payment; on whether local specialists 
could be allowed to work for foreign countries; on regulations 
governing scientific and technical activities and trade union 
organizations, and the like. 
  Although there are many other specific matters to be taken 
into account, the quality and abilities of the persons involved 
in this field of activity are, after all, deciding factors. 
This is because political incapability and ignorance will be 
reasons for failure. As the country is just opening its door, so 
many noteworthy incidents have occurred. Price bargaining is a 
fact of life. But if workers of certain factories place their 
boss above all, if both the host and guests collude with one 
another in turning their joint venture into a site to consume 
obsolete machinery and equipment and unsalable goods of other 
countries for the purpose of tax evasion and tax fraud, if 70 
percent of the total machinery imports are the kind that need to 
be thrown into a junk yard as cited in NHAN DAN, we hardly will 
be able to protect ourselves from succumbing to the influx of 
foreign money and goods.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian vice premier and minister of 
foreign affairs, today sent a letter to UN Security Council 
Chairman Karel Kovanda rejecting accusations by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic about 
Croatia's alleged intervention in the war against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The letter stresses that it would be 
illogical and inadequate for the Republic of Croatia, which is 
proposing and advocating a peace solution, to undertake a 
military offensive in the most critical phase of the peace 
negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, let alone to engage in open 
military intervention. Minister Granic recalls that the Croat 
areas in central Bosnia, and around Zepce in particular, have 
been exposed to constant, relentless attacks by the Muslim army 
which did not even observe a tripartite Christmas truce. 
  He also recalls that UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] reports 
did not confirm Bosnian government accusations of military 
intervention by the Croatian Army and that the UNPROFOR report 
said there was no proof of a significant deployment of the 
Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Taking these objective 
facts into consideration, Prime Minister Silajdzic's accusations 
ought to be treated as unfounded, Minister Granic said. 
  According to him, the form, sharpness, and timing of 
Silajdzic's obviously unfounded accusations against my 
government make me believe that the Muslim side is neither ready 
nor willing to accept peace negotiations in good faith at the 
moment. 
  In his letter to the Security Council chairman, Minister 
Granic reiterated his invitation to Silajdzic to return to the 
negotiating table, even before the new round of the Geneva 
negotiations to be held on 10 February, and to get involved in 
fresh efforts in order to find a tenable political solution 
based on already accepted principles and solutions for an 
alliance of the three equal constituent nations. 
  In conclusion, the minister recalls that Croatian President 
Dr Franjo Tudjman has twice so far asked for complete 
international supervision of all borders of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He has also on several occasions asked for 
the complete demilitarization of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has been and will be the policy of my 
government, Granic's letter says.

  [Text] A recent statement by Bosnian Defense Minister 
Hamdija Hadzihasanovic on the alleged military intervention of 
the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the cause of an 
extraordinary news conference by the Croatian Defense Ministry. 
Brigadier Drago Krpina, head of the ministry's political 
department, spoke at the conference. Zoltan Kabok reports: 
  [Kabok] The claims by Bosnian Minister Hadzihasanovic that 
as 
many as 15 brigades of the Croatian Army with 30,000 soldiers 
were fighting on the soil of their neighbors are a blatant lie 
-- according to Brigadier Krpina -- aimed at putting 
international pressure on Croatia. 
  [Begin Krpina recording] The justification of the failure of 
the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia and of some defeats of 
the Muslim army in the vicinity of Prozor -- as I have already 
said -- is an attempt to bring about the lifting of the arms 
embargo imposed on the Muslim army. [end recording] 
  [Kabok] Speaking about the genesis of Croatian-Muslim 
relations Krpina said that from the very beginning the 
leadership of Croatia advocated a single Bosnian state. 
Croatia, Krpina went on, was the first country to establish 
diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina after the 
international recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to 
our information, Krpina said, 2,000 volunteers of Bosnian origin 
are currently fighting in the neighboring country 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina]. Over 5,000 mercenaries from Islamic 
states -- who are encouraging fanaticism and fundamentalism -- 
are currently fighting on the side of the Muslim army, Brigadier 
Drago Krpina said at the end of the news conference, also 
denying all allegations by the Bosnian defense minister about 
any involvement of Croatian Armed Forces in clashes in the 
neighboring state.

  [Text] The elections in the republic of Serbian Krajina 
[RSK] are over. A new multiparty Krajina parliament is supposed 
to meet in 10 days. Milan Martic, newly elected RSK president, 
held his first news conference today at which, among economic 
measures and moves, he also announced the introduction of the 
super dinar, because he assessed that a unified monetary policy 
in the FRY, the republic of Srpska, and the RSK is the first 
step toward the creation of a joint state: 
  [Correspondent Petko Koprivica] Newly elected RSK President 
Milan Martic held his first news conference in Knin today when 
he, among other things, repeated that he will remain resolute in 
his intention to realize six key points of his electoral 
program, which are defense, legal order, the reanimation and 
promotion of the economy, the strengthening of diplomatic 
activities, and the unification of the Serbian lands into one 
state: 
  [Martic] "I continue to be a common man with a new burden on 
my back and with a desire that the program that I have drawn up 
succeeds, because if the program succeeds the people have also 
succeeded. I think that the program can and must succeed, as 
nobody has the right to oppose what constitutes the interest and 
the will of this people." 
  [Koprivica] Let us listen how the RSK President commented on 
the beginning of the establishment of relations between Belgrade 
and Zagreb, that is to say, how he sees the borders of his 
country in the light of the Geneva negotiations: 
  [Martic] "People can interpret this agreement in Geneva the 
way they like. However, it does not significantly change 
anything. Not even the signature that Tudjman and President 
Milosevic have placed on it brings anything significant. What 
it means is only the establishment of peace. However, this 
under no circumstances means that Krajina has been returned to 
Croatia, as the Croatian politicians have presented this. I am 
not surprised that Tudjman is constantly repeating that, by 
this, Croatia has in a way been acknowledged within its borders. 
This is absolutely not true. The only thing that was signed 
was signature for peace, to seek political solutions in peace. 
  "In any case, we all strive that this actually be the case. 
However, we do not renounce anything, and nobody is 
contemplating returning the RSK to Croatia. We will negotiate 
with Croatia on an equal footing, we will be proportionally 
represented in all talks and will negotiate in peace how to live 
further as two neighboring countries, but in no way together." 
  [Koprivica] The RSK President also told journalists that he 
would favor that capable and entrepreneurial people, who will be 
able to work successfully for the benefit of the Serbian nation, 
regardless of their party membership, enter the future 
government of this most western Serbian land. Namely, Martic 
concluded, nobody, never, under no circumstances can and will 
get a mandate to place his personal interests above the national 
goals of the Serbian nation.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian vice prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, has sent a letter to Italian 
Foreign Affairs Minister Beniamino Andreatta stressing that he 
had received with great concern and regret the news about the 
killing of the three Italian journalists in Mostar, and due to 
this tragical event he wished to express condolences to the 
Italian public and families of the killed journalists, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced. 
  Their death is yet another confirmation of horrors caused by 
the aggression and war which is continuing in former Yugoslavia. 
Around 50 journalists have been killed so far, and as of late 
aid workers have become target of attacks which proves that we 
all have to double our efforts for the hostilities to cease and 
a peace solution to be found, Minister Granic's letter says. 
  Once again I would like to condemn the crime most vehemently 
and assure you that the Croatian government will not begrudge 
effort to provide help in an independent investigation to 
clarify the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident, the 
statement says underscoring that as soon the Croatian government 
received the news about the killing of the three Italian 
citizens, it exerted all its influence over the warring factions 
in Mostar to help in the establishment of a cease-fire and the 
evacuation of the killed journalists. 
  In conclusion of this letter Minister Granic said he was 
hoping that in the course of his forthcoming meeting in Rome he 
would be able to have talks with his Italian counterpart on the 
possibilities for halting the war in this area.

  [Text] On behalf of the Croatian Government, Mate Granic, 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, has 
signed a memorandum of understanding between the Republic of 
Croatia, the European Union [EU] and the CSCE. The memorandum 
is linked with the EU and CSCE missions in Croatia, whose task 
is to support the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. 
  On behalf of the EU the memorandum was signed by Danish 
Ambassador to Croatia Eric Skov, and on behalf of the CSCE -- 
currently chaired by Italy -- by Italian Ambassador to Croatia 
Salvatore Cilento. 
  The memorandum regulates the ways of working and the methods 
of activity of the two international missions -- the EU and the 
CSCE -- active in Croatia since January 1993. The missions' 
task is to ensure that the sanctions are fully implemented. The 
Croatian authorities, especially the customs and financial 
bodies, are called on to help supervize the implementation of 
measures envisaged by the sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro. The memorandum also regulates the status of the 
missions' members, in keeping with the Vienna Convention. 
  A memorandum with the same content was also signed by all 
other countries bordering Serbia and Montenegro.

  [Text] Knin, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- The program I had offered 
in the election campaign became the reflection of people's will 
after the elections and it can and must be implemented, the 
newly elected president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] 
Milan Martic said at today's press conference. All creative 
forces and teams of experts will gather to implement the 
program. There is no place for political splits and all parties 
must subordinate their activities to national and state 
interests. As far as economic measures are concerned, the 
president of the RSK announced the introduction of the "super" 
dinar. According to Martic, a unified monetary policy of 
Yugoslavia, the republic of Srpska and the RSK is the first step 
toward the creation of a joint state. 
  Martic announced that he would meet the president of the 
republic of Srpska, Radovan Karadzic, after he had talks with 
Serbian President Milosevic. 
  As far as the make-up of the new Krajina government is 
concerned and taking into account the multiparty structure of 
the Krajina parliament, due to meet in about ten days, Martic 
announced consultations and talks with the heads of 
parliamentary groups and party leaders and went on to express 
his belief that an agreement would be reached. 
  In any case, the government will be competent, the RSK 
president stressed. He did not even hint who the new prime 
minister could be or which party he belonged to. When the 
largest parliamentary group, the Serb Democratic Party of 
Krajina, was mentioned in this context, Martic said that it did 
not have an absolute majority (32 out of 84 deputies) in the RSK 
parliament. 
  Explaining the defense program, Martic said that an 
efficient 
and more economic army should be created, an army which would be 
prepared to defend and preserve the borders. As the supreme 
commander of the Serb army of Krajina, Martic announced his 
first steps after the parliament's session, pointing out that 
all incompetent people would have to go. This will also be true 
regarding all other state bodies and the police. 
  Replying to one of the questions, Martic pledged that all 
state bodies would have their headquarters in Knin, including 
the ministry of foreign affairs, if this would prove to be 
efficient and appropriate. Outlining his plan for a more 
aggressive foreign policy, the RSK president pointed out that 
Krajina must achieve full status at all negotiations in the 
peace process. According to Martic, the RSK must achieve the 
status currently enjoyed by the republic of Srpska. 
  Commenting on the declaration on the normalization of 
relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia, Martic said: "The 
declaration does not change anything in Krajina's status and it 
does not mention that Krajina is back in Croatia as Croatian 
politicians are claiming. In reality this is a document which 
seeks political solutions in a peaceful manner." This is also 
our aspiration and we want to hold talks with Croatia on an 
equal footing, to reach a peaceful agreement on life as 
neighbors and not under the same roof. As far as final 
demarcation with Croatia is concerned, Martic said that an 
internationally controlled referendum could be held so that the 
Serbian people would get their right to self-determination as 
all other peoples in the world.

  [Text] Vladimir Wolfovich Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party, who is staying on a private 
visit in Slovenia, held a news conference in Bled this 
afternoon. Tomaz Gerden reports: 
  [Begin Gerden recording] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, of course, 
attracts great attention wherever he goes. This was also the 
case in Bled were approximately 100 foreign and domestic 
journalists and cameramen have gathered. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
who was invited here by the National-Social Alliance, in the 
introduction praised Slovenia, which he is visiting for the 
second time. He was here for the first time in November 1990 at 
the congress of the Liberal Party. 
  I view the Slovene nation, which has chosen its own fate, 
with respect. Zhirinovskiy also said that he knew that our 
country was highly developed and cultured and handled its 
affairs into which he would not meddle by itself. An avalanche 
of reporters' questions ensued: 
  Zhirinovskiy answered fiercely. Occasionally he had problems 
with the translation. He gave preference to Slavic journalists 
over western journalists, who are obviously getting on his 
nerves. For example, he accused them of creating a false 
impression that he favored war. The leader of the Russian 
Liberal Democrats assured them that he has always favored peace 
and was opposed to the use of force. 
  All foreign troops, including the blue berets, should 
withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only then will there be 
peace. He also spoke in favor of not changing borders and of 
freezing the situation in Europe as it was in 1945 after World 
War II. 
  Asked what are his alleged connections with the former KGB, 
he categorically assured: I have no connections with the former 
or the present KGB. I would gladly have had connections with 
the KGB as this was the most powerful political police in the 
world. Had I been connected with the KGB, I would be sitting in 
the Moscow Kremlin now and not in this small town on the shore 
of a lake. 
  Mr. Zhirinovskiy then distributed his book among the 
journalists, again threatened Western, corrupt journalists, and 
said that he would meet any Slovene politician who might wish to 
do so. For example, he had received Mr. Jelincic yesterday. 
  Finally, it is worthwhile noting that the news conference, 
despite sporadic outbursts, was carried out in perfect order. 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who will soon leave for Serbia, repeated on 
several occasions that he favored peace and only peace and that 
his former militant statements were misrepresented. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 28 (TANJUG) -- Russia's Liberal 
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Friday 
that if the United Nations decided to mount air attacks on 
Bosnian Serbs he would move in parliament for Russia's 
withdrawal from the U.N. which, he said, would be the end of the 
world organization. Speaking at a press conference in Ljubljana 
where he arrived on Thursday [27 January] on a short private 
visit, Zhirinovskiy resolutely opposed any military action in 
former Yugoslavia. Any further foreign involvement in the 
Yugoslav crisis, especially in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
would inevitably trigger world war three, he argued. 
  The first precondition for resolving the crisis in the 
Balkans is to withdraw foreign troops from the territory of 
former Yugoslavia. Otherwise, the conflict would continue for 
another 20 or 30 years, said Zhirinovskiy. 
  At the press conference attended by over 100 reporters from 
Europe, Japan and the United States, Zhirinovskiy said he would 
present his plan for resolving the Bosnia crisis during his 
visit to Belgrade on Sunday. TANJUG learns unofficially that 
Zhirinovskiy will be visiting Belgrade at the invitation of the 
Russian-Serbian Friendship Society. 
  In Slovenia, Zhirinovskiy was highly criticial of the 
disintegration of the Slavic states into a host of 
city-statelettes. If this trend continues, the entire world 
will break up because the retailoring of borders in one case 
will encourage the same practice in another. Slovenia violently 
seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991. 
  Asked whether he had his own ideas for the formation of a 
new 
Yugoslav community, Zhirinovskiy said a confederation of 
Slovenes, Serbs and Croats could not be ruled out.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has, in the meantime, reported 
that a group of men, supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, last 
night gravely violated public order in Bled. The Foreign 
Ministry informed Yuri Stepanovich Girenko, charge d'affaires of 
the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, about the event that had 
disturbed some of the Slovene public and advised that Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and his men leave the territory of the Republic of 
Slovenia as soon as possible.

not leave our country early. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana [title as heard] 
has stated that it would not get involved in the matter and our 
authorities should, thus, treat the offenders against public 
order in accordance with internal Slovene legislation and 
international norms. They have also expressed belief in the 
correctness of the incumbent Slovene organs regarding the 
punishment of the Russian citizens.

  [Text] Ljubljana, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
president of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, left Slovenia 
for Budapest this morning. He will continue his journey to 
Belgrade this afternoon. 
  "I would like to show the Serbs that there exists another 
Russia, a new leading political party, a new Russian 
parliament", said Zhirinovskiy in his statement for TANJUG. 
  He hinted at "Russia taking a new stand in order that the 
war 
in former Bosnia-Herzegovina may end as soon as possible", and 
so that "no Serb and no Slav would ever have to die in the 
Balkans. The Balkans will flourish" -- was the message of the 
leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats. 
  In the course of his official and unofficial meetings in 
Serbia and the Serb Republic [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], 
Zhirinovskiy is expected to put forward his proposals for the 
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, and especially for an end to 
the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fully supporting the 
Serbian and Montenegrin people, whom he considers as brotherly, 
he will strongly oppose the air strikes on Bosnian Serbs 
persistently threatened by the United Nations and NATO. 
  "My party and the official Russian policy will keep 
demanding 
that the international community abolish the sanctions against 
the FRY and allow its return back among the recognized European 
countries", said Zhirinovskiy.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Earlier today Prime Minister Peter 
Boross evaluated the first month of his tenure in a radio 
interview. He described relations between the Visegrad 
countries as an expedient cooperation framework. He stressed 
that the question of whether or not it is a political or an 
economic bloc should not be overemphasized. What he considers 
to be more important is that cooperation has begun between these 
countries under a free trade agreement. Andras Takacs sums up 
further details of the interview. 
  [Takacs] Prime Minister Peter Boross evaluated the past four 
years as being successful. He said that the government did not 
first and foremost concentrate on the elections, but worked 
according to a certain program. Asked about the foreign policy 
situation, the prime minister said: 
  [Begin Boross recording] Recent international measures, 
restrictions, and other moves taken against little Yugoslavia 
have not changed the situation; they have failed to sort out the 
serious problem. A genuine government, a legitimate government 
-- I refer to the latest elections -- is working in Belgrade. 
It is natural that we have to be in contact with this 
government and have to establish a possible beneficial 
neighborly system of relations with it. [end recording] 
  [Takacs] [passage omitted] Speaking about the economy, the 
prime minister described opinions -- according to which the 
country is in an even worse state than four years ago -- as 
lacking in seriousness. Our country's foreign currency reserves 
total $7 billion compared to $800 million four years ago.

  [Text] Belgrade, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, warned 
Western politicians this evening that "bombing Serbian positions 
in Bosnia would be a declaration of war against Russia." At a 
packed news press conference in Belgrade's Yugoslavia hotel, 
Zhirinovskiy recalled that "the Russian Army is still in Europe" 
but added that his party is urging peace and an end to the war 
in Bosnia and that "it is not threatening anybody". 
  Speaking in detail about ways to solve the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said that there were three ways: Either 
the foreign troops leave the territory of former Yugoslavia and 
let the Slav nations solve their problems on their own; or 
"accepting the status quo"; or "the arrival of Russian troops." 
  "We are supporting the Serbs and our standpoint is that the 
Serb lands -- the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serb 
Krajina should be within the Republic of Serbia," he said, 
adding that he would be happy if "Russia and Serbia had a common 
border." Zhirinovskiy stressed that he had come as chairman of 
the party which had won the Russian parliamentary elections by a 
wide margin, and went on to call on the Western governments "to 
understand the language of the new Russian authorities." He 
also said that he has never "liked the policy pursued by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, particularly in the Balkans" 
and that he will demand his resignation "if he does not support 
Serb policy." 
  According to him, Russia has never threatened anybody with 
anything and has not done anything by force, "but it will come, 
if someone calls for it." Asked whether he would have a meeting 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Zhirinovskiy said 
that he is ready for talks, "if someone in the Serbian 
leadership requests this", but that for him "the most important 
thing is the Serbian people". He stressed that he would "when 
he is elected as president, propose an alliance of Slav states, 
whose centeer will not be Moscow, because everyone has grown 
tired of this." 
  Expressing his personal view that the former member 
countries 
of the Warsaw Pact "should remain neutral," Zhirinovskiy 
stressed that "Russia will not enter NATO." The president of 
the Russian Liberals stressed that he is "against all blocs" and 
against "any center that dictates conditions by force." 
  Speaking about the situation in Russia, he said that "that 
there should not be any upsetting of the internal political 
situation in Russia," that parliament "will do its work over the 
coming three years," and that "the people elected his party for 
the sake of stability." 
  Commenting on relations between the United States and 
Russia, 
the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia assessed 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton "has shown himself to be a 
weakling" by not having a meeting with him in Moscow. "This is 
a gift, because anti-American feeling is growing in Russia, 
because the people know that Clinton supports the disintegration 
of Russia," Zhirinovskiy added. 
  Commenting on his recent stay in Slovenia, he noted briefly 
that the visit passed off "without incident" and "without 
contacts with the authorities." Zhirinovskiy stressed at the 
end of the news conference, which lasted almost 90 minutes, 
during which he was frequently interrupted by applause and 
ovations, that "the time for the withdrawal of Russia has passed 
and that a general emergence is beginning."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 28 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier 
Zeljko Simic said on Friday [29 January] all Yugoslav citizens 
who had been in Croatian territory at the time of the outbreak 
of Croatia's war of secession in 1991, and who had since 
disappeared must be tracked down. Croatian authorities are 
willing to release those from the list of 980 missing persons 
who should be found to be in prisons or camps, said Simic on his 
return from Geneva, where he had met on Thursday with Croatian 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic. 
  Yugoslav officials will be permitted to go to Croatia and 
investigate the circumstances in connection with the 
disappearances. Simic and Granic agreed on the setting up of a 
joint commission for the affairs of refugees, missing persons 
and humanitarian assistance. The talks with Granic took stock 
also of other sensitive issues between the two countries, such 
as the restoration of PTT, road and railway communications, said 
Simic. 
  He explained that the problems discussed at Geneva could not 
be solved without the participation of the `third party.' He 
was referring to Krajina Serbs, whose views he said were 
indispensable and whose legitimate interests had to be taken 
into account in dealing with the problems. 
  Roads and railways linking Yugoslavia and Croatia pass in 
part through the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), which has 
been proclaimed by the local Serbs in those parts within the 
arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia where they are the 
majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession 
from the former Yugoslav federation and trampling on their 
rights. 
  Simic said he was travelling to Zagreb on February 12 as 
part 
of regular monthly exchanges of visits by Belgrade and Zagreb 
ranking officials.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Alexandra 
Andon in Bucharest; date not given: "The Embargo and the 
Illusion of Peace Through the Use of Force"] 
  [Text] [Andon] What is the meaning of this sudden visit 
to Bucharest? 
  [Jovanovic] It is not exactly a sudden visit, we have had a 
steady practice for quite some time now, to carry out political 
contacts regularly. We have continued this practice in spite of 
sanctions. This time we have examined the stage of projects for 
bilateral accords that the prime ministers of the two countries 
agreed upon in October 1993. 
  [Andon] What kind of bilateral accords are you referring to? 
  [Jovanovic] We are talking about a long-term economic 
cooperation accord, whose drafting has reached the final stage. 
Likewise, we are talking about the basic bilateral accord and 
about the cooperation accord in the area of health, culture, and 
ecology. We wish that the lifting of sanctions should find us 
prepared. 
  [Andon] How long do you think the embargo is still going to 
last? 
  [Jovanovic] This embargo should not have been imposed in the 
first place. It was imposed as an idea for the reestablishment 
of peace in Bosnia but it has become the major obstacle in the 
path of peace because the Muslims rely on those sanctions and, 
therefore, they oppose peace. They believe that through 
sanctions they will obtain victory since they could not obtain 
victory in any other way in this war. An increasingly greater 
number of countries are aware of this fact. The most important 
thing is that the neighboring countries, which are the most 
affected by these sanctions, should oppose this irrational and 
absurd policy. 
  [Andon] Which countries give you signs that they support the 
lifting of the embargo? 
  [Jovanovic] First of all the European Union has linked the 
reestablishment of peace in Bosnia to the lifting of sanctions, 
asking that Serbs should fulfill certain conditions that they 
have already fulfilled. The Americans oppose the lifting of the 
embargo because of their overall interests in the region. But 
such countries as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and even Hungary 
started to give positive signs in this respect and they support 
the lifting of the embargo. The same can be said about big 
countries such as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Ukraine, 
Belarus, and among the members of the European Union Italy and 
Spain have become more flexible. Sanctions are a factor that 
directly influences the continuation of the war and might lead 
to a rapid destabilization in the Balkans. 
  [Andon] How far from or how close to a result are the Geneva 
negotiations? What is the major obstacle in the path of those 
negotiations? 
  [Jovanovic] The major obstacle is the sanctions because they 
give the Muslims the illusion that they can continue the war. 
However, actions of support for lifting the embargo have not 
been prepared yet and the international community can still not 
oppose the Islamic world, those rich Arab countries which 
support Izetbegovic's [Alija, president of Bosnia's Presidency] 
blackmail. Through him, they aim at the establishment of a 
unitary Muslim Bosnia in the center of Europe. 
  [Andon] You held talks in Bucharest with your Romanian 
counterpart Teodor Melescanu about the relations of the two 
countries with other countries in this area, namely with 
Albania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In concrete terms, what are the 
results and the conclusions of those talks? 
  [Jovanovic] We agreed that we have to renew inter-Balkan 
cooperation, as part of the process of European integration. 
Certainly, it is still too early to talk about precise terms. 
First we have to be out of the woods and then cry "halloo." 
  [Andon] What role have the relations with Romania played in 
the context of Yugoslavia's quasi isolation? 
  [Jovanovic] They have played the role that derives mostly 
from the reality that the two countries have never had conflicts 
throughout their history. Thus, Romania and Greece made 
possible that this monstrous wish to isolate Yugoslavia 
completely has never been achieved, and this helped other 
countries as well to adopt a more independent view regarding 
relations with Yugoslavia. We have had scores of political 
contacts and visits. First of all with Romania and Greece but 
also with countries that are situated farther, such as India and 
China. 
  [Andon] Have you received signs from any country that, after 
the lift of embargo, they would like to have economic 
cooperation with Yugoslavia? 
  [Jovanovic] Yes, from several countries. As a matter of 
fact, even now businessmen from Germany and France, that is, 
countries that have a very tough stand toward Yugoslavia, sell 
goods to us. Others are afraid that they may lose the market. 
Currently we are preparing bilateral economic accords -- the 
type we have with Romania -- also with Ukraine, India, Russia, 
Greece, Bulgaria, and probably with Hungary as well. Many 
countries feel that sanctions will not last long and they want 
to return to the Yugoslav market.

  [Text] President Ion Iliescu chaired an ordinary meeting 
of the country's Supreme Defense Council at Cotroceni Palace 
today. The first point of the agenda was an examination of the 
documents adopted by the North Atlantic Council summit in 
Brussels on 10-11 January, that is the declaration of the heads 
of state and government and the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
documents. The discussions on this agenda point were also 
attended by Messrs. Oliviu Gherman and Adrian Nastase, 
presidents of the two parliamentary chambers, as guests. 
  The communique received by fax from Cotroceni Palace, points 
out that, by adhering to the PFP Romania, along with the other 
partners, is thus reiterating its commitment to fulfill, in good 
faith, the obligations included in the UN Charter and the 
principles of the Human Rights Declaration, as well as the 
commitment to observe the CSCE Final Act and other CSCE 
documents. 
  Unanimously endorsing Romania's adherence to the PFP as a 
transitory stage toward full integration in the North Atlantic 
Organization, the Supreme Defense Council also endorses further 
cooperation with NATO to achieve the goals stipulated by the 
basic document. The Supreme Defense Council adopted a number of 
preparatory measures to facilitate the fulfillment of the 
obligations incumbent upon Romania through the adherence to the 
PFP. It was also decided that, in working out the presentation 
document, the established team of experts -- consisting of 
representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of National Defense -- should consult with specialists 
nominated by NATO. Similarly, consultations should be conducted 
with the heads of the political parties represented in 
Parliament in order to finalize the document. 
  Also today, the Supreme Defense Council examined and 
endorsed 
a report on the strategy and program for mobilizing the national 
economy in case of emergency and suggested that the government 
should correlate these documents with Romania's reform program 
and the special PFP program. 
  The Supreme Defense Council also endorsed a report on the 
activity carried out by the country's Supreme Defense Council in 
1993, which will be submitted to Parliament. At the same time, 
the Council's activity plan for the current year was also 
approved. The latter will be completed with certain activities 
resulting from the need to schedule various other actions and 
obligations devolving on Romania from the special PFP program, 
after its content is known. 
  The Council also endorsed the proposals on establishing the 
legal status of military cemeteries and commemorative war 
monuments at home and abroad as well as the legal status of 
foreign soldiers buried on Romanian soil.

<F P=106> [Ion Medoia report: "Defiance"] </F>
  [Text] Protesting the president's visit in the martyr city 
[Timisoara], Traian Orban, a person who was wounded in the 
revolution, laid his body across the tram rails. Iliescu laid a 
wreath in the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes. The fact that the 
president visited the military barracks in Lipovei Street, where 
on 17 December 1989 13 young persons were murdered, was simply 
an act of defiance. During Iliescu's meeting at the County 
Prefect's Office, the building was "protected" by hundreds of 
policemen and members of the riot police. 
  From the very beginning, while coming down the stairs of the 
presidential plane, Iliescu declared that he had a special 
interest, including a "personal" one (?!), in that town. 
Romania's president was present for the second time in the 
martyr city. His visit began with a classical working visit 
[reference to Ceausescu's working visits in the country], 
following every rule of such visits, at the first factory that 
lay in Iliescu's way, namely the FILTY [as published] company. 
Iliescu also hastily visited the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes, 
where he laid a wreath in a contemptuous silence. At the 
military barracks situated in Lipovei Street, belonging to the 
same unit which in 1989 December opened fire against the 
demonstrators thus killing 13 young persons, the military had 
the "honor" of personally meeting Ion Iliescu, the eminent 
president. The current leader of the country passed without 
even casting a glance at the heroes' mothers who had lined up in 
front of the barracks. While Iliescu was chatting amiably with 
the commanders of the unit, the bereaved mothers were crying at 
the barrack gates and chanting: "Iliescu, don't forget, 
Timisoara doesn't want you!" or "Let us put him on trial here, 
in Banat!" and "Down Iliescu!" 
  The peak of Iliescu's visit was his meeting in the County 
Prefect's Office building, which was surrounded, as it had never 
been before, by the police and the riot police. The president 
was almost one full hour late. Considering the visit as an act 
of defiance against the dead and the wounded [in the 
revolution], Traian Orban, who was wounded in the bloody 
December, laid himself across the tram rails as a sign of 
protest. 
  Inside the County Prefect's Office, which formerly used to 
be 
the headquarters of the PCR [Romanian Communist Party] Timis 
County branch, the president met with close aides of the former 
county secretary of PCR, Iliescu [sentence as published]. The 
atmosphere of the meeting was strained. Realizing how 
embarrassing the situation was, as the meeting was "populated" 
by former PCR officials, many people who had been invited to 
attend started leaving the hall. 
  As Iliescu's memories of the "golden age" are related too 
much to Timisoara, the president did not have the necessary time 
(and desire) to meet with that county's revolutionary 
organizations. The presidential counselors promised them 
separate talks. Now, in the evening hours, while our 
correspondent is sending this report, the Prefect's Office 
building is under siege by thousands of Timisoara citizens who 
are booing to express their protest with respect to the 
presidential visit.

  [Text] The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
[UDMR] last week sent an aide memoire to the Council of Europe 
regarding observance of the recommendations made by the Council 
of Europe when Romania was admitted as a full member. This aide 
memoire has been signed by UDMR President Bela Marko and 
Executive President Csaba Takacs, the UDMR press bureau reports. 
  The document emphasizes that the UDMR supports, without 
reservation, the recommendations made by the Council of Europe, 
which it views as mandatory in the democratic transformation 
process that is taking place in Romanian society. The aide 
memoire sent to the rapporteurs for Romania in the Council of 
Europe divides the recommendations into four categories to which 
Romania has pledged to abide, but in the implementation of which 
certain political forces -- that is Romania's Government -- do 
not manifest the necessary political will: the signing and 
ratification of certain international accords; problems 
regarding rights of ethnic minorities; legislative problems; and 
the law-governed state. 
  Without claiming to exhaust all problems, the document lists 
those problems that, according to the UDMR, are expected to be 
solved: Use of the mother tongue in the administration, 
justice, and education of all grades; use of bilingual 
inscriptions; ensuring equal chances for the assertion in the 
economy, especially in the area of privatization; adoption of 
the law on ethnic minorities and of the education law; 
separation of the powers in the state; the independence of the 
judicial power; decentralization; restitution of nationalized 
church properties; the genuine independence of the audiovisual 
media; the urgent solution of the situation of those who have 
been sentenced on ethnic grounds; and so forth. 
  The UDMR believes that the solution of these problems is 
indispensable for Romania's integration into European structures 
and expresses the hope that the international body -- the 
Council of Europe -- which has shown trust in Romania by 
admitting it as a member with full rights will seek more 
efficient ways and means to enable it to support our country, so 
that Romania can be integrated in European structures, the UDMR 
emphasizes, as cited by ROMPRES.

<F P=106> [Gheorghe Boldur-Latescu editorial: "The Chinese Model"] </F>
  [Text] No doubt political analysts as well as many of our 
more experienced fellow citizens still remember that after 
almost 20 years of terrible communist terror, starting in 1964 
in our country there was a period of relative political and 
economic relaxation, with actual positive effects on the 
people's standard of living. 
  "The Romanian spring," as some people called this period, 
ended in 1971, after Nicolae Ceausescu's visit to Asia. He 
returned enthusiastically from what he saw in China, where the 
aberrant and bloody "Cultural Revolution" was in full process of 
implementation. The darkest period of the Bolshevik 
totalitarianism in Romania began after that visit. That was a 
period that ended only with the anticommunist revolution of 
1989. The application of the Chinese model -- because, in fact 
that is what this was all about -- in the 18 years of the 
Ceausescu dictatorship left tragic marks on the Romanian people 
in the biological, psychological, economic, social, and moral 
sphere and many of those marks can be felt even today. 
  Four years after the December 1989 events, the history of 
the 
application of the Chinese model seems to be repeated. In a 
moment when, with immense efforts and sacrifice and in spite of 
the opposition of those nostalgic Communists, complex processes 
are taking place in Romania aimed at gradually leading toward 
democracy, free economy, and European reintegration, a careful 
observer might distinguish with astonishment and fear certain 
elements that suggest a new attempt to follow the Chinese model, 
with the appropriate modifications that it went through in the 
decades that have passed since it had been implemented by Mao 
Zedong. 
  In this respect, one cannot ignore the numerous visits paid 
in recent months to China by important personalities of the 
current leadership, among them Adrian Nastase [president of the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament and president of 
the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania] and Mircea Cosea 
[chairman of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and 
Economic Reform]. 
  However, we should pay special attention to the fact that 
some declarations made very recently by President Iliescu and 
Adrian Nastase are very close to the general concept of the 
Chinese model, the way it has been remodeled in the past years 
by Deng Xiaoping. For example, during the talks held at 
Cotroceni [Presidency] with the representatives of the 
Democratic Convention, the head of state let it be understood 
that the current leaders are ready to hold dialogue with the 
opposition, but in no way can there be a question of sharing 
power, although the catastrophic situation of our country and 
the obvious lack of confidence of the public in the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania] and in its allies would make a 
change of government imperative for the benefit of the country. 
This position adopted by Mr. Iliescu has been confirmed also by 
the president of the Chamber of Deputies, on the occasion of an 
ample interview granted to the Romanian Television on Monday, 17 
January, immediately after the major current events program of 
that evening. In the interview, the leader of the ruling party 
shared with millions of television viewers who were following 
the program another idea that derives from the Chinese model, 
namely that privatization is not a goal in itself. The Chinese 
leaders have launched in recent years the concept of "socialist 
market economy" which is a flagrant contradiction of terms, 
because the socialist economy (in fact the communist economy) is 
not compatible with the market economy, as can be seen from the 
tragic experience of the past 75 years. However, market economy 
cannot exist without massive privatization, the proof of it 
being what is currently happening in our country and in the 
former communist countries which carry out half-measure reforms. 
The two major leaders of the current neo-communist power in our 
country have also spoken out for other "theses" that derive from 
the typical cliches of the Chinese models. Thus, on the occasion 
of the visit paid to Cotroceni by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the 
representative of the United States to the United Nations, Mr. 
Iliescu stated that the current economy is going through a 
crisis of system and its major cause is the contradiction 
between rich and poor countries. In turn, during his 
aforementioned television interview, Mr. Nastase affirmed that 
Romania's admission to the Euro-Atlantic structures does not 
depend on the democratic reforms in our country but on our 
geostrategic position. 
  Thus, the phantom of the Chinese model is haunting our 
country again, but this does not stop us from being optimists, 
just as we have been so far. If we look at what happened in 
less than three years to the "glorious Soviet Union" and to the 
aberrant ideology on which the colossus with clay legs that 
frightened the civilized West for three quarter of a century 
relied, we can predict what is going to happen in a few years to 
the other communist colossus that tries to invent new funny 
formulas of survival. The same thing that will happen to those 
who try to follow that model. There is nothing we can do except 
tell all of them at the right time: "God forgive them for the 
evil they inflicted on humanity," because we are too small to do 
this.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Turn in Belgrade-Politics"] </F>
  [Text] For the time being, we know very little about 
[Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's talks in Belgrade last 
weekend. We know even less about the reasons for the suddenly 
urgent visit. Therefore, we are forced to draw our conclusions 
from the statements of the foreign minister and his host in 
Belgrade and from the chance remarks made by [Prime Minister] 
Peter Boross in his radio interview on 29 January. 
  What we can find out is that there has been a turn in the 
Hungarian Government's Yugoslav policies. 
  The Hungarian statements suggest that the Yugoslav crisis 
has 
already been reevaluated in the secret rooms of international 
politics and Jeszenszky actually "forwarded the CSCE's stance" 
in Belgrade, in other words, he went there on a CSCE errand. 
This latter statement is doubtful to say the least, and there 
were no signs of the former up to last night. Therefore, these 
statements are nothing but mere self-justification. 
  The turn was probably brought about by the fact that, in the 
laboratories of Hungarian foreign politics, the view that "the 
Serbs have won" must have become dominant, and we have to make 
rapid use of the favorable moment. This view already almost 
prevailed in early summer 1993, but it did not manage to break 
through, because the need to catch up with the Atlantic side was 
then dominant. At that time, the view in the United Nations and 
NATO was that Milosevic and his Belgrade are responsible for the 
situation in Bosnia and the Croatian Krajina -- even if the 
other sides in the fighting share this responsibility. This 
view has not changed since then. 
  It is a different matter that the international 
organizations 
seem to be impotent, they cannot find a way to a peaceful 
solution, and they will not enter into a military solution. 
However, they are still aware of what the running amok of the 
grand nation-state concept could mean if, after Milosevic and 
the Serbian victories were approved, it was let loose. 
  The foreign policy turn will probably be justified by the 
expected positive change in the situation of the Vojvodina 
Hungarians. The Hungarian Government is straying into an 
extremely dodgy area through this. The statement that Milosevic 
"is not averse to" the idea of territorial autonomy does not 
mean anything and is not worth anything. And to talk about the 
local assertion of democracy -- as Jeszenszky does -- is 
meaningless under dictatorial circumstances. For the same 
reason, it is impossible to appreciate the prime minister's 
statement that "a legitimate government is operating" there. 
  For of all these reasons, it is also doubtful if the 
Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] is acting wisely 
when it enters into bargaining with Milosevic, who is hungry for 
support and success, on an autonomy plan which, in its final 
form, may give rise to further ethnic cleansing, and can incite 
conflict between the national minorities even in places where 
peace has so far been preserved. 
  Obviously, sooner or later, democratic order will also be 
established in Rump Yugoslavia. At that time, will the 
Hungarians be seen as the last ally of the dictatorship? 
Because its ethnic party committed itself to Milosevic with the 
active assistance of the mother country's government? 
  It would be appropriate to think in terms of the more 
distant 
future.

<F P=106> ["AN Newspanorama"-attributed interview with Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, 
at Ferihegy Airport in Budapest on 30 January: "Rowdy Soldiers 
in the Bar"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, spent a short time in Budapest on his 
way from Ljubljana to Belgrade. The correspondent of the AN 
Newspanorama interviewed him at Ferihegy Airport. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Mr. Zhirinovskiy! You have been traveling 
a lot lately. Are you also planning a visit to Hungary? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have an invitation here too, but I am 
invited to so many European countries now that I cannot yet tell 
when I can come here for a longer time. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Who invited you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Journalists, public figures, economists, and 
public organizations. Besides, I have already been to Hungary 
as a student in 1966. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Personally, with whom or with what 
political parties do you have contacts? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] With Janos Kadar.... 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] That is the past; what about today? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Actually, I have no contacts with anyone. I 
met with the representative of your liberal party in Helsinki in 
1990 and we exchanged a few letters after that meeting, but that 
is all.... You know, the Hungarian liberals received a lot of 
money from the German liberals before the elections of 1990 and 
this helped them gain good positions at the elections, so they 
thought they would not need anyone. However, things did not 
turn out well for the Hungarians, because they have a lot of 
problems now. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Why do you think so? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No one wants your Ikarus buses; these buses 
fill the air with smoke. These buses are not even required by 
us any more, and the West does not want Hungarian goods either. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] In your opinion, what would be the correct 
road? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] To build up an Eastern community by making 
use of the former CEMA and Warsaw Pact contacts. Naturally, I 
think exclusively of economic and cultural cooperation, without 
communists and fascists. If we create our own Maastricht and 
our own Strasbourg, we will be able to compete with the West. 
No doubt, we will be better than the West with our economic 
reserves and potential. Then, you Hungarians will also be 
strong and free, not like now, when the old contacts have 
disintegrated and the West does not show any haste in opening 
the door for you. We should not throw out the good things. We 
must modernize the contacts in the new situation. 
  [UJ MAGYARORSZAG] Could Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit have a positive effect on these 
contacts? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Absolutely. We must restart the system that 
is advantageous for both sides. In my opinion, there is only 
sense in a regional cooperation, like a Danube region 
cooperation. There is no need to knock at the doors of the 
West, on foreign doors, and ask to be accepted in order to clean 
their boots and wash their cars. I hope you do not want NATO 
units to replace the former Soviet troops in Hungary and start 
feeding them now. Or do you want NATO soldiers massing it up in 
bars and pestering the girls?

<F P=106> ["B.J."-initialled report: "The Nation-Building State in </F>
Focus -- According to Csurka, the MIEP Is a `Resolute Force'"] 
  [Text] On 29 January the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP] decided on its election program at its national meeting 
of deputies. Cochairman Istvan Csurka summarized the program by 
saying: The MIEP is a resolute force.... The deputies accepted 
the party's election program, according to which the corporate 
tax would be reduced and, at the same time, the tax authorities 
would be given powers of investigation, and a secret police of 
economic crimes would be set up. In place of the discredited 
enemy image, they plan to set up a rank order of risks regarding 
our neighboring countries. 
  "We have to see that, according to the plans, the suit of 
power [as published] is to be put on the alliance between the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP]. However, to make this suit look good, the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], that has by now collapsed, 
would also get a duffle coat and the Federation of Young 
Democrats [FIDESZ] would get a jacket!" [sentence as published] 
This is how Istvan Csurka summed up the future of Hungarian 
domestic politics in his speech setting the program. 
  According to him, the real change of the regime has to be 
started, therefore, the power must not be left in the hands of 
those who have, up to now, been the rulers. This change of the 
regime would only actually affect 5,000 to 6,000 subordinates, 
and the army of 50,000 to 60,000 servants lined up behind them 
would immediately adjust to the new situation. Through this, 
those people who are ready to sell out Hungary without any 
principles at any minute would be removed from power straight 
away. Csurka did not leave any doubt in his audience as to the 
fact that the MIEP wishes to totally upset the current 
"pseudo-order" because the time for "real order" has come. The 
simple thesis that everything is based on lies in Hungary is the 
basis for this grand development of society. For this reason, 
the party declared fundamental changes in the order established 
by the [former Prime Minister] Antall era, and this might even 
mean that they will again start to fight against communism. 
  "What else could be meant by the apportioning in the left 
wing but the fact that they share out the fat jobs and the well- 
functioning economic areas between themselves. However, in the 
past four years, they have been doing the same, namely they have 
been distributing the areas that make them rich," Csurka said, 
and he set the direction of the MIEP's program as follows: 
  "We want to break with the state administration of [former 
Finance Ministers] Lajos Faluvegi, Laszlo Bekesi, and [Finance 
Minister] Ivan Szabo, and with the foreign policies of [former 
Foreign Ministers] Frigyes Puja, Gyula Horn, and [Foreign 
Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, which destroy the nation. We are 
different from the other Hungarian political parties in the 
sense that, in addition to criticizing the disorders of domestic 
conditions, we actually do something against them. Therefore, 
our election program helps us to get into power, and the power 
is only a means for us to help implement our program that will 
improve the situation of the Hungarians! We can confidently say 
that we are the resolute force that will implement the real 
change of the regime." 
  Csurka said the following in conclusion: 
  I have to end my speech with the slogan of officers of the 
so- often cursed [former governor] Horthy 's army: Ladies and 
Gentlemen, victory or Siberia! 
  The first contribution was made by Lajos Posze, the sacked 
chairman and director general of the Szerencsejatek Rt. 
[gambling enterprise], and he suggested, among other things, 
that the state should take gambling under its own authority for 
at least five years, because it is an untenable situation that 
50 to 70 billion forints a year go into the pockets of the mafia 
people operating one-armed bandits while, lately, families have 
been brutally murdered for the income from gambling machines. 
According to Co- Chairman Lajos Horvath, quite a few of the 
high-ranking military leaders still continue to lead a double 
life. 
  He summed up the future of Hungary's foreign policy as 
follows: 
  We have been here for a thousand years and we want to stay 
for at least another thousand years. Therefore, it is an 
unnecessary and irreparable decision to sacrifice the Hungarian 
minorities for a hoped-for European Community membership. 
Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is still working against the 
Hungarians living beyond our border who are desperately seeking 
autonomy! 
  Horvath said that we must be clear about the current 
geopolitical situation, therefore, in place of the outdated and 
discredited enemy image, he suggested that responsible Hungarian 
politicians grade Hungary's neighbors according to risk. 
  Finally, let us read a section from the MIEP's election 
program. 
  "The chaos of the Antall era, with its quagmire and pact, 
appears to prove that it is impossible to create order because 
the group of leaders from the past period are stronger and will 
prevent this. Thank God, this is not true, either! 
  "This will was lacking in the Antall leadership. 
  "If the democratically elected political power has the will 
to create order then, with the support of the majority of 
people, the foundations of an order based on justice can be 
established in a short period of time. 
  "Where should this be started? 
  "People coming from the soft or hard one-party system 
dictatorships are weak and vulnerable, and only have the 
strength to empower someone through secret voting, in the 
privacy of the voting booths, to represent their interests, but 
have no time themselves to create the institutions, 
organizations, and constitutions of their just order. 
  "Therefore, the democratically elected new power and new 
government will have to create a new state whose primary goal is 
to put the disadvantaged strata of the Kadar-Aczel [former party 
chief and cultural minister] period into a good position, and to 
solidly represent their interests, at the cost, if necessary, of 
squeezing out the favored people of the former period. In the 
Antall period, exactly the opposite happened. Therefore, our 
program essentially contains the methods of implementing these 
tasks. 
  "This is why the nation-building state is the focus of our 
ideas."

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, by unidentified correspondent; date and 
place not given--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On 29 January the Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party [MIEP] adopted its election program. 
MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath is to report to the listeners of 
"Extra" about the decisions made during the one-day meeting. 
[passage omitted] Mr Horvath, was this one-day meeting the 
opening of the election campaign? 
  [Horvath] Naturally, this was also the opening of the 
election campaign and, like every party preparing for the 
forthcoming tasks seriously, we also had to give a political 
program. 
  [Correspondent] Parties are usually stereotyped in their own 
country and abroad alike. You are called populist, national 
radical, and I have even heard that the MIEP is a national 
fundamentalist party. What do you consider yourself? 
  [Horvath] None of these. [passage omitted] 
  I think that the MIEP is a party which, in the Hungarian 
society of castes, wishes to represent the caste of those 
excluded, that is the majority caste. We consider that the old 
nomenclatura allowed into its own ranks a few people from the 
new parliamentary parties and created a new caste consisting of 
100,000-200,000 people in this country, who can get access to 
everything in this country, while the majority is living in 
ever-deteriorating circumstances. So this is a national party 
representing their interests, in fact, a kind of people's party. 
  [Correspondent] How do you mean that 600,000 people [as 
heard] were allowed inside the nomenclatura? Who are inside, 
the ruling parties, members of the coalition? 
  [Horvath] Well, the people of the ruling parties and the 
coalition were let inside this nomenclatura, and the old members 
have not really left. So the compromise between the two sides 
was the great compromise of 1990. 
  [Correspondent] But members of your party were also party to 
this great compromise, since the MIEP then was still part of the 
MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. 
  [Horvath] This was one of the initial reasons for leaving 
the 
MDF, for instead of the change deemed real by us, this 
compromise took place. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Are you going to form an election alliance 
with anybody? Which parties do you consider as potential 
partners? For if you intend to participate in the government, 
you will have to form a coalition, but with whom, with the MDF, 
Fidesz [Alliance of Young Democrats], the HSP [Hungarian 
Socialist Party]? 
  [Horvath] I think that these three parties are out of the 
question. First of all, perhaps I can start at the level of 
self-organization of society, for this is always more important 
that the political parties; the Farmers' Circles [Gazdakoeroek], 
Peasant Alliance [Paraszt Szovetseg], Society for the Protection 
of [Hungarian] Intellectual Life [Szellemi Vedegylet]. [passage 
omitted] Representatives of the KDNP [Christian Democratic 
People's Party] and the Independent Smallholders' Party were 
also present at our consultation, as guests, which also shows 
that the MIEP, on today's political scene, is a national 
people's party undertaking Christian and Smallholders interests 
also. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Csurka said that the people wish to 
overturn the present pseudo-order completely. What should one 
understand by this? 
  [Horvath] What I said earlier; there is a pampered stratum 
of 
society which exercises the jobs-for-the-boys principle. 
[passage omitted] For example, one-time comrades, now bank 
president or industrialist, can lend each other hundreds of 
millions, and if the loan goes down the drain at the end, the 
state will bail them out with its program of bank consolidation 
with taxpayers' money. [passage omitted] The MIEP wants to 
replace this pseudo-order with a real order. 
  The manifestation of this pseudo-order in parliament is the 
six- party consensus, which somehow always comes about in 
parliament eventually. You mark my word, in most cases, outside 
the plenary sessions the six parties sign an agreement somewhere 
else, and at the plenary sessions only a pretend debate takes 
place. They say that there is a consensus. This is making a 
mockery of parliamentarianism a bit, this is a pseudo-order. 
  [Correspondent] However, according to my information the 
MIEP 
is not in favor of a witch-hunt, but in spite of this you intend 
to sack 5,000-6,000 leaders. How can you reconcile this? 
  [Horvath] Innocent people must not be burned at the stake, 
but where witches can be found, Christians have to take action. 
  [Correspondent] Mr Csurka said once that if there were not 
an 
overwhelming cultural revolution in Hungary, that would mean the 
end of the nation; after the Chinese Cultural Revolution, this 
sentence has a somewhat unpleasant connotation. What do you 
mean by this ? 
  [Horvath] We mean something entirely different. [passage 
omitted] The Hungarian cultural revolution, if I may say so, is 
only a figure of speech. What it means is that in the country 
there should be education and support for culture which 
prioritize Hungarian interests and values. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Are you in favor of the present Hungarian 
foreign policy of trying to join NATO? 
  [Horvath] I think it is very important that Hungary join 
every European institution. We also consider it important not 
to keep begging for admittance like a dog with its tail between 
its legs, but to clarify the conditions and in turn we should 
give our own conditions, and this is how consensus should form. 
This means that a few fundamental national interests must not 
be given up, for example, the autonomy aspirations of the 
Hungarians living in the neighboring countries. We consider 
them so important that we can not give these up in order to be 
admitted to the European Community. The prime example, that if a 
nation fights for autonomy steadfastly and tenaciously then it 
achieves that, is Palestine. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Ryszard </F>
Malik; place and date not given: "Now the Climate for Romania 
Is Better"] 
  [Text] [Malik] We can see Russia slowly but definitely 
returning to its imperial role. The politicians in Moscow are 
not going to abandon the influence on the course of events in 
Central and East Europe. Characteristic was the fact that 
Russia did not agree to Poland's admission to NATO, which, 
eventually, ended up in the "Partnership for Peace" initiative 
being approved at the NATO summit in Brussels. What is your 
evaluation of Boris Yeltsin's policy, of Russia's role, and what 
is your opinion on the attitude of Western states toward the 
countries liberated from Soviet hegemony? 
  [Iliescu] We should look at all the transformation processes 
under way in our region objectively and without emotions. We 
must remember that Russia was established on the ruins of the 
Czarist state in 1917 and, even though with other slogans and 
with the ideology of internationalism, it pursued the same 
imperialist policy of the Czars. It strove to submit the world 
to itself. The USSR was nothing but a continuation of Russia as 
it looked before 1917. The artificially established republics 
were steered centrally; all power was concentrated in the 
Kremlin. What has changed now? The Russia of Yeltsin is 
reverting back to the old Russian traditions -- traditions going 
back to times before 1917: we have the Duma, we have the Czarist 
eagle as the emblem of today's Russia, there are also people who 
are referring to the past. There are conservative forces, which 
demand that the Russian state, in this way or another, control 
the neighboring states. I am thinking about our part of Europe 
and about our two neighbors. 
  A return to the past, especially to the past associated with 
a given state's strength, could be observed in all fallen 
empires: in Great Britain after World War II; in France in the 
1960's, when Algeria, which wanted independence, was looked upon 
as an overseas part of France. Therefore, I want to emphasize 
that what we are observing today in Russia is not really 
surprising. 
  These are forces with which we must reckon; please note, 
however, that there are also progressive democratic forces, led 
by President Yeltsin. I hope that democracy will win; that new 
relations between Russia and its neighbors will develop in line 
with accepted rules of international politics, and that they 
will be friendly and will serve the interests of both sides. 
The historical process that is going on in today's world is 
very complex and we cannot really jump to any conclusions. I 
believe in the wisdom of politicians and assume that we all want 
a stable and peaceful Europe. The "Partnership for Peace" 
program seems to be a step in the right direction in this 
process. 
  [Malik] Romania sees, then, a possibility of Russia's 
membership in NATO? 
  [Iliescu] I hope that a certain general formula of 
partnership will be established which will in the future allow 
the Russian Federation to integrate with political and economic 
structures throughout Europe. I hope that Russia will find its 
niche in the community based on the rule of respecting the 
interests of all states. Today, a new international order is 
being constructed; this order is based on cooperation and 
understanding between all states and nations. It is a 
necessity, however, it is at the same time a guarantee of peace 
and stability. 
  [Malik] You are one of the few politicians in former 
socialist countries who is still in power after all the changes 
that have taken place. Could you reveal the source of this 
success? 
  [Iliescu] Once again we must go back to history. Romania 
was one of the states where the communist regime was very 
strict. However, at the time of intervention in Czechoslovakia 
and even earlier, Romania proved that it was not going to just 
passively follow the orders of the Kremlin. It was only the 
policy of the last decade, under the Nicolae Ceausescu regime, 
that led to an economic catastrophe, to unprecedented exclusion 
of the intellectual elites from political and economic life; in 
those years the elites were sentenced to a life of isolation. 
Building an autocratic economy and paying off the foreign debt 
at any cost were the most important achievements -- in the 
negative sense -- of the last communist leader of Romania. This 
is why the activities of the opposition were so radical; this is 
why we had a revolution that did not occur in any other former 
communist country. In the times of President Causescu, I was 
isolated for criticizing his policy in public. Because of that, 
I became a well-known personality -- one can even say that I 
became popular. I did many things that did not exactly fit the 
compulsory model. When the revolution broke out, in December 
1989, I found myself in the center of all the events and, 
perhaps because of my past, the people trusted me. I was 
elected chairman of the National Salvation Front. Then in the 
1990 elections, I was elected president; finally, two years ago, 
the people once again supported my candidacy for the head of 
state. It looks like I am still enjoying the trust of the 
people. 
  [Malik] Mr. President, not long ago Romania was depicted 
as a country governed by former communists. The situation 
changed a little after a former communist leader won the 
elections in Lithuania and after a social-democratic party won 
the Polish elections. Did you not, at a certain point, get the 
impression that Western politicians wanted to force you, as it 
were, to leave the political scene? 
  [Iliescu] I get the impression that not only in the case of 
Romania, but in all the states formerly governed by communists, 
there is a certain ideological flaw in the way the West 
perceives us. The very term ex-communist has in our case 
negative connotations. I will ask the following question: 
Should over 4 million members of the Romanian communist party 
now be isolated, excluded from the political and economic life? 
What should happen to the leaders of the opposition, such as 
Professor Emil Constantinescu (leader of the oppositional 
Democratic Convention comprised of 18 groupings -- R.M.), who 
was the [communist] party's ideological secretary in the 
university? Former communist party members are in all the 
groupings today. Almost the entire intellectual elite in 
Romania was in the party. This is not the only criterion for 
evaluating people. This is not acceptable; it is a Bolshevik 
evaluation. We must build a new Romanian society and evaluate 
people according to what they can do. One must see things and 
people as they really are, without looking into the dossier at 
any cost. 
  [Malik] In Switzerland, in exile, lives former King Michael 
II. Why do you not want him to return to his fatherland? 
  [Iliescu] We must look at this problem without any emotions. 
The problem is whether Romania is supposed to be a monarchy or a 
republic. The Romanian people have already expressed their 
opinions on this subject in a referendum; they accepted the 
republican constitution. Monarchy was a certain stage in the 
history of Romania; there is no raison d'etre for its role in a 
new society. Indeed, there are various forces and people in our 
country that for various reasons want to restore the monarchy. 
These people are living with illusions -- they want to return 
to the times before World War II. Today, that is simply 
impossible. Personally, I have nothing against the king. 
However, if he wants to return to Romania as a king, this is 
simply out of the question. Now, if he wants to come back here 
as an ordinary citizen, then he is welcome. Let me only add 
that it is not him that is the cause of all this commotion; he 
does not want to be a monarch any longer. Those who have caused 
it are people driven by nostalgia. 
  [Malik] Is it true that Romania is being isolated, that 
there are opinions in Bucharest that the state has been 
relegated to the sidelines of regional initiatives, and that 
entrance into the Council of Europe was delayed? 
  [Iliescu] Romania does not want to be isolated. It is true 
that we are being moved away. We wanted -- fruitlessly -- to 
become a member of the Visegrad Group and to join the Central 
European Initiative. We want to cooperate with all the states 
of Central and East Europe, including Poland. As far as the 
issue of admitting us to the Council of Europe is concerned, my 
evaluation is that it was the same ideological flaw -- 
perceiving us as former communists. However, also as a result of 
our internal disputes, they are transferred to the international 
level. It is one of our weaknesses in the period of change. We 
know all about it. 
  The climate for Romania is now better. Everyone understands 
that including our country in the process of European 
integration will be in the interest of all Europe. 
  [Malik] Since I am speaking with you as the Romanian 
president, I cannot help asking you a question about the 
Republic of Moldova, which was established from the debris of 
the USSR. Is it possible, and is it very real, that Romania and 
Moldova will become one state? There will be a referendum on 
this very soon. 
  [Iliescu] Well, this is a very difficult issue given the 
present international situation. We must look at it 
objectively. We must respect international and interstate 
agreements that set the present borders in Europe. One cannot 
change the present status of borders in one point, because this 
would cause an avalanche of corrections; such an avalanche would 
be difficult to control and would place the stabilization of the 
entire continent in question. 
  As for the Republic of Moldova, it is one of the many states 
that were established after the collapse of the Soviet Union; 
processes of political and economic transformations are under 
way there. However, it must be remembered that Moldova is a 
territory that historically belongs to Romania; that Romanian is 
spoken there; and that the country has the same culture. The 
Soviet Union's annexation of Moldova was the result of the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov pact; however, Nikita Khrushchev was even 
smarter than Stalin and divided Moldova; as a result, today part 
of it belongs to Ukraine. Thus, now this concerns not only the 
Republic of Moldova, but also Ukraine. 
  We have good relations with Moldova and we will develop them 
in all areas. The answer to the question of when the 
unification of these states will be possible remains pure 
guesswork. No one knows that. If we assume that in the future 
united Europe there will be no borders and that there will be 
one great European nation, this issue will not be so emotional. 
  [Malik] Many national minorities live in Romania. Of 
these, the Hungarians are the most numerous. This is the cause 
of tensions in the relations between Romania and Hungary. What 
guarantees does Romania provide minorities? 
  [Iliescu] In Romania lives a Hungarian minority that 
consists of 1.7 million people. Just like all the other 
minorities, of which there are 14, the Constitution guarantees 
them all rights, it can develop without any hindrances, in 
peace, and with the feeling of stability. The minorities have 
their own representatives in the parliament. Even the smallest 
national groups, in case their representatives are not elected 
to parliament, are guaranteed a seat there. The Romanian 
Government has acknowledged the rights of the minorities for 
free development, in accordance with their needs, in every area. 
No matter whether they are Germans or Hungarians, all of them 
have the same rights as Romanian citizens. The rule that our 
country is applying is that minority members must be loyal 
citizens of Romania and observe all binding laws. 
  Now, as for our relations with Hungary. We have informed 
Budapest that we are alarmed at the extreme demonstrations of 
some political forces in Hungary which query the status quo in 
the region and demand extraordinary rights for the Hungarian 
minority in Romania, and not only here. We do not consent to 
the idea of territorial autonomy for any minority. For example, 
do the Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine in France have 
autonomy? We believe that these are issues that each state 
regulates in line with international law. Please bear in mind 
that one-third of Romanians live outside our borders. We are 
not trying to turn it into a problem; we are not bringing this 
issue up. We support the contacts of the Hungarians with their 
native country; however, we would also like them to be loyal 
citizens of Romania and to respect the law just like all the 
other citizens. 
  I believe that our relations with Hungary are good. Our 
economic contacts are on a very good level, I would say. I do 
believe that if we take a real look at the problems that need to 
be resolved and that need cooperation, we will render these 
relations normal and friendly. Just like the relations with any 
other state. 
  [Malik] Many economic problems of Romania have their origin 
in the war in former Yugoslavia. Does Romania, which has good 
relations with the new Yugoslavia, have any influence on this 
conflict? Is it doing anything to help end this conflict? 
  [Iliescu] Romania has never had any conflicts with former 
Yugoslavia. On the contrary, our relations are very good. As I 
see it, the disintegration of Yugoslavia was a positive event. 
After World War I, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established 
which functioned very well; it settled disputes between various 
nations and various religions, the Muslims, Catholics, and 
Orthodox Church members. In World War II, the nations of 
Yugoslavia fought jointly against the German invaders. The 
disintegration of Yugoslavia is the result of the ending of the 
Cold War; it is the play of the interests of various states, 
such as Germany, which contributed to what happened. Romania 
today has good relations with the new Yugoslavia, with Slovenia, 
and with Croatia. We would like the conflict in Bosnia to be 
settled quickly and peacefully. We are trying to help this 
cause as much as we can. We have historical, political, 
economic, and cultural relations with this region. It is also 
in our interest to finally settle this dramatic conflict. 
  [Malik] Mr. President, Polish-Romanian relations have a long 
tradition. They have always been friendly. How do you evaluate 
them today? 
  [Iliescu] I would first of all like to emphasize that we 
attach great importance to our relations with Poland and their 
development. First, because we cooperated many times in the 
past and many times we were on the same side of the barricade. 
We were linked by the same problems. Our neighbors were great 
empires which attempted to submit us to themselves. Right now 
we are facing a great challenge related to the process of 
democratic transformation and the introduction of a market 
economy. Therefore, it is with sorrow that I speak about the 
unfriendly treatment of Romania; you write about our state being 
a country of Gypsies; your mass media, including the newspaper 
that you represent, present only a negative picture of Romania. 
Why is that? Is it because Poland is enjoying great sympathy 
in Romania and because the Romanians admire Polish culture? 
  We are both surprised and alarmed at this reservedness on 
the 
part of Poland toward Romania. 
  However, I am an optimist and I hope that in the immediate 
future better times for Polish-Romanian relations will come. 
Using your newspaper, I would like to inform all your readers 
about my optimism and about the great sentiment that the 
Romanian people have for Poland and Poles.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "Signature on `Partnership'; </F>
Prior to Prime Minister Pawlak's Visit to Brussels"] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers is scheduled to make 
a decision today on whether Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will 
sign a document committing Poland to joining the program of 
cooperation with NATO known as "Partnership for Peace" during 
his visit to NATO Headquarters in Brussels tomorrow. The 
government's decisions to date justify a supposition that this 
kind of authorization will indeed be formulated for the prime 
minister, said Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's chief diplomat, 
during Monday's [31 January] press conference at the Office of 
the Council of Ministers. 
  Olechowski stated he will submit a motion to the government 
requesting that it approve a resolution authorizing the prime 
minister to sign the document. Observers deem the Council of 
Ministers' acceptance as virtually certain, although, as is 
widely known, Poland has reservations with regard to 
"Partnership for Peace" because it says the program provides no 
guarantees for future membership of our country in the Western 
alliance. In a separate conversation with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jerzy 
Milewski, who is chief of the National Security Bureau and first 
deputy defense minister, said he believes the Council of 
Ministers will give the prime minister a "green light" enabling 
him to sign a so-called document of principles, in which the 
West outlined the main principles of the "Partnership" and which 
contains an invitation to take part in the program. Specific 
issues regarding NATO-Poland cooperation will be worked out 
during consultations which are to begin shortly. 
  Both "Partnership for Peace" and general relations with NATO 
are scheduled to be one of the main topics discussed during the 
prime minister's visit to Brussels, as well as during a meeting 
with the new first deputy secretary general of NATO, Sergio 
Silvio Balanzino of Italy (Manfred Woerner is seriously ill). 
  During the second day of the visit (3 February), Waldemar 
Pawlak will present a lecture at a conference organized by the 
Washington-based Strategic and International Research Center. 
The topic of the lecture will be the security of Poland and 
Europe in general. The prime minister will also be a guest of 
Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Regardless of the prime 
minister's participation, some personalities from Polish 
political life are also scheduled to take part in the Brussels 
conference--for instance, Professor Bronislaw Geremek. Polish 
National Bank Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz will be a 
representative of the Polish economic sector. 
  Apart from that, Waldemar Pawlak also, as the first Polish 
prime minister to do so, will meet with Willem van Eekelen, 
secretary general of the Western European Union. 
  During the unofficial part of the prime minister's visit to 
Brussels, some talks are also scheduled with EC Chairman Jacques 
Delors and also with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch. 
The prime minister's associates, however, refused to let 
journalists know what specific topics would be discussed during 
the talks. All they said was that the new prime minister's 
second trip abroad (following the Prague summit with the U.S. 
and Visegrad countries' presidents) is supposed to emphasize 
Poland's efforts toward integration with the West, and that the 
visit is associated with the fact that on 1 February Poland's 
treaty of association with the European Union becomes effective.

  [Text] Slovak President Michal Kovac spoke today in favor 
of preserving the Visegrad Group's role as a practical 
consultative forum, without its being institutionalized. He 
said that mutual cooperation of Central European countries would 
help to speed up the inevitable economic changes and their 
incorporation into the well-tried European structures. 
  Replying to a question about whether in his opinion the 
Visegrad Group could exist without the Czech Republic, President 
Kovac said that, in the talks he had in Prague, there was no 
indication that the Czech Republic was not interested in mutual 
cooperation. President Kovac therefore does not think it 
appropriate to consider other alternatives to the Visegrad Group.

  [Excerpts] Ljubuljana, Jan 28 (AFP) -- Slovenia's Foreign 
Ministry on Friday called on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to leave the 
country after the Russian ultra-nationalist leader said the 
independent state should be incorporated into a new Yugoslavia. 
The Ministry said in a statement that Zhirinovskiy, who arrived 
here Thursday at the invitation of the tiny National Social 
Union of Slovenia, had "offended public order" and "caused 
consternation among part of the Slovenian public." The Ministry 
call for him to leave "as quickly as possible" came after the 
leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party said Slovenia should 
form part of a reconstituted Yugoslavia. 
  Last month, Zhirinovskiy angered Bulgarian officials and was 
promptly asked to leave the country after calling on the 
president to step down. 
  At a press conference in the northwestern town of Bled 
Friday, Zhirinovskiy said Slovenes, Croats and Serbs should 
reunite in a single state. "Slovenes are perhaps happy to have 
their own state, but if everyone followed their example it would 
lead to catastrophe," he added. He stressed that he was against 
the use of arms to resolve conflicts, as this would set the 
stage for "a third world war," and that countries' frontiers 
should be respected. 
  The only way to stabilize the situation in former Yugoslavia 
was for United Nations troops to withdraw, he added. He warned 
that if the world body approved the use of North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation air strikes in Bosnia he would personally "call on 
(the Russian) parliament to vote for Russia to leave the UN." 
  The Ministry statement said Zhirinovskiy's entourage had 
"grossly violated public order" during their stay in Bled. It 
called on Russia's charge d'affaires in Ljubuljana to ensure 
Zhirinovskiy and his team left Slovenia promptly. [passage 
omitted] 
  Zhirinovskiy was due to spend Saturday and Sunday in the 
Slovenian resort of Portoroz on the Adriatic coast before 
leaving for Belgrade. His Belgrade host Velimir Cvetic, head of 
the Social Democratic Party of Yugoslavia, earlier said 
Zhirinovskiy would be invited to visit the Serb-styled Serb 
republics in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina respectively.

  [Text] General Janko Bobetko, chief of general staff of the 
Croatian Army Corps, has denied the accusations by the Sarajevo 
government that regular units of the Croatian Army are allegedly 
present in Bosnia. 
  [Begin Bobetko recording] The issue of Croatia's involvement 
or noninvolvement [in the fighting in Bosnia] is an issue which 
has always been absolutely politicized because the basic fact, 
or the strongest argument, has been completely forgotten, and 
all humanitarian and civilizational norms have been ignored. 
Thousands and thousands of Croats born in Bosnia and living 
here in Croatia not only looked on [at what was going on in 
Bosnia], but also lost either their entire family or some 
members of their family in most beastly ways. They saw their 
fathers gone missing, relatives who are no longer there, sisters 
who are wondering around those Bosnian ravines -- and the 
question which is raised now is: who has got the right to forbid 
me or any Croat from Bosnia, to defend his (?own). Who can do 
that? Which institution? It is sad that organizations which 
have concrete insight in every detail of what is going on can 
still be perturbed by a statement by a Silajdzic because Croatia 
is present and it does not allow the genocide over the Croatian 
people. If that was [true], and it is in fact invented, the 
world, today, in the 21st century, [as heard] should ask itself: 
What are we doing, gentlemen, when in 21st century [as heard] 
Europe we have allowed such atrocities and such a war? [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Balance of the Clearing Account </F>
Just Like at the End of Last Year"] 
  [Text] Prague--The overall balance of the clearing account 
for trade with Slovakia has reached 5.7 billion korunas or 
approximately 170 million ECU's, after Thursday [27 January], 
which is 40 million ECU's over the margin limit. 
  The old lot surplus amounts to 800 million korunas, and the 
new lot 4.9 billion in favor of the Czech Republic. Last year, 
at the end of December, when the margin limit was surpassed for 
the first time, the amounts reached 1.611 billion and 4.106 
billion, respectively. The National Bank of the Slovak Republic 
covered the amount over the allowed margin before the deadline 
on 10 January.

<F P=106> [Report by Mladen Krsmanovic on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's </F>
address to a rally in Bijeljina; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Russian 
fading into Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Krsmanovic] Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, president of the Russian liberals, took the floor 
at the rally amid tumultuous applause. Addressing the rally, 
Zhirinovskiy said he had come from Russia which, although far 
away in the north, had close fraternal links with the Serb 
nation. He said: We consider you as our brothers. I represent 
the party that won at Russia's first free elections. Our party 
came first. The Russian people elected this party knowing that 
it was the party of a new Russia, the party of a new foreign 
policy, the party of cooperation with the Serb people, and added: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I promise you that I will make radical 
changes 
in policy very soon. I have already demanded that Minister 
Kozyrev tell the entire world clearly that the Russian 
Government and the Russian parliament are on the side of the 
Serb people. 
  [Krsmanovic] After this Zhirinovskiy pointed out that there 
were different countries in the territory of former Yugoslavia 
bearing different names. He said this territory was once called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is the Serbs who are living in this 
region. They should be asked if and when a new name is given to 
this country and when the borders of Serbia are determined, said 
Zhirinovskiy and added: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Catholics from the West, Muslims from the 
East, some enemy forces from the North--they all want to take a 
chunk of Greater Serbia for themselves, and they think that we 
will agree to it. We will never agree to it and Russia will 
help you. It will punish those who want to divide the Serb 
land. This policy has been going on for 100 years now. Every 
50 years they start a war in the Balkans or somewhere else, and 
each time the victims are the Serb and the Russian people. Our 
message to the whole world today is that a new historic era is 
in the making. We shall put an end to the policy of playing 
games with the destinies of the Serb and Russian people once and 
for all. 
  [Krsmanovic] Addressing more than 15,000 people gathered in 
the square of King Peter I the Liberator in Bijeljina, 
Zhirinovskiy said that he was speaking from the center of 
Serbia, from the seat of the territories which have historically 
and by right belonged to the Serb people. He made a special 
note of Russian solidarity. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would like to give you some encouragement. 
The governments of some foreign countries that have applied 
(?methods of) pressure are now threatening air strikes because 
their other policy has failed. If one single bomb falls on a 
Serb town I warn them, on behalf of the strongest party in the 
Russian parliament, that this is a declaration of war against 
Russia and that we will punish them for it. They have two 
standards of democracy: According to them, the destruction of 
Serbs and Russians is democracy. But when we defend ourselves, 
they call it fascism. We do not fall for these double standards. 
I therefore hope that the Serbs become even stronger. I wish 
you courage, strength, and optimism. Look ahead proudly as a 
great nation. The great Russian nation is behind you. 
  [Krsmanovic] Zhirinovskiy ended his speech with these words 
to the rally in Bijeljina today: We have one church, one 
language, one history--the same destiny. This destiny will be a 
happy one in the 21st century, and the future will be happy for 
all Russians and all Serbs. 
  This afternoon Zhirinovskiy is expected to meet Milan 
Martic, 
president of the republic of Serb Krajina, in Vukovar.

  [Text] [Announcer] The treaty on Poland's association with 
the European Union comes into force 1 February, two years after 
it was signed. Andrzej Olechowski, minister of foreign affairs, 
said at a news conference in Warsaw that from now on we would 
have new rights. 
  [Olechowski] "Poland, not only because of its aspirations 
but 
also in the institutional sense, occupies a specific place in 
Europe. It is now joining the countries which have decided to 
achieve a historic task, rare on our continent, namely to get 
integrated into one body. The form which this body should take 
has, of course, been a subject of discussions. From now on, we 
shall also be able to influence this discussion and we shall be 
able to express our views on the future shape of the continent." 
  [Announcer] Now over to the minister of foreign economic 
cooperation, Leslaw Podkanski. 
  [Podkanski] "The preliminary agreement which expires today 
will be replaced by the Association Treaty, which gives us 
guarantees for the continuity of principles and conditions of 
trade between Poland and the [European] Community. The 
fundamental objective is to create in the next few years a 
free-trade zone for our state and the [European] Community 
states. The treaty, however, does not give the final ruling on 
the issue of agricultural products and fish." 
  [Announcer] When assessing the two-year transitional period, 
from the moment of signing until the moment when the Association 
Treaty comes into force, Minister Leslaw Podkanski said that at 
present almost three quarters of our exports find their way onto 
the EC market without any duties being levied. The minister 
added that until now a quarter of goods imported to Poland from 
the EC had been duty free. Minister Leslaw Podkanski: 
  [Podkanski] "As of 1 January 1995 we shall be able to export 
all goods duty free, apart from textiles and metallurgical 
products. When it comes to our concessions with regard to 
allowing EC goods onto the Polish market, from 1 January 1995 to 
1 January 1999 we shall have to carry out a proportional 
reduction in the duties levied on all industrial goods, which 
are still in force." 
  [Announcer] Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the government 
plenipotentiary for European integration: 
  [Saryusz-Wolski] "A whole package of agreements is coming 
into force. They concern not only a free flow of goods but also 
of services, capital and people, although people to a lesser 
extent. The association institutions are starting to function as 
well. This should put us in a better position to negotiate and 
improve the treaty further." 
  [Announcer] Our full membership in the European Union will 
complete the process of association. It is, however, not known 
yet when this will happen, Minister Andrzej Olechowski pointed 
out. 
  [Olechowski] "We have in this respect an unequivocal 
declaration from Copenhagen which says that it is in the 
interest of both sides that Poland should become a member of the 
European Union. For this reason it is a duty of both Poland and 
the European Union that Poland should become a member, and that 
this should happen in our lifetime. A schedule of specific 
steps will be needed for this purpose. We shall make efforts 
for such a schedule to emerge." 
  [Announcer] The minister of foreign affairs, Andrzej 
Olechowski, said that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers 
tomorrow he would ask the council to authorize Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak to sign during his forthcoming visit to 
Brussels, an agreement on Poland's membership in the Partnership 
for Peace program. 
  [Olechowski] "The decision concerning the prime minister's 
signing the document, which is an invitation to the Partnership 
for Peace [program], will be taken by the Council of Ministers 
tomorrow. If we look at the decisions made by the Council of 
Ministers so far, such an authorization will certainly be 
formulated. The Council of Ministers has already expressed its 
support for the Partnership for Peace [initiative] and Poland's 
willingness to take active part in this program." 
  [Announcer] Krystyna Koziol was the author of this report 
from the press conference.

  [Text] Warsaw (DDP/ADN)--According to the German and Polish 
interior ministers, Manfred Kanther and Andrzej Milczanowski, 
there have been some initial difficulties with the 
implementation of the German-Polish asylum agreement. This is, 
however, normal and there is no question of Poland having 
circumvented the agreement, as was reported by some German media 
at the weekend, Kanther told journalists in Warsaw today. 
  In the six months after the agreement came into force on 1 
July 1993, 2,697 people who had illegally entered Germany from 
Poland were turned over to the Polish authorities by the German 
side, Milczanowski said. Another 975 refugees were sent back 
under a simplified procedure. 
  During those six months there were only 28 cases where the 
Polish side refused to accept the persons to be returned. The 
main reason for this was problems with the interpretation of the 
papers which the German authorities must produce to document the 
refugee's transit route through Poland. The Polish side 
believes there are still some unresolved points regarding this 
question. 
  Kanther said, on the other hand, that the documents' 
plausibility was "sufficiently proven" by the agreements already 
reached. Nor did he wish to comment on the figures quoted by 
Milczanowski. Different categories in counting the refugees 
preclude any comparison. Milczanowski announced that liaison 
officers will be named by the end of February to bring about a 
more rapid settlement of contentious issues. 
  Milczanowski conceded that some of the persons returned from 
Germany have once again illegally entered Germany from Poland. 
This resulted among other things from the fact that he could 
not detain deported refugees for longer than 48 hours in 
accordance with a decision by Poland's Constitutional Court. 
However, this problem would be "sorted out" during the next 
month and a half. Individuals refused entry should then be 
flown back to their country of origin within 48 hours. 
  Kanther and Milczanowski also discussed cross-border 
cooperation in fighting crime. An agreement to this effect is 
to be drafted in the near future. The ministers described 
cooperation between the interior ministries and police forces of 
both countries as smooth.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Milczanowski Gives </F>
Promises to Kanther"] 
  [Text] Cooperation and joint interests in combating the 
problem of migration was declared on Monday [31 January] by 
German Internal Affairs Minister Manfred Kanther and his Polish 
counterpart, Andrzej Milczanowski. "The Germans do not have any 
complaints that they would like to submit to us," said 
Milczanowski following the conference. "Bonn-Direkt," an 
information program broadcast on Sunday evening in the second 
program of the German television network ZDF, carried a report 
on the complaints of the Federal Republic of Germany toward 
Poland for not implementing the duties stemming from an 
agreement on readmission signed on 7 May 1993. 
  It was stated on the ZDF program that Polish border troops 
employ all kinds of tricks just to avoid admitting refugees 
captured by German border police. However, the aforementioned 
agreement obliges Poland to begin asylum proceedings or return 
the refugees to their countries of origin. 
  The agreement on readmission, signed on 7 May 1993 by Poland 
and Germany, envisioned that from 1 July (that is, from the day 
the new asylum law came into force) until the end of 1993, 
Germany would be allowed to send back to Poland no more than 
10,000 refugees; from 1994 on, there would be no limits. By the 
end of 1994, Poland is supposed to receive 120 million German 
marks to secure the borders and establish an asylum system. 
  The head of the German Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW] 
spoke in Warsaw with President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, and Polish MSW Head Andrzej Milczanowski. At 
the conference following the meeting, no one spoke about 
Germany's complaints with Poland. Milczanowski even reported 
that the similarity of views of both ministers is as great as 
the convergence of their birthdays; they were born in the same 
year, the same month, and on the same day. 
  "We achieved a satisfactory agreement on the issue of 
readmitting foreigners who cross the border illegally." 
  "There are certain difficulties," conceded Kanther. 
  "Indeed, there are certain difficulties in the area of the 
interpretation of documents which are supposed to be a 
sufficient reason for us to admit asylum-seekers from Germany," 
said Milczanowski. He reported that from 1 July to the end of 
1993, Germany sent 2,679 people to Poland; there were 28 
controversial cases. 
  Kanther admitted that the German side has different data 
from 
those presented by Milczanowski, "but they cannot be identical 
because there are different legal categories." 
  Probably by the end of February, both sides will appoint 
liaison officers in the border areas. This step is supposed to 
make the process of establishing the identity of refugees "less 
bureaucratic" in situations when they have no documentation. 
  Asked by RZECZPOSPOLITA after the conference whether Poland 
had returned any refugees to countries of origin, he said that 
it had, but not by air. He was not able to say how many 
refugees we had sent away from Poland in this way. 
  During the conference the moderator did not let any of the 
Polish journalists ask a question; only German journalist were 
allowed to ask questions.

<F P=106> [Article by Krystyna Grzybowska from Bonn: "Security of East </F>
Europe; Territorial Claims Forbidden"] 
  [Text] After Helmut Kohl left to meet with President 
Clinton, the Chancellor's Office leaked information on Bonn's 
plans to reconciliate the security needs of Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the three Baltic states with 
support for Boris Yeltsin and Russian interests. These plans 
were discussed during talks in Washington. Bonn believes that 
the security needs of Poland and the other neighbors might, for 
the time being, be satisfied by decreasing the distance to the 
West European Union [WEU]. 
  Germany wants to present the East European states, which 
have 
already signed association treaties with the European Union 
[EU], with an offer of membership in the European Political 
Cooperation, in the system of diplomatic consultations of the 
EU, which, in line with the Maastricht Treaty, will be replaced 
by a joint foreign policy. 
  In line with Chancellor Kohl's plans, Poland as well as 
other 
countries would take part in the meetings of political directors 
of foreign affairs ministries, and they would have the full 
right to express their opinions when joint policies on the most 
fundamental issues are established. At the same time, a process 
of shortening the distance to the WEU would be ongoing; it would 
be harmonized with the integration with EU structures. 
  One could also hear in German diplomatic circles talk that, 
even though the entire "Partnership for Peace" proposal is still 
quite fuzzy, one thing, according to Bonn, must be made clear: 
Excluded from the "Partnership" will be any and all states 
making territorial claims on their neighbors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gregor Koebl, FRG consul general in Gdansk, </F>
by correspondent Andrzej Palmirski; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Palmirski] Your previous post was with the 
diplomatic mission to the Sultanate of Brunei, where the 
national income per head of population is the highest in the 
world. I will not ask you to make comparisons, although I am 
sure plenty could be made, but to share with us your reflections 
concerning our new role as a country aspiring to membership of 
the free market. 
  [Koebl] It is true that Brunei is a very rich country, but 
it is also quite small and situated as far from Poland as it is 
from Germany. Poland, on the other hand, is a large country 
which, together with France, is our closest and most important 
neighbor. That is why I believe that, in these 
post-German-unification days, my principal task in Szczecin will 
be to keep highlighting the fact that Poland is a most important 
partner for Germany. 
  Thus, I am facing a major opportunity to engage my talents 
here, and the best thing about it is that it will not be routine 
work. As soon as the Berlin Wall fell, we faced new challenges, 
with the possibility of making new cross-border contacts, and 
with entirely new expectations from the people living on the two 
sides of the border. So I see it as my most important task in 
Szczecin to bring about the realization of all these aspects of 
our new neighborhood situation. 
  [Palmirski] The Odra-Nysa border is now the frontier line 
between the European Union [EU] and Central Europe. What are 
the chances of making sure that it will not become a dividing 
line between a community of wealth and a community of poverty? 
  [Koebl] I hope that that sort of dividing line will be 
abolished to the same extent that a similar line was abolished 
between Germany and France. That particular division does not 
exist any more. The whole process will, of course, take some 
time, just as in the case of our own western border. 
  A significant impulse lending an impact to the 
transformation 
process was the association agreement between the EU and Poland 
which, according to our intentions, will eventually lead to 
Poland's full membership of the Union. This is something that 
we are striving for on both sides. 
  Consequently, I hope that the dividing line between the 
present EU and Poland will gradually disappear in the future, 
and that Poland will enter more and more deeply into the Union's 
structures until finally it becomes completely integrated with 
the Union. 
  Many new initiatives are springing up nowadays from the 
background of these concerns, and the authors of these 
initiatives attempt to accelerate the whole process of 
integration. I am thinking here of the campaigns to create new 
Euroregions on both the Polish and German sides of the border.... 
  [Palmirski] But the proposed "Pomerania" Euroregion appears 
at the moment to be sunk in deep slumber. What impulses are 
necessary to wake it up and bring it to life? 
  [Koebl] This will depend on both partners. Associations of 
parishes which have expressed the wish to create the new 
Euroregion have already been set up on both sides of the border. 
Both these associations are sovereign structures and it is 
entirely up to them when they decide to set a date for the 
creation of the Pomerania Euroregion. Nevertheless, if there 
are still some reservations on either side, we simply need more 
time for these to disappear. Patience is sometimes also needed 
in politics. It is just like in a good marriage: Before you 
enter into the contract, you should first consider your 
decisions very carefully, because the principle of the whole 
thing is that the marriage should be indissoluble. 
  [Palmirski] Your predecessor in this post, Mr. Rainald 
Roesch, rendered many services to the cause of Polish-German 
cooperation. What, in your opinion, will be the main directions 
of further cooperation? 
  [Koebl] It is the consul's brief during his mission to see 
to the development of economic cooperation. There is no need 
for me to dwell here on the more obvious consular concerns, such 
as attention to the legal and administrative problems affecting 
citizens who come into contact with us. 
  However, it appears that political contacts will be among 
the 
most important matters for us to deal with in this particular 
borderland area. After all, because of the complete change in 
the political situation after 1989, our partners appear in an 
entirely new light to us. The fields of action mapped out by 
the new pacts and treaties between Poland and the FRG are new, 
too. We are still discovering many new things about each other 
and we are still learning how to understand each other. 
  That is why I am very happy to have been so well received by 
the political leaders in your voivodship, from the voivoda down. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Palmirski] Would you now be so kind as to comment on the 
case that keeps Everyone's emotions engaged: What is your 
position concerning Zhirinovskiy's declarations about the 
changes in European borders that he proposes to make? 
  [Koebl] That particular issue belongs in the world of big 
politics. Everything pertaining to such concerns--and 
especially when these involve current developments in Russia--is 
within the competence of relevant figures at the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn rather than a "minor" figure such as the consul 
in Szczecin. Consequently, I would prefer not to make any 
statements on these questions--which is not to say that I do not 
hold a personal opinion in these matters.... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for </F>
Polish President Lech Walesa, by Piotr Swiac on the "Directly 
From the Belvedere" program; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Swiac] Shortly after a summit of the Visegrad 
Group leaders in Prague, President Walesa was host last week to 
Slovak President Michal Kovac. Despite some very friendly 
gestures at the meeting, some preannounced agreements were not 
signed, among them a transborder agreement. 
  [Drzycimski] It is a fact that there was a readiness on our 
part to sign the two agreements, but the Slovaks were not 
technically prepared to do so. From what President Kovac told 
us during the bilateral talks, they have 14 more agreements 
ready in their initial form, so it could be expected that during 
both the ministers' and the prime ministers' mutual 
visits--which, as announced, will take place in the immediate 
future--these agreements shall be signed. 
  But you know, you really must take a different kind of 
approach to this. Presidential visits do not necessarily always 
result in the signing of treaties, agreements, pacts, and so 
forth. The nature of such visits is completely different. 
These visits, I would say [hesitating], they open 
up....[Drzycimski changes thought] They raise the standards, 
they create opportunities, both for prime ministers and for 
ministers, but one should perhaps emphasize even more strongly 
that these visits also create opportunities for people who 
manage institutions, workplaces, for local governors on both 
sides of the border--these are the opportunities for them to 
kind of follow the [high-ranking officials'] lead. It is that 
aspect which will determine whether or not these meetings made 
sense. 
  The presidents of both countries--that is to say, Lech 
Walesa 
and Michal Kovac--discussed very significant political issues, 
which are important not only for the countries of the Visegrad 
Group but also for the countries of Central and East Europe as 
well. To us, Partnership for Peace, which has been accepted by 
all the countries of the Visegrad Group, is a path of some kind, 
that is to say, it may be such a path, but it may also be kind 
of a concealed attempt to rebuild a sphere of influence--the 
sphere from which we fled. In that regard, President Kovac, for 
instance, also focused our attention on the fact that our 
military cooperation is just excellent--both immediately across 
the border, and globally, between our two countries. 
  [Swiac] The issue of Partnership for Peace has a direct 
impact on issues linked with the Polish Army. We will see some 
changes in the Army. Those who are critical of these planned 
changes--the Sejm National Defense Commission among others--are 
charging [hesitating] that the changes will lead to a kind of 
elimination of the civilian part from the Army. 
  [Drzycimski] That is not possible for a very simple reason: 
If we intend to join NATO, then one of the preconditions.... 
  [Swiac, interrupting] Exactly. 
  [Drzycimski] One of the preconditions is civilian 
supervision over the Army. But there is a general trend to 
retain civilian supervision in a determinant manner. In that 
area, there is no willingness to eliminate civilian supervision 
over the Army, neither on the president's part, nor, I think, on 
the part of the [Defense] Ministry. The reason is that if we 
were to do that, we would kind of contradict everything we have 
done so far. This entire change is not just for its own sake; 
it must at the same time have some safety valves which will 
guarantee that the Army is efficient and able to conduct a full 
mobilization if there is such a need. It is not the case that 
we live in an isolated world. There are different situations 
occurring around our country, in particular on the Eastern side. 
It is not the case that we are afraid of war. We do not expect 
a war to come from the outside, but what we want is that our 
country's territory is such that we have guarantees of its 
security and sovereignty.

of Minister's Economic Committee Approved"] 
  [Text] The Council of Minister's Economic Committee 
yesterday approved the draft of a law concerning a new mechanism 
for controlling salaries which, effective 1 April, is to replace 
a tax on excessive wage increases [popiwek]. 
  Enterprises would have to choose one of the four following 
methods to determine salary levels: 
  --An agreement with the local Chamber of the Treasury [Izba 
Skarbowa]. 
  --An agreement signed between the enterprise's establishing 
agency and the manager--so-called managerial contract. 
  --Independent shaping of salary levels by the enterprise 
itself, on the condition that the ratio of aggregate profit and 
salary to one zloty of salary, as compared to the same kind of 
ratio last year, will not deteriorate. 
  --Establishing salary levels based on a government-fixed 
index of growth of the average monthly salary (the basis would 
be provided by the average monthly salary from the second half 
of 1993, or from all of 1993). 
  Enterprises would be forced to pay two zlotys on every zloty 
over established limits. Trade union activists received the 
draft this week. They now have a maximum of 30 days in which to 
conduct negotiations.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Successful Despite Misunderstandings; Press </F>
Section of the Presidential Office on Slovak President's Visit 
to Poland"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Press Section of the Presidential 
Office of the Slovak Republic has been authorized to announce: 
  The official visit by the president of the Slovak Republic 
to 
the Republic of Poland was prepared in the same manner as all 
previous trips abroad by the head of state. According to the 
words of Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik, "the 
president's visit to Poland has been prepared for quite some 
time and was preceded by extensive diplomatic activity." The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed which treaties ought to be 
signed during the visit, and the composition of the delegation 
was determined accordingly. A discussion on the specific agenda 
of the visit took place also during the president's bilateral 
talks with the president of the Republic of Poland in Prague, on 
the occasion of the meeting of representatives of the Visegrad 
Four countries with President Clinton. The talks between the 
presidents of Poland and Slovakia were attended also by 
ministers Jozef Moravcik and Jan Ducky. In the course of these 
talks, they arrived at the opinion that steps must be taken to 
increase economic cooperation between the two countries. For 
these reasons, Minister of the Economy Jan Ducky and other 
representatives of our economic life were to be members of the 
official delegation. It is therefore incomprehensible that the 
prime minister learned about the Slovak president's planned 
official visit to Poland only on 19 January 1993, as he declared 
at the 26th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. 
  In spite of instances of misunderstanding between 
constitutional bodies, which have also been reported in the 
press, we are able to state that the Slovak president's official 
visit to the Republic of Poland was successful and represents a 
major contribution to the development of Polish-Slovak 
relations. On the other hand, the questioning of the activity 
of any central state body and its representatives is damaging to 
the interests and the good name of the Slovak Republic abroad.

Democrats of the Slovak Republic and former foreign minister, by 
Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "What Was Lexa 
Doing in Yugoslavia?"] 
  [Text] [Pankovcinova] What information do you have about 
the purpose of Ivan Lexa's visit to the former Yugoslavia in the 
fall of 1992? 
  [Knazko] I found out after the fact that Mr. Lexa had gone 
to Yugoslavia with the blessing of the prime minister. I never 
found out anything about the purpose of this visit and no report 
was ever written about it. Thus, the government resolution 
according to which every government member--anyone who was in 
any way involved in Slovak foreign policy--is obliged within 14 
days of returning from a visit to submit a report on it was 
infringed. 
  [Pankovcinova] However, Mr. Lexa was not a government 
member, neither a minister nor a state secretary, at that time. 
Did this resolution apply to him? 
  [Knazko] He was head of the Slovak Government Office at that 
time and this resolution applied to him if he went there with 
the blessing of the prime minister. Without his blessing, of 
course, he could not have gone there. 
  [Pankovcinova] Why did you not say anything about this 
before? 
  [Knazko] I did. I wrote a letter to the prime minister, but 
I did not receive a reply. This was not the only instance. 
Later, I also informed the press about visits that were not 
discussed in advance with the Foreign Ministry--for example, 
when the prime minister was in Germany or Austria without the 
knowledge of the deputy prime minister and foreign minister. We 
never received a report at the Foreign Ministry on these visits 
by the prime minister. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 January on page 
2, under the headline "A Question for Ivan Lexa," carries the 
following 100-word "(SD)"-signed question and Lexa's response: 
  "In a speech delivered to the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic, M. Knazko indirectly described you as the person the 
prime minister sent to the former Yugoslavia in the fall of 1992 
without the knowledge of the Foreign Ministry. Do you have 
anything to say to this? 
  "Lexa: No comment."]

yesterday evening and told him that, after "reevaluating the

my criminal activity" and that the legal proceedings being taken 
against me in accordance with Paragraph 103 of the Criminal Law 
are continuing, I do not understand the current course of 
action, said Lexa. At the same time, he described this

the law enforcement agencies a month ago.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Podstupka: "Second Wave in Fall; News </F>
Conference at the Ministry of Privatization"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Ministry for the Administration and 
Privatization of National Property [MSPNM] called a news 
conference yesterday, the first after three months, at which 
State Secretary Ivan Lexa provided information on key aspects of 
the privatization process. 
  The first wave of privatization ended last October. The 
privatization objectives of the first wave were fulfilled, with 
the exception of 30 enterprises. Ivan Lexa contested views to 
the effect that privatization has slowed down and those 
expressing doubts about its transparency. He said that, since 
15 July 1993, when the ministry started working in its new 
composition, the process of privatization has accelerated six 
times. A total of 100 privatization projects have been approved 
since then, 35 of which were direct sales. Another 70 
privatization projects are waiting for the National Property 
Fund [FNM] to invite or evaluate a public tender. The state 
secretary pointed out that neither the government nor the MSPNM 
can accelerate the process, which is in the hands of the FNM. 
The MSPNM was dissatisfied with cooperation with the FNM 
Executive Committee, and changes in the FNM bodies have 
established prerequisites for the situation to improve. Some 
new methods should make privatization more transparent. Prices 
will be set according to a new expert's standard and will be 
monitored by the Supreme Inspection Office. Financial Police 
will check potential buyers of property, how they meet their tax 
obligations, the purity of their previous operations, etc. The 
ministry also calls on the trade unions to send to it signals 
regarding the professional qualities and irreproachability of 
current managers who want to privatize their company. 
  According to Ivan Lexa, the personnel ties between the MSPNM 
and the FNM as contained in the government bill on privatization 
are warranted. The MSPNM is preparing another important 
bill--on holdings. The bill's key issue is the legal 
codification of taxation, as the double taxation of proceeds 
from shares must be prevented. 
  Speaking about employee-held shares, Ivan Lexa said that, in 
its policy statement, the government pledged to support 
employees' wider participation in privatization. He cited Sigma 
Zavadka, Topvar Topolcany, and JAS Bardejov as successful 
examples of companies privatized by their employees. In the 
Tlaciarne Bratislava [Bratislava Printing Works], the initiative 
was seized by middle-level managers, who already own 51 percent 
of shares. He also said that the method of allocating a part of 
the shares for the management and another part for employees had 
good prospects. 
  Asked by PRAVDA about the form and the date of the second 
privatization wave, Ivan Lexa said that registration [of coupon 
books] is planned for the last quarter of 1994. It is necessary 
to beware of the all-or-nothing approach [mantinelizmus], to 
which led the endeavor to comply at any price with the federal 
deadlines for the first privatization wave. The method of 
privatizing individual enterprises will be assessed more 
thoroughly [than in the first wave]. A specific owner will be 
sought first, and only then [when a specific buyer is not found] 
will the coupon method be used. Property worth 50-70 billion 
korunas [Sk] will be privatized in the second wave of coupon 
privatization. The MSPNM is to submit its material on the 
second wave to the government by the end of February 1994. 
  A concept is being prepared on how to privatize the Sk47.7 
billion worth of securities still held by the FNM. The state's 
permanent participation [in companies, in which the FNM holds a 
stake] will be reassessed and limited as much as possible. 
FNM-held shares will be sold either directly or by means of 
public tender, and smaller remainders will be offered for sale 
on the stock exchange or on the RM-System market. However, the 
state secretary pointed to the risk of disturbance in the market 
if too many securities were to be sold at once.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Deputies Did Not Approve Amendment on </F>
Signposts; Meeting of Parliament Will Continue Next Week"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--The 26th meeting of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] continued yesterday with 
the discussion of amendments to the law on the official language 
and the law on the territorial and administrative division of 
the Slovak Republic, which are known as the Law on Signposts. 
Although a government-sponsored bill on orders, a document on 
European coproduction in film-making, and an amendment to the 
law on financing political parties and movements from the state 
budget were also on the agenda, most of the day was taken up by 
the debate on the Law on Signposts. In spite of that, the law 
did not pass. The bill on orders met, for the time being, with 
the same fate. 
  In the debate on the legislative norm on signposts, Deputy 
Jan Pivoluska, Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], 
proposed that an ethnic minority's minimum representation in a 
community required for the installation of signposts in the 
minority's language be raised from 20 percent [as recommended in 
the government bill] to 50 percent. Erno Rozsa, Coexistence, on 
the other hand, proposed that 10 percent of ethnic minority 
members in a community should be sufficient for the community to 
be designated also in their language. 
  Miroslav Gandi, HZDS, ended his contribution with an appeal 
for the unification of deputies representing Slovak political 
parties against the demands of the Hungarian coalition. 
Ladislav Pittner, Christian Democratic Movement, stressed in 
the debate that one cannot fight irridentism by suppressing the 
rights of ethnic minorities and that ethnic minorities must be 
accommodated in line with European conventions. Igor Gazdik 
endorsed the Hungarian coalition's proposal on behalf of the 
Club of Independent Deputies. 
  Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, communications, 
and public works, discussed linguistic aspects and how the names 
of communities came about. 
<H5>  Deputies Rejected Everything </H5>
  Most changes proposed in the [parliamentary committees' 
rapporteurs'] joint report and during the debate by individual 
deputies did not pass. The deputies also turned down the 
comprehensive proposal tabled by the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement-Coexistence coalition, changing substantial 
portions of the law. Of the 134 parliamentarians present, 52 
voted for the proposal of the Hungarian coalition, 65 against, 
and 17 abstained. The proposal that communities should be able 
to have names in the language of ethnic minorities on the basis 
of a decision by the local council, or on the basis of a local 
referendum, did not pass, either; it was short of three votes. 
During the final vote on the amendments, 132 deputies reported 
their presence. The law was not approved because only 64 
deputies voted in its favor, while 35 voted against and 33 
abstained. [passage omitted] 
  The 26th NRSR meeting will continue next Wednesday [2 
February].

by the Horne Srnie local council at its meeting the day before 
yesterday. In a statement addressed to Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, the Horne Srnie deputies demand that the present border 
between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic [CR], which 
is formed here by the Vlarka Creek, be retained. They appeal to 
National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies to endorse 
their demand that the present border remain unchanged.

<F P=106> [Article by "r": "Slovak PEN Center Protests Against </F>
Restriction of Media Freedom"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--At its meeting on 18 January 1994, the 
Slovak PEN [International Association of Poets, Playwrights, 
Editors, Essayists, and Novelists] Center Committee adopted a 
statement, which says, among other things: 
  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar speaks about a list of 40 
journalists who supposedly receive their pay from abroad in 
dollars and asserts that, after verifying the list's 
authenticity, he will make it public. 
  The Constitution of the Slovak Republic guarantees every 
citizen's right to freely disseminate information and there is 
no law banning the acceptance of honorariums from abroad. This 
does not even run counter to ethics. What we consider immoral 
is, quite the contrary, the evocation of stereotypes of 
totalitarian thinking by which dollars were synonymous with 
dirty money. The publication of such a list, but even the very 
mention of it by the prime minister, is an evident attempt to 
use xenophobic sentiments in society against independent media, 
an attempt that is, in the final analysis, directed against 
democracy. We protest, furthermore, against the prosecuting 
bodies' efforts to introduce into practice Article 103 of the 
Penal Code [regarding defamation of the head of state]. This 
precedent of a political problem being carried to the level of 
criminal law is a dangerous signal of future abuse of Articles 
102 and 103 of the Penal Code against truly independent critics 
of power. The Slovak PEN Center deeply regrets that two of its 
members signed the Proclamation of 50 Slovak Intellectuals to 
the Intellectuals of Europe [reference to a statement adopted in 
Bratislava on 6 January 1994, in which 50 Slovak intellectuals 
blame Hungarian policies and ethnic Hungarians' "irredentism" 
for tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations].

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Yesterday in the Government" </F>
column: "The Czechs Decided Without Us"] 
  [Excerpts] Reports keep appearing in the Czech and also in 
some Slovak media that the division of federal property could 
have been elegantly wound up if only the Slovak side had not 
made absurd demands, which the Czech side will never accept. 
There is talk about [Slovak demands for] compensation for the 
federal flag and for the Slovak territory ceded to Poland in 
1920, and the like. What is the reality? A report on the 
present state of work on the division of the property of the 
former CSFR between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic 
was on the agenda of yesterday's meeting of the government. 
[passage omitted] 
  Of the 12 partial agreements pertaining to the division of 
federal property, eight have been signed so far. Four 
agreements, which are in the works, are still to be signed. 
These are: an agreement on the property settlement of the 
consequences of the division of the former Czechoslovak State 
Bank [SBCS] balance between the Czech National Bank and the 
Slovak National Bank; a treaty between the Czech Republic 
Government and the Slovak Republic Government on the sale of 
gold; an agreement on the division of the deficit of the federal 
budget for 1992 between the state budgets of the Czech Republic 
and the Slovak Republic and on the settlement of financial 
relations of organizations for 1992 with the state budgets of 
the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic; and the agreement on 
the aggregate mutual financial settlement of the results of the 
division of the former CSFR's property between the Czech 
Republic and the Slovak Republic approved by the [Czech-Slovak] 
"Commission" [for the division of federal property]. 
  The key problem is the division of the former SBCS's 
balance. 
No progress on this issue has been made, however. 
  The agreement on aggregate settlement is actually the final 
agreement, and its signing depends on the solution of the other 
partial disputed issues--gold, archives, Czechoslovak Airlines, 
the maritime fleet, buildings, and so forth. 
  Other outstanding issues pertaining to property division 
that 
are dealt with by the staff of the relevant ministries, the 
solution of which is monitored by the "Commission," are: the 
CSFR's share in the property of the former CEMA, the 
Czechoslovak Maritime Fleet, the division of archives (Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, Ministry of Interior 
of the Slovak Republic, Ministry of Defense of the Slovak 
Republic, Office for Industrial Ownership, Supreme Court), and 
the property of the former Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Moderate Growth of Prices; Lasting </F>
Decline of Production"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--The price growth slowed in the last 
three months of 1993, Rudolf Krc, chairman of the Slovak 
Statistical Office, told a news conference yesterday. Whereas 
in October prices rose 1.4 percent [compared with the preceding 
month], in November they rose 1 percent and in December 0.6 
percent. [passage omitted] 
  Goods worth 314.4 billion korunas [Sk] were produced in 
industry in the first 11 months of the year, 13.9 percent less 
than in the same period the year before. The volume of building 
work reached the value of Sk39 billion, which was 23.4 percent 
less than in the first 11 months of 1992. 
  The Slovak Statistical Office has also released some data 
for 
December 1993. In livestock production, the numbers of cattle, 
pigs, and poultry continued to decline. Milk production reached 
1.2144 billion liters, 8.7 less than in December 1992, while the 
production of eggs declined more than 11 percent. 
  Average industrial monthly wages in enterprises with 25 and 
more employees reached Sk6,942 in November, which was Sk1,034 
(17.5 percent) more than in the same month the year before. 
Average monthly wages in construction stood at Sk6,573, in 
transportation at Sk6,206, and in retailing at Sk5,126. A 
month-to-month comparison shows a slight increase in the 
productivity of labor. A total of 368,095 job applicants were 
registered with labor offices at the end of the year. The 
number of unemployed increased 0.4 percent in the course of 
December (to 14.4 percent). An annual comparison shows an 
increase in employment by 4 percent.

  [Text] Bratislava--According to an analysis by the Slovak 
Statistical Office, consumer prices rose by 0.6 percent in 
December. Over the 12 months of 1993, however, in comparison 
with December of 1992, the prices grew by 16.7 percent, and in 
comparison with all of 1992 by 23.2 percent. Inflation 
increased in December last year by 0.6 percent in comparison 
with November and by 23.2 percent in comparison with the average 
of 1992. The increase in the price of eggs and egg products 
(4.1 percent) is most responsible for the overall increase in 
the price of food products (0.3 percent). In the nonfood group, 
prices rose by 0.2 percent in most of the categories surveyed, 
and by 0.5 percent in transportation and sporting accessories.

  [Text] Last year, the Slovak Republic exported arms and 
ammunition worth approximately $45 million. This was 
communicated to NOVY CAS daily by Karol Dropa, deputy head of 
department of special production at the Slovak Ministry of 
Economy. The essence of this export, in his view, was only one 
contract--namely, the export of tanks to Syria. 
  For the sake of comparison, the daily says that last year 
the 
Czech Republic exported military equipment and materials worth 
approximately $167 million, which is $17 million more than 
similar exports in 1992 by the former federation.

  [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 31 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia is 
considering a normalisation of the relations with the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), Slovenian Foreign Minister 
Lojze Peterle said on Monday [31 January]. At a press 
conference in Ljubljana Peterle underscored Slovenia's official 
stand that the normalisation of the relations with the F.R.Y. 
was of interest for this former member of the Yugoslav 
Federation, especially after the increasingly successful 
contacts between Belgrade and Zagreb. The Slovenian Foreign 
Ministry has been actively monitoring all recent changes in the 
Ljubljana-Belgrade relations, said Peterle but did not elaborate. 
  Slovenia's Foreign Ministry is studying what should be done 
for the setting up of the contacts between Ljubljana and 
Belgrade, said the minister and added that proposals would be 
submitted to the Slovenian Government in order to examine them 
at one of its next sessions. The F.R.Y. recognized Slovenia in 
late summer of 1992, as part of the preparations for the London 
Conference on resolving the Yugoslav crisis. At that time, 
Slovenia did not show any interest in the normalisation of the 
relations with the F.R.Y.

  [Excerpt] The Chamber of Counties of the Croatian Assembly 
today adopted a statement on the implementation of foreign 
policy, expressing its support for a joint declaration of the 
Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Here is a report by Jasenka Dudic and Kreso Zadravec on the 
statement and the course of the session, which was addressed by 
Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of 
foreign affairs: 
  [Dudic] The Geneva declaration is in accordance with 
fundamental efforts of the international community and the EU 
action plan, is in line with the essence of President Tudjman's 
peace initiative, and is a concrete step in its implementation. 
This is what the Chamber of Counties says, among other things, 
in its statement. In the statement, the declaration was 
assessed as a step toward mutual recognition of the two 
sovereign states, a decisive act for the permanent resolution of 
the crisis, and a path leading toward a political solution for 
the temporarily occupied parts of Croatian territories. This is 
leading toward the final and unconditional incorporation of UN 
Protected Areas into the Republic of Croatia. 
  The declaration will not only contribute to the 
normalization 
of the situation and to relations between the countries that are 
signatories to it, but also to the beginning of general 
normalization, which is a precondition for the establishment of 
the new world order and the promotion of stability and security 
in the whole of the southeastern part of Europe. An important 
initial step on that path is the open recognition of all states 
within their legitimate international borders in accordance with 
the UN Charter and basic CSCE documents. 
  In the statement, the Chamber of Counties calls on the 
Bosnian Muslims unconditionally and immediately to halt their 
offensive actions against Croat-populated areas, particularly in 
central Bosnia. Otherwise, the Chamber holds that the 
government and the president of the Republic ought to analyze 
and reexamine the current situation in diplomatic relations 
between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and, in 
accordance with the assessment of this situation, take 
appropriate steps. 
  Alongside the condemnation of all misdeeds, crimes, and acts 
in contravention of the law on international war and the 
humanitarian law, in its statement the Chamber of Counties 
encourages the Croatian Government to do everything in 
diplomatic, political, humanitarian, and all other areas to 
secure the continuous presence and the normal life of the Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The statement was adopted with 38 votes against. A separate 
statement was adopted by the club of deputies of the Croatian 
Social and Liberal Party [HSLS], Croatian Peasants' Party, 
Istrian Democratic Alliance, Social-Democratic Party, and 
Croatian People's Party. 
  I am sorry that, despite all our efforts, we did not succeed 
in formulating a joint statement that would be acceptable to the 
deputies' club of the HSLS, Granic said in his address to the 
deputies. He explained the important objectives of Croatian 
foreign policy. 
  These are, first of all, to reintegrate the occupied 
territories into the state system of the Republic of Croatia, to 
resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way that the 
survival and equality of Croats is guaranteed, to have 
good-neighborly relations with all states, and to integrate 
Croatia into European and world processes. 
  Granic stressed that the current situation in the occupied 
territories is untenable, since the Serbs have completed ethnic 
cleansing and do not respect the human rights of Croats; 
however, opting to liberate the occupied territories militarily 
would cause great casualties and, probably, the international 
isolation of Croatia. This is why Croatia opted for the 
strategy of negotiation, in order to first establish 
communication and to resolve humanitarian and other questions, 
which should eventually bring about a peaceful reintegration of 
the temporarily occupied territories into the Croatian state 
system, Granic said. He added: 
  [Begin Granic recording] This path, which includes primarily 
peacemaking and a peaceful option, does not -- at the end of the 
day -- exclude any methods of achieving the final goal: the 
goal of a completely free Republic of Croatia. We shall try to 
do our utmost, however, to exhaust the peaceful option and to 
get the international community's support for it. 
  As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, this means that lasting 
relations between Croats and Muslims should be established, that 
all confrontation should stop immediately, and that the 
Bosnian-Muslim state should develop as a secular state, 
acceptable to Europe, to its entire environment. Croats should 
also stay in their areas, with their safety and development 
guaranteed. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vukovar, 31 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, said this 
evening in Vukovar in the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] that 
"the West -- because of applying double standards -- is most to 
blame for the war in the former Yugoslavia." On the one hand 
the republics which succeeded from the former Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia were recognized, and on the other, the 
Serbs were not granted the right to self-determination, the 
leader of the largest opposition party in Russia said at a rally 
in the center of Vukovar. 
  "The West must be punished for this and Russia will do its 
utmost to have the war criminals punished," Zhirinovskiy said at 
a news conference held in the partially rebuilt Danube Hotel 
after the rally. Amid an ovation from several thousand people 
of Vukovar, the guest of the Serb Democratic Party of all 
Serbian lands promised that "the great Russia will be the 
protector of all Serbs" and spoke about the "creation of a joint 
Slav state from Vladivostok to Knin." 
  "The era is behind us, once and for all, when the Serbian 
people, who heroically fought for their own survival and the 
survival of all [eastern] Orthodox peoples, were punished. If a 
single bomb falls on a Serb town, that will mean a declaration 
of war on Russia and that will be the time when we will have all 
debts paid to us," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  The leader of the party which won the largest number of 
votes 
at the elections in Russia on 12 December said that a Russian 
battalion is already fighting in the RSK and that, "if need be, 
whole divisions and even a whole army will come." He wished the 
Serbs the strength to persist in their just struggle for their 
homes where they have lived for centuries. 
  In reply to a reporter's question, Zhirinovskiy said that 
his 
party stands for Russia with the borders of the former USSR, but 
only by peaceful means. He recalled that Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
and some other former USSR republics have already expressed a 
desire to return to the joint state, primarily for economic 
reasons. 
  The citizens of Vukovar were also addressed by RSK President 
Milan Martic, who said that the Serbian people "got only 
disappointment from Russia, while waiting for the great Orthodox 
spirit to reawaken." 
  "And it is being reawoken in the person of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, who is a guarantor for us that in the future we 
will have a great protector in the world", Martic said, and 
added that "Vukovar and the RSK will never be Croatian again."

  [Text] [Correspondent] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's visit to 
Vukovar and the occupied areas of the Vukovar and Srijem county, 
i.e. Sector East where a Russian UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
battalion is deployed, was a point on the agenda of a Vukovar 
and Srijem Assembly session today, from which a protest note was 
sent to the Russian embassy saying among other things: 
  [Begin recording] [Matej Jankovic, prefect of the Vukovar 
and 
Srijem County] Therefore, I consider it your duty to dissociate 
yourself from the visit and activities of your parliamentarians, 
while UNPROFOR in which your soldiers are also deployed, has a 
duty to prevent Zhirinovskiy from entering an area within the 
internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Croatia 
without permission by relevant bodies of our state. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] It should be noted that the Croatian side 
has 
never opposed any visits either to Sector East or the UNPROFOR 
forces that was regularly announced or organized in cooperation 
with relevant Croatian bodies.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "Lost Sheep"] </F>
  [Text] Although nonbinding, the resolution of the U.S. 
Senate demanding the lifting of the arms embargo against the 
Bosnian Muslims is more than telling. First of all it reveals 
the prevalent way of thinking in this leading U.S. institution 
regarding the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The 
U.S. Senate obviously believes that a political solution is 
impossible, and so the military solution imposes itself. 
Additionally, this resolution confirms that -- out of narrow 
internal interests -- the United States wants to radicalize its 
behavior in order to appease its allies in the Islamic and Arab 
world. 
  Both these facts, however, show that there is a large rift 
in 
interests and intentions between Europe and the United States 
when it comes to solving the crisis on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia. While the European Union, divided over the 
national interests of France, Great Britain, and Germany -- and 
in the shadow of Russian diplomatic moves -- is trying in vain 
to find a common denominator for its policy, the United States 
is trying to move things with loud threats of air strikes and 
now of lifting the arms embargo against Alija Izetbegovic's 
army. However, it is hard to believe that the real way will be 
found with such diversified interests. The European West and 
the United States still resemble lost sheep far more than a 
respectable political force. 
  Although one should not, in principle, draw parallels with 
the past for day to day political events, one should 
nevertheless say that the U.S. Senate did not pass such a 
resolution, or indeed any resolution, binding or otherwise, when 
Croatia was the victim of the Serbian aggression. Besides, the 
arms that Alija Izetbegovic would get with the lifting of the 
embargo would, at least initially, be used exclusively against 
the Croats in central Bosnia and the Neretva River valley. That 
is why Croatia cannot remain calm and unconcerned in the face of 
the latest resolution of the U.S. Senate.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina and Petr Novacek: "Havel's </F>
First Year in Office: A Political Figure in Reserve"] 
  [Text] A bomb alert, a skirmish between the Republican 
leader and reporters in a toilet, and assaults by extreme 
right-wing deputies addressed to Vaclav Havel over the 
microphone--this was the atmosphere in which the first Czech 
president was elected by a close majority in the Chamber of 
Deputies. Commentaries appeared immediately saying that Havel 
would become a lonely figure without political weight. However, 
the fact that he has been elected president is evidence that he 
is not politically negligible at all. 
  Several days before the presidential elections, various 
representatives from Klaus's party had indicated that they could 
accept the idea that one of the most popular Civic Democratic 
Party politicians--Jan Strasky--would assume office at the 
Castle. The former federal prime minister, for whom the 
opposition would vote just to make Havel angry, was not 
completely without chances. Moreover, this enlightened and 
educated technocrat is a much more typical representative of 
Czech society than an exceptional dissident, creating in the 
world a rather distorted picture about ourselves. However, one 
of the Civic Democratic Party's highest officials admitted that 
the party executive committee had arrived quickly at the 
conclusion that Havel, as a living legend, is "less dangerous as 
president than as nonpresident." 
<H5>  Havel and the Foreign Minister </H5>
  The first conflict between the Castle and the Foreign 
Ministry broke loose only two days after Havel's election. The 
president said that the "Czech Republic should support the idea 
of an international military intervention in Bosnia." Then he 
added that the country's binding standpoint would be discussed 
at his meeting with the foreign minister. Josef Zieleniec, 
bringing the text of the Constitution with him, visited the 
Castle. He drew the president's attention to the fact that the 
president may represent the Republic, but the Republic's foreign 
policy is formulated by the government. 
  Nevertheless, in April, during Vaclav Havel's visit to Bill 
Clinton in Washington, he said: "One possibility of achieving 
peace in Bosnia is to make air strikes on Serbian positions." 
Three days later, Vaclav Klaus reacted: "To recommend someone 
to intervene, and to stay aside, seems very difficult to me." 
This was an exchange of opinions that has become a framework 
for political duels regarding foreign policy: The president's 
generally correct moral standpoints versus the realism of the 
government policy based on the world's complicated relations in 
which the Czech Republic's voice is only one of many. 
  At that time, Vaclav Havel and Josef Zieleniec used to dine 
together almost once a week. The minister very decently 
explained the Cerninsky Palace's diplomatic intentions to the 
president. At the same time, he strictly insisted that, unlike 
in Dienstbier's time, each of them will be active in a clearly 
delimited space. 
  On the other hand, the newly elected leaders, too, began to 
understand, on their foreign visits, that the president's fame 
abroad is no fiction. One of our diplomats admits that "the 
same way Milan Kundera writes for the British or the French, 
President Havel delivers speeches abroad that the foreign 
officials want to hear. As the wise ruler in The Little 
Prince, he invites someone to do what he wants to do 
anyway. When he does it, it even strengthens Havel's authority." 
  Owing to the mediating role of Alexander Vondra, Zieleniec's 
first deputy and Havel's former adviser, relations between the 
Cerninsky Palace and the Castle have gradually improved. 
Clinton's visit to Prague was already under the influence of 
Cerninsky Palace's skillful maneuvers and Vaclav Havel's 
personal diplomacy. After Josef Zieleniec allowed Budapest to 
become Warren Christopher's host city last year, Havel, by a 
suggestive letter, could invite the U.S. president to Prague. 
He, as well as his predecessor Bush, has understood that it is 
advisable to appear, from time to time, on the television screen 
with Havel, the philosopher and intellectual. 
  According to eyewitnesses, the president, the prime 
minister, 
and the foreign minister acted unanimously during Clinton's 
visit. Impressed by this cooperation, one of Havel's advisers 
said: "Clinton would not arrive if Havel were not the president, 
but he would equally not arrive if our economic transformation 
were on the Romanian level." 
<H5>  Havel and the Prime Minister </H5>
  Since his arrival at Prague Castle, Vaclav Havel has become 
a 
close collaborator with Vaclav Klaus. Someone has said that, 
particularly in the first six months of his rule, the president 
seemed to be fascinated by the prime minister's exceptionality. 
This, however, is a problem that Klaus's partners must sort out. 
"The most difficult thing is to survive the first three years 
with Klaus, then everything becomes O.K.," one of the prime 
minister's friends says. 
  Between the prime minister and the president, there are few 
disputes about the concepts. However, they sort of kick one 
another's ankle, in the name of political prestige. Of course, 
in this sort of duel, Klaus is more inclined to attack. This is 
a result of the prime minister's aggressiveness and also of his 
political instinct for self-preservation. Unlike the president, 
who has been elected by parliament for five years, party leader 
Klaus must everyday collect points for himself and for his party 
for the coming communal election and for the parliamentary 
elections later on. 
  Vaclav Klaus has not missed any opportunity to let the 
public know who is the number-one man in our politics. 
Permanent pressure on the president has occasionally assumed an 
impolite form toward the head of state. For example, some 
ministers recall that the prime minister let Vaclav Havel wait 
in the antechamber for several minutes when the president came 
to a government meeting. 
  Maybe Havel, who is always polite, realized later that he 
should have left immediately. Apparently, one year is too short 
a time for Havel to get accustomed to the rules of the power 
struggle that belongs to the party-oriented policy in stable 
democracies. Whoever can prove that he is able to exert vehement 
pressure on his milieu and to react promptly to the attacks of 
his partners wins. 
  The fact that Vaclav Havel has avoided direct confrontation 
with the prime minister has thus provoked the most embarrassing 
episode of the year: The disrespectful dispute after the visit 
by Salman Rushdie, whose visit was quite desirable otherwise. 
Irrespective of the fact that this was a private visit on the 
incentive of the International Helsinki Committee, the president 
knew about it and should have discussed it with the prime 
minister. Today it is a known fact that the top echelons of the 
Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry knew about the visit 
two weeks in advance but did not report it to Klaus. 
  When there was a verbal dispute between the president and 
the 
prime minister, in which both issued politically improper 
statements, no one was willing to admit a mistake. It is quite 
symptomatic that, after a three-hour debate behind the Castle's 
closed door, involving the president, the prime minister, the 
foreign minister, and the interior minister, Havel finally gave 
up. The result was a farce in the form of a communique that 
described the president's spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, as the 
culprit who committed the faux pas. 
  With the exception of Rushdie-type affairs, both political 
protagonists have kept their personal disputes under wraps. On 
the other hand, there is no reason for them to hide their 
disputes regarding their concepts and opinions originating from 
their different political beliefs. Who else than the president 
and the prime minister should set an example of how to conduct 
ethical discussions in which one participant tolerates the other? 
<H5>  Havel and Parliament </H5>
  In the era of his federal presidency, relations between 
Vaclav Havel and parliament represented a stumbling block. 
Today, however, the communication between the president and the 
Chamber of Deputies has lost the tension it previously had. 
This is also due to the fact that the Constitution allows the 
president to return bills to parliament but not to present them. 
Vaclav Havel used his right to veto the bills when he returned 
to the deputies the immoral bill on customs by which the 
legislative body granted unjustified advantages to deputies as 
regards customs control. 
  Otherwise, it seems that the president has gradually adopted 
one of the principal methods of practical policy, which he had 
demonstrably despised in relations with the Federal 
Assembly--that is, cultivating official contacts and also 
contacts behind the scenes, with the influential representatives 
of both the coalition and the nongovernment parties. His 
activity culminated by the end of last year when he met with all 
of the clubs of deputies within several hours, with the 
exception of Sladek supporters, debating the politically "hot" 
and topical subject of the reform of the state administration. 
  Otherwise, it seems that the president is seeking to 
establish contact with the chairmen of two coalition 
parties--Josef Lux and Jan Kalvoda, prominent Civic Democratic 
Party personalities in parliament--and also with several 
representatives of the opposition. It is impossible to question 
the fact that Havel, Kalvoda, and Lux have similar opinions, but 
it would be a simplification to say that an anti-Klaus coalition 
is being created here. "The president is only searching for 
possible allies, and he is also consulting other people, which 
he did not do before," one of the People Party's deputies says. 
<H5>  Havel and People </H5>
  One of the most sensitive problems, persisting from the time 
of Havel's federal presidency, is the problem of our "settling 
accounts with the past." There is no doubt about the fact that 
the president raised the hopes of the people when he said on 21 
August 1990 that we have to continue the revolution and to 
finally destroy the power of the communist mafias. However, 
Vaclav Havel has never specified how such a cleansing process 
should be performed. However, he strictly rejected any unlawful 
settling of accounts with the past, including the published list 
of the State Security collaborators. 
  Last spring, in an interview for the Polish paper GAZETA 
WYBORCZA, Havel said that the screening law and the illegally 
published list of agents in NECEZUROVANE NOVINY had caused human 
tragedies. "I know about people who committed suicide and about 
children who jumped out of the window when they learned that 
their father was on the list," the president said. Later on, 
when he was sued by Peter Cibulka, one of the NECENZUROVANE 
NOVINY editors and a Charter 77 signatory, the president spoke 
in front of the court about attempted suicides only. 
  It is possible to agree with those who say that the 
controversy between Havel and the vulgar Cibulka in the 
courtroom is a private affair between the two former dissidents. 
On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore that some people 
were maliciously happy to watch the conflict between former 
"prisoners of conscience." 
  Daniel Kroupa, Civic Democratic Party deputy chairman, is of 
the opinion that the president should abstain from 
disputes--disputes between parties, in particular. "Vaclav 
Havel should focus on great presidential topics," Daniel Kroupa 
says. "We should not moralize, but we should support values in 
politics." 
  It seems that Vaclav Havel began behaving in that manner by 
the end of his first year in office at the Castle, when he 
summarized in his New Year's speech his opinions about civic 
society and applied them to real political problems, 
particularly the territorial division. He presented 
controversial opinions that provoked the prime minister's 
reaction but caused only a mediocre discussion in the press. It 
will depend on the president himself whether he will be able to 
present more detailed plans, embellish them, and present them to 
the attentive part of the public in such a form as to make them 
the predominant topic the next year. 
<H5>  Havel in His Role </H5>
  The German paper GENERAL ANZEIGER has written about Vaclav 
Havel recently: "The president is on his way to becoming what 
he was when he was a dissident--a man striking his head against 
the wall, while being surrounded by a sea of indifference. The 
fact that mostly old wives and children are waving hands when 
the president is traveling within the Republic does not mean 
much. Other people have to make their living and do not have 
time to applaud wise speeches of statesmen. However, Havel has 
won 70 percent of the popular vote in public opinion polls, 
which suggests that people want to have someone in the Castle 
who is protecting the general principles of society. The 
president has certainly passed this test.

  [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus arrived from 
Davos to Ermantigen near Lake Constance today. Jiri Halousek 
reports: 
  [Halousek] Vaclav Klaus is staying today at Wolfsberg Castle 
near Ermantigen, at the invitation of the Union Bank of 
Switzerland. [passage omitted] 
  Klaus held a news conference for representatives of the 
Swiss 
communications media this afternoon. 
  The prime minister first pointed to the differences that 
exist between the Czech Republic and the majority of the other 
former communist countries. These differences exist in both the 
political structure and the economy. While, for example, in the 
majority of postcommunist states privatization of large 
enterprises is only beginning, it will be completed in our 
country this year. 
  Klaus went on to say that the fact that there is low 
unemployment in our country is the consequence of our having 
managed to secure the correct ratio between labor productivity 
and wages. In the West, on the contrary, this ratio is 
troublesome at the moment. The current 3.5 percent of 
unemployed will not be possible to maintain on a long-term 
basis, but unemployment will grow in a balanced way. Klaus 
expects the growth of unemployment this year to be 0.1 percent a 
month. Inflation should be under 10 percent. 
  The Czech prime minister then said he was convinced that 
what 
our government has done has general validity. Despite various 
national differences, other postcommunist countries must proceed 
basically in the same way if they want to succeed. 
  We do not need help from the West, only security guarantees, 
membership in international institutions, and open markets. We 
are interested in entry into the EC. However, as Klaus 
continued, on the other hand, we also have worries similar to 
Switzerland's. We do not like bureaucracy and state 
interventionism. About the Maastricht Treaty, Klaus said that 
we need common markets, not a political union. We are seeking 
our own identity, which we lost during the years of proletarian 
internationalism, and we fear that we might lose it again in a 
too-unified Europe. We want to get to Europe, but we do not 
want to dissolve in it as a lump of sugar in a cup of coffee, 
Klaus said literally. Large nations do not have these worries, 
but small countries such as the Czech Republic have them. 
  Klaus then went on to say that he was on the side of 
Slovakia 
in the conflict between Slovakia and Hungary. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "gag": "Rules for Arms Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--"At last we have clear rules of the game," 
J. Vlcek, director general of the RDP Group arms consortium, 
told us. He responded this way to the government draft law on 
trade in military material, which was discussed by the 
parliament committees yesterday. According to Vlcek, however, 
even this law will not be able to protect the Czech arms 
factories from being besmirched by foreign competitors, which 
have recently described Prague as a dealer in death. "The 
regular challenge to the trustworthiness of the Czech Republic 
in dealing with military material is partly caused by the effort 
on the part of the competition to suppress Czech arms exports. 
At times, however, it is also due to our inability to convince 
the world that our exports are controlled by clear laws," 
Bretislav Gregr, director of the license administration section 
at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said. According to him, 
the law defines limits for dealers in military material, which 
correspond to international standards. It even refers to state 
administration employees who have access to information on arms 
trade. After their departure from these bodies, for three years 
they are not permitted to work for firms involved in the 
production or sale of arms.

<F P=106> [Article by "km": "The State Wants Arms Exports To </F>
Occasionally Remain a Secret"] 
  [Text] Prague--Although Industry and Trade Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy stated recently that the military material trade 
policy of the Czech Republic is completely open, some arms 
contracts are still veiled in secrecy. 
  Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at 
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that there are 
exceptional instances of trade, about which it is not 
appropriate to inform. "They are concealed from a third 
country," he said. He refused to provide any more detail. 
  Bretislav Gregr stated that, last year, the Czech Republic 
exported arms to 52 countries of the world. The value of the 
exported military material is close to $167 million, which is 
$17 million more than in 1992. 
  The greatest interest abroad is in aviation technology, the 
main buyer of which is Egypt, and in handguns, which are 
exported mostly to Turkey. Although the largest shipments of 
military material go particularly to African and Arab countries 
and Southeast Asian states, the Czech Republic has most arms 
trade business partners in Europe. 
  Arms Imports remain low because the Defense and Interior 
Ministries do not have funds sufficient for armament. Last 
year, the Czech Republic imported arms and parts for military 
technology from a total of 12 countries of the world. There 
was, for instance, a shipment of special components for aviation 
technology from the Bahamas. 
  Last year, the Czech Republic did not export any heavy 
technology, like tanks, armored carriers, or artillery systems. 
Nor was a single Tamara radiolocator exported, which has a good 
name abroad. 
  On the other hand, Kuwait has bought a greater quantity of 
the universal plastic explosive Semtex, which is used there to 
eliminate the consequences of the Persian Gulf war. 
  Great Britain obtained a small quantity of Semtex, as did 
several other states that are testing Semtex features to be more 
successful in the struggle against terrorists who use this 
explosive.

  [Text] Prague--The promotion and advertising of arms, as 
well as their sales, can be conducted, according to the new law, 
only by licensed arms dealers. To date, any businessman with a 
general enterprise license could offer arms and military 
technology for sale. 
  Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at 
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that the tightening of 
the conditions was caused by instances that unnecessarily 
damaged the reputation of the Republic. He gave an example of a 
citizen who had nothing to do with arms dealing advertising the 
sale of handguns and submachine guns in a foreign journal. Some 
people even offered tanks and airplanes abroad. "We have begun 
to receive notes through diplomatic channels asking how it is 
possible that these individuals can offer arms without any 
restrictions," Gregr said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta and Jiri Bigas: "Iran Suspected </F>
Skodaexport Employee of Spying"] 
  [Text] The Iranian intelligence service suspected Ladislav 
Tyl, a Skodaexport representative detained in Iran last year 
under so-far-unexplained circumstances, of espionage. This was 
reported by a diplomatic source who does not wish to be 
identified in order to avoid difficulties in office. 
  However, Skodaexport Director General Jan Ricica rejects the 
espionage charge. "Espionage activity is completely 
unrealistic," he said. He emphasized that, following the 
intervention of the Czech ambassador to Tehran, Tyl was released 
with the explanation that the suspicions had not been confirmed. 
  Tyl was arrested shortly after the departure of the Skoda 
Plzen delegation that had visited Tehran to establish business 
contacts and also discussed the possibility of supplying Iran 
with modernized T-72 tanks. While some sources place Tyl's 
arrest precisely in the context of Skoda Plzen Director General 
Lubomir Soudek's business negotiations, Ricica said that such a 
connection seem unlikely to him. Nevertheless, Tyl participated 
in all Soudek's meetings in Tehran. 
  The Skodaexport director general also said that he could not 
think of any reason for detaining Tyl. "Because there was no 
indication of any links to the Skodaexport business activities 
in the course of the incident, we are certain it must have been 
a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity," he declared. 
  The Skoda Plzen business mission to Iran created suspicion 
among some intelligence services that Skoda is trying to acquire 
a share not only in supplies of conventional arms, but also of 
technology for the Iranian nuclear program. 
  Tyl was detained by Iranian security on 7 December of last 
year and released five days later. He had worked in Iran for 
almost four years. Following the incident, however, he returned 
home. The arrest cut his planned stay in Iran by approximately 
14 days. 
  In response to our question, the Iranian Foreign Ministry, 
through its Prague embassy, refused to comment on the 
circumstances of Tyl's arrest. 
  According to experts on this area, it cannot be ruled out 
that the Iranian security service was attempting to find out 
whether Tyl had any information about the Iranian nuclear 
program. 
  Ricica considers Tyl's arrest a thing of the past. He says 
he does not expect it to have an impact on future business 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by "(ZI)": "Unemployment in the Czech Republic"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The number of unplaced job-seekers registered at 
labor offices continued to rise in December last year. On 31 
December, 185,216 people were out of work, which is the highest 
number of unemployed since March 1992. Compared with the 
situation at the end of November, there were 9,500 (5.38 
percent) more unemployed, while, compared with the same period 
of 1992, there were 50,400 more unemployed. 
  Some 31,944 people came onto the labor offices' registers in 
December, which is 6,900 newly registered job seekers fewer that 
at the end of November. Only 22,500 job seekers came off the 
labor offices' registers; of these, 15,600 (69.3 percent) were 
placed in employment, 2,700 (12.0 percent) were struck off the 
register for not observing the conditions for cooperation with 
the labor offices, and the remaining 4,200 (18.7 percent) came 
off the register for other reasons. The number of labor offices 
that, during December, recorded a drop in the number of 
registered job seekers has declined. Only six labor offices 
(Prague-West, Ceske Budejovice, Usti nad Labem, Jablonec nad 
Nisou, Prague, and Beroun) recorded a drop in the number of job 
seekers between - 3.8 percent and - 0.1 percent. The 
month-to-month increase in unemployment in the other labor 
offices hovered between 0.05 percent in the Blansko District and 
17.2 percent in Cheb. 
  The number of people receiving benefits prior to entering 
into employment was 93,380 on 31 December 1993, which is 50.4 
percent of the overall number of unplaced job seekers. 
  The level of unemployment, calculated as a percentage of the 
number of registered job seekers in the overall available work 
force, was 3.52 percent on 31 December, which was the highest 
figure recorded in 1993. Compared with the same period last 
year, this is 0.95 percentage points more and, compared with 
September 1993, it is 0.35 percentage points more. Unemployment 
rose in all regions of the republic except Prague (stagnation). 
The highest level is still in North Moravia (6.16 percent), 
where, of the 10 districts, only Olomouc recorded an 
unemployment level under 5.0 percent. Only in Prague and the 
Cheb District was the level of unemployment under 1.0 percent in 
December (0.34 percent and 0.68 percent respectively). It was 
more than 5.0 percent in 22 districts and more than 7.0 percent 
in seven districts. The highest level of unemployment was in 
the Znojmo District (8.52 percent) and in Bruntal (8.7 percent). 
  The number of vacancies has continued to decline in contrast 
to the rising number of unplaced job seekers. On 31 December 
1993, there were 53,938 vacancies on offer at labor offices, 
which is 1,100 fewer than in November and 25,500 fewer than 
during the same period of 1992. The supply and demand situation 
for vacancies is different in individual regions of the Czech 
Republic. While in Prague at the end of December there were 
almost six vacancies per job seeker; in North Moravia, the 
demand for vacancies exceeded supply almost 12 times and in 
South Moravia 6.5 times. The average for the Czech Republic as 
a whole was 3.4 job seekers per vacancy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "ria": "Seventy Million for AIDS"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--According to Ondrej Trojan, M.D., from the 
National Commission for the Prevention of HIV/AIDS, the 70 
million korunas that the government provides for the prevention 
of AIDS would suffice if it did not have to be used for the 
drugs and equipment of the many facilities. The commission, in 
which AIDS experts from both government and nongovernment 
spheres are represented, recently decided on the following 
distribution of the money: 20 percent will go to prevention 
(education, behavior surveys, and so on), 26 percent to testing, 
and more than half for everything else, principally treatment 
and investment. This means that health insurance covers, for 
example, only the drugs for hospitalized patients and not for 
those whose disease has not yet developed and are being treated 
as outpatients. According to Trojan, who is also president of 
the nongovernment Association for the Struggle Against AIDS and 
for Sexual Education, the commission could not turn down the 
funds for this purpose because it would endanger human lives. 
"Let us call things by their names and not boast to the World 
Health Organization of 70 million spent on prevention, if, in 
fact, the money is only covering for the state or health 
insurance," Trojan says. Just for a comparison: Great Britain 
invests an annual 20 million pounds on prevention. 
  Nongovernment organizations receive approximately 7 percent 
of the 70 million. (The World Health Organization generally 
recommends, however, that at least 15 percent of the total be 
allocated to these organizations.) The AIDS Help Society wants, 
for instance, to establish a so-called lighthouse for those sick 
and dying of AIDS. According to Trojan, nongovernment 
organizations have to fight much harder for funds. The idea 
apparently still prevails that they are more likely to waste the 
funds at their disposal than government institutions.

  [Text] New York, Jan 31 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia maintains that the status of the republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) should be resolved in talks between Croatia and 
the RSK as the legitimate representative of the Serb people in 
U.N. protected zones, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic said in a letter to the U.N. Security Council. In the 
letter, Jovanovic informed the Security Council president that 
Yugoslavia and Croatia signed in Geneva on January 19 a joint 
declaration aimed at normalizing ties in line with the 
principles set out in the U.N. and CSCE charters. 
  Noting that the declaration does not imply mutual 
recognition 
of the two states, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this 
was, nevertheless, the ultimate goal. The document also does 
not prejudge a solution for the status of the RSK, he explained. 
  The right of peoples to self-determination is guaranteed in 
the Helsinki final act of 1975, and the Yugoslav Government does 
not question that fundamental right, said Jovanovic. 
  The RSK, created in late 1991 by Serbs within their ethnic 
and historic boundaries, was proclaimed a U.N. Protected 
Territory in early 1992 in a document which set out that this 
status should last until a political settlement acceptable to 
both sides had been found. The fact that the RSK is a 
U.N.-Protected Territory has not stopped Croatia, however, from 
trying to introduce its rule there by force.

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- Representatives of the 
Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Depos, and the Democratic Party 
(DS) have failed to reach an agreement on the election of the 
chairman of the Serbian parliament. Dragan Tomic (SPS), Vuk 
Draskovic (Depos) and Zoran Djindjic (DS) informed parliamentary 
deputies about this today and gave their explanations. Two new 
candidates have been proposed -- Dragan Tomic (SPS) and 
Jorgovanka Tabalovic (Serbian Radical Party). Neither of the 
initial candidates -- Zoran Arandjelovic (SPS) and Gvozden Rosic 
(Depos) -- received the necessary majority of votes.

  [Text] There is currently a break here [in the Serbian 
Assembly]. In the continuation of the session, the chiefs of 
the clubs of deputies have concluded, each for his own side, 
that great efforts to find an agreement have been invested over 
the last five days, but also that the negotiations did not yield 
the desired results. 
  A logical consequence of all this is the repeat of the 
entire 
procedure for the election of the assembly chairman. The 
candidate put forward by the Socialist Party of Serbia is Dragan 
Tomic, director of Jugopetrol and a chief of the Socialists' 
club of deputies, who also stood as a candidate last week. The 
opposition proposed Jorgovanka Tabakovic, economist from 
Pristina, and a deputy of the Serbian Radical Party, as its 
candidate. 
  At the moment there is a break, as I have reported. A debate 
about the candidates will ensue soon, after which the voting 
will be carried out. However, since nobody has changed his 
mind, the chances for the assembly to get a chairman in this 
round of voting are slim. This will be all for the time being.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Nikolic: "Science -- A Stage Set for the </F>
Regime"] 
  [Excerpt] Science and education resemble Siamese twins -- 
one cannot live without the other. The rate at which they will 
grow depends on how much is being invested in this bipolar 
"generator of the development of every society." In the SFRY, 
both these activities had full verbal support, and difficulties 
came about only when money was supposed to be given. It seems 
that "old habits die hard." 
  There are about 15,000 scientists and researchers (11,000 of 
them with doctoral degrees) and 150 scientific entities 
registered in Serbia: About 30 institutes have been founded by 
the republic, a quarter of which (seven) are under the patronage 
of Belgrade University. There was a list in the former 
Yugoslavia with the names of 33,000 scientific workers (of this 
number, only 4,000-5,000 people could justify holding this title 
on the basis of OECD standards). At the end of December 1990, 
it was announced that we do not lag behind the world in the 
number of researchers, but the difference is seen the moment one 
counts the number of computers, finds out what one day of a 
researcher looks like, or establishes the money allocated per 
scientist. 
  Unlike their colleagues from the European Community, who 
spend 47 percent of their working hours on research, in our 
country only every second researcher uses a third of his working 
hours for research. According to the number of scientific works 
in natural sciences published in internationally recognized 
scientific journals, before the war broke out the SFRY was in 
48th place out of 172 states. Of the European countries, only 
Romania, Turkey and Albania were behind us. The situation was 
even worse in the social sciences: 61st place with only Romania 
and Albania behind us. 
  One can learn about the situation in science by the numbers 
of patents granted in the research and development sector of the 
economy. As a comparison, one should say that in 1986 alone, a 
single Japanese firm claimed 28,200 patents, a that which the 
enterprises from the territory of former Yugoslavia (if they 
joined together again) would be able to reach in 158 years! 
  When the very ambitious federal Law on Financing Scientific 
and Technological Development was passed last summer, experts 
immediately saw that everything "remained just on paper" because 
funds amounting to 0.002 percent of GNP do not suffice even for 
small, let alone more serious, projects. 
  The embargo and other things have caused scientists to leave 
the country en masse. According to unofficial data, 17-20 
percent of people dealing with science have left the country in 
the last two years alone. 
  It has been calculated that the "brain drain" alone will 
reduce the GNP over the past two years by $30 billion. [passage

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said he expected the Bosnian conflict to be settled by 
war, in a statement Tuesday [1 February] to the Bosnian Serb 
news agency SRNA. 
  "The international community is going to allow the conflict 
to be settled by war, which means that the world will give 
Moslems credit for land acquired through fighting. This same 
principle should be adopted for the Serbs," he said. 
  The military headquarters for the self-proclaimed Serb 
republic of Bosnia on Monday decided to mobilize "everyone able 
to be mobilized, including women," in order to "end the war as 
quickly as possible." 
  A reorganization of the army, as well as the introduction of 
"stricter measures regarding deserters" were decided by the 
chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army. 
  Karadzic, quoted by SRNA, said Bosnian Serbs' military goals 
were to "modernize its army, increase its efficiency, ensure the 
defense of our republic and vanquish our enemies." 
  This required "the entire nation to mobilize for work or 
war," he said. 
  Bosnian Serb military commanders have repeatedly charged 
that 
the Moslem-majority Bosnian Government Army is preparing a 
large-scale offensive for the spring. 
  The Bosnian Serb leader also repeated his opposition to 
reopening the airport at Tuzla, the Moslem-controlled city in 
northeastern Bosnia. "Any reopening of Tuzla airport is not 
motivated by humanitarian reasons but by military reasons," he 
said. 
  The stage for more fighting was set after the last attempt 
to 
negotiate a settlement to the Bosnian conflict, two days of 
talks by the warring parties in Geneva last month, failed to 
make any progress. European Community negotiator David Owen at 
the time said the sides appeared to be gearing for new 
offensives after the winter, after 21 months of war.

  [Text] Jagodina, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, said today that international 
power brokers were doing as they pleased and were playing cruel 
games with the nerves of an entire nation that wants only what 
belongs to it. 
  Commenting for Radio Jagodina [in Serbia] on the latest 
threats of military intervention and proposals to lift the arms 
embargo for the Muslim side only, Karadzic said that the Bosnian 
Serbs have done everything for a peaceful solution but they were 
still exposed to relentless threats. 
  In reality, Srebrenica has never been a problem because we 
have allowed the Dutch battalion to replace the Canadian unit. 
However, the international community needs to aggravate the 
situation due to its obligations to the Islamic states. France 
wants to humiliate the NATO alliance and cause its downfall and 
so forth, Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic said once again that the opening of Tuzla airport 
was out of the question because this would mean that the Muslims 
would receive large amounts of weapons, which they were getting 
anyway. 
  It is absurd to discuss the lifting of the embargo on 
weapons 
for the Muslims when they have been receiving them from the 
Americans and Islamic states for a long time. The Muslims are 
well armed and, according to their own claims, they have 200,000 
soldiers. We think that they have even more, Karadzic said. 
  He also spoke of the discrepancy between Europe and the 
United States in respect of the ways for solving the Bosnian 
crisis and about the increasing number of claims by certain 
states that negotiations were no longer necessary as the Muslims 
were scoring victories on the battlefield. 
  The Serbs could be interested in this option. If we are 
talking about a status quo, the Serbs will keep 70 percent of 
the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina or possibly go down 
to 64 percent to which we have the right in the name of peace. 
If the Muslims opt for war, all percentages will be out of the 
question, Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic said that the option chosen by the Muslims and 
their 
allies was already clear, adding that this would perhaps finally 
be revealed as early as the next round of Geneva negotiations 
scheduled for 10 February.

  [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 1 (AFP) -- 
Humanitarian groups in Zenica have introduced drastic security 
measures to protect aid workers following the murder of a 
British aid worker believed to have been killed by Islamic 
fundamentalist mercenaries. 
  Aid workers have also reported thefts and problems with 
local 
people driven to desperation through hunger and hardship. One 
aid worker said the situation in the central Bosnia Moslem 
enclave was getting like Somalia where food aid has been 
routinely looted by armed gangs. 
  In response to a request from the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) a contingent of UN British 
troops moved into Zenica from their nearby base of Vitez on 
Friday to reassure members of non-governmental organisations 
(NGO). 
  On Thursday [27 January] night, Paul Goodall, Simon King and 
David Court, all three employed by the British 
government-sponsored Overseas Development Agency were kidnapped 
at gunpoint while driving in Zenica. 
  They were taken to a spot outside the town where Paul 
Goodall, a father of four, was shot dead and the other two were 
wounded as they jumped into an icy river to escape. 
  Three men believed to have been among the killers were shot 
dead Monday by Bosnian military police when they tried to break 
through a road block near Sarajevo. 
  They were described as being of Arab appearance with false 
Pakistani passports. Another three suspected Islamic 
"muhajedeen" mercenaries are being questioned by police in 
Zenica. 
  "It's a terrorist act. It's obvious that murder was the 
intention and it's frightening," said Larry Hollingworth, the 
leader of the UNHCR delegation in Zenica. 
  "For the first 24 hours, moral was very low among the NGOs. 
So we asked for a military presence to be here," he said. 
  Hollingworth said aid workers have been warned to take more 
precautions and to stay together. "We gave new instructions but 
they are free to do what they want. I don't want people to go 
alone into isolated villages. I want them to go out in groups, 
to stay in at night unless they have an escort." 
  "I don't know who wants to stop us but that is the line some 
groups are taking," Hollingworth said, adding: "There are 
various elements here who are not under (Bosnian) government 
control." 
  Sources in Zenica said between 200 and 300 Moslem 
"mujahedeen" or holy warriors were based in Zenica and the 
surrounding countryside. They have taken an active part in 
fighting Croat forces and their influence over the local 
population is growing. 
  "We had to move out of a house where he had planned to stay 
because of threats from one of the mujahedeen who came and told 
us to get out because we were too close to one of their bases," 
said Francisco Guevarra a French nurse with the Medecins du 
Monde medical charity in Zenica. 
  "The local people are scared of them and we avoid them as 
much as possible," he added. 
  But the presence of the Islamic mercenaries is not the only 
reason why aid workers are becoming more security-conscious. 
  As supplies of food and other items run out, thefts have 
increased, with international organisations becoming prime 
targets. 
  "In three weeks, we have been attacked nine times with 
garage 
break-ins, burglaries of homes, diesel fuel stolen from vehicle 
tanks," said Laure Bonnevie an administrator with the 
Pharmaciens sans Frontieres organisation which deals in medical 
supplies. 
  "People are hungry and will get more aggressive as time goes 
on," she said. 
  "We are already taking maximum precautions. The only thing 
we haven't done is hire bodyguards, and that we will not do," 
said Jean-Francois Delimoges of Medecins du Monde (doctors of 
the world). 
  Gilles Groizeleau of the French charity Equilibre was 
pessimistic. "We now have to employ policemen and private 
security guards to protect our warehouses and residence. We are 
slowly sliding towards a Somalia-type situation." 
  In the neighbouring town of Kakanj an angry crowd blocked 
convoys several times last week and six Bosnian policemen were 
shot and wounded in the turmoil. 
  "We'll achieve less than 20 percent of the needs in January. 
All this helps to promote civil unrest. A lot of civil unrest 
is because people are hungry," said Hollingworth. 
  "If we can get a lot of food here, we can remove one of the 
major causes (of unrest). But the number of people who need to 
be fed increases every single day and means to achieving it get 
worse every day."

  [Text] Immediately before the evening news, we received an 
exclusive report from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The murder of the British 
humanitarian worker, Paul Goodall, and the wounding of two of 
his colleagues, is a crime without precedent for which the West 
quickly accused members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Here is 
the result of a quick and successful investigation by the 
Ministry of Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Following the terrorist attack on the UNHCR [UN High 
Commission for Refugees] workers in Perin Han near Zenica on 27 
January this year, members of the Ministry of the Interior and 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, as well as the relevant judiciary 
bodies from Zenica and Sarajevo, took urgent and energetic 
operational and other steps to clarify this terrorist act and 
find the culprits. 
  Three persons, under well-founded suspicion of taking part 
in 
the attack, were arrested in Zenica. Taking as the starting 
point the established facts and the fact that the group that 
carried out this crime consisted of several people, steps were 
taken to find all the culprits. Reliable information was 
obtained to the effect that three kidnappers had set off toward 
Butmir in the stolen vehicle, in order to--as the Ministry of 
Interior of Bosnia-Herzegovina assesses--reach the airport and 
flee. 
  The plan was to intercept the group on Mount Igman in order 
to arrest its members. However, the car failed to stop despite 
repeated warnings by the Army. In a contrary action, automatic 
weapons fire was immediately opened from the car in the 
direction of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army members and had to be 
returned. All three terrorists and one civilian, who was held 
hostage, were killed in the ensuing shoot-out, while one 
military policeman was seriously wounded. 
  A passport issued in Great Britain and a passport that was 
an 
obvious forgery from Pakistan with an entry and transit visa of 
the Republic of Croatia was found on those killed. For the 
aforementioned reasons, it cannot yet be said for certain what 
kind of people this involved; nor can their exact identify be 
verified.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belgian General Francis Briquemont, former </F>
commander of the UN Protection Forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, by 
announcer Jacques Bredael and correspondent Philippe Lamair in 
the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Bredael] Good evening, General Briquemont. You 
have just heard [U.S.] Senator Biden saying: "Let them die their 
own way if we don't have the courage to help them live." Is this 
also your way of looking at the situation? 
  [Briquemont] The least that can be said is that the senator 
makes himself quite clear. But I think -- as it has been widely 
admitted over the past few weeks -- that one will have to choose 
between the logic of war or the logic of peace. If one wants to 
lift the arms embargo, the fighting eventually will intensify; 
this might correspond to the attitude of the Bosnian Government. 
But I stress again vigorously that if the three warring sides 
keep on fighting, the 10,000 Blue Helmets will not be able to go 
on providing humanitarian aid. One will have to choose: either 
there is an agreement in a few days or in a few weeks, or there 
is no agreement. In the latter case I believe that one will 
head toward intensified fighting. The situation will need to be 
thoroughly reassessed. 
  [Lamair] General, public opinion understands less and less 
the Bosnian issue and wonders why it is still impossible after 
20 months of war to put an end to it. What are the obstacles to 
a settlement to the conflict? 
  [Briquemont] Well, listen, I do not think that such a 
conflict will ever be solved with packages of resolutions; 
actions have to be envisaged. The first of these perhaps should 
be to make it possible for those on the spot to be able to apply 
the UN Security Council resolutions. Another aspect also seems 
important to me: We always apply our concepts, our Western, 
West European concepts to other societies which absolutely do 
not handle problems as we do. It always strikes me to hear some 
generals and also some political leaders saying: "You know, 
conflicts here are solved by force." Maybe one should understand 
what is happening over there before thinking that anything in 
which we believe in Brussels, in Washington, or elsewhere can 
materialize in that region [Bosnia]. 
  [Lamair] Your successor, British General Michael Rose, has 
the same mandate, the same number of troops. Would it not be 
necessary, for him to succeed, to change the mandate and, if 
nothing changes, well, to withdraw the Blue Helmets? 
  [Briquemont] Change the mandate? Well, I do not know if it 
is necessary to change it now. Simply, I would say that we 
should be given the means to implement the UN Security Council 
resolutions -- as I have been saying over and over again for 
weeks together with General Cot: "Give us the troops we need to 
carry out our mission successfully." The other problem is to be 
able to use the troops within the framework of the resolutions 
of course, but also in a way that the military chiefs deem 
necessary. I will not hide my deep shock when a battalion 
commander refused to execute an order because his government, or 
the governments of Nordic countries, refused to deploy a company 
in Srebrenica. I was deeply shocked because Srebrenica is a 
sensitive spot in Bosnia, and a key point of one of the most 
important UN resolutions -- Resolution 836. I thus believe that 
the contributing nations must accept the UN mandate, but it is 
far too easy to decide to send troops while saying at the same 
time: "I wish to use them here or there only for this or that 
purpose." This shocked me deeply and I can tell you that this 
battalion commander also was very ill at ease because refusing 
an order from one's commander is very serious for a soldier. I 
think this represents an intolerable intrusion by the political 
[leaders] in the conduct of operations. This must change and my 
successor has raised the issue in New York, but in the meantime, 
the governments of the contributing nations must admit that. 
Unfortunately, I do not believe this will happen anytime soon. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bredael] This is another vision of everyday reality in 
Sarajevo. General, have you experienced these desperate efforts 
by the population to preserve the life it had before [the war]? 
  [Briquemont] I experienced them intensely and you know the 
admiration I have for the Sarajevo population. And they were 
grateful to me because I probably did a little for them. You 
would not believe all the efforts made by the UNPROFOR to 
provide those people with a little water, electricity, and gas, 
all the efforts made so that those artists could come and 
perform. But the population also taught me lessons. I deeply 
admired their dignity, their resistance, and as I have already 
said in several interviews, I admired the women of Sarajevo. 
  [Lamair] General, judging from the report we have just seen, 
do you think that it is still possible for Sarajevo, and for the 
whole of Bosnia, to be a multiethnic region in the future? 
  [Briquemont] Yes, but... we probably have reached the most 
remote limit of that possibility. I believe that the fighting 
must stop very soon because if it does not, Sarajevo will no 
longer be that multicultural fortress and all the sides will 
become radicalized and Sarajevo will lose this multicultural 
feature. I believe that the city increasingly will become a 
Muslim city. 
  [Bredael] Do you mean that the Muslims are now also carrying 
out an ethnic cleansing? 
  [Briquemont] I do not know if I can call this ethnic 
cleansing, but if the fighting continues, the Muslims will want 
to turn Sarajevo into their capital and it then could be a kind 
of administrative cleansing. 
  [Bredael] Well, thank you, General, for your comments.

  [Text] The delegation of the Tuzla region, led by chairman 
Izet Hadzic and Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic, held talks today at 
Dubrave Airport with General Michael Rose, commander of the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina. On behalf of 
the General Staff, the talks on the opening of the airport were 
attended by Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic, deputy 
commander and chief of the General Staff, and his associates, 
Brigadier- General Mustafa Hajrulahovic-Talijan and Ramiz 
Suvalic, deputy commander of the 2d Corps. 
  Mayor Selim Beslagic informed General Rose about the 
difficult humanitarian situation in the Tuzla region, where some 
800,000 people have been living under siege for 10 months. He 
reiterated the demand that the international forces urgently 
open Dubrave Airport, which would solve the problems connected 
with the delivery of humanitarian aid not only to the free 
territories, but also the territories under the aggressor's 
temporary occupation. The examples of Bratunac, Bijeljina, and 
Zvornik were given. The only thing to which we will not agree 
is that the aggressor controls the airport, Mayor Beslagic said. 
  Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic reported on the 
attempts by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to enable the 
international institutions to operate freely, and also stressed 
the need for occasional meetings with the UNPROFOR chief of 
staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to solve possible disputed 
issues at that level, too. 
  General Rose expressed his gratitude for the support he was 
given, and informed his hosts about the orders he had issued to 
his liaison officers. He said that he believed that their 
successful work would be the grounds for the achievement of aims 
ahead of the international forces.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 31 January carries in 
its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  The studio announcer says that "on this, the 14th day of the 
[Serbian] enemy offensive against the free Doboj, Teslic, and 
Tesanj territories, the fighters of the 7th South Operative 
Group destroyed two more of the aggressor's tanks, an M-84 and a 
T-55, which brings the number to nine in this latest aggressor 
offensive, and to 72 enemy tanks destroyed since the start of 
the aggression against our country." 
  Reporting from an unspecified location in northern Bosnia, 
Hajrudin Redzovic says that "our antiaircraft defense has also 
been brilliant today. In the region of (Bojakovici) an 
aggressor's helicopter was hit and, badly damaged, forced to 
land in the village of Vitkovci." He says that "it was real 
hell in the region of Filipovici today, where the enemy launched 
a series of tank-infantry attacks, also using howitzers, 
self-propelled guns, and cannons of all calibers. Our positions 
on (Taratova Kosa) were also exposed to heavy tank fire. All 
these attacks were repelled." The report says that "the heroism 
of the fighters of the Tesanj 207nd Glorious Brigade was also 
extraordinary today. They inflicted heavy losses on the 
aggressor's manpower." 
  The studio announcer cites the Fojnica Press Center as 
saying 
that "the ustasha offensive on the Fojnica-Kiseljak front went 
into its third day today. During the day the enemy launched 
three combined artillery and infantry attacks on our defense 
lines. While the ustasha were attacking with waves of infantry, 
the chetnik artillery and tanks provided them with heavy 
support. Our fighters repulsed all these attacks and inflicted 
heavy losses on the enemy in manpower. The number of killed 
ustasha runs to dozens." 
  As for the Celic front, the "[Serb] enemy started shelling 
the town fiercely in the afternoon hours, just as the 
representatives of the Nordic Battalion arrived. They, too, 
were exposed to the chetnik fire from artillery, mortars, and 
antiaircraft guns." The studio announcer says that "the enemy 
fired over 100 shells at Teocak today." 
  Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer 
says that "this morning the chetniks shelled Mijatovica Kosa, 
Brijesce, Turkusici, and Point 830. This afternoon, the 
chetniks shelled the region in and around Zuc, and residential 
districts in Alipasino Polje and Sokolje."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 31 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems and 
Croats have been fiercely fighting over the past 24 hours in 
nearly all disputed territories, and Moslems have also continued 
attacks and provocations against the Serbs, Bosnian Serb 
military sources announced Monday. 
  Moslem Radio Sarajevo reports that three civilians have been 
killed and 14 wounded when the forces of Bosnian Croats and of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia Sunday afternoon fired 
over 80 artillery shells on the Moslem part of Mostar, town in 
the southern part of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to Moslem media, the Croat anti-aricraft and 
artillery units Sunday night fired on demarcation lines in 
Mostar, and Monday morning renewed their attacks on Moslem 
positions in Konjic, Jablanica and Prozor areas in central 
Bosnia. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources report that Moslem forces have 
been attacking practically all Serb communities and defense 
lines in the Sarajevo area, trying unsuccessfully to provoke 
large-scale clashes in order to renew the anti-Serb media 
campaign. 
  According to the same sources, Moslem forces have also 
attacked Serb communities and positions in northern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the areas of Doboj, Gradacac and Maglaj, 
as well as Olovo in central Bosnia. 
  Moslem formations have carried out a fierce artillery and 
infantry attack on Serb positions in the Maglaj area, but have 
had to withdraw, with losses, to their starting point, Bosnian 
Serb military sources report.

along HVO lines. On the Mostar front Muslim forces have 
increased their attacks, firing with artillery and smallarms on 
the city, while several mortars hit the city center. Serb forces

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 29 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] commander strongly protested to the head of Bosnian 
Croat forces Saturday after three Italian journalists were 
killed in Mostar and two peacekeepers wounded in central Bosnia, 
UNPROFOR said. 
  The Italian television journalists were among 10 people 
killed Friday during Croat shelling of the Moslem part of 
Mostar, a divided town in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The peacekeepers were wounded when Croat forces (HVO) 
attacked a UN convoy taking fuel to a hospital in the central 
town of Bakovici on Thursday. 
  In a letter to General Ante Roso, HVO chief-of-staff, the 
UN's General Jean Cot condemned "this type of behaviour" as 
"totally inadmissable," UNPROFOR said in a statement. 
  In a separate incident, two UN military observers -- a 
Dutchman and a Bangladeshi -- were slightly wounded Friday when 
a mine exploded near Drnis, in southern Croatia, UNPROFOR said. 
  They were driving with a third observer in the "southern 
sector," one of four areas of Croatia under UN protection, when 
they went over the mine. 
  The wounded men, who had wounds in the head, were 
hospitalized in Split, southern Croatia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 29 (AFP) -- Croat forces agreed to 
briefly halt their shelling of the Moslem-held sector of Mostar 
Saturday while UN troops evacuate the bodies of three Italian 
journalists killed by shrapnel the previous day, UN forces said. 
  Idesbald van Biesebroeck, a spokesman for the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR), said the bodies would be taken later in the 
day from the Moslem hospital in eastern Mostar to a medical 
center run by the Spanish UN contingent at Draveco, south of 
Mostar in southern Bosnia. 
  The three Italian television journalists, Marco Lucchetta, 
41, Dario D'Angelo, 47, and Alessandro Otta, 37, were killed 
Friday [28 January] by a mortar shell fired from the Bosnian 
Croat western part of Mostar. 
  Their bodies were due to be flown out of Split, a Croatian 
port town, later Saturday, the Italian ambassador at Zagreb, 
Salvatore Cilento, said. 
  The Bosnian Croat "defense ministry" on Saturday deplored 
the 
"tragic deaths" of the three Italians and expressed "deep 
sympathy for their families," in a statement carried by the 
official Croat news agency Hina. 
  Seven other people were killed in the Croat bombardment of 
Mostar Friday in which 55 rounds of artillery fire fell on the 
eastern part of the town, a spokesman for the UN's Spanish 
contingent said. 
  A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
[UNHCR], Kris Janowski, said Saturday that snipers had also 
killed two Moslem civilians near where an aid convoy was being 
unloaded into a UNHCR warehouse in eastern Mostar. 
  Two mortar rounds also fell near the convoy, but caused no 
casualties. 
  Friday Britain suspended its participation in aid conoys in 
Bosnia after a British driver was murdered and two Britons 
wounded by uniformed gunmen in the Moslem-held central Bosnian 
town of Zenica. 
  Meanwhile, Radio Sarajevo reported that Croat aircraft 
bombed 
the Moslem village of Kute, near Prozor in central Bosnia, early 
Saturday after shelling the village throughout the day Friday. 
  The radio, quoting officials in the mainly Moslem Bosnian 
army, gave no toll from the bombing and UN officials were unable 
to confirm the attacks on Kute, which, together with the nearby 
village Here that was overrun by Croat forces Tuesday, is a 
strategic supply link between southern Bosnia and Sarajevo. 
  The UN was unable to confirm the attack on Kute, although it 
confirmed on Friday the capture of Here. 
  Numerous Moslem refugees fled to Kute in October 1992 after 
a 
Croat offensive at Prozor. 
  Sarajevo's government called Friday for the UN to convene in 
emergency session and condemn the "open military intervention of 
Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

  [Excerpts] One person has been killed and two others 
wounded in an artillery attack by the Muslim army on Vitez and 
its vicinity. After the Muslim artillery had pounded Novi 
Travnik this morning, particularly the suburb of Donji Rastovci, 
Muslim artillery attacks spread in the course of the afternoon 
to other parts of the Lasva river valley. The centre of Vitez 
and all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] positions in that area 
are coming under particularly heavy fire. Shortly after 1300 
the parish church in Vitez was hit. After the Croatian 
artillery had retaliated, the shelling of this area subsided, 
although it has not completely stopped. At the same time Muslim 
infantry forces launched an attack from Sivrino Selo against the 
village of Dubravice east of Vitez and HVO positions east of 
Travnik. The HVO command in Vitez has reported that the HVO 
forces are firmly holding their positions. [passage omitted] 
  The political department of the Defense Ministry of the 
Croat 
Republic of Herceg-Bosna, expressing its regret over the tragic 
killing of the three members of an Italian RAI Uno television 
team from Trieste yesterday and extending condolences to their 
families, has issued an extraordinary communique explaining the 
circumstances surrounding the killing of the three journalists. 
  Shortly before 1600 yesterday Muslim forces fired four 
mortar 
rounds on a very busy street in the western [Croat-held] part of 
Mostar, the communique says. The shells were fired from Muslim 
positions situated near the Muslim army fourth corps command 
headquarters; three people in the western part of Mostar 
sustained injuries. In order to neutralize the attack the HVO 
retaliated, firing on the fourth corps command headquarters 
whence the shells had been fired against the western part of the 
city. That was when the three Italian journalists who were 
filming at that time in the vicinity of the command headquarters 
were killed. 
  After the Spanish UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] battalion 
interpreter had called and stated that the three journalists had 
been killed and one woman wounded, HVO troops immediately 
ceased fire, the communique says. The bodies of the journalists 
are still in a hospital in the eastern part of Mostar, from 
where they are expected to be transported by a UNPROFOR vehicle 
to Split to be flown to Trieste this evening. 
  The Spanish UNPROFOR battalion had warned the journalists to 
postpone their visit by a few days, but, having joined the 
International Commitee of the Red Cross, they came at their own 
risk. At the same time two other teams of journalists, a group 
of German journalists, a group of Dutch journalists, and two 
Turkish journalists [as received] sought permission to visit 
Mostar. They had set off for Mostar, but having been warned by 
HVO soldiers at the last checkpoint before entering Mostar that 
to visit this town would be risky, they gave up their trip and 
waited for UNPROFOR to take them back to Medjugorje, Colonel 
Antonio Castro, UNPROFOR spokesman in Medjugorje, said. Col. 
Castro added that in his talks with the Italian journalists he 
had been asked whether it was risky to visit Mostar, and had 
replied that to visit either the eastern or the western part of 
Mostar was always risky.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Ryszard </F>
Malik; place and date not given: "Now the Climate for Romania 
Is Better"] 
  [Text] [Malik] We can see Russia slowly but definitely 
returning to its imperial role. The politicians in Moscow are 
not going to abandon the influence on the course of events in 
Central and East Europe. Characteristic was the fact that 
Russia did not agree to Poland's admission to NATO, which, 
eventually, ended up in the "Partnership for Peace" initiative 
being approved at the NATO summit in Brussels. What is your 
evaluation of Boris Yeltsin's policy, of Russia's role, and what 
is your opinion on the attitude of Western states toward the 
countries liberated from Soviet hegemony? 
  [Iliescu] We should look at all the transformation processes 
under way in our region objectively and without emotions. We 
must remember that Russia was established on the ruins of the 
Czarist state in 1917 and, even though with other slogans and 
with the ideology of internationalism, it pursued the same 
imperialist policy of the Czars. It strove to submit the world 
to itself. The USSR was nothing but a continuation of Russia as 
it looked before 1917. The artificially established republics 
were steered centrally; all power was concentrated in the 
Kremlin. What has changed now? The Russia of Yeltsin is 
reverting back to the old Russian traditions -- traditions going 
back to times before 1917: we have the Duma, we have the Czarist 
eagle as the emblem of today's Russia, there are also people who 
are referring to the past. There are conservative forces, which 
demand that the Russian state, in this way or another, control 
the neighboring states. I am thinking about our part of Europe 
and about our two neighbors. 
  A return to the past, especially to the past associated with 
a given state's strength, could be observed in all fallen 
empires: in Great Britain after World War II; in France in the 
1960's, when Algeria, which wanted independence, was looked upon 
as an overseas part of France. Therefore, I want to emphasize 
that what we are observing today in Russia is not really 
surprising. 
  These are forces with which we must reckon; please note, 
however, that there are also progressive democratic forces, led 
by President Yeltsin. I hope that democracy will win; that new 
relations between Russia and its neighbors will develop in line 
with accepted rules of international politics, and that they 
will be friendly and will serve the interests of both sides. 
The historical process that is going on in today's world is 
very complex and we cannot really jump to any conclusions. I 
believe in the wisdom of politicians and assume that we all want 
a stable and peaceful Europe. The "Partnership for Peace" 
program seems to be a step in the right direction in this 
process. 
  [Malik] Romania sees, then, a possibility of Russia's 
membership in NATO? 
  [Iliescu] I hope that a certain general formula of 
partnership will be established which will in the future allow 
the Russian Federation to integrate with political and economic 
structures throughout Europe. I hope that Russia will find its 
niche in the community based on the rule of respecting the 
interests of all states. Today, a new international order is 
being constructed; this order is based on cooperation and 
understanding between all states and nations. It is a 
necessity, however, it is at the same time a guarantee of peace 
and stability. 
  [Malik] You are one of the few politicians in former 
socialist countries who is still in power after all the changes 
that have taken place. Could you reveal the source of this 
success? 
  [Iliescu] Once again we must go back to history. Romania 
was one of the states where the communist regime was very 
strict. However, at the time of intervention in Czechoslovakia 
and even earlier, Romania proved that it was not going to just 
passively follow the orders of the Kremlin. It was only the 
policy of the last decade, under the Nicolae Ceausescu regime, 
that led to an economic catastrophe, to unprecedented exclusion 
of the intellectual elites from political and economic life; in 
those years the elites were sentenced to a life of isolation. 
Building an autocratic economy and paying off the foreign debt 
at any cost were the most important achievements -- in the 
negative sense -- of the last communist leader of Romania. This 
is why the activities of the opposition were so radical; this is 
why we had a revolution that did not occur in any other former 
communist country. In the times of President Causescu, I was 
isolated for criticizing his policy in public. Because of that, 
I became a well-known personality -- one can even say that I 
became popular. I did many things that did not exactly fit the 
compulsory model. When the revolution broke out, in December 
1989, I found myself in the center of all the events and, 
perhaps because of my past, the people trusted me. I was 
elected chairman of the National Salvation Front. Then in the 
1990 elections, I was elected president; finally, two years ago, 
the people once again supported my candidacy for the head of 
state. It looks like I am still enjoying the trust of the 
people. 
  [Malik] Mr. President, not long ago Romania was depicted 
as a country governed by former communists. The situation 
changed a little after a former communist leader won the 
elections in Lithuania and after a social-democratic party won 
the Polish elections. Did you not, at a certain point, get the 
impression that Western politicians wanted to force you, as it 
were, to leave the political scene? 
  [Iliescu] I get the impression that not only in the case of 
Romania, but in all the states formerly governed by communists, 
there is a certain ideological flaw in the way the West 
perceives us. The very term ex-communist has in our case 
negative connotations. I will ask the following question: 
Should over 4 million members of the Romanian communist party 
now be isolated, excluded from the political and economic life? 
What should happen to the leaders of the opposition, such as 
Professor Emil Constantinescu (leader of the oppositional 
Democratic Convention comprised of 18 groupings -- R.M.), who 
was the [communist] party's ideological secretary in the 
university? Former communist party members are in all the 
groupings today. Almost the entire intellectual elite in 
Romania was in the party. This is not the only criterion for 
evaluating people. This is not acceptable; it is a Bolshevik 
evaluation. We must build a new Romanian society and evaluate 
people according to what they can do. One must see things and 
people as they really are, without looking into the dossier at 
any cost. 
  [Malik] In Switzerland, in exile, lives former King Michael 
II. Why do you not want him to return to his fatherland? 
  [Iliescu] We must look at this problem without any emotions. 
The problem is whether Romania is supposed to be a monarchy or a 
republic. The Romanian people have already expressed their 
opinions on this subject in a referendum; they accepted the 
republican constitution. Monarchy was a certain stage in the 
history of Romania; there is no raison d'etre for its role in a 
new society. Indeed, there are various forces and people in our 
country that for various reasons want to restore the monarchy. 
These people are living with illusions -- they want to return 
to the times before World War II. Today, that is simply 
impossible. Personally, I have nothing against the king. 
However, if he wants to return to Romania as a king, this is 
simply out of the question. Now, if he wants to come back here 
as an ordinary citizen, then he is welcome. Let me only add 
that it is not him that is the cause of all this commotion; he 
does not want to be a monarch any longer. Those who have caused 
it are people driven by nostalgia. 
  [Malik] Is it true that Romania is being isolated, that 
there are opinions in Bucharest that the state has been 
relegated to the sidelines of regional initiatives, and that 
entrance into the Council of Europe was delayed? 
  [Iliescu] Romania does not want to be isolated. It is true 
that we are being moved away. We wanted -- fruitlessly -- to 
become a member of the Visegrad Group and to join the Central 
European Initiative. We want to cooperate with all the states 
of Central and East Europe, including Poland. As far as the 
issue of admitting us to the Council of Europe is concerned, my 
evaluation is that it was the same ideological flaw -- 
perceiving us as former communists. However, also as a result of 
our internal disputes, they are transferred to the international 
level. It is one of our weaknesses in the period of change. We 
know all about it. 
  The climate for Romania is now better. Everyone understands 
that including our country in the process of European 
integration will be in the interest of all Europe. 
  [Malik] Since I am speaking with you as the Romanian 
president, I cannot help asking you a question about the 
Republic of Moldova, which was established from the debris of 
the USSR. Is it possible, and is it very real, that Romania and 
Moldova will become one state? There will be a referendum on 
this very soon. 
  [Iliescu] Well, this is a very difficult issue given the 
present international situation. We must look at it 
objectively. We must respect international and interstate 
agreements that set the present borders in Europe. One cannot 
change the present status of borders in one point, because this 
would cause an avalanche of corrections; such an avalanche would 
be difficult to control and would place the stabilization of the 
entire continent in question. 
  As for the Republic of Moldova, it is one of the many states 
that were established after the collapse of the Soviet Union; 
processes of political and economic transformations are under 
way there. However, it must be remembered that Moldova is a 
territory that historically belongs to Romania; that Romanian is 
spoken there; and that the country has the same culture. The 
Soviet Union's annexation of Moldova was the result of the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov pact; however, Nikita Khrushchev was even 
smarter than Stalin and divided Moldova; as a result, today part 
of it belongs to Ukraine. Thus, now this concerns not only the 
Republic of Moldova, but also Ukraine. 
  We have good relations with Moldova and we will develop them 
in all areas. The answer to the question of when the 
unification of these states will be possible remains pure 
guesswork. No one knows that. If we assume that in the future 
united Europe there will be no borders and that there will be 
one great European nation, this issue will not be so emotional. 
  [Malik] Many national minorities live in Romania. Of 
these, the Hungarians are the most numerous. This is the cause 
of tensions in the relations between Romania and Hungary. What 
guarantees does Romania provide minorities? 
  [Iliescu] In Romania lives a Hungarian minority that 
consists of 1.7 million people. Just like all the other 
minorities, of which there are 14, the Constitution guarantees 
them all rights, it can develop without any hindrances, in 
peace, and with the feeling of stability. The minorities have 
their own representatives in the parliament. Even the smallest 
national groups, in case their representatives are not elected 
to parliament, are guaranteed a seat there. The Romanian 
Government has acknowledged the rights of the minorities for 
free development, in accordance with their needs, in every area. 
No matter whether they are Germans or Hungarians, all of them 
have the same rights as Romanian citizens. The rule that our 
country is applying is that minority members must be loyal 
citizens of Romania and observe all binding laws. 
  Now, as for our relations with Hungary. We have informed 
Budapest that we are alarmed at the extreme demonstrations of 
some political forces in Hungary which query the status quo in 
the region and demand extraordinary rights for the Hungarian 
minority in Romania, and not only here. We do not consent to 
the idea of territorial autonomy for any minority. For example, 
do the Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine in France have 
autonomy? We believe that these are issues that each state 
regulates in line with international law. Please bear in mind 
that one-third of Romanians live outside our borders. We are 
not trying to turn it into a problem; we are not bringing this 
issue up. We support the contacts of the Hungarians with their 
native country; however, we would also like them to be loyal 
citizens of Romania and to respect the law just like all the 
other citizens. 
  I believe that our relations with Hungary are good. Our 
economic contacts are on a very good level, I would say. I do 
believe that if we take a real look at the problems that need to 
be resolved and that need cooperation, we will render these 
relations normal and friendly. Just like the relations with any 
other state. 
  [Malik] Many economic problems of Romania have their origin 
in the war in former Yugoslavia. Does Romania, which has good 
relations with the new Yugoslavia, have any influence on this 
conflict? Is it doing anything to help end this conflict? 
  [Iliescu] Romania has never had any conflicts with former 
Yugoslavia. On the contrary, our relations are very good. As I 
see it, the disintegration of Yugoslavia was a positive event. 
After World War I, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established 
which functioned very well; it settled disputes between various 
nations and various religions, the Muslims, Catholics, and 
Orthodox Church members. In World War II, the nations of 
Yugoslavia fought jointly against the German invaders. The 
disintegration of Yugoslavia is the result of the ending of the 
Cold War; it is the play of the interests of various states, 
such as Germany, which contributed to what happened. Romania 
today has good relations with the new Yugoslavia, with Slovenia, 
and with Croatia. We would like the conflict in Bosnia to be 
settled quickly and peacefully. We are trying to help this 
cause as much as we can. We have historical, political, 
economic, and cultural relations with this region. It is also 
in our interest to finally settle this dramatic conflict. 
  [Malik] Mr. President, Polish-Romanian relations have a long 
tradition. They have always been friendly. How do you evaluate 
them today? 
  [Iliescu] I would first of all like to emphasize that we 
attach great importance to our relations with Poland and their 
development. First, because we cooperated many times in the 
past and many times we were on the same side of the barricade. 
We were linked by the same problems. Our neighbors were great 
empires which attempted to submit us to themselves. Right now 
we are facing a great challenge related to the process of 
democratic transformation and the introduction of a market 
economy. Therefore, it is with sorrow that I speak about the 
unfriendly treatment of Romania; you write about our state being 
a country of Gypsies; your mass media, including the newspaper 
that you represent, present only a negative picture of Romania. 
Why is that? Is it because Poland is enjoying great sympathy 
in Romania and because the Romanians admire Polish culture? 
  We are both surprised and alarmed at this reservedness on 
the 
part of Poland toward Romania. 
  However, I am an optimist and I hope that in the immediate 
future better times for Polish-Romanian relations will come. 
Using your newspaper, I would like to inform all your readers 
about my optimism and about the great sentiment that the 
Romanian people have for Poland and Poles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Alexandra 
Andon in Bucharest; date not given: "The Embargo and the 
Illusion of Peace Through the Use of Force"] 
  [Text] [Andon] What is the meaning of this sudden visit 
to Bucharest? 
  [Jovanovic] It is not exactly a sudden visit, we have had a 
steady practice for quite some time now, to carry out political 
contacts regularly. We have continued this practice in spite of 
sanctions. This time we have examined the stage of projects for 
bilateral accords that the prime ministers of the two countries 
agreed upon in October 1993. 
  [Andon] What kind of bilateral accords are you referring to? 
  [Jovanovic] We are talking about a long-term economic 
cooperation accord, whose drafting has reached the final stage. 
Likewise, we are talking about the basic bilateral accord and 
about the cooperation accord in the area of health, culture, and 
ecology. We wish that the lifting of sanctions should find us 
prepared. 
  [Andon] How long do you think the embargo is still going to 
last? 
  [Jovanovic] This embargo should not have been imposed in the 
first place. It was imposed as an idea for the reestablishment 
of peace in Bosnia but it has become the major obstacle in the 
path of peace because the Muslims rely on those sanctions and, 
therefore, they oppose peace. They believe that through 
sanctions they will obtain victory since they could not obtain 
victory in any other way in this war. An increasingly greater 
number of countries are aware of this fact. The most important 
thing is that the neighboring countries, which are the most 
affected by these sanctions, should oppose this irrational and 
absurd policy. 
  [Andon] Which countries give you signs that they support the 
lifting of the embargo? 
  [Jovanovic] First of all the European Union has linked the 
reestablishment of peace in Bosnia to the lifting of sanctions, 
asking that Serbs should fulfill certain conditions that they 
have already fulfilled. The Americans oppose the lifting of the 
embargo because of their overall interests in the region. But 
such countries as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and even Hungary 
started to give positive signs in this respect and they support 
the lifting of the embargo. The same can be said about big 
countries such as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Ukraine, 
Belarus, and among the members of the European Union Italy and 
Spain have become more flexible. Sanctions are a factor that 
directly influences the continuation of the war and might lead 
to a rapid destabilization in the Balkans. 
  [Andon] How far from or how close to a result are the Geneva 
negotiations? What is the major obstacle in the path of those 
negotiations? 
  [Jovanovic] The major obstacle is the sanctions because they 
give the Muslims the illusion that they can continue the war. 
However, actions of support for lifting the embargo have not 
been prepared yet and the international community can still not 
oppose the Islamic world, those rich Arab countries which 
support Izetbegovic's [Alija, president of Bosnia's Presidency] 
blackmail. Through him, they aim at the establishment of a 
unitary Muslim Bosnia in the center of Europe. 
  [Andon] You held talks in Bucharest with your Romanian 
counterpart Teodor Melescanu about the relations of the two 
countries with other countries in this area, namely with 
Albania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In concrete terms, what are the 
results and the conclusions of those talks? 
  [Jovanovic] We agreed that we have to renew inter-Balkan 
cooperation, as part of the process of European integration. 
Certainly, it is still too early to talk about precise terms. 
First we have to be out of the woods and then cry "halloo." 
  [Andon] What role have the relations with Romania played in 
the context of Yugoslavia's quasi isolation? 
  [Jovanovic] They have played the role that derives mostly 
from the reality that the two countries have never had conflicts 
throughout their history. Thus, Romania and Greece made 
possible that this monstrous wish to isolate Yugoslavia 
completely has never been achieved, and this helped other 
countries as well to adopt a more independent view regarding 
relations with Yugoslavia. We have had scores of political 
contacts and visits. First of all with Romania and Greece but 
also with countries that are situated farther, such as India and 
China. 
  [Andon] Have you received signs from any country that, after 
the lift of embargo, they would like to have economic 
cooperation with Yugoslavia? 
  [Jovanovic] Yes, from several countries. As a matter of 
fact, even now businessmen from Germany and France, that is, 
countries that have a very tough stand toward Yugoslavia, sell 
goods to us. Others are afraid that they may lose the market. 
Currently we are preparing bilateral economic accords -- the 
type we have with Romania -- also with Ukraine, India, Russia, 
Greece, Bulgaria, and probably with Hungary as well. Many 
countries feel that sanctions will not last long and they want 
to return to the Yugoslav market.

  [Text] President Ion Iliescu chaired an ordinary meeting 
of the country's Supreme Defense Council at Cotroceni Palace 
today. The first point of the agenda was an examination of the 
documents adopted by the North Atlantic Council summit in 
Brussels on 10-11 January, that is the declaration of the heads 
of state and government and the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
documents. The discussions on this agenda point were also 
attended by Messrs. Oliviu Gherman and Adrian Nastase, 
presidents of the two parliamentary chambers, as guests. 
  The communique received by fax from Cotroceni Palace, points 
out that, by adhering to the PFP Romania, along with the other 
partners, is thus reiterating its commitment to fulfill, in good 
faith, the obligations included in the UN Charter and the 
principles of the Human Rights Declaration, as well as the 
commitment to observe the CSCE Final Act and other CSCE 
documents. 
  Unanimously endorsing Romania's adherence to the PFP as a 
transitory stage toward full integration in the North Atlantic 
Organization, the Supreme Defense Council also endorses further 
cooperation with NATO to achieve the goals stipulated by the 
basic document. The Supreme Defense Council adopted a number of 
preparatory measures to facilitate the fulfillment of the 
obligations incumbent upon Romania through the adherence to the 
PFP. It was also decided that, in working out the presentation 
document, the established team of experts -- consisting of 
representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of National Defense -- should consult with specialists 
nominated by NATO. Similarly, consultations should be conducted 
with the heads of the political parties represented in 
Parliament in order to finalize the document. 
  Also today, the Supreme Defense Council examined and 
endorsed 
a report on the strategy and program for mobilizing the national 
economy in case of emergency and suggested that the government 
should correlate these documents with Romania's reform program 
and the special PFP program. 
  The Supreme Defense Council also endorsed a report on the 
activity carried out by the country's Supreme Defense Council in 
1993, which will be submitted to Parliament. At the same time, 
the Council's activity plan for the current year was also 
approved. The latter will be completed with certain activities 
resulting from the need to schedule various other actions and 
obligations devolving on Romania from the special PFP program, 
after its content is known. 
  The Council also endorsed the proposals on establishing the 
legal status of military cemeteries and commemorative war 
monuments at home and abroad as well as the legal status of 
foreign soldiers buried on Romanian soil.

  [Text] Protesting the president's visit in the martyr city 
[Timisoara], Traian Orban, a person who was wounded in the 
revolution, laid his body across the tram rails. Iliescu laid a 
wreath in the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes. The fact that the 
president visited the military barracks in Lipovei Street, where 
on 17 December 1989 13 young persons were murdered, was simply 
an act of defiance. During Iliescu's meeting at the County 
Prefect's Office, the building was "protected" by hundreds of 
policemen and members of the riot police. 
  From the very beginning, while coming down the stairs of the 
presidential plane, Iliescu declared that he had a special 
interest, including a "personal" one (?!), in that town. 
Romania's president was present for the second time in the 
martyr city. His visit began with a classical working visit 
[reference to Ceausescu's working visits in the country], 
following every rule of such visits, at the first factory that 
lay in Iliescu's way, namely the FILTY [as published] company. 
Iliescu also hastily visited the Cemetery of the Martyr Heroes, 
where he laid a wreath in a contemptuous silence. At the 
military barracks situated in Lipovei Street, belonging to the 
same unit which in 1989 December opened fire against the 
demonstrators thus killing 13 young persons, the military had 
the "honor" of personally meeting Ion Iliescu, the eminent 
president. The current leader of the country passed without 
even casting a glance at the heroes' mothers who had lined up in 
front of the barracks. While Iliescu was chatting amiably with 
the commanders of the unit, the bereaved mothers were crying at 
the barrack gates and chanting: "Iliescu, don't forget, 
Timisoara doesn't want you!" or "Let us put him on trial here, 
in Banat!" and "Down Iliescu!" 
  The peak of Iliescu's visit was his meeting in the County 
Prefect's Office building, which was surrounded, as it had never 
been before, by the police and the riot police. The president 
was almost one full hour late. Considering the visit as an act 
of defiance against the dead and the wounded [in the 
revolution], Traian Orban, who was wounded in the bloody 
December, laid himself across the tram rails as a sign of 
protest. 
  Inside the County Prefect's Office, which formerly used to 
be 
the headquarters of the PCR [Romanian Communist Party] Timis 
County branch, the president met with close aides of the former 
county secretary of PCR, Iliescu [sentence as published]. The 
atmosphere of the meeting was strained. Realizing how 
embarrassing the situation was, as the meeting was "populated" 
by former PCR officials, many people who had been invited to 
attend started leaving the hall. 
  As Iliescu's memories of the "golden age" are related too 
much to Timisoara, the president did not have the necessary time 
(and desire) to meet with that county's revolutionary 
organizations. The presidential counselors promised them 
separate talks. Now, in the evening hours, while our 
correspondent is sending this report, the Prefect's Office 
building is under siege by thousands of Timisoara citizens who 
are booing to express their protest with respect to the 
presidential visit.

  [Text] The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
[UDMR] last week sent an aide memoire to the Council of Europe 
regarding observance of the recommendations made by the Council 
of Europe when Romania was admitted as a full member. This aide 
memoire has been signed by UDMR President Bela Marko and 
Executive President Csaba Takacs, the UDMR press bureau reports. 
  The document emphasizes that the UDMR supports, without 
reservation, the recommendations made by the Council of Europe, 
which it views as mandatory in the democratic transformation 
process that is taking place in Romanian society. The aide 
memoire sent to the rapporteurs for Romania in the Council of 
Europe divides the recommendations into four categories to which 
Romania has pledged to abide, but in the implementation of which 
certain political forces -- that is Romania's Government -- do 
not manifest the necessary political will: the signing and 
ratification of certain international accords; problems 
regarding rights of ethnic minorities; legislative problems; and 
the law-governed state. 
  Without claiming to exhaust all problems, the document lists 
those problems that, according to the UDMR, are expected to be 
solved: Use of the mother tongue in the administration, 
justice, and education of all grades; use of bilingual 
inscriptions; ensuring equal chances for the assertion in the 
economy, especially in the area of privatization; adoption of 
the law on ethnic minorities and of the education law; 
separation of the powers in the state; the independence of the 
judicial power; decentralization; restitution of nationalized 
church properties; the genuine independence of the audiovisual 
media; the urgent solution of the situation of those who have 
been sentenced on ethnic grounds; and so forth. 
  The UDMR believes that the solution of these problems is 
indispensable for Romania's integration into European structures 
and expresses the hope that the international body -- the 
Council of Europe -- which has shown trust in Romania by 
admitting it as a member with full rights will seek more 
efficient ways and means to enable it to support our country, so 
that Romania can be integrated in European structures, the UDMR 
emphasizes, as cited by ROMPRES.

<F P=106> [Gheorghe Boldur-Latescu editorial: "The Chinese Model"] </F>
  [Text] No doubt political analysts as well as many of our 
more experienced fellow citizens still remember that after 
almost 20 years of terrible communist terror, starting in 1964 
in our country there was a period of relative political and 
economic relaxation, with actual positive effects on the 
people's standard of living. 
  "The Romanian spring," as some people called this period, 
ended in 1971, after Nicolae Ceausescu's visit to Asia. He 
returned enthusiastically from what he saw in China, where the 
aberrant and bloody "Cultural Revolution" was in full process of 
implementation. The darkest period of the Bolshevik 
totalitarianism in Romania began after that visit. That was a 
period that ended only with the anticommunist revolution of 
1989. The application of the Chinese model -- because, in fact 
that is what this was all about -- in the 18 years of the 
Ceausescu dictatorship left tragic marks on the Romanian people 
in the biological, psychological, economic, social, and moral 
sphere and many of those marks can be felt even today. 
  Four years after the December 1989 events, the history of 
the 
application of the Chinese model seems to be repeated. In a 
moment when, with immense efforts and sacrifice and in spite of 
the opposition of those nostalgic Communists, complex processes 
are taking place in Romania aimed at gradually leading toward 
democracy, free economy, and European reintegration, a careful 
observer might distinguish with astonishment and fear certain 
elements that suggest a new attempt to follow the Chinese model, 
with the appropriate modifications that it went through in the 
decades that have passed since it had been implemented by Mao 
Zedong. 
  In this respect, one cannot ignore the numerous visits paid 
in recent months to China by important personalities of the 
current leadership, among them Adrian Nastase [president of the 
Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament and president of 
the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania] and Mircea Cosea 
[chairman of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and 
Economic Reform]. 
  However, we should pay special attention to the fact that 
some declarations made very recently by President Iliescu and 
Adrian Nastase are very close to the general concept of the 
Chinese model, the way it has been remodeled in the past years 
by Deng Xiaoping. For example, during the talks held at 
Cotroceni [Presidency] with the representatives of the 
Democratic Convention, the head of state let it be understood 
that the current leaders are ready to hold dialogue with the 
opposition, but in no way can there be a question of sharing 
power, although the catastrophic situation of our country and 
the obvious lack of confidence of the public in the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania] and in its allies would make a 
change of government imperative for the benefit of the country. 
This position adopted by Mr. Iliescu has been confirmed also by 
the president of the Chamber of Deputies, on the occasion of an 
ample interview granted to the Romanian Television on Monday, 17 
January, immediately after the major current events program of 
that evening. In the interview, the leader of the ruling party 
shared with millions of television viewers who were following 
the program another idea that derives from the Chinese model, 
namely that privatization is not a goal in itself. The Chinese 
leaders have launched in recent years the concept of "socialist 
market economy" which is a flagrant contradiction of terms, 
because the socialist economy (in fact the communist economy) is 
not compatible with the market economy, as can be seen from the 
tragic experience of the past 75 years. However, market economy 
cannot exist without massive privatization, the proof of it 
being what is currently happening in our country and in the 
former communist countries which carry out half-measure reforms. 
The two major leaders of the current neo-communist power in our 
country have also spoken out for other "theses" that derive from 
the typical cliches of the Chinese models. Thus, on the occasion 
of the visit paid to Cotroceni by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the 
representative of the United States to the United Nations, Mr. 
Iliescu stated that the current economy is going through a 
crisis of system and its major cause is the contradiction 
between rich and poor countries. In turn, during his 
aforementioned television interview, Mr. Nastase affirmed that 
Romania's admission to the Euro-Atlantic structures does not 
depend on the democratic reforms in our country but on our 
geostrategic position. 
  Thus, the phantom of the Chinese model is haunting our 
country again, but this does not stop us from being optimists, 
just as we have been so far. If we look at what happened in 
less than three years to the "glorious Soviet Union" and to the 
aberrant ideology on which the colossus with clay legs that 
frightened the civilized West for three quarter of a century 
relied, we can predict what is going to happen in a few years to 
the other communist colossus that tries to invent new funny 
formulas of survival. The same thing that will happen to those 
who try to follow that model. There is nothing we can do except 
tell all of them at the right time: "God forgive them for the 
evil they inflicted on humanity," because we are too small to do 
this.

  [Text] Sofia, February 1 (BTA) -- DEMOKRATSIYA and 
OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK carry front-page reports on the detention of 
a Bulgarian ship carrying oil by an embargo patrol of the 
Western European Union [WEU] near Calafat, Romania. The tugboat 
Khan Krum and three barges carried 5,000 tonnes of diesel fuel, 
the dailies say. The convoy tried to pass by the port of Ruse 
with its lights off, obviously attempting to reach the Serbian 
port upstream, DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of the 
Democratic Forces (SDS), reports. According to the daily, the 
boat was hired by Multigroup. This is not the first time that 
this financial grouping is named in connection with a 
sanctions-busting attempt, the two dailies write.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalia Ilieva] </F>
  [Text] New York, January 31 (BTA) -- Bulgarian companies 
have filed 5,184 applications for export of non-embargo goods to 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Sanctions Committee 
since the entry into force of UN Security Council Resolution 820 
of April 17, 1993, sources of Bulgaria's Permanent Mission to 
the UN said. 3,623 applications were granted, 226 were blocked 
or put aside for further consideration, and 1,336 are awaiting 
replies. Export permission has been granted for goods worth 
10,000 million U.S. dollars and 2,000 million German marks. 
  "This is the first case of its kind in the history of the 
UN," Slavi Pashovski, Bulgarian ambassador to the UN, told BTA. 
"It takes the Sanctions Committee three to four weeks to 
consider the applications. The delay is due to the lack of a 
special body dealing with them alone. In the summer Bulgarian 
applications were blocked by Islamic member states of the 
Security Council," he said. "Firms should file their 
applications with the Ministry of Trade which sends them to the 
Bulgarian mission in New York. We have had as many as 200 
applications on some days lately." 
  "Currently the prevailing opinion at the UN is that no 
special fund can be set up to compensate losses, like the one 
set up after the Iraqi aggression, as no one can see any source 
of proceeds to Yugoslavia." Ambassador Pashovski believes UN 
resources of indirect compensation for Bulgaria's losses caused 
by the Yugo-embargo have been tapped effectively. The Sanctions 
Committee recognized Bulgaria's special economic problems 
arising from sanctions enforcement and recommended to UN 
specialized organisations, international financial institutions 
and regional banks to adjust their programmes to Bulgaria's 
needs. Their response so far shows their first step will be to 
make independent studies and estimate Bulgaria's losses., 
  Bulgaria's estimates of the damage caused by the embargo add 
up to 3,500 million U.S. dollars. "Everything now depends on 
the government's efforts and activity," Mr. Pashovski said. 
"There is an idea that losses could at least be deducted from 
Bulgaria's debt. This is one of the key issues at the 
foreign-debt negotiations." 
  Mr. Pashovski said the delay in transit road haulage through 
serbia on the part of Bulgaria was justified, provided it was 
prompted by a desire for greater accuracy. He highly commended 
the sanctions committee's decision to grant Bulgaria a transit 
transport corridor, which was refused in the summer. 
  "The listing of Bulgarian companies in the registers of UN 
suppliers is a new priority of the Bulgarian mission to the UN. 
This is a multi-million-dollar business targeted mainly on 
peacekeeping operations of the world organisation and many 
companies will be informed about tenders for various supplies so 
that they could participate. To become suppliers, however, the 
companies will have to prove the advantages of their products 
over other tenderers," Ambassador Pashovksi stressed.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Radka Nenova] </F>
  [Text] Budapest, January 28 (BTA) -- The signing of a brief 
memorandum on the transshipment of goods across Serbia brought 
to a close the talks between a Bulgarian and a Hungarian 
delegation here last night. The document proceeds from the 
procedure announced by the Brussels-based UN Sanctions 
Committee. In compliance with this procedure, the sides had to 
sort out some technicalities concerning Hungarian rules and 
legislation. 
  "The Hungarians were understanding of all matters we 
raised," 
Bulgarian Deputy Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov told 
BTA. "There are some problems which our Hungarian partners were 
unable to solve right now, but they promised to sort them out 
and let us know soon. For instance, there was the problem on 
how truck convoys for the journey back from Hungary to Bulgaria 
will be formed." 
  On the initiative of the UN Sanctions Committee, the 
Bulgarian and Hungarian delegations will confer in Budapest on 
February 3 and 4. Quite a few problems will be specified at 
that meeting. "At the meeting we will brief the committee on 
these technicalities which we have coordinated with our 
Hungarian colleagues, as well as on our arrangements with the 
Bulgarian border control authorities and possibly with the 
Serbian partners concerning the transshipment of goods via 
Serbia. Evidently, the convoys will not start overnight. We 
will also wait for the meeting in Budapest, to which we have yet 
to receive an invitation from Brussels, and we will then send 
the first applications for permits. Only after obtaining such 
permits, complying with all technical conditions, we can 
actually start transiting goods across Serbia," the Bulgarian 
deputy transport minister said. 
  Each type and quantity of goods intended for transshipment 
across Serbia have to be cleared with the UN Sanctions 
Committee. These permits will be valid for three months, or the 
procedure will be the same as the one followed in permitting 
shipment of humanitarian assistance to Yugoslavia. In this 
case, however, the committee will deal with transshipment of 
goods to Western Europe and from Western Europe across Serbia to 
Bulgaria and, possibly, on to the Middle East.

  [Text] Sofia, January 30 (BTA) -- Speaking on the Nedelya 
150 Weekly Political Programme of the Bulgarian national radio 
today, Multigroup President Iliya Pavlov did not deny his 
acquaintance with former communist functionary Ognyan Doynov, 
but said that Mr. Doynov and Multigroup had no commitments to 
each other. Mr. Doynov is believed to be in Austria now and the 
Bulgarian prosecutor general has filed an official request for 
his extradition to answer embezzlement charges. Mr. Pavlov 
described as fabrications and lies the allegations that 
Multigroup-affiliated companies have busted the Yugoembargo. As 
for his acquaintance with Ivo Karamanski (the owner of the 
Sevastopol Casino in Sofia and alleged Mafia boss now under 
arrest), the Multigroup president said he had no personal 
impressions as the two "represent different strata." 
  The Austrian press alleged that Multigroup is a Bulgarian 
formation of companies-phantoms existing only as post office 
boxes in Switzerland. There are also rumours that these 
companies are laundering money of the former Bulgarian Communist 
Party. According to press stories, Doynov's brother, Emil 
Doynov, working as a consultant at the joint-stock company, was 
playing the intermediary between Multigroup and Ognyan Doynov. 
Newspaper stories alleged that Multigroup tops the list of the 
companies that have busted the UN embargo. The group was said 
to be involved in huge oil deals with former Yogoslav countries. 
It was even said that the raging gangsters' war in Sofia was 
ignited by a conflict between Ivo Karamanski and Iliya Pavlov. 
The group was reportedly expelled from G-13, a formation of big 
Bulgarian industrialists. 
  Iliya Pavlov said that Multigroup has over 3,000 staff and 
the 1993 turnover was approximately $1,000 million, which is 
"put down in the records of some major European banks." There 
is no employee of the Doynov family in the holding group. Emil 
Doynov had only been temporarily employed as consultant for some 
deals with Poland in 1992, which "was an absolutely normal 
business," and if it is necessary and profitable for the holding 
group, it will employ him again, Mr. Pavlov said. Emil Doynov 
is a former Bulgarian trade attache in Vienna. 
  Multigroup strictly observes the Yugoembargo, "all the more 
that it had active business contacts in this region before the 
enforcement of the UN sanctions," and these contacts will be 
renewed when the embargo is lifted, Mr. Pavlov said. According 
to him, undercover activity is unthinkable as the holding group 
is the most strictly monitored institution in this country. Mr. 
Pavlov dismissed as impossible allegations that G-13 members 
have criticized Multigroup. "When Bulgaria and the national 
capital are at stake, there should be no competition, G-13 means 
that we have to be united when the national interests are 
concerned," he said. Commenting on the difference between the 
strata that he and Ivo Karamanski represent, Mr. Pavlov said 
that Karamanski "is bodyguard or owner of a single casino, while 
Multigroup is a economic giant which could own 100 casinos if it 
wants to." 
  Multigroup emerged three years ago, starting its activity as 
Multiart, a cooperative set up in 1988. The holding group works 
predominantly in the sphere of metallurgy, chemistry and machine 
engineering. It trades in coal, ores, salt, sugar, and develops 
investment projects. The difference between Multigroup and 
Multigroup Holding Group Inc., is that the latter holds the 
shares of all Multigroup-affiliated companies, Iliya Pavlov 
recently told the press. The holding group was registered in 
Zug, Switzerland, and has subsidiaries in the United States, 
Ukraine, Russia, South Africa and the Far East. The lending, 
financial and banking activity of Multigroup is performed by the 
Sofia Credit Bank, the Sofia Discount House and the Sofia 
Insurance Company, First Bulgarian Stock Exchange and the 
Macedonian Credit Bank.

  [Text] Sofia, January 31 (BTA) -- At a regular meeting 
today the Council of Ministers decided to export Bulgarian 
uranium concentrate abroad. The decision concerned 500 tonnes 
of concentrate stocked before the entry into force of the decree 
closing down uranium mines. According to the commission set up 
by the government last December to explore prospects for using 
the uranium concentrate, it will be inefficient to resume 
uranium mining in Bulgaria. The commission came to this 
conclusion considering the high prime cost of the local product, 
which exceeds the average international price about 4.5-fold, 
says a commission report heard by the cabinet today. According 
to the commission, Bulgaria would lose about 10 billion leva by 
the year 2005 by using the more expensive local product. 
  The commission suggested three schemes for utilizing the 
uranium concentrate. The first one envisages that it be sold at 
international market prices, the second that it be stored in 
special depots and the third that it be processed to use in 
Bulgarian nuclear reactors. 
  Yet taking into account Bulgaria has no technology to 
process 
the concentrate into fuel and that current storage methods turn 
the ore into a potential environmental threat, the commission 
recommends to sell abroad. The Council of Ministers would 
further on select the export agents.

  [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- The Podkrepa Labour 
Confederation (Podkrepa) thoroughly disapproves the draft budget 
proposed by the government, mainly because it has provided no 
guarantees for the collection of revenue, Dr. Konstantin 
Trenchev, president of Podkrepa, said at a briefing today. The 
budget version submitted to parliament has been proposed by the 
cabinet off its own bat without even showing it to the trade 
unions, Dr. Trenchev said. According to him, the draft budget 
assigns health care, education and culture the role of beggars. 
The Podkrepa Coordinating Council is categorical that the state 
will by no means be able to do well with such a budget in 1994, 
Dr. Trenchev stressed. 
  One of the demands made by the Confederation of Independent 
Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) on the government is that the 
budget be revised after the first half of the year, Prof. 
Krustyu Petkov, president of KNSB, said at yesterday's briefing 
of the other influential trade union amalgamation. In his 
opinion, the budget update is necessary because on the one hand 
the draft budget framework is artificial, and the government has 
done nothing to match projected expenditure to actual 
requirement on the other. Further on, there is nothing to 
guarantee that the collection of revenue would be most 
successful than last year; in addition, the projections of 
parties, trade unions, the government and the International 
Monetary Fund concerning this country's financial prospects are 
entirely different, the KNSB leader said. Following the budget 
update, income policy negotiations should be opened again. 
Otherwise the whole system of incomes adjustment to inflation 
will collapse and the KNSB will have to resort to forcing 
methods, the trade union functionary said. 
  The people of the miners federations may use "unconventional 
methods" of protest to defend their very biological survival, 
Dr. Trenchev told the participants in today's briefing. 
Podkrepa is not inclined to accept, as a member of the National 
Council for Tripartite Cooperation (comprising representatives 
of employers, trade unions and the government), a rise in 
electricity prices before the government signs the general 
agreement with the trade unions on salaries in the 
state-financed sector and other social issues which has been 
worked on since December last year (when miners staged 
nation-wide strike actions), he said. Podkrepa may decide to 
launch new strikes, but the government is on the wane anyway and 
will probably fall by the end of February, the trade union 
leader said. 
  If Prof. Lyuben Berov's cabinet ignores the KNSB stand on 
the 
government-proposed increase of the prices of energy sources, at 
its meeting on February 3 the KNSB Coordinating Council will 
adopt a decision for nation-wide protest actions, including 
civil boycott of the new prices, KNSB President Krustyu Petkov 
told journalists yesterday. "I don't like those threats in the 
least," he said, commenting on yesterday's statement by Deputy 
Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev who said that the government 
would not tolerate any civil disobedience and would sue 
instigators. The cabinet may fall, but the KNSB will not 
contribute to it, being concerned over the possible consequences 
for the population, Prof. Petkov stressed. 
  No political force is interested in new elections at the 
moment, Prof. Petkov said, commenting on Prime Minister Berov's 
statement of January 25 that if the budget was not passed by 
mid-February, early parliamentary elections would be inevitable. 
However, the KNSB would be compelled to agree to the holding of 
early elections by purely economic considerations, the KNSB 
leader said. 
  A caretaker cabinet can blow up political life in the 
country, Dr. Trenchev observed at today's briefing. The 
Podkrepa leader believes that parliamentary elections are the 
sole democratic and reasonable way out of the present situation 
in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariya Barutchieva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- Lack of markets, the 
enterprises' low adaptability to free-market conditions, and a 
delay in privatization and structural adjustment caused a 
shrinkage in production and sales in 1993, Dimitur Fratev, 
spokesman for the National Statistical Institute (NSI) and head 
of the NSI Finance and Lending Statistics Department, told BTA. 
Significantly, the share of private sector production and sales 
increased in 1993. Private sector output, excluding farming, 
rose 22 percent. 
  Production dropped about 8 percent (excluding agriculture), 
the drop in the state sector alone being 10 percent, Mr. Fratev 
told a news conference today. Industrial output dropped 10 
percent from 1992 and sales went down 9 percent. The shrinkage 
in production was greatest in the food, machine engineering and 
textile industries. A total 8 percent growth in production was 
reported in power engineering, ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy, and the chemical and oil-processing industries, 
which account for 45 percent of the aggregate output. 
  The private sector accounted for about 4 percent of 
industrial output in 1993. Sales in the private sector exceeded 
9 billion leva (3.5 percent of industrial sales), a 29 percent 
rise over 1992 at comparable prices. At 57 percent the share of 
the private sector was biggest in retail trade, up from 46 
percent in 1992, an increase by nearly one quarter, Mr. Fratev 
added. 
  Inflation dropped 15.6 percent, from 79.5 percent in 1992 to 
63.9 percent in 1993. Last year inflation began to be computed 
on a different basis from the 1990-92 period, when commodity 
turnover was the key indicator. The consumer price index, 
adopted as a key indicator of inflation in 1993, is calculated 
on the basis of monthly observations of the actual retail prices 
of a basket of 1,400 commodities and services. Food prices went 
up by an average 60.38 percent, non-foods 55.94 percent, and 
services 93.66 percent. Heating and energy outlays accounted for 
about 4 percentage points of the total consumer price increase. 
  The upward trend of redundancies in the state and 
cooperative 
sector persisted in 1993, Mr. Fratev said. The employment 
figure for the state and cooperative sector (excluding 
agriculture) was 1,322,000, a drop of over 10 percent (about 
152,000 persons) on 1992. Private sector employees numbered 
750,000. The latest figures (by September 30, 1993) show 
unemployment in Bulgaria at 814,000, including 50,000 pensioners 
and 14,000 students seeking jobs. 
  State and cooperative enterprises' obligations amounted to 
167 billion leva by September 30, 1993, as against 125 billion 
in 1992. 
  NSI forecasts do not envisage GDP growth in 1994.

  [Text] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov assessed as extremely successful 
the visit to Kuwait by a Bulgarian parliamentary delegation 
headed by him. 
  On his return today, Mr. Yordanov said the delegation had 
been received by top state officials, Kuwait's Amir Shaykh Jabir 
al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, Crown Prince and Prime Minister 
Shaykh Sa'ad al-'Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah, and the speaker of 
the National Assembly. He said the Bulgarian MP's had been 
warmly greeted at the Kuwaiti Parliament. 
  They all stressed the significant role played by Bulgaria 
and 
the democratic forces in particular in support of Kuwait's cause 
during the Iraqi aggression, Mr. Yordanov said. 
  Asked by BTA whether Kuwaiti businessmen were ready to 
invest 
in Bulgaria, Mr. Yordanov stressed they were showing interest 
but Bulgaria had to remove certain obstacles. "We are the ones 
who lack a successful policy of attracting foreign investment," 
he said. 
  Mr. Yordanov pointed out the sides had reached full 
understanding over the entry into Kuwait of more Bulgarian 
engineering and construction firms, as well as of food makers.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
considers the fulfilling of the January 14 trilateral 
declaration by the presidents of the United States, Russia and 
Ukraine on removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine a significant 
step towards the strengthening of European stability and 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world. 
  In a statement given to CTK today, the Ministry praises the 
attitude by Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk and expresses 
its support of Kravchuk's efforts at attaining the passage of 
the document by the Ukrainian Parliament. 
  Since its birth on January 1, 1993, the Czech Republic has 
been striving to establish advantageous and long-term relations 
with Ukraine. By this it wants to contribute to strengthening 
Ukrainian statehood, which it views as an important condition of 
European security, Ministry Spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 27 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys confirmed to CTK today that three Czech UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protection Forces] soldiers arrested on the 
Austrian-Czech border Wednesday [26 January] for alleged weapons 
smuggling were not carrying six hand grenades or any explosives, 
as had been reported. 
  What they were carrying, Baudys said, was one (functional) 
trophy pistol and a fake grenade with no fuse or charge. The 
soldiers were travelling with their unit by bus back to the 
Czech Republic for their regular leave when a 60-man Austrian 
anti-terrorist commando group stopped the unit's two buses at 
the Wullovitz-Dolni Dvoriste border crossing, removed the three 
soldiers, questioned them, and handed them several hours later 
to Czech authorities in Dolni Dvoriste. The other 67 soldiers 
cleared customs with no problem. 
  Baudys said the raid had apparently been intended to 
intercept someone else and probably been prepared in advance, 
since accompanying the commandos were Austrian journalists and 
TV crews. 
  He admitted that the three soldiers had committed an 
offence, 
"but it doesn't deserve the dramatic antics of the whole 
situation and with which it was carried by the media." 
  The three are now in Cesky Krumlov, south Bohemia -- where 
Czech UNPROFOR troops are trained -- awaiting a decision by 
military police and state representatives on their fate. 
  On Wednesday an Austrian rapid deployment team stopped 
another bus of Czech UNPROFOR soldiers heading for Vienna. 
According to the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY (APA), they found a 
handgun, two clips and 40 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov 
machine gun. 
  According to Jaromir Novotny, director of the Czech Defence 
Ministry's Foreign Affairs Section, no soldiers were questioned 
and the bus was allowed to reach the Czech Republic. He could 
not confirm the discovery of the weapons as he had not received 
an official Austrian report, he said.

  [Text] Prague, January 28 (CTK) -- The Committee for the 
Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS) has called for the 
dismissal of Justice Minister Jiri Novak, accusing him of not 
sufficiently purging the judiciary of judges who breached human 
rights before the November 1989 revolution with their unjust 
verdicts. 
  In the past four years, the overall state of the judiciary, 
the prosecutors' offices and of the prison service has not 
changed much, and representatives of the former regime continue 
to exercise their influence in these areas, VONS says in an open 
letter sent to Novak today, the content of which they revealed 
at a press conference. 
  Representatives said they had been asking Novak to purge the 
judiciary in accordance with the law. They gave him their notes 
on 42 judges who had life appointments but who before November 
1989 had "seriously and often more than once breached basic 
human rights by unjustly giving them unconditional prison 
sentences." 
  The list was then reduced to 24 because some of the judges 
have left the judiciary. After negotiations with Novak ten more 
were removed from the list, but VONS insists that the remaining 
14 should leave the judiciary. 
  VONS is an organization founded by 16 charter 77 signatories 
in 1978 to protest against political imprisonments. Among them 
was Vaclav Havel, who has since 1989 asked for his membership to 
be revoked. In 1989 the organization had 32 members, now it has 
23. 
  VONS representative and Vice Chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) Vaclav Benda said that he had told 
Premier Vaclav Klaus several days ago about VONS' demand that 
Novak be removed. Klaus is chairman of the Civic Democratic 
Party, the party which on the basis of coalition agreements was 
given the position of justice minister to fill. Klaus had not 
commented on his proposal, Benda said. 
  VONS committee members said that Interior Minister Jiri 
Ruml, 
a VONS member, had also been informed of the organization's 
request.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 28 (CTK) -- The Environment Ministry is 
willing, on condition that terms stipulated by Minister 
Frantisek Benda are met, to consider completing the Temelin 
nuclear plant and bringing into operation, the Ministry's 
Spokesman Frantisek Stanek told CTK today. 
  Stanek was commenting in reaction to the decision by the 
American EX-IM Bank to provide guarantees for the completion of 
Temelin. 
  Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia, 
started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been 
strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially 
in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are 
involved in the project. 
  The Ministry's positive attitude is conditioned by the 
passing of a nuclear law, an energy law, and laws on the plant's 
decommissioning, insurance against possible nuclear damage and 
state supervision of nuclear material, Stanek announced. 
  The EX-IM Bank does not observe the rules it requires in 
other cases, Jindrich Petrlik, a representative of the 
environmental groups Duha (Rainbow) and Deti Zeme (Children of 
the Earth), stated. The projects for which the loans were 
granted should be in line with Americans standards, he said, 
adding that Temelin plant does not comply with them. 
  The activities against granting the guarantees for the loan 
to complete Temelin plant will be continued also in the United 
States and Greenpeace hopes that the congress will not recommend 
providing guarantee for the loan, Vera Frankova, the Greenpeace 
spokeswoman, told CTK. 
  The board of the EX-IM Bank approved guarantees for loans on 
American export worth $317 million for the completion and 
modernization of the safety equipment for Temelin plant, 
originally Soviet-designed. 
  The EX-IM Bank must hand the whole project to congress which 
has 35 days to assess any transaction of the bank regarding 
nuclear energy before.

  [Text] Prague Jan 31 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's foreign 
trade turnover was 10.6 percent higher in 1993 than it was in 
1992, according to the preliminary results of a Czech Statistics 
Office (CSU) study. 
  Czech imports increased by 2.7 percent and exports by 20.0 
percent last year. The only countries with whom Czech trade 
decreased were those of the former Soviet Union. Czech Republic 
exports and imports increased to all other countries. 
  A total of 58.0 percent of Czech trade in 1993 was made with 
countries with mature market economies, while 8.7 percent was 
exchanged with former members of the Soviet Union and 6.1 
percent with other Eastern European states in economic 
transformation. 
  The Czech Republic's trade surplus was 5.9 billion crowns 
($200 million) last year. The largest surplus was recorded with 
developing countries (13.6 billion crowns, $453 million), while 
the surplus with European Union states was 7.5 billion crowns 
($250 million). The Czech Republic's largest trade deficit was 
with countries of the former Soviet Union ($19.8 billion, $660 
million). 
  Czech trade with Slovakia was at a surplus balance of 9.6 
billion crowns ($320 million).

  [Text] Budapest, 31 January (MTI) -- The ruling Party of 
Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) holds the view that 
sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary may succeed in 
normalizing bilateral relations in the soonest possible time, 
including the conclusion of a basic treaty. 
  This is contained in the message PDSR Chairman Oliviu 
Gherman 
has sent to the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). The message 
was handed over to MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn by a delegation led 
by Romanian Ambassador Ion Donca today [31 January]. Horn told 
MTI that the message was a reaction to former MSZP statements on 
Hungary's relations with its neighbours. 
  Signed by Gherman, the message stresses that the PDSR met 
with a great deal of satisfaction the Hungarian socialists' 
position calling for a historical reconciliation between Hungary 
and its neighbours, including Romania. 
  In Gherman's view, this reconciliation should be confirmed 
by 
a basic treaty, which would recognize the current borders and, 
on the basis of international norms, contain mutual commitments 
to guaranteeing minority rights. 
  The settlement and development of relations would promote 
the 
two countries' integration into the Euro-Atlantic system and 
facilitate their democratic transformation, runs the message. 
  In reply to it, Horn confirmed that the MSZP was pressing 
for 
Budapest and Bucharest to conclude a basic treaty, declaring 
both the inviolability of borders and the full enforcement of 
ethnic minority rights. 
  In the MSZP's view, Hungary and Romania are interdependent 
as 
far as their relationship with European integration 
organizations is concerned. Thus they should not act against 
one another, on the contrary, they should make every possible 
joint effort to enforce their interests in this field.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 January (MTI) -- The policy 
represented by Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula 
Horn differs from that of the Hungarian Government, Ferenc 
Oberfrank, cabinet chief of the foreign minister, told MTI 
tonight. His statement came as a follow-up to the message 
Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the Party of Social Democracy of 
Romania, sent to the MSZP. (The message and Horn's verbal 
answer were covered earlier tonight.) 
  The message, handed over by Ambassador Ion Donca, refers to 
"sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary which may succeed in 
normalizing bilateral relations." 
  "Whom can we consider Hungary's sober-minded forces that may 
guarantee the success mentioned in the letter," Oberfrank asked. 
  "Do the two countries need a treaty to settle their 
relations 
or do they need citizens who are satisfied and have rights, no 
matter whether they belong to a minority or the majority? Why 
do both sides consider the border issue timely?" the cabinet 
chief asked. 
  "It is contrary to international diplomatic practice that an 
ambassador hands over a party message and comments it," 
Oberfrank said.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 Jan (MTI) -- Sanctions imposed on the 
former Yugoslavia have failed to meet expectations. On the 
contrary, they have hit the civilian population, especially in 
Vojvodina, extremely hard, deprived the warring parties of equal 
opportunities and caused Hungary's economy a loss of $1.3 
billion. For this reason, the embargo policy needs to be 
reconsidered and, if need be, a new sanctions system has to be 
introduced, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Deputy 
Chairman Gyorgy Csoti of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum 
(HDF) told reporters in Budapest on Monday [31 January]. 
  Csoti stressed that, despite the ensuing losses, Hungary 
will 
continue to observe the sanctions imposed by the international 
community. He denied that Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade 
has anything to do with calls for reconsidering the embargo. 
  "Hungary has nothing to talk about with Serbia concerning 
the 
embargo, nor should the lifting of sanctions be initiated by 
Budapest alone," csoti added. "It is mainly a question of 
effectiveness. The embargo has proven futile so far," he said. 
He admitted that he has no idea what kind of a new system 
should replace the present sanctions. 
  Csoti recalled that Hungary's association agreement with the 
European Union will come into effect tomorrow, opening new 
prospects for the country's development. He proposed that 
Budapest immediately start preparations for becoming a 
full-fledged EU member, and file its application as soon as 
possible so that genuine talks can start in 1996. Csoti 
considers it important for Hungary to get involved in the work 
of the EU's political institutions. In addition, Hungary should 
press for the Western European Union to grant a status 
corresponding to associate membership for Hungary and Poland in 
its June general assembly, he said. 
  Evaluating Hungary's relationship with neighbouring 
countries, Csoti said that bilateral ties with four of Hungary's 
seven neighbours are free of problems, and there are no 
obstacles to the development of friendly contacts. 
  Unfortunately, this is not true for ties with Slovakia, 
Romania and Serbia. Hungary's foreign policy towards these 
states should seek historical reconciliation, he said. However, 
good relations are only conceivable if ethnic minorities are 
allowed to exercise their right of self-determination and their 
collective rights, Csoti said. He mentioned South Tyrol and the 
Swedish minority in Finland as proper examples. 
  Csoti pointed out that the Hungarian minorities living in 
neighbouring countries have declared their efforts for autonomy 
in a responsible and civilized way which is recognized by the 
world public. 
  In Csoti's view, Hungary should always stand prepared to 
hold 
talks and forge agreements with its neighbours, but this policy 
should not go to the minorities' detriment. "This does not mean 
that Hungary gives an ultimatum to its neighbours. We only 
expect Slovakia and Romania to observe the rather lenient 
recommendations of the Council of Europe," Csoti said.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 January (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry published through MTI the following government 
statement today: 
  "The Government of the Republic of Hungary attributes 
special 
importance to the coming into force of the European Agreement on 
February 1, 1994. The agreement implies that Hungary, 
undergoing a process of integration into Europe, establishes a 
new and more advanced type of relationship with the European 
Union and its member states. 
  "Now that the European agreement comes into force, the 
government considers it necessary to reaffirm that integration 
into Europe is a historical command for Hungary, a command 
stemming from its traditions of thousands of years. There is no 
alternative to this process, which became possible only after 
the change in regime. 
  "This agreemeent provides a favorable framework for the 
acceleration of economic and social modernization. 
  "Hungary's integration into Europe is one of the most 
efficient safeguards for the country's security. 
  "Accordingly, joining the European Union as a full member is 
a strategic objective, and a foreign, security, and economic 
policy priority for the Hungarian government. 
  "Attaining this aim is a national program which determines 
Hungary's internal development and the country's place and role 
in Europe. 
  "To realize this national program, the government strives to 
exploit all the possibilities offered by the European Agreement, 
and develop constructive cooperation with the European Union 
member countries and other associate countries in Eastern and 
Central Europe. 
  "The Hungarian Government is aware that reaching the level 
of 
development required for integration is a complex task which 
necessitates further significant steps in economic 
transformation and the related social care. 
  "Fulfilling the economic policy tasks aimed at meeting the 
requirements of integration is a precondition for the 
modernization of the Hungarian national economy and the 
country's long-term stability amd social peace. 
  "In this effort of historic importance, the government 
reckons with the creative contribution and support of all 
citizens. 
  "The government expresses the conviction that Hungary will 
strengthen and enrich the process of European unification with 
its political, historical and cultural heritage forming an 
integral part of European heritage, national characteristics, 
internal development since the change in regime, and 
contribution to stability in Europe."

  [Text] Budapest, 29 January (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] has become a modern people's party, Chairman 
Ivan Peto said on Saturday [29 January], the second day of the 
program forming delegate assembly, in the Budapest Convention 
Center. 
  Peto was of the opinion that the SZDSZ is clearly in the 
middle of the political arena, the Federation of Young Democrats 
is somewhat to its right, with the parties of the government 
coalition still farther right. The Hungarian Socialist Party is 
to the left of the party. 
  The chairman of the largest opposition party spoke in detail 
about the party's election strategy. He mentioned as the first 
and most important basic principle to safeguard the cleanness of 
the elections. Peto also said the SZDSZ would refrain from a 
negative campaign and mud-slinging, focussing on the party's 
program instead of criticizing the programs and political 
activity of the other parties. 
  The SZDSZ chairman said the 1994 elections will basically be 
of a different nature and content than in 1990, at which time 
the change in political system was at stake, while this spring 
voters will have to choose between democratic parties, by 
considering the success rate of governmental work over the past 
four years. The most important goal for the SZDSZ is to achieve 
a liberal majority, and with this to take over from the current 
government coalition. 
  As regards political cooperation with other parties, the 
agreement concluded with the young democrats remains guiding for 
the SZDSZ, and it will definitely respect it, Peto said. The 
Hungarian Socialist Party is a political and election opponent 
of the free democrats, he added, who must be defeated at the 
elections. 
  With respect to the situation in the public service media, 
Peto said the SZDSZ is not ready to participate in a "media law 
show" that sanctifies the current condition.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 27 -- Minister of Defence Piotr 
Kolodziejdzyk has declared he wants to put an end to the "war 
over frequencies" waged by his ministry with the National Radio 
and Television Council (KRRIT), according to parliamentary 
Deputy Marek Siwiec, a member of the council. 
  Siwiec was speaking to reporters on Thursday following a 
meeting with Kolodziejdzyk. The meeting had been arranged after 
Siwiec had submitted a formal question in parliament. However, 
Siwiec added that he was still waiting for a formal reply from 
the minister. 
  The minister informed Siwiec about the measures to be taken 
by the Armed Forces in order to hand over to civilian users a 
number of frequencies used by the Air Force telecommunications 
services. However, according to Siwiec, Kolodziejdzyk had argued 
that the problem could be successfuly overcome only on condition 
that the Army received an extra 2 trillion zlotys (ca. 90 m 
dollars) to finance necessary technical restructuring.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 28 -- According to the Central 
Statistical Office (GUS) the Gross National Product (GNP) in 
1993 increased by 4 per cent, the industry and agriculture 
production went up whereas the unemployment figures did not 
decrease and inflation was still high. Also the purchasing 
power of payments declined, the GUS Deputy President Roman 
Sawinski said on Friday. 
  In comparison with 1992 the sales of industry went up by 6.2 
per cent but were still lower than in 1989 and 1990. The 
highest sales were recorded in the printing, transport, 
electro-technological, electronic and clothing industries while 
coal-mining, energy and leather industries noted a decrease in 
production. The GUS data also indicate that generally companies 
became more profitable by decreasing their costs. 
  In 1993 the housing construction suffered a serious 
breakdown, it build 35 per cent flats less than in 1992. 
  The agriculture produce increased by 2.2 per cent and the 
total area of uncultivated arable land decreased from 12 to 7 
per cent. In the eighties only 1 per cent of arable land was 
left fallow. 
  In 1993 prices went up by 35.3 per cent. Such a high 
inflation rate was influenced mainly by hikes in gas, energy, 
transport, telecommunications and fuel prices. Although the 
purchasing power of payments declined by 1.8 per cent and of 
pensions by 2.6 per cent, private consumption rose, which means 
that poles did bigger shopping taking loans or diminishing their 
savings. 
  Unemployment figures were still high in 1993 and in December 
the unemployment rate amounted to 15.7 per cent. There were 
2,889,600 unemployed people registered in job centres. The 
highest unemployment rate was recorded in the northern provinces 
of Koszalin (28.7 per cent), Suwalki (28.6 per cent), Olsztyn 
(27.8 per cent), Slupsk (27.3 per cent) and Elblag (26.8 per 
cent). 
  The budget deficit was lower than it was envisaged in the 
budget law and amounted to 44 trillion zlotys (over 2 billion 
U.S. dollars). The budget revenue (459 trillion zlotys) was 
higher by 6 per cent than envisaged as the state got more money 
from income tax and customs duties and the budget expenditure 
(503 trillion zlotys) was lower by 2.3 per cent. 
  Imports exceeded exports by 3.5 billion dollars, which, 
according to Sawinski, was connected with the increase of 
imports by 47 per cent in comparison with 1992 before the 
introduction of VAT [Value Added Tax]. In the same time exports 
went up only by 24.1 per cent.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/1/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu remains open to the variants of forming the 
executive resulted from the dialogue among the political 
parties, said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu at a press 
conference on Friday [28 January]. It rests with the parties, 
the spokesman said, to carry out negotiations among themselves 
in order to find the best ways of forming a parliamentary 
majority or an eventual executive team. "If the outcome of the 
negotiations is a parliamentary coalition larger than the one 
supporting the current government, the president will salute 
that," said Chebeleu. 
  Government reshuffling is a prerogative of the prime 
minister 
and he may do it whenever he sees it as necessary, said the 
spokesman. 
  The next week visit to Bucharest by the two co-presidents of 
the peace conference on former Yugoslavia was appreciated by the 
presidency spokesman as the result of the interest constantly 
shown by Romania in supporting the settlement of the Yugoslav 
crisis. The role of the Geneva conference as well as of the 
neighbouring countries is to support the efforts made by the 
countries involved in the settling of the crisis as a viable 
solution can emerge only from within the former Yugoslavia, the 
spokesman said and further added: "We can only contribute to 
the creation of an external climate favourable to the dialogue." 
Romania, as a neighbour, is interested in the settlement of the 
problems in the zone as soon as possible, leaving out the use of 
force means. 
  The Partnership for Peace is, the spokesman said, an offer 
made by the NATO to the Eastern countries, an offer which we 
have saluted. Romania's linking to the Euro-Atlantic structures 
and the NATO is an important step toward a strengthened security 
for Romania. It is a success for the Romanian diplomacy as the 
Partnership for Peace matches our constant approaches with 
respect to the role of NATO in this part of Europe, namely, that 
of not making discriminations with regard to the security of the 
countries in the zone. This point of view has prevailed in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said the Romanian presidency 
spokesman. 
  Presidential spokesman, Ambassador Traian Chebeleu also 
referred his news conference on January 28 to President Ion 
Iliescu's visit in Timisoara and, before that, in Focsani, 
regarding a pointless protest by the county branch of the Alfa 
Trade Union Cartel, and, respectively, the president's contacts 
with private companies, as seen by an EXPRES MAGAZIN journalist. 
  The presidential spokesman recalled to the attending 
journalists the fact that "during almost all his visits in the 
country the president inquired about and visited private 
economic enterprises." Ambassador Chebeleu referred in that 
context to the Romanian head of state's meeting with Romanian 
businessmen on November 30, 1993, his attendance of the "1993 
Private Companies' Top" meeting, where he made an extensive 
address, as well as to the fact that on his trips abroad, when 
he was accompanied by businessmen, the Romanian president 
included every time also representatives of private Romanian 
firms.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 29/1/1994 -- Teodor Melescanu, 
the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, was on an official 
visit to Morocco on 26-28 January in response to an invitation 
from his Moroccan counterpart. 
  Foreign Minister Melescanu had talks with A. Filali, 
minister 
of state and foreign minister of the Kingdom of Morocco about 
the present stage and the prospects of the Romanian-Moroccan 
relations, and about international and regional matters of joint 
interest. Minister Melescanu met with the president of Morocco's 
Chamber of Representatives, with the Moroccan ministers of 
mining and energy, public works, and cultural affairs. 
  The talks with the Moroccan personalities gave the two sides 
the opportunity to express their wish that partnership be the 
basic principle of the future development of their bilateral 
relations. To this effect the possibility was examined of taking 
actions apt to render the Romanian-Moroccan relations a 
privileged nature. 
  The exchange of opinions on international and regional 
issues 
revealed similitude or closeness in assessing the developments 
in the areas in which the two countries are located and on a 
wider international plane. 
  Concomitantly with the visit to Morocco of the Romanian 
minister of foreign affairs, the Romanian-Moroccan Joint 
Governmental Committee for Economic, Technical and Scientific 
Cooperation held its 8th session under the chairmanship of the 
two countries' foreign ministers. The committee agreed on 
cooperation projects in port facility development, drilling, 
energy, mining, agriculture, professional training. Both sides 
admitted that the trade exchanges had been below their economic 
potential and agreed to favor direct contacts between public and 
private businesses, between medium and small ventures. 
  At the end of the official visit to Morocco and of the 8th 
session of the joint committee, the Romanian and Moroccan 
foreign ministers signed several bilateral juridical documents: 
the convention for the mutual guaranteeing of investments, the 
statement on establishing regular consultations between the two 
foreign ministries, the programme of the cultural accord for the 
years 1994 and 1995.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/1/1994 -- The national 
federation of the transport unions, Elcatel, called Monday, 31 
January, a protest rally in front of the transport ministry 
building to express their dissatisfaction with the attitude 
taken by the Romanian National Railway Corporation (SNCFR) and 
the relevant ministry to the "serious problems" railway 
employees have to endure and with the hazards arising from such 
an attitude. 
  Among the reasons of discontent are the delay in the debate 
and passing of the railway transportation bill, the persisting 
economic blockage, and the compensation by the government of 
railway tariffs. 
  Should their claims be disregarded, Elcatel promised 
concerted strikes on 15 February, to be then extended to a 
general strike on 17 February.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 29 (CTK) -- Today's Slovak dailies 
concern themselves primarily with the dispute between President 
Michal Kovac and Premier Vladimir Meciar, which prevented the 
signing of a Slovak-Polish trade agreement during the 
president's visit to Warsaw this past week. 
  "President Kovac's visit to Poland stayed under the shadow 
of 
domestic disputes," writes the independent daily NARODNA OBRODA. 
"At the beginning of the visit many Polish officials dropped 
remarks that in the case of the year-old state (Slovakia) it was 
necessary to show some understanding for everything," the daily 
writes. "Officially they remained diplomatically polite even 
after the mysterious elimination of Economics Minister Jan Ducky 
from the delegation, after the announced and then unsigned 
(trade) agreement, and especially after the explosion of the 
'Panic letter' affair. Press reactions and indications from 
backstage have given rise to the impression that Slovak politics 
is less reminiscent of a hopeful youth than of an irresponsible 
adolescent." 
  The left-leaning PRAVDA calls the results of the 
presidential 
visit less than satisfying. It had been indicated beforehand 
that at least one agreement would be signed, but in the end 
nothing was even initialed, and so Polish journalists lost 
interest. "If it had stopped there, it could have been said that 
it was just an ordinary, routine visit," the daily writes. "Only 
when the affair with the alleged letter from Panic to our 
premier blew up on the first day of the president's stay in 
Warsaw did things start to get more serious." 
  The paper adds ironically that "for the visibility of 
Slovakia it was a nice piece of work," but the conclusions the 
average person will draw from it are something "of which we 
should take not the slightest bit of notice." 
  The trade union daily PRACA writes that "relations between 
the head of state and the chief of the cabinet and their staffs 
cannot be like those between quarreling and outraged spouses. 
Both sides will say that the other is at fault. But the end 
result will be that the citizen draws a picture which disgusts 
him, and which brings him not only illusions, but motivation. 
(Meanwhile) His interests remain somewhere off to the side." 
  Most regrettable is that the source of friction is foreign 
policy and the presentation of the state, the paper concludes: 
"The disoriented citizen shakes his head, all the more baffled 
when he sees that the fights are taking place not between 
government circles and the opposition, but between those who 
should without question be pulling together toward the same end. 
It is only natural to ask: Who should I trust at all...? It's 
no wonder public opinion polls show that the largest group of 
people by far is those who would rather not vote for anyone. 
All this theater would possibly be funny if it weren't so sad."

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 27 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament 
today ratified the treaty between Slovakia and Ukraine on a 
common border and cooperation in questions. The treaty was 
signed on October 14, 1993. The treaty confirms the current 
border, and provides for the marking of the border on the 
terrain and for maintenance of the markers. It also provides 
for the creation of a joint commission to monitor compliance 
with the treaty. It will remain in force for ten years and 
supersedes a similar treaty between Czechoslovakia and the 
Soviet Union signed in 1973, when Ukraine was still a Soviet 
Republic.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 27 (MTI) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic received Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky in Belgrade on Thursday. Jeszenszky arrived in 
Belgrade for an official visit, at the invitation of Yugoslav 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. 
  Speaking to the press after the talks, Jeszenszky said that 
Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians (DCVH), was a welcome presence at the 
talks. He said topics discussed included bilateral relations, 
economic problems and ways to develop economic cooperation. 
  The two sides agreed that both Hungary and Yugoslavia should 
form bridges with Europe and the Middle East -- their geographic 
location should be utilized. Jeszenszky added that a priority 
consideration for Hungary is that the Hungarians in Vojvodina 
should have a secure future. 
  "Along with the presence of Andras Agoston, another 
encouragement was the fact that President Milosevic said the 
Vojvodina Hungarians will enjoy full equality. He also said 
they can and will have institutions which they deem necessary 
for themselves. This is significant not only for our two 
countries, but can serve as a model settlement for the 
ethnically mixed region," Jeszenszky said. 
  Milosevic also said the Serbian Government does not tolerate 
any actions that could lead to citizens fleeing their 
birthplaces. The main problem today is of an economic nature, 
and this is largely the consequence of the sanctions. 
  Jeszenszky said he is not competent to judge whether the 
conditions offered will be sufficient for peace in Bosnia, but 
he voiced the hope that the proposal tabled by the European 
Union, based on the Kinkel-Juppe proposal, could bring an end to 
the conflict. Jeszenszky said the Serbian side is committed to 
meet the expectations and the motions. 
  The Hungarian foreign minister discussed the so-called 
Krajina issue with the Serbian president, and the matter of 
territories near Hungary, such as Baranya. 
  "Large numbers of refugees have arrived in Hungary from 
there, fleeing the war and threats by people who forced them to 
leave. I expressed the hope that these people will be able to 
return to their homes as soon as possible," Jeszenszky said. 
  He also voiced the hope that major facilities like the Adria 
oil pipeline will again become operational. "It is important 
for hostilities to finally come to an end here, not only for the 
two countries, but for all Europe as well," the foreign minister 
said. 
  Jeszenszky again stated that Hungary would gladly support 
the 
lifting of sanctions, but this can only take place if Serbia 
wins approval from the international community, which can be 
achieved only through their actions. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said his talks 
with Foreign Minister Jeszenszky touched upon all walks of 
bilateral relations and international life. 
  "During our talks on Friday, we should deal more with 
bilateral relations. With the approach of an end to the 
south-Slav crisis, it will be possible to expand relations with 
the neighbouring countries. Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is the 
first arrival, and his visit indicates we have arrived at the 
start of normalizing relations with the neighbouring countries," 
the Yugoslav foreign minister said.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 28 (MTI) -- Foreign Ministers 
Geza Jeszenszky of Hungary and Vladislav Jovanovic of 
Yugoslavia, as well as Andras Agoston, president of the 
Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina, gave statements 
during the farewell ceremony of the Hungarian delegation at the 
Belgrade airport on Friday. 
  In an interview with the correspondent of MTI and Hungarian 
Radio, Jeszenszky said that talks went beyond the expectations 
of cautious optimism. The leaders of Serbia and Yugoslavia are 
ready to fulfil the wishes of the international community, yet 
how these are realized in Sarajevo and Bosnia is a different 
matter. 
  "It is even more important for us that not merely the 
readiness, but the will also exists to improve and settle 
bilateral relations on the part of both sides, and this can take 
place amidst the current upholding of sanctions. The end of 
sanctions, after fulfilling the requirements of the 
international community, is in the interest of all," Jeszenszky 
said. 
  "There were talks about high-level negotiations, but the 
priority now is practical steps. Serbian President Milosevic 
reported on the situation of Hungarians in Vojvodina, and I am 
curious to see how the promises are fulfilled in the future. 
This theme is on the agenda of talks between Serbian leadership 
and Vojvodina Hungarians, however, I indicated that the 
legitimate representatives of the Vojvodina Hungarians enjoy the 
support of the Hungarian Government," Foreign Minister 
Jeszenszky said. 
  Speaking to MTI, president of the Democratic Community of 
Hungarians in Vojvodina, Andras Agoston, said the meeting held 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forms part of a series 
of consultations which have not yet been concluded. 
  "This means quite a lot for us, as on the one hand they 
recognize us as a political factor, and on the other, we can 
show a responsible approach to Yugoslav politics," Agoston said. 
  In his statement, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic stressed that a political and psychological turn had 
taken place in the Hungarian-Yugoslav talks, which should lead 
to the stabilization of relations, to normalization, and 
ultimately bring peace to the entire region. 
  "Agreement was reached on numerous issues, and we must 
immediately implement these in order to be able to regard these 
talks as genuinely historical later on. Talks covered all 
essential topics, stressing there is a mutual intention for the 
sanctions to be lifted, and for us to prepare expanding 
relations. We agreed to eliminate all phenomena which could 
threaten this process," Jovanovic said.

  [Text] Pristina, January 30 (ATA) -- During their stay in 
Kosova, CSCE representatives and heads of embassies in Belgrade, 
Laura Mirakian (Italy), Dr. Geran Jakobson and Torsten Petre 
(Sweden), who have substituted the observers expelled from 
Kosova last summer, visited the Council for the Defence of Human 
Rights in Pristina. During a talk about the situation of human 
rights in Kosova, CSCE representatives showed interest in the 
political legal proceedings after the arrests among Albanians 
last year as well as the position of the Albanians after the 
measures being adopted in the economic and financial field in 
Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The chairman of the Council for the Defence of Human Rights 
in Pristina, Adem Demaci, reported about the escalation of 
Serbian state repression against unprotected Albanians and added 
that unfortunately international community has not properly 
understood the criminal character of the Serbian regime. Mr. 
Demaci said that through its slow reaction towards the rapid 
Serbian actions, international community has objectively 
supported the aggression. 
  "We do not demand from Europe to send her sons to be killed 
for us. The question is of a military character. Serbia will 
generate war in the region as long as its will be militarily 
stronger. In order to avoid its military superiority, it should 
either be disarmed or others must be armed," Mr. Demaci said. 
  CSCE representatives supported the views presented by M. 
Demaci. They took special interest in the alternative which 
would resolve the crisis. In this context, Mr. Demaci said 
that the military presence of America in Macedonia has prevented 
the spillover of the conflict in the south. But if other 
preventive measures are not taken, the conflict may burst out. 
Serbian acts are irrational.

  [Text] The talks between Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov and Iranian Foreign Minister `Ali Akbar 
Velayati, who is paying an official visit to our country, lasted 
almost two hours. 
  The talk is reported to have focused on bilateral relations 
between the two countries and on economic links, in particular, 
as well as on the possibilities of reviving trade contacts 
between Bulgaria and Iran. This is how Minister Daskalov 
described the intentions expressed in this respect: 
  [Begin Daskalov recording] In this connection we agreed on 
more intensive contacts between our economic ministries. Iran's 
first deputy minister of trade is a member of Mr. Velayati's 
delegation and he is expected to hold meetings at the Ministries 
of Trade, Finance, and Transport, and to visit the Bulgarian 
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, with the purpose of specifying 
the spheres in which we could intensify our trade relations. We 
also discussed some specific trade problems that have emerged in 
our relations. We are also preparing a trade agreement that is 
expected to be signed during the Iranian delegation's visit, as 
soon as our experts have completed their work. We are also 
planning to sign a protocol on cooperation and consultations 
between our two foreign ministers representing the traditional 
form of protocols that our country usually signs. [end 
recording] 
  Mr. Velayati, in turn, specified the spheres of future 
cooperation between the two countries in the following way: 
  [Begin Velayati recording, in English fading into 
announcer-read Bulgarian report] In our discussion with my dear 
colleague, the distinguished foreign minister of Bulgaria, we 
touched upon bilateral, regional, and international problems. 
We expressed our readiness to pursue and intensify the 
traditionally good Bulgarian-Iranian relations in all possible 
spheres, such as trade, economics, and culture. We also pointed 
out the stands of the two countries on the Yugoslav conflict and 
Iran's readiness to support peacemaking actions under the 
UNmaegis, the Iranian guest declared. [end recording]

  [Text] Sofia, Feb. 1, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati Monday voiced readiness of the Islamic countries to 
dispatch peace-keeping forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the 
flag of the United Nations. 
  Speaking to local reporters at the end of the first round of 
talks with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Dascalov, 
Velayati said the forces can play an outstanding role in the 
establishment of peace and tranquillity in the Balkans and 
former Yugoslavia. Velayati who arrived here Monday on an 
official 2-day visit, made the remark in response to a question 
of Bulgarian reporters on the incompetence of the United Nations 
with regard to the Bosnian crisis. 
  He stressed that Iran would not spare any effort for the 
establishment of a just and honorable peace in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Bulgarian Government which used to export a considerable 
amount of goods through former Yugoslavia prior to the arms 
embargo, has asked the U.N. for compensation. 
  A source close to the both sides told IRNA here that the 
Bulgarian foreign minister has expressed deep concern over the 
spread of the war in the Balkans and stressed his country's 
readiness to help establishment of peace in the region through 
international cooperation.

  [Text] Sofia, Feb. 2, IRNA -- Bulgarian President Zhelyu 
Zhelev Tuesday called for promotion of Tehran-Sofia cooperation 
in communication and transportation areas and for the 
establishment of an air link between the two capitals. Zhelev 
made the remark in a meeting with the visiting Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati who arrived here Monday on an 
official visit. An informed source quoted the Bulgarian 
president as saying that implementation of the 
political-economic agreement, to be signed between the two 
countries today, will have positive effects on mutual ties. 
Zhelev also extended an invitation to President Rafsanjani to 
pay an official visit to Bulgaria. 
  Velayati later briefed President Zhelev on the outcome of 
his 
talks with Bulgarian officials. President Zhelev stressed that 
rights of the Bulgarian Muslims were safeguarded in the 
country's constitution. He added that the Bulgarian Muslims 
were holding significant positions in the parliament, government 
and other organizations. 
  The Iranian foreign minister also met with Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov who termed Velayati's visit to Sofia as a turning 
point in mutual ties with Tehran. He said his country welcomed 
an increase in the volume of trade with Iran. The Bulgarian 
official said his country was interested in purchasing more gas 
and oil from Iran and called for more avenues to promote 
bilateral commercial ties. 
  In another development, Velayati discussed mutual ties and 
international developments including the crisis in Bosnia with 
the speaker of Bulgaria's parliament, Aleksander Yordanov. 
  Velayati outlined stands of the Islamic Republic in 
connection with the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and underlined 
the need for urgent measures to establish a just and honorable 
peace in the region. 
  Later, Yordanov awarded Velayati with an honorary decoration 
of the Bulgarian parliament as a sign of parliamentary 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Svetoslav Terziev commentary: "Conventional Handshake"] </F>
  [Text] It is gratifying when the leader of the only 
superpower in the world, namely the President of the United 
States, takes the opportunity to say a few nice words about 
Bulgaria and its domestic policy. President Bill Clinton did so 
while self-appointed pro-American lobbyists in Bulgaria are 
sparing no efforts to convince the United States and the whole 
world that the country is being recommunized and its democratic 
development is lagging behind, after they lost power. 
  It would have been even more gratifying, however, if 
President Clinton's appreciation of Bulgaria's policy in the 
sphere of human rights had not been tainted by the well known 
U.S. condescension, accompanied by encouragement for obedience 
(namely trade without prohibitive customs duties, for example). 
Regardless of Bulgaria's difficult economic situation, it still 
has its pride, and if someone is willing to exchange goods with 
our country, he had better accept us as partners rather than as 
subordinates. 
  Even Russia, which is totally submerged by economic chaos, 
had the dignity to declare, through its ambassador in Washington 
last Tuesday [25 January], that it prefers real material 
assistance to advice on how to run its domestic affairs. 
  Since the beginning of 1990 Bulgaria has received $150 
million from the United States in the form of official financial 
assistance, which amounts to $40 million annually, the U.S. 
Embassy in Sofia has disclosed. This deserves our gratitude, 
but we should admit, in all frankness, that the amount is not 
only far from adequate compared with our country's needs, but 
also far from being overgenerous compared with the financial 
possibilities of the United States. The amount appears even 
more modest compared with Washington's ambition to dictate what 
should be done and how things should be run in Bulgarian 
politics. Once upon a time, the late USSR paid out much more 
for the same prerogative.

  [Text] What the hell can the Union of Democratic Forces 
[SDS] gain from its latest no-confidence motion, considering 
that the cabinet might stumble over a negative vote on the 
budget anyway? 
  The practice of putting forward "no-confidence votes" is by 
no means the result of a long-term, well-considered strategy. 
Regardless of the increasing "Bolshevization" within the SDS, 
the Union has not yet reached the discipline of semi-democratic 
centralism characteristic of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP]. Hence, the decisions of the SDS are usually the results 
of momentary balances of forces within the coalition, of 
opportunistic considerations, or even of mere coincidences. 
  The two gentlemen Filip Dimitrov and Edvin Sugarev are the 
most influential SDS leaders today, and it is they who introduce 
these no-confidence votes (not that this means that the cabinet 
deserves any confidence, as a matter of fact). "Well, let us 
move another no-confidence vote; perhaps we can overthrow the 
government some day or other after all!" -- this is the 
unexpressed motive behind their "strategy." 
  However, some of the SDS deputies are by no means eager for 
new elections (which applies to Parliamentary Chairman Mr. 
Yordanov, who is very concerned about his post, and also to 
numerous undeclared rank and file members, who long for an 
eternal parliament). 
  The "eternal" deputies do not dare openly to declare 
themselves against a course that leads to new elections. Hence, 
they are forced to support the series of no-confidence votes. 
Should the cabinet fall, they too are ready to join the 
"victors" who are driving the SDS toward an election defeat. If 
the cabinet does not fall -- every unsuccessful no-confidence 
vote is likely to prolong their existence as members of 
parliament, which is the most pleasant physical condition for 
them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andor Mandoky, head of the Economic </F>
Committee of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Henrik 
Hammang; place and date not given: "Reevaluted Debt"] 
  [Text] The parties running in the upcoming elections, 
including the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], have 
formulated their economic programs. We asked Andor Mandoky, 
head of the Economic Commmittee of the KDNP, about the Christian 
Democrats' economic concepts. 
  [Hammang] The KDNP often criticized the current 
privatization practice. Will there be any change in this if you 
are part of the government in the next four years too? 
  [Mandoky] We regard privatization as a fundamental issue of 
the new social and economic order. The new structure and the 
functioning of the economy will improve through privatization. 
We formulated our views on the issue at our congress held in 
Godollo in the spring of 1992. We had reservations regarding 
the methods of this process that started before the elections, 
methods that we took over without criticism in order to shape 
our new order. We want an evident list of property, something 
required by law. On the basis of this, we want a systematic 
privatization process, as well as openness, supervision 
possibilities, and the discovery of abuses. We are in favor of 
the emergence of broad strata of owners. We are in favor of 
developing strata of small and medium-size entrepreneurs. 
  [Hammang] Many people claim that only a reform of the state 
administration could lead to real changes in the economy. Do 
you have any relevant concepts in your program? 
  [Mandoky] Our economic program contains the reform of state 
administration, together with a program ensuring an economic 
revival as soon as possible. Experts are currently working on 
this. We think that a rational reduction of expenses in itself 
will not solve the problems of economic crisis and state 
administration. We count much more on the positive effect of an 
increase in production and services. Therefore, we attribute 
great importance to privatization in this respect. It is a 
basic requirement for both domestic and foreign buyers to use 
the property obtained at a favorable cost, rather than reduce 
it, use it up, or take it out. They should create jobs and 
provide services at competitive prices. 
  The useful handling of state property is the other area with 
considerable resources. Saving and operating the viable 
state-owned production capacities for purposes of taxation and 
employment represents the basis of our economic program. The 
resulting positive processes could indirectly help the problems 
facing the budget by increasing the income. 
  [Hammang] One can mostly achieve an increase in income by 
increasing taxes. However, we can no longer follow this road. 
Is there a solution at all? 
  [Mandoky] In our view, for a more proportional tax burden, 
it is necessary to reexamine our taxation system, including a 
shift from income-type taxation to consumer-type taxation, the 
taxation of big properties, and focusing on a family-type 
taxation in the personal income tax. 
  We also think that strengthening the taxation discipline is 
essential for financial stability. Supervision should be 
strengthened in order to discover the hidden incomes. 
Investments and research-development should be encouraged 
through tax allowances, and the tax policy should serve ventures 
that increase investment and create jobs. 
  [Hammang] In addition to helping the ventures, it is 
important to develop a welfare network. Are there any 
possibilities of increasing welfare expenses in the near future? 
  [Mandoky] Welfare expenses are closely connected to the 
economic situation. It was not by accident that we Christian 
Democrats were the first to turn to economic issues, because we 
have a strong commitment to correctly handling the social 
problems. 
  Halting regression and starting an economic revival are the 
basic goals of our economic program. We know that this is a 
process that needs a longer time. Economic revival depends on 
the prevailing economic program and the professional abilities 
serving the implementation of this program. At the moment, it 
is irresponsible to promise an increase in the standard of 
living and to suggest the need to further increase the welfare 
burdens and expenses. We must concentrate all our efforts to 
accelerate the economy and to increase production, services, and 
exports. 
  [Hammang] However, all this is hindered by the debt burden 
left to us by the previous regime and the need to repay the 
interest. 
  [Mandoky] We have repeatedly expressed our position on the 
issue of debt servicing and credits, and this problem makes up 
one chapter of our program. Naturally, we accept the repayment 
of our debts. However, we wonder about the heavy burden of debt 
servicing, a burden that questions our ability to emerge from 
the prevailing economic crisis. Therefore, we think that a 
reexamination of the problem is justified in any case.

<F P=106> ["Al.A."-signed report: "The Ministers Mend What Was </F>
Spoiled by Journalists"] 
  [Text] At the end of last week, Romanian National Defense 
Minister Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu received his 
Bulgarian counterpart, Valentin Aleksandrov. Despite the fact 
that one would expect closer political ties between Romania and 
Bulgaria -- as the two countries are neighbors, they have 
similar domestic problems, and a chance that if they had 
cooperated they would find a way to solve the difficulties 
generated by the crisis situation outside their borders. Except 
for a few random attempts to further their ties, relations 
between the two countries have been characterized by 
indifference, perhaps even competition. 
  The Bulgarian defense minister's visit was due for several 
months, but it was postponed a number of times, although the 
reasons for that had nothing to do with the nature of bilateral 
relations. Merely one week before the meeting of the two 
ministers, a certain suspicion and tension emerged again as a 
consequence of the fact that the Bulgarian press had published 
some false information claiming that Romania had massed troops 
along the common border. 
  However, in Bucharest, the two defense ministers still 
managed to find a common "language." They reasserted their 
consequent support for the political and diplomatic settlement 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and excluded the variant 
of military involvement, which they termed as dangerous for both 
conflict parties [the Bosnian Serbs and the NATO allies acting 
on behalf of the United Nations], because of the high 
probability that, as a consequence of such involvement, the 
conflict would expand. In the same context, the ministers 
agreed that neither country would send troops to join the "blue 
helmets" in former Yugoslavia. Such a decision was only 
natural, whereas the opposite would have been quite unusual, as 
UN peacekeeping operations are never carried out by forces of 
countries that neighbor a conflict region. 
  During the visit, they also signed the Romanian-Bulgarian 
military cooperation accord. Among other things, the accord 
also provides for cooperation in the education and training of 
military personnel, a chapter that, in view of the Partnership 
for Peace, might be equally interesting for both countries.

<F P=106> [Transcript of "exclusive" interview with Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by 
Srdjan Djuric, editor of the Belgrade-based Independent 
Television Studio B: "Brothers, The Russians Are With You"; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] All armies, including NATO, should be withdrawn 
from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The existing 
situation needs to be strengthened, and the Yugoslav peoples 
themselves need to decide about their future. Territories 
populated by Serbs or Croats must stay under the control of 
Serbs or Croats, while the Muslim issue is an artificial one. 
You do not have any Muslims, said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader 
of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, in an exclusive 
interview to Srdjan Djuric, editor of the Eye of the World 
program of Independent Television Studio B. 
  The blockade must be lifted, continued Zhirinovskiy, and 
then 
everything will take a normal course. There will be Slovenia, 
Croatia, and Greater Serbia. And that is it. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, it is all Serbia. Nothing else 
will be necessary. Let there be three states -- Slovenia as one 
entity, then division with Croats -- if they are such great 
Catholics -- and the rest will all be Greater Serbia. Borders 
with Bulgarians, Romania, and Hungary. You have access to the 
Adriatic; it is all normal. 
  [Djuric] Your idea of a confederacy of Orthodox countries 
has been given a lot of publicity in Serbia. How do you 
envisage this? Which countries would comprise it? What would be 
its purpose? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We need to think about the fact that in this 
world, which has fallen apart, there are no longer two blocs, 
there is no bilateral balance, and no fanatical ideology lasts 
forever. All this has gone down the drain. Essentially, this 
was violence. However, if we were to try uniting into some kind 
of alliance of states, as Orthodox Slavs, this would make us 
stronger, firmer. We would then have a single society, a common 
language with you. We are one tribe. You remained in the 
Balkans, the Poles proceeded to the northwest, the Russians to 
the northeast; our civilization started there [as published]. 
The Russians went on their way, the Poles on theirs, and you 
stayed here. Then they hacked you to pieces, gave some to the 
Italians, Austrians, Germans, and Turks. They are all 
barbarians. They came from here [as published] 500 years ago, 
they conquered the Byzantine Empire, and kept you in blood and 
torture for 500 years. Until Alexander II liberated all of you. 
That is why we could now form a Slav alliance of Slav states. 
The Balkans, Czech, Slovakia, Poland, Russia -- these would 
make a very good foundation, because we share a common language 
and culture. The Serbs, the Ukrainians, and the Russians are 
all Orthodox. It would be easier for all of us, it would be 
better. It would all be one expanse of territory, because this 
is a single territory, one territory, a huge territory. If you 
were in New Zealand, and someone else were in Argentina, how 
could you unite? Whereas in this case, everyone is here. You. 
The Bulgarians. Only the Hungarians and the Romanians are in 
the way. A clear border with the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. 
We could save a lot on transportation. For example, from your 
ports on the Adriatic across all of Russia from Vud to Japan. 
There you are. Poland and Germany as well. Hamburg, Warsaw, 
Moscow, Vladivostok. A Eurasian transit trade route and 
everything will be fine. The language -- Russian. You will be 
pleased to speak Russian more often than English. You even use 
the same alphabet as we do. We favor doing something, we are 
trying to accomplish something. However, the Slavs have always 
been weak. The Germans constrained you from the west, the 
northeast, and the northwest. If a new Russia emerges, we will 
not allow them to go on constraining you. If you desire closer 
relations with Russia, so be it. If you do not, you are welcome 
-- everything depends on you, on your wishes. If the Russians 
rule over the territory of the former Soviet Union, the 
situation in Serbia and Yugoslavia will be stable. If the Serbs 
are at war, the Croats, and Bosnia, it will be an endless war. 
The same applies to our case. If you remove the Russian front, 
we too will have an endless war, just like Afghanistan. 
  [Djuric] What is your opinion of the presidents of Serbia, 
Croatia, and Bosnia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not know them very well personally. 
Principally speaking, they are all former communists. I am not 
a communist. And that is why it is obvious that there is no 
agreement on ideology. I am ready to support them if they take 
up a patriotic position, that is, where there are Serbs, that is 
Serbia. [If they support] let us say normal relations with 
neighboring states, so that noone would attack the Serbs, and 
that they try to minimize any danger threatening Serbia, we can 
reach an agreement. However, if they betray the Serbian people 
and start betraying Serbian interests to the advantage of the 
Muslims and Croats, then I cannot support them, because I 
believe that an agreement is not possible. Where the Serbs 
live, that is Serbia. All of it. Concessions should not be 
made to anyone. The Muslims need to be removed, all the armies 
withdrawn, and the war ended. You can live on tourism alone. 
Tourism can make you the richest country in the world, you need 
nothing else. Such sea, such beaches, so many beautiful 
resorts. And now there is a war there, and everything is being 
destroyed. 
  [Djuric] Finally, a short question. Do you know the 
president of Yugoslavia and do you have a candidate for that 
post? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Who is the current president of Yugoslavia? 
I know that Milosevic is the president of Serbia, and I did not 
think that Yugoslavia had a president. 
  [Djuric] It does, his name is Lilic. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Who? Lilic? Who is he? We know of 
Milosevic from Serbia, and the Muslims have Izetbegovic. Who is 
this Izetbegovic? What makes him a Muslim? And I know Tudjman 
-- the Croat. There, we have heard of them; Tudjman, Milosevic, 
Izetbegovic. While the president of the united Serbia and 
Montenegro is not widely known, this is very unclear. However, 
the alliance [as published]. We knew only of Tito, Josip Broz 
Tito! That was all we knew -- Tito -- and nothing else. 
Nowadays, you elect them and change them every year. For 
example, that American -- where did he run off to? 
  [Djuric] You mean Panic? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, Panic. That was his fate. He came for 
a while, he was here, and then he went back to where the greasy 
sandwiches are. Why should he be in a place where everything is 
bleeding? That is not a fatherland. That is a market. He 
tried to be president of Yugoslavia and then he went back. I 
know of Milosevic, but he is a communist. And that is his flaw. 
Which is his party? 
  [Djuric] The Socialist [Party of Serbia]. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The Socialist -- of course, I raise my hat to 
him. I told the communists here that they should change their 
name, I told Zyuganov that he should rename the party the 
Workers' Party. Everyone is tired of the word communist. And in 
the same way that there is an Agricultural Party, he could 
change the name of the party to the Workers' Party. It is a 
good name. The Russian Workers' Party of Russia, the president 
-- Zyuganov. Otherwise, they have no perspective. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Democracy </H5>
  [Djuric] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you a monarchist or a 
republican? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am a republican. I respect the 
monarchists. However, I am a republican. I also respect 
religious parties, but I favor a secular republic. That is 
that. Here we have the Liberal Democratic Party -- law and 
freedom. Freedom within the framework of the law; that is the 
whole ideology. For me democracy is when the majority finds the 
solutions, but takes into account the minorities -- as in 
Yugoslavia. The Serbs make decisions, taking into account that 
there are also the Slovenes and Croats and other categories. 
However, it is the Serbs' duty to make the decisions. Looking 
back into history, there used to be a great Serbia, and there 
was order and silence. Yet now we will have 12 states, and 
there will be war, bloodshed, and violence. Nothing good will 
happen. We choose the lesser of two evils. The lesser evil is 
Serbia's rule in the Balkans, the greater evil is 15 small 
states swallowing and killing each other every day. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  The Hobby </H5>
  [Djuric] According to the election results, a great number 
of soldiers and officers voted for you. Is that because the 
army believes that you are the man who can restore its position 
and reputation in Russian society? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The significance of the army! Yes? The army 
always displayed its sympathy, both at the previous and these 
elections. I always say: I love the army, the KGB, and the 
secret political police. That is my flaw. I love them. Other 
people, they go fishing or have other hobbies, while my hobby 
within the framework of politics are my sympathies towards the 
structure of power. I used to be in the army. I love a strong 
Russian Army, a strong KGB, and the political police, that is, 
the entire structure of power, and that is why they voted for 
me. Eighty percent of the officers, the army, the KGB, and the 
police voted for me. However, since the voting was secret, this 
cannot be proven. It can only be proven in the military 
constituencies, which were closed to everyone else. There it 
was obvious.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- The offer made by 
Slovenia to the Federal Republic of Yugoslav [FRY] to normalize 
relations means knocking on an open door, since the FRY had 
earlier already recognized Slovenia unilaterally, a move which 
was practically rejected since it was not reciprocated. The 
statement made by Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle that 
"the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Ljubljana 
was of interest for Slovenia," was interpreted by observers of 
Yugoslav-Slovenian relations in Belgrade as an official offer of 
Ljubljana to the FRY. 
  There have not yet been official reactions in the FRY to 
Ljubljana's offer, but the offer just as every other offer to 
normalize relations made by a former Yugoslav republic, would be 
carefully examined in Belgrade. The FRY is working for 
re-establishing disrupted links in the former Yugoslavia, ending 
the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a just solution to 
the crisis in former Yugoslavia. That is why it is exclusively 
the fault of Ljubljana that Belgrade's earlier offer for mutual 
recognition had been consigned to oblivion. 
  One wonders why the Slovenian foreign minister has shown his 
cards and made his offer to normalize relations between 
Ljubljana and Belgarde at this particular time. It is well 
known that out of all the former Yugoslav republics Slovenia has 
up to now been the most out-spoken in its attacks on Belgraee in 
all international fora, from the U.N. to the CSCE. Demanding 
even that the mentioning of Yugoslavia be banned, Ljubljana has 
naively expected to improve its reputation in the world, to 
approach the european Union and other international factors. 
  The Slovenians have shown by their offer to normalize 
relations with Belgrade that they did not wish to be late in the 
process of normalization of relations with the FRY. The 
interest to normalize relations with the FRY has undoubtedly 
been spurred by the beginning of the normalization of relations 
between Belgrade and Zagreb, since Slovenia is having some 
serious problems with Croatia. The possible normalization of 
relations with the FRY would counterbalance to a great extent 
the trouble Slovenians are having with Croats, it is assessed in 
Belgrade. 
  The ball is now in Slovenia's court.

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- Jacques de Larosiere, 
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, today informed Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], that the bank cannot send 
a mission for talks with Yugoslav experts on the reconstruction 
of the country's monetary system because the FRY is not 
currently a member of this international institution. Kontic 
had sent a letter to the European Bank at the beginning of 
January, requesting that a mission of this bank pay a visit to 
Yugoslavia in order to discuss the reconstruction of the 
monetary system with Yugoslav experts. 
  Larosiere believes that the FRY government should remain in 
contact with the bank's board of governors concerning its 
readmission, but at the same time expressed doubt that the 
bank's members would wish to tackle this issue before the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia are lifted and "a more favorable 
international climate is created."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mithat Emini Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] The former secretary-general of PDP [Party for 
Democratic Prosperity] was arrested on Saturday [29 January] 
under the charges of founded suspicion that he was involved in 
the affair with the organization of paramilitary Albanian 
formations in Macedonia and arms smuggling, MIC reports, quoting 
reliable sources in the interior ministry. The district 
attorney Gligor Serafimovski confirmed this information to MIC. 
However, he denied that Emini was transferred from prison in 
Skopje to the state polyclinic, due to heart difficulties. MIC 
found out that the court proceedings of the group of Albanians, 
including an Albanian with Macedonian and US citizenship, all 
indicted under the same charges, are expected to begin toward 
the end of this week. 
  Toward the beginning of last November, the Macedonian police 
arrested the Deputy Minister of Defense Husein Haskaj, together 
with a larger group of Albanians, under the suspicion of 
smuggling arms and organizing paramilitary and parapolice 
organizations in Macedonia. The Minister of the Interior 
Ljubomir Frckovski stated, at the time, that "there is a founded 
suspicion that the Deputy Minister of Defense Haskaj was 
involved in the expert estimation and giving advice to a foreign 
state, which is in the sphere of giving out state secrets." The 
Ministry of Defense denied this information and explained that 
Haskaj did not have at his disposal information about the 
defense plan of the Republic of Macedonia. Frckovski also 
denied that an arsenal of 300 automatic guns were found on the 
suspects, but only 35. Frckovski also denied that a list of 
20,000 recruits of the Albanian paramilitary in Macedonia was 
also found on the people arrested. "It is quite possible," 
Frckovski said, "that the arrested individuals were preparing a 
concept for organized paramilitary action." 
  The police then announced that this was otherwise the fourth 
cut off arms smuggling channel in Macedonia. The first had come 
from Croatia through Bulgaria, the second from FRY through 
Bulgaria, and third through Salonika, into Macedonia.

  [Text] Let us listen to a report from Ibajete Hajrullahu 
about the problems within the Party for Democratic Prosperity 
[PDP] in Macedonia and the suspension of the Macedonian 
parliament session, scheduled to discuss the census bill: 
  [Hajrullahu] After many efforts to reach an agreement 
between the two factions in the PDP, this was attained in the 
meeting held in Tetove. On this occasion, a joint council made 
up of representatives from both former councils was formed to 
make preparations for the early congress. The council also 
comprised one representative from every PDP branch. 
  This council will hold its first meeting on 3 February at 
the 
PDP headquarters in Tetove. Meanwhile, the Macedonian Assembly 
continued its suspended proceedings regarding the government's 
proposal to discuss the census law. The discussions by 
Macedonian deputies displayed the fear that by conducting an 
objective census, the number of Albanians will turn out to be 
greater than the present one, which the Macedonians used to 
manipulate. However, in drafting the law the government's main 
aim is not that it should be acceptable for Albanians as well. 
The Albanian deputies again presented their remarks requesting 
no more than a real and objective census and the return of lost 
belief in the Republic's Statistics Department. The debate was 
again suspended.

<F P=106> [Report by Miodrag Vukovic from Podgorica] </F>
  [Text] Ivan Milutinovic Square in Podgorica was too small 
to hold all those who wanted to welcome Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. After talks 
with Svetozar Marovic, secretary general of the Democratic Party 
of Socialists, and meetings with the Montenegrin opposition 
parties -- only the pro-Montenegrin bloc did not attend -- 
Zhirinovskiy held a rally in the capital of the republic. The 
fervent atmosphere during the meeting did not result in trouble. 
After being addressed by the Russian leader, the crowd of over 
50,000 people dispersed peacefully and enthusiastically. 
  This enthusiasm was caused by Zhirinovskiy, who greeted them 
with the words that a great Serb had come to his brother Serbs. 
With the victory of his party, Zhirinovskiy said, the Russian 
people had determined a new course in policy, particularly 
toward the events in the former Yugoslavia. No one must strike 
against Serbia, as that would be a strike against Russia. The 
world wants to divide the Balkans into many little statelets, so 
that the West can catholicize half the peninsula, and islamize 
the other half, Zhirinovskiy said. 
  They are trying to destroy our Orthodox religion, and your 
only fault, Zhirinovskiy said, is that you are on the border 
with the West, and therefore the attacks on you are all the 
fiercer. The Russian Army, some 300,000 troops, is still in 
Germany, but if need be it will be moved to the Balkans so as to 
protect its brother Serbs. As for the sanctions, Zhirinovskiy 
said, they can keep them in force. Russia has all you need, and 
will buy everything you can offer. As for defense, if there is 
an attack, you should not give it so much as a thought, 
Zhirinovskiy said, and added that Russia had not only 
state-of-the-art weapons, but also a secret sonar weapon -- as 
it is called -- which it will use for its own defense and for 
the defense of her Orthodox brothers on the territory of the 
present Yugoslavia. 
  Russian might has to be displayed to the world, so as to 
force it to leave the Slavs to live in peace. Russia will make 
it clear that Serbia should not be taken lightly.

  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, Feb 2 (TANJUG) -- Italian 
Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta says that Italy has 
acquiesced in Montenegro's request to intercede with the U.N. 
Sanctions committee for stepping up the procedure for issuing 
permits for aid deliveries to that Yugoslav Republic. In a 
letter to his Montenegrin counterpart Miodrag Lekic, Andreatta 
said Italy had upheld also Montenegro's request for permission 
to export aluminium and use the proceeds for humanitarian 
imports. Andreatta said that Italy was already investing 
efforts for the reopening of the ferry line between Bari, Italy, 
and Bar, Montenegro, being aware of its importance to Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) and its communications with the rest of the 
world. 
  Although humanitarian goods are supposed to be exempt from 
sanctions clamped on Yugoslavia by the United Nations in May of 
1992 for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. sanctions committee has often been 
deliberately slow in issuing the necessary permits for the 
import of even the most essential articles, which are in 
extremely short supply because of the embargo, making life 
difficult both for the Yugoslavs and the 700,000 refugees 
accommodated in the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by Vid </F>
Blagojevic on 1 February; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Blagojevic] Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
Srpska republic, commented on yesterday's visit by Mr. Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy to the Srpska republic and Bijeljina in the 
following way to your reporter: 
  [Karadzic] I would like to say the Mr. Zhirinovskiy is 
welcome [words indistinct]. He is not just any Russian, but a 
Russian who has behind him several million voters, and of course 
their families -- so a very significant number of Russians -- 
and since we have very good relations with the Russian 
Government and the Russian opposition [words indistinct] with 
the opposition, just as we gladly meet the government. Things 
are certainly changing in Russia. What I can tell our listeners 
and the local radio stations is that, unfortunately, in our wish 
to have peace as soon as possible, we were hoping that peace 
could come soon. 
  However, the Muslim side has opted for war, and the United 
States has decided to support the Muslim commitment to war by 
recognizing the actual situation on the ground that the Muslims 
have achieved by force of arms. That bothers us as that means 
there will be more suffering, particularly among the Muslim 
people, but we should also be glad about it, since if the actual 
situation on the ground created in fighting is recognized, then 
it will be recognized for the Serbs as well, and the Serbs 
control 60 percent of the territory. The Serbs will achieve 
their aims to a greater extent even though with more casualties 
than if there were to be peace. 
  We have adopted important decisions at the general staff 
level. Our people have to be completely mobilized. We are either 
a nation or not. We are either a nation or we will disappear. 
Our enemies have to know that it is dangerous to fight against 
the Serbs, that when cornered, the Serbs have no other choice. 
We have no choice but to win. We did not want to defeat the 
Muslims. We wanted them to win on their territory and us to win 
on ours, and to part our ways. If they do not want to, then it 
is our duty to defend every inch of our country. There are no 
more percentages. Nobody can guarantee any percentages to the 
Muslims, and they will most certainly get much less than they 
could have had if they had accepted [word indistinct]. 
  [Blagojevic] Asked about the fate of [Bosanska] Posavina and 
Mt. Ozren at the last negotiations and the coming ones in 
Geneva, President Karadzic said: 
  [Karadzic] (That is undefined) since we did not want 
anything like that as we have a lot of work to do with the 
Croats. [sentence as heard] Part of western Slavonia is under 
Croatian control so we thought that the entire Bosanska Posavina 
should belong to the Serbs, and that is what we still think. 
Therefore every inch of Posavina has to belong to the Serbs. 
We do not want any corridor, we want a real territorial link 
between our Krajina, the Srpska republic, and the Serbian 
Krajina, that is, republic. We could not abandon Mt. Ozren, we 
even got a significant part of Mt. Ozren back through 
negotiations. To tell the truth, the Muslims did not feel much 
like taking Mt. Ozren with so many Serbs there, and such savage 
and rough Serbs, too, so that, to our mutual satisfaction, we 
decided that this part of Mt. Ozren should be returned. 
  However, since the Muslims have given up on all this, we 
have 
the reason, the rights, and the ability to defend every inch of 
the Serb land, and the Muslims will get what is left. We cannot 
compensate them, we cannot guarantee them 33 percent, and let 
them then fight for more. Every gamble has two possible 
outcomes, a gain and a loss, and every stick has two ends. If 
the Muslim leadership has opted for war, and it has, and the 
United States has decided to recognize the results of their 
struggle, and it has, then it should all also apply to the Serbs 
and the Serbs should not complain as they already control 72 
percent of the territory, and own 60 percent of the territory. 
If we do make any concessions, then that will only be a 
percentage or two of unimportant territory, we will not give 
away anything important that is Serbian. 
  [Blagojevic] In what context are we to view the latest 
statement by General Morillion, former UN commander? 
  [Karadzic] That a Muslim state should not be (created)? 
  [Blagojevic] Yes. 
  [Karadzic] That is our big problem, ours and the Croats. 
Europe wants us to remain in a common country with the Muslims 
so as to control them. That European calculation is extremely 
wrong since in about 15 years the Muslims would be in the 
majority, and they would create pressure, as in Kosovo, for the 
Serbs and the Croats to move out. Then it would become a great 
Muslim state in Europe. Trying to avoid a small Muslim state in 
Europe, Europe is creating a great Muslim state, because of its 
miscalculations. Europe does not know that, though. We will 
not accept that. We have nothing against a small Muslim state, 
but we also have nothing against dividing Bosnia in two parts 
between the Serbs and the Croats. The Muslims in Tuzla could 
get autonomy with the Serbs, and autonomy in Zenica with the 
Croats, although we would rather see a clean partition into 
three, where the Serbs could enjoy their territories, and the 
Muslims could enjoy whatever is theirs. 
  [Blagojevic] President Karadzic finally addressed the 
soldiers in the Srpska republic army: 
  [Karadzic] Greetings to all the fighters. Please, gentlemen 
fighters, you are the most glorious generation of Serb fighters, 
and the officers are the most glorious generation of Serb 
officers. Pay no attention to what we do at the conferences, as 
all the maps are transient, and only what you hold is eternal. 
Hold every village of ours, and do not worry.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 1 (AFP) -- A UN aid convoy headed 
to the besieged Bosnian Moslem enclave of Maglaj Tuesday 
carrying 79 tonnes of badly needed food and supplies, UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Kris Janowski said in 
Sarajevo. He said the convoy left the northwestern town of 
Banja Luka Tuesday morning and was to travel north through 
Serb-held territory in order to avoid crossing the Croat enclave 
of Zepce where several previous convoys have been stopped. 
  The last aid convoy to reach Maglaj, besieged by Serb and 
Croat troops, arrived there on October 26, five months after the 
previous one. Janowski said the situation in the enclave was 
desperate. [passage omitted] 
  In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said 
Tuesday that Russia was against the international community 
launching air strikes on Bosnia that could lead to an escalation 
to the conflict. 
  Kozyrev, who spoke following a meeting with peace 
negotiators 
David Owen, of the European Community, and Thorvald Stoltenberg 
of the UN, added that if air strikes are inevitable then they 
must be "carried out within the framework of UN Security Council 
resolutions and the approval of the UN Secretary General and 
members of the Security Council." 
  He added that such strikes should not be aimed exclusively 
against the Serbs but against all the belligerants. 
  In central Bosnia, British troops reported seeing 
helicopters 
flying over the regions of Novi Travnik and Vitez, where Croat 
and Moslem troops are fighting, Bill Aikman, spokesman for the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said. 
  He said the helicopter flights, carried out by both the 
Moslem and Croat troops, were noticed Monday and one helicopter 
from a Croat base in Vitez flew over the camp of the British UN 
peacekeepers stationed nearby. The flights are in violation of 
a no-fly zone declared over most of Bosnia by the United Nations. 
  Aikman said that the situation was relatively calm 
throughout 
the country Monday except in the capital and central Bosnia. 
  In Geneva, the UNHCR protested to Belgrade Tuesday against 
the mobilisation of Bosnian Serb refugees in rump Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), and denounced a new wave of ethnic 
cleansing in western Bosnia. Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the 
mobilisation of hundreds of Serbian refugees to fight on the 
warfronts in Bosnia was "illegal." 
  She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at 
night 
to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also 
protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia 
with Croat refugees from Bosnia. 
  Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of 
killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are 
trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region 
and confiscating their property. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Janowski said in Sarajevo that 19 containers 
carrying a field hospital donated to the Moslem sector of Mostar 
by a Moslem South African organisation were expected to reach 
the enclave from Croatia Tuesday after a six-month delay.

  [Text] After visiting several cities in the former 
Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo, Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of 
the UN secretary general, and head of the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] in the former Yugoslavia, held talks today in 
Belgrade with Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic. They discussed all the issues that are currently 
complicating the situation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as 
heard], particularly certain demands by the international 
community issued to the leadership of the Srpska republic. 
  [Begin recording] [Akashi, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] There should be no difficulties 
concerning the rotation of the UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica, 
and I hope that this rotation, based on this agreement, will be 
completed by the end of February. 
  As for the opening of Tuzla airport, I believe that Dr. 
Karadzic is keeping an open mind. He wants to explore our 
suggestions. He has to consult his assembly, but we are ready 
to take into account his concerns regarding the security and 
other aspects of this. 
  We have a clear mandate from the UN secretary general to 
open 
the airport by peaceful means, by negotiations, but if that is 
not successful, then there is the possibility of the use of a 
minimum of force for self-defense. However, I am sure that we 
agree that we will do everything possible to avoid that kind of 
an escalation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How do you understand the 
latest 
mandate that you have been given by Mr. Butrus-Ghali? The 
foreign press carries different interpretations of that mandate. 
  [Akashi] I have explained many times to the distinguished 
members of the press that the secretary general has given me a 
mandate to call for NATO air support for self-defense for our 
troops. This is different from air strikes for offensive 
purposes. Neither the secretary general nor I have the right to 
initiate such attacks. Even NATO would have to go back to 
consult the NATO Council to solve that issue, the issue of air 
strikes. 
  We are talking about something specific here, about the air 
support for the self-defense of our troops. 
  [Karadzic] We have completely clarified the issue of 
Srebrenica with Mr. Akashi, General Rose, and their associates, 
and we do not believe that this will be a problem. The Dutch 
troops are already in Srebrenica, and we believe that the 
Canadian UNPROFOR will be completely replaced by the Dutch 
forces by the end of February. 
  As for the opening of the airport in Tuzla, we understand 
the 
efforts of the international community to increase the inflow of 
humanitarian aid into the Tuzla region. Last time we offered 
Mrs. Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to double, 
even treble, the number of humanitarian land convoys, and we are 
ready to increase the inflow of convoys for Tuzla, and that has 
already happened. Larger amounts of food are already reaching 
Tuzla. 
  I am afraid that the issue of opening Tuzla airport could 
become more of a psychological than a realistic one, 
psychological in the sense that the international community 
could, that is, some belligerent members of the international 
community could use this as a form of exerting further pressure. 
We do not reject in principle the notion of it, but it is too 
major a decision for any one Serbian official to make by 
himself. That has to be decided by our assembly. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- French General Philippe 
Mercier, member of the chief of staff [as received], said on 
Tuesday that Bosnian Muslims have completely turned to the war 
option after they captured arms factories in the latest fighting 
(against Croats) in the central part of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Gen. Mercier told the press that, thanks to financial 
support 
of Islamic countries, Bosnian Muslims continue to arm themselves 
because arms and ammuntion, even a certain number of rockets, 
can reach them across borders of the former Yugoslavia despite 
the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the former Yugoslavia. 
  This is the first time in France that a high military 
official openly spoke about the amply arming of the Bosnian 
Muslims and the aid they were receiving from Islamic countries. 
  French military sources assessed that Muslim forces loyal to 
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic numbered around 85,000 
troops, possessed between 20 to 30 tanks, around 350 cannons and 
a score of helicopters and airplanes. 
  Gen. Mercier confirmed reports that "several units" of the 
Croatian Army were in Bosnia-Herzegovina helping Bosnian Croats 
in the fighting against Muslims in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  French sources claim that the forthcoming meeting of the 
European Union foreign ministers, to be held in Brussels on 
February 7, will discuss the possible imposing of economic 
sanctions against Croatia due to its direct military involvement 
in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

more specifically to the possibility of NATO air strikes on Serb 
positions as our foreign minister, Javier Solana, is about to go 
to Bosnia. On the eve of Solana's visit [2 February], our

  [Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish Blue Helmets stationed 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina would find themselves in a tight corner if 
the air strikes decided upon by the United Nations were to go 
ahead. The head of the Madrid Group [Spanish UN contingent], 
Colonel Luis Carvajal, makes no secret of his doubts about how 
effective these air strikes would be in opening Tuzla Airport or 
in allowing the replacement of Canadian Blue Helmets in 
Srebrenica. 
  [Begin Carvajal recording] We have a defense capacity, that 
is true. We have arms and we have the means, but they are 
limited of course. We do not have air cover, other than that 
provided by the planes themselves, we do not have antiaircraft 
defenses. [end recording] 
  [Cespedes] This afternoon Col. Carvajal visited the city of 
Mostar with General Cot, head of UNPROFOR in former Yugoslavia. 
Both of them met the mayor of Mostar and there was not a single 
reference made to the charges made 28 January against the 
Spanish Blue Helmets. The problem is over.

  [Text] Jagodina, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Assembly President of 
the Serbian Republic (RS) Momcilo Krajisnik on Tuesday said 
there was not a single soldier from the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia [FRY] on the territory of the state of the Bosnian 
Serbs and the RS was not receiving any arms from the F.R.Y. 
  Krajisnik said on Radio Jagodina (central Serbia) that the 
RS 
leadership "most categorically denies the reports circulating in 
U.S. circles that Army of Yugoslavia (VJ) units are crossing 
into the RS armed or unarmed to fight on the Serb side in the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Co-chairman of the international conference on the former 
Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg said in New York on Monday there 
was no evidence that there were Army of Yugoslavia troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Krajisnik said it was true that the Muslim side had declared 
a longlasting war on the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. He 
said the Bosnian Serbs were preparing to defend their territory, 
and the RS supreme command had proclaimed a (general) 
mobilization on Monday to that end. 
  "Our mobilization should be understood as a preventive 
response to the Muslim side's commitment to a longlasting war," 
Krajisnik said. He set out that the purpose of the mobilization 
was, among other things, to distribute the burden of the war 
among all RS citizens. 
  Krajisnik said he would meet again soon at Sarajevo airport 
with Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
  "The purpose of our meeting will be to replace the war 
option 
with a negotiating one, and I hope the meeting will be 
successful so that we could have concrete results in Geneva on 
February 10 (in the resumption of the peace talks)," Krajisnik 
said.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Rifts among Moslems, 
advocates of a political solution and those who are in favor of 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, are becoming more and more frequent, 
TANJUG correspondent has learnt from ranking Bosnian Serb 
military circles. 
  In the region of Zavidocici and Zepca, central Bosnia, 
antagonism between Moslem military and civilian authorities is 
more marked, the sources added citing local Bosnian Croat 
military sources. 
  Croatian refugees from Sarajevo are also giving accounts of 
growing divisions among Moslems in that city and the rising 
number of those who are now in favor of a political solution, 
and not the continuation of war in Bosnia. 
  Serbian military sources report about continued Moslem-Croat 
clashes in central Bosnia, especially in the region of Prozor, 
Gornji Vakuf, Kiseljak and Zepca, as well as in the region of 
Mostar, in the south-west of that former Yugoslav republic. 
  In attacks of Croatian forces on parts of Mostar under 
Moslem 
control one civilian was killed and seven were wounded in the 
last 24 hours, Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported on Tuesday. 
  At the same time, Croatian military sources claim that 15 
civilians were wounded on Monday in the part of Mostar under 
Croatian control. 
  Despite heavy casualties, the Moslem army continued its 
offensive in the region of Zepce, the Zagreb-based Croatian 
Radio reported. 
  In the region of Sarajevo, Moslem forces continued attacks 
on 
the Serbian parts of the city, targetting especially [word 
indistinct], Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici and Ilidza, Serbian 
military sources added. 
  Serbian positions in northern Bosnia, in the region of 
Doboj, 
the mountains of Ozren and Teslici, were also targetted by 
Moslems. 
  Moslem forces continued with their armed provocations of the 
Serbian side from the direction of Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija 
(north-east Bosnia), as well as from the eastern Bosnian enclave 
of Gorazde -- a zone under U.N. protection.

  [Excerpt] Just like the past few days, the worst situation 
today on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts was in the operational 
zone of the 7th South Operative Group. Smajl Terzic reports 
from the press center: 
  [Terzic] In the last 14 days, 160 Chetniks have been killed 
and twice as many put out of action. Fierce attacks took place 
today in the Filipovici region, Komin, Obli Kamen, and Kriz, 
where the enemy fired over 800 82-mm shells. The reasons for 
this are revenge and the withdrawal of damaged tanks and an 
armored personnel carrier. [passage omitted]

Zenica regularly. 
  The 10 trucks brought to the town, held by the mainly-Moslem 
Bosnian army, 4,200 litres of fuel oil, 600 litres of kerosene, 
60 tonnes of individual parcels, 96 tonnes of flour, 9,600 
blankets and medical supplies. A second convoy of similar size 
was expected in Zenica Thursday [3 February], the ICRC said.

  [Excerpt] Before leaving Warsaw for Brussels, Waldemar 
Pawlak was asked whether Partnership for Peace would guarantee 
our NATO membership. He said: 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] I think this is not just the issue 
of Partnership for Peace but also a matter of the association 
with the European Union. Apart from the issue of security, 
political, military, and economic matters, partnership for 
development is also very important, and so is looking for forms 
of cooperation that would give Poland an opportunity for 
cooperation with the European Union as a partner. I think this 
is a fundamental condition, particularly because security issues 
may be a problem in the future, while economic problems are a 
problem today and should be solved today. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Pol Mathil </F>
in Warsaw; date not given: "On the Polish Left and the World"] 
  [Text] [Mathil] One hundred days after taking office as 
prime minister of a government of the left in Poland, you are 
making your first visit to Brussels. How are you going to 
explain to your Western interlocutors that Poland, the most 
anti-communist of the former Soviet bloc countries, has 
replaced, after four years, a regime born out of Solidarity with 
a government formed of two parties with their roots in the 
former regime? 
  [Pawlak] My generation is fortunate to enter upon the 
political scene at a time when we ourselves are deciding our 
fate, while our parents and grandparents were forced to live 
under the constraints of the Communist regime and look for their 
spot in the sunshine. Certain people now say that we must do 
away with Communism in the country. But we cannot do away with 
Communism in a country which never accepted the Communism in the 
first place. We were the only Eastern bloc country to have 
maintained intact its national memory, private agriculture, 
church and intellectual elite. Within the group which was, 
apparently, condemned to uniformity, we were different. This 
aspect is an essential element of the present situation. 
  [Mathil] You do not therefore like the definition of your 
coalition as "post-Communist"? 
  [Pawlak] No, I find it anachronistic, dating from the former 
era in fact. Also, the past history of politicians and 
political parties in Poland, of the people from Solidarity also, 
is very complicated. 
  My party, the Peasant Party, began well before the Communist 
era. It has been active in Polish politics for a hundred years. 
Such a party cannot be described as "post-Communist." 
  [Mathil] And the reasons for your electoral success? An 
ideological vote? 
  [Pawlak] No, I don't believe so, it was a pragmatic vote. A 
signal that the economy is more than statistics and abstract 
accounting, it is above all people. I believe the vote 
indicated that, for the Poles, the affairs of the present and 
the future are more important than those of the past, and 
day-to-day problems eclipsed any ideological debate. The 1991 
elections had already signalled that certain consequences of the 
reforms were hitting the population very hard. But this signal 
was ignored. As the government did not change course, the 1993 
elections showed that the political climate had changed 
radically. 
  [Mathil] Alternating governments is in fact a quite normal 
phenomenon in a democracy, but not when it brings to power two 
parties as burdened by the past as your own. You are accused of 
rebuilding a model of the past? 
  [Pawlak] That is the view of people who have not noticed the 
far-reaching changes in the structures and generations in our 
parties. Also, virtually all those who are involved in the 
exercise of power have been confirmed in their position by the 
ballot box. 
<H5>  Cohabitation With Lech Walesa </H5>
  [Mathil] Poland is the first country with cohabitation 
between a government of the left and a president of the right, 
like in France, but in reverse. What are your relations with 
Lech Walesa? 
  [Pawlak] Good. I believe that it is in the interests of the 
country for them to remain as good as possible. We do not deal 
with symbols, but with specific, concrete questions. On any 
important and urgent matters, I never have any problem in 
gaining access to the president. 
  [Mathil] After three months of cohabitation, has there been 
no major conflict between the president and the prime minister? 
  [Pawlak] Even if there had been, I would not tell you. 
  [Mathil] The fact remains that three key ministries, 
defense, 
foreign, and the interior, remain the reserve of the president. 
Do these ministers remain outside the control of the prime 
minister? 
  [Pawlak] They are members of the government which I head. 
Under the Constitution, the government is appointed by the 
parliament, but the individuals who head these three departments 
are chosen in consultation with the president. Admittedly, this 
is a situation with the potential for conflict, but Polish 
cohabitation makes it possible to arrive at a compromise. 
  [Mathil] The Solidaruty governments, from Mazowiecki to 
Suchocka, pursued a policy of reforms admired in the West but 
rejected by the voters. You described it as a "vehicle heading 
for the abyss." What do you do to stop it? 
  [Pawlak] The sentence is not complete, I was alluding to the 
abyss of social conflict. An "active economy" is required, in 
which not only a few monetarist instruments but all the players, 
and notably the government, must play a role. We must 
understand that there is a limit to social resilience, beyond 
which there is the danger of provoking an explosion, 
destabilization, and the end to reforms. That is why we have 
begun by looking at the situation of the most underprivileged. 
  [Mathil] Your critics claim that carrying out your election 
promises will threaten the cause of reforms and trigger rising 
inflation. 
  [Pawlak] For the moment, inflation is lower than expected 
and 
in any event it can only be meaningfully discussed after a 
certain period of time. 
  [Mathil] You are arriving in Brussels the very day after the 
entry into force of the association accord with the European 
Union negotiated by previous governments. Does your government 
of the left have any reservations regarding this treaty? 
  [Pawlak] It is enough to look at our foreign trade debt, one 
half of which, or more than one billion dollars in 1993, stems 
from trade with the EEC. It is not of question of listing 
preferences on paper, but of achieving real cooperation. 
  [Mathil] Do you mean to say that Poland is discriminated 
against in terms of access to Western markets? 
  [Pawlak] That is putting it in strong terms. But you could 
say that the European Union applies solutions to Poland which it 
would not like to see applied to itself. 
  [Mathil] You have the reputation of being a protectionist. 
Why? 
  [Pawlak] I don't know. I have simply asked the question: 
Why has not Poland so far used all available means in order to 
defend its interests as the countries of the European Union have 
done? 
  [Mathil] In Brussels, you are going to sign Poland's access 
to the Partnership for Peace. Is it true that as recently as 
last Friday you were not sure that you would be able to do it 
this Wednesday? 
  [Pawlak] The decision to sign was taken at a summit with Mr. 
Clinton in Prague. But it was a question of having the full 
backing of the government. This was obtained on Friday. 
  [Mathil] This agreement has been strongly criticized in 
Poland, notably by your president. Is the partnership 
considered to be insufficient? 
  [Pawlak] It is a complex matter. Apart from the external 
dangers which could be posed in the future, there are more 
immediate aspects of internal order. This is why we formulated 
the idea of a "Partnership for Development." And Mr. Clinton's 
statement on the need to enlarge access to Western markets by 
the countries of Central Europe shows a similar thinking. 
Security is a very broad concept which goes beyond bilateral 
relations between Poland and NATO for example. 
<H5>  The "Partnership" Creates A Draught Zone </H5>
  [Mathil] Do you agree with Henry Kissinger for whom the 
"partnership" creates a no man's land between Russia and NATO? 
  [Pawlak] I prefer to say "a draught zone" where you might 
catch a cold. The situation is characterized by uncertainties 
which the ambiguities of the "partnership" do not remove. 
  [Mathil] What dangers would you cite to show the fragility 
of 
the situation? 
  [Pawlak] I would begin by the elements of internal 
stability, 
social and economic. The quicker we achieve this stability, 
notably through international cooperation, the easier it will be 
to solve wide, long-term problems. But I do not believe we are 
under a direct threat in our international environment. 
  [Mathil] So how do you see events in Russia and above all 
the 
results of the recent elections? 
  [Pawlak] I see it as further proof that reforms cannot be 
achieved independently of the social climate. 
  [Mathil] But do you see in this result a danger to Poland? 
Belarus and Ukraine, two buffer states between Poland and 
Russia, are being slowly "sucked in" by Moscow. What do you 
think of the idea of Russia's "legitimate interests" in the 
"near abroad"? Do you feel this is relevant to or even targeted 
at Poland? 
  [Pawlak] Our present relations with Russia's president and 
government are not of a nature to justify such fears. In any 
event, we take our decisions in complete sovereignty and we have 
no reason to believe that Russia does not respect this. But of 
course time will tell. 
  [Mathil] Exactly, you have time. At the age of 34, you are 
certainly one of the youngest prime ministers in the world. 
People say you are very ambitious. Is it true that you will be 
a candidate against Lech Walesa at the next presidential 
elections? 
  [Pawlak] I have a job now which is very interesting and 
which 
I find totally satisfying. I do not know if I am an ambitious 
man, but I am certainly not a man in a hurry.

<F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Prime Minister Will Sign `Partnership </F>
for Peace'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Waldemar Pawlak's government 
debated "Partnership for Peace," Poland's treaty of association 
with the EC, and a social contract. The ministers were obliged 
to implement a UN resolution imposing sanctions on Libya. 
  --During his visit to NATO Headquarters in Brussels, which 
begins today, the prime minister will sign a document pertaining 
to Poland's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program. The 
government authorized the prime minister to place his signature, 
Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz (under secretary of state in the Council 
of Ministers Office) told journalists. He also said Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski will not attend the Brussels 
meeting. Detailed principles of our participation in the 
program will be subject to negotiations to be conducted with 
those who will participate in it. Lithuania and Romania have 
already declared their willingness to join. 
  --The Council of Ministers heard a report from the foreign 
minister concerning the fact that the treaty on Poland's 
association with the EC has gone into effect. In accordance 
with an agreement signed in mid-December 1991, the treaty became 
effective on 1 February. Poland his signed the treaty for 10 
years, which does not mean, however, that we will automatically 
join the Western European Union in 2004. But what will happen 
is that, from now on, we will have influence on decisions made 
in Brussels. Joint association agencies will be established. 
The extent of our relations with the countries of "the 12" will 
also be widened: Apart from trade, it will include the flow of 
capital, services, and labor. 
  --Labor Minister Leszek Miller presented an up-to-date 
report 
before the Council of Ministers concerning work on a social 
contract. This coming Friday [4 February], substantive 
negotiations are to begin among the government, trade unions, 
territorial self-governments, and employer organizations. Both 
the Council of Ministers and its chief "are eager to sign an 
agreement on social guarantees as soon as possible." 
  So far, the different parties have managed to come to 
agreement on certain technical aspects. It is already known 
that negotiations will be conducted in six groups. The 
government will be represented by the following ministries: 
Labor and Social Policy, Health, Land-Use Management and 
Construction, and Education. Let us recall here that Prime 
Minister Pawlak declared his willingness to sign a social 
contract as far back as his inaugural speech in the Sejm. 
  When asked when the contract will be signed, Labor Minister 
Miller refused to set a date. All he said was that the groups 
will continue their work for several months, while the 
negotiations are supposed to be "long and intensive." According 
to a communique issued by the [government's] Press Office, the 
Council of Ministers authorized Deputy Prime Minister 
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz to coordinate work on the contract. 
Minister Miller, for his part, informed journalists that 
supervising all of the work will be leaders of the Council of 
Ministers Economic Committee (the committee subordinated to 
Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski) and the Council of 
Ministers Sociopolitical Committee (subordinated to Cimoszewicz). 
  --The government proposed an amendment to the Transport Law 
and also debated devoting part of the Treasury's shares for 
purposes of reprivatization. The ministers failed to reach a 
decision on the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Katarzyna Kolenda; relayed by </F>
Polonia TV network] 
  [Text] One day before Prime Minister Pawlak's departure for 
Brussels, a NATO Headquarters information mission arrived in 
Warsaw. 
  [Begin recording of Herman Von Richthofen, German 
representative to NATO, in English with superimposed Polish 
translation] The purpose of our mission is, to a certain extent, 
to demonstrate that NATO is treating the Partnership for Peace 
scheme seriously. We would like to begin political and military 
cooperation within this scheme as soon as possible. [end 
recording] 
  Members of the mission declared that, before the end of this 
year, joint exercises of Polish and NATO armed forces will be 
held. [video cuts to show General Stanislaw Wozniak speaking to 
camera] For the time being, we are not considering the number 
of divisions assigned to the scheme. We are considering the 
possibility of selecting small forces. We are talking here about 
a platoon, a company. 
  An agreement that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak will sign 
tomorrow concerns political consent for Poland's participation 
in the scheme. A detailed document is being prepared, and, in 
the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it will be signed 
in a few weeks' time. It is still not known how much 
participation in the scheme will cost us: This year's budget 
does not envision any expenditure for this purpose. 
  Representatives of the NATO mission discussed Poland's 
participation in the scheme with Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski and Jerzy Milewski, head of the National Security 
Office. Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the minister of national defense, 
and General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General Staff, could 
not meet the NATO delegation because they are on vacation with 
the president in the Karkonosze Mountains.

<F P=106> [Article by Joanna Boczkowska from Bern: "Walesa Is Going to </F>
Switzerland"] 
  [Text] President Lech Walesa will visit Switzerland 
on 25-27 May. The idea of inviting the Polish guest to pay a 
visit, which is regarded by the Swiss as the year's most 
important state visit, was first put forward by Otto Stich, 
finance minister and the Confederation's president for this 
year. The visit will be an opportunity to "establish closer 
contacts between the two countries," according to Mario Carrera 
(President Stich's press spokesman), in a statement to 
RZECZPOSPOLITA. 
  Issues linked to both countries' membership in the same 
group 
within the IMF will also be discussed. It is worth recalling 
here that last year President Stich came out strongly in favor 
of Switzerland's joining the IMF, and he also made efforts to 
have Poland included in the same group [within the IMF] as 
Switzerland. 
  Even though a lot of time is still left in which to define a 
detailed program for the visit, it is already known unofficially 
at this stage that President Stich would like to play host to 
his guest in his home canton of Solothurn. The city of 
Solothurn plays quite a significant role in the history of 
Polish-Swiss contacts. Tadeusz Kosciuszko stayed and died there 
in the years 1815-17. To this day in the city, there is a 
modest but very beautiful museum devoted to the Polish national 
hero.

Belarusian Ambassador Vladimir Senko on 1 February. The Sejm 
Chancellery has reported that the ambassador described the 
internal situation in Belarus in connection with the recent 
dismissal of Stanislav Shushkievich, chairman of the Belarusian 
parliament. 
  They discussed Belarusian-Russian relations in the areas of 
the unification of the monetary systems of both countries and 
closer economic cooperation. Much attention was devoted to the 
Partnership for Peace program, particularly the procedure of 
joining the program. 
  Both men expressed deep satisfaction with the state of 
bilateral relations but pointed out that the level of 
parliamentary contacts was insufficient.

will be halted. The other trade union confederations of the 
region are also to join in the strike. 
  The trade union members are demanding payment of the arrears 
of 850,000 zlotys [Z] due to them for last year and a pay raise 
of Z800,000 for each employee from 1 January. The trade unions 
have announced that, unless the Polish State Railways [PKP] 
General Directorate embarks on negotiations, the trade unions 
will make preparations for an all-out strike.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Arms Industry in Attack"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow there will be an eight-hour strike of 
defense industry factories. On Tuesday [1 February], the 
government did not reach an agreement with the Inter-Union 
Strike Committee [MKS] of arms industry employees, who on 9 
February will take part in the "Solidarity" demonstration 
against increasing unemployment and prices, and the decrease in 
employee incomes. "Certain traditional elements of 
arms-industry products will, of course, not be armed," we were 
told by "Solidarity" branch head Stanislaw Glowacki. 
  The demands of the arms industry have changed only slightly 
since the "Solidarity" manifestation in front of the Office of 
the Council of Ministers last September. At that time, 2,000 
employees of arms-industry factories declared that they had had 
enough of the negotiations, which they saw as fruitless. After 
seven-hour negotiations on 1 February, most of the demands of 
the MKS (Trade Union of the Electromachine Industry, National 
Section of the Arms Industry of "Solidarity," the "Metalworkers" 
Federation) were included in the column of differences of 
opinions with the government. 
  The arms-industry employees demanded, among other things, 
that the governmental level of orders for military equipment and 
ammunition be set "at a level that guarantees maintenance of the 
state's defense readiness" (5.5 trillion zlotys). The 
government did not go beyond the amounts of money envisioned in 
the budget bill and declared that money obtained through the 
sale of equipment would be earmarked for such purchases. As for 
the issue of covering the costs of maintaining the so-called 
defense reserves (readiness to begin manufacturing military 
equipment in the event of war, which is required by the Army) 
between 1990 and 1993, the government promised that it would 
once again present the Council of Ministers with the proposal to 
cover these costs with the companies' debts to the budget. The 
government stressed that the budget bill envisions money for the 
restructurization of this sector: money obtained from credit 
guarantees and the so-called EFSAL [expansion unknown] fund. 
Trade unions believe that this should be financed, in addition, 
through state subsidies (only every third company retained its 
creditworthiness). They also demanded separate legal 
regulations concerning social protection for arms-industry 
employees. The government spoke about how the popiwek [tax on 
excessive wage increases] would be abolished, which the MKS also 
found unacceptable. The MKS also demanded wage increases to 
compensate for price increases (in September 1993 they were at 
the level of 60 percent of average pay in the country). The 
government pointed out that indexation of wages is not possible 
now and that it is holding talks with trade unions on the issue 
of wage levels. 
  As for the issue of recovering money for deliveries of 
equipment to the former Soviet Union, the government will 
continue negotiations with the Russian Federation and, as 
previously, will compensate the Russian debt with Poland's dues 
for the sold equipment. The MKS wants the losses to be covered 
regardless of the result of the negotiations with Russia. Also 
unresolved is the problem of limiting Poland's negative 
balance-of-equipment exports to states under UN resolutions, as 
well as the issue of prepension relief. However, the government 
confirmed that the duty-free contingent for importing military 
equipment exclusively concerns products that are not 
manufactured in Poland or that are imported to be assembled in 
Polish arms factories.

<F P=106> [Interview with Center Accord leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski by </F>
Igor Zalewski and Piotr Zaremba; place and date not given: "We 
Will Not Stop Getting Rid of the Vestiges of the People's 
Republic"] 
  [Text] [ZYCIE] Bronislaw Geremek [Democratic Union 
parliamentary chief] has said that he will sit down at the same 
table as other Solidarity groups in order to discuss a joint 
presidential candidate. Would you sit at the same table as 
Geremek? 
  [Kaczynski] Unless we want the present ruling camp to win 
the presidency, a Solidarity candidate must have the broadest 
possible support. It would have to be someone who appeals to 
both the anticommunist community and to those voters who are not 
fundamentally anticommunist but who nevertheless appreciate our 
values. I have in mind the Democratic Union and 
Liberal-Democratic Congress electorate. I do not know if the 
candidate will be recognized by everyone. 
  [ZYCIE] You have lost hope in Walesa? 
  [Kaczynski] Yes. It is not true that I have changed my mind 
about him, as the mass media suggest I have. 
  [ZYCIE] What are the principles that join Center Accord 
[PC], the Christian-National Union, Peasant Accord, and the 
Movement for the Republic into one bloc? 
  [Kaczynski] Christian values, national traditions, the 
belief in a market economy, and mutual agreement as to the 
methods of safeguarding Poland's security and its pro-Western 
orientation. Just like Western right-wing parties, we have no 
intention of concealing our differences. The German CSU 
[Christian Social Union] consists of avowed traditionalists and 
liberals. 
  [ZYCIE] How much is the idea of decommunization still 
realistic? After all, the heirs of communism won the last 
elections. 
  [Kaczynski] I do not know how many votes they will have next 
time, but we are certainly not going to stop getting rid of the 
vestiges of the People's Republic. It does not matter what kind 
of label one attaches to the ruling coalition. Are we to accept 
the increasing autonomy of the Interior Ministry, the increasing 
distortions to the banking system, and the lack of equal 
opportunities? To change the administration, one can use 
various methods, such as promoting young people, who are not 
burdened by communist practices. 
  [ZYCIE] But in a few years' time, the personnel 
relationships you are criticizing will be so firmly rooted that 
it will be impossible to remove them. 
  [Kaczynski] Yes, it will be more difficult to combat them, 
especially because we do not accept revolutionary methods of 
struggle. But does that mean we have to accept a system that 
erodes our cultural standards? 
  [ZYCIE] You say that the Pawlak Government is not only bad, 
it is also in favor of recommunization. 
  [Kaczynski] The Polish left wing is really not interested in 
changes. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is backed by red 
capital, which is eating away at the state budget. But, 
fortunately, the electorate is in favor of maintaining the 
present economic and social structures. Whatever Mr. 
Kwasniewski [leader of the SLD] tries to do, he cannot act 
against the interests of the electorate. 
  [ZYCIE] What does recommunization involve? 
  [Kaczynski] Among other things, it involves making local 
government bodies dependent on the wishes of the parties that 
form the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Suchocka fired good 
PC provincial governors because they belonged to the 
parliamentary opposition. We condemned this action, but what is 
happening today is quite different. Local bodies of the Social 
Democratic Party of the Republic of Poland or the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] are actually recommending candidates for various 
posts. That signals the return of a classic nomenklatura. 
  [ZYCIE] The right-wing bloc has formed its own 
constitutional commission. What kind of principles will the 
right wing's draft constitution enshrine? 
  [Kaczynski] Christian and Polish values, strong guarantees 
of ownership rights, and democracy. 
  The Senate's draft constitution of 1991 was not supported by 
the PC. Any drastic increase in the president's powers is the 
first step toward a dictatorship, and not only with Walesa as 
president. Other public institutions are simply too weak. A 
strong presidency would turn everyone into the Belweder's 
clients. 
  Even the comparatively weak provision in the Small 
Constitution, whereby the foreign, interior, and defense 
ministers are appointed on the president's recommendation, means 
that these ministries are dependent on the president. Does the 
Pawlak government control these ministries? I do not wish to 
defend the interests of left-wing parties. However, it is worth 
noticing that, even with their huge parliamentary majority, the 
SLD and the PSL are incapable of gaining control over these 
ministries. They are taking part in an opportunistic political 
contest with the Belweder, but at the same time they know how 
weak they really are.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslaw Usidus: "Church Well-Wishing but Also </F>
Cautious"] 
  [Text] To win the trust of the church, it is not enough to 
show up in a cathedral a few times and take a picture of oneself 
with a cardinal. That is the opinion of right-wing politicians. 
Such is also, more or less, the conclusion expressed in a 
statement by Primate Jozef Glemp upon his return from a visit to 
Germany. 
  The right word here is trust because the church protested 
against the word "support." The Christian-National Union [ZChN] 
won the sympathy of priests with their firm fight for issues 
that party activists, judging from the statements of hierarchy 
representatives, consider important. The ZChN was accused of 
blindly following the church of defending everything that was 
said to be its stance or in its interest. Common are opinions 
that this devotion paid off to the party of Jurek and 
Niesiolowski. In the 1991 elections, many representatives of 
the clergy portrayed to believers the election list of the 
Electoral Catholic Action, established by the ZChN, as the right 
list to choose. 
  The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant 
movement in the Warsaw cathedral, declarations (in the 
statements of leaders, at least) of the desire to defend the 
Concordat, statements protecting money collected at church 
Masses from tax, references to the image of a traditionally 
religious peasant who is tied to the belief of his forefathers 
as much as he is to his land--as a result of all this... 
<H5>  A Faint Odor of Incense </H5>
  ...has began to surround the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. 
  It is difficult to say how many representatives of the 
clergy 
have been influenced by it. There are priests, such as the 
well-known Boguslaw Bijak, who have been engaged in the policy 
of improving relations with the peasants for a long time. Many 
examples of contacts between peasant activists and rural priests 
are no secret. All the same, it is not very likely that the 
church will get really involved in the coming self-governmental 
elections, or in any other elections in the near future. 
  Representatives of the hierarchy are rather cautious. "I do 
not know whether this is merely a demonstration or the real and 
true attachment of a great number of people--of farmers or 
people linked to farming--which is tied to the church," says 
Cardinal Jozef Glemp. 
  Caution as well as friendliness is also recommended by 
rightist politicians, traditionally linked to the church. "It 
is a very good thing that the PSL is willing to defend Catholic 
interests," says Marek Jurek. "However, we must wait and see 
how it will react to really important issues, such as the 
defense of the unborn." 
  He believes that neither the members of the party, where one 
can come across "former members of the Polish United Workers' 
Party," nor the roots of Pawlak's party, "which stems from SL 
Wola [not further identified] or from PSL-Liberation," nor the 
behavior of the PSL Deputies' Club when the antiabortion bill 
was being considered, guarantee that the PSL will defend 
Catholic tenets in politics. 
<H5>  We Do Not Envy, We Are Not Surprised </H5>
  Rightist politicians give assurances that the increasingly 
closer relations between the PSL and the church are not a cause 
of envy or surprise for them. "The church cannot afford to be 
in conflict with the establishment [preceding word in English]; 
it has certain things to see through, such as the Concordat; the 
PSL may become a supporter of the church. In the doctrinal 
sense, it is enough to broaden the peasants' economic 
antiliberalism with philosophical antiliberalism--to transform 
from a party of young Boryna [a peasant character in Polish 
literature] to a party of old Boryna," explains one of the 
coalition politicians. 
  More radical PSL activists, such as Jacek Soska, do not like 
the party's gravitation toward Christian-national positions. 
This is not only because they differ as far as the diagnosis 
concerning the party's electorate's expectations is concerned; 
they also first of all ask what their party will gain if it 
develops closer relations with the church. The question that is 
frequently asked is whether the PSL, in fact, needs the special 
favors of the church. As is often recalled, this party won 
voters with its criticism of the economic policy of the 
Solidarity governments. It did not really get very deep into the 
philosophical side of things.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Croatia sent a letter today to Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary-general's special envoy [for Yugoslavia], protesting 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's visit to the occupied areas of the 
Republic of Croatia without permission from the Croatian 
Government. The Foreign Ministry assesses that the visit 
contravenes all relevant Security Council resolutions and 
documents which confirm the sovereignty and integrity of the 
Republic of Croatia. It will also have negative repercussions 
on the implementation of the above mentioned documents and on 
diplomatic efforts directed toward normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations and the peaceful reintegration of the 
occupied areas into the constitutional and legal system of the 
Republic of Croatia. This is why Mr. Akashi was asked to do 
everything within his power to prevent any future occurrence of 
such events which seriously threaten peace in this region. 
  Niko Bezmalinovic, ambassador of the Republic of Croatia to 
the Russian Federation, has sent a similar protest letter to the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, by Ilija Zurobac; place and date not given: "I 
Shall Fulfill the Demands of the Nation"] 
  [Text] The most important thing now is to immediately 
kickstart the paralyzed economy, to return some of the armed 
people from the front, and to start the professionalization of 
the army. Afterward, we will start public works in forestry and 
agriculture, and the reconstruction of Krajina. In this way, we 
will create the conditions for a normal functioning of the 
state, while drawing a sizable number of people into the 
reconstruction of the war-torn republic of Serbian Krajina 
[RSK]. All this, newly elected RSK President Milan Martic 
emphasizes, is contained in his electoral program. 
  Everything that I have promised, he says, starting with a 
stable and efficient economy, the establishment of legal order, 
the revitalization of the economy, the social program, 
diplomacy, and naturally, the unification of the Serbian lands, 
I intend to carry out. However, prior to the unification we 
must build a stable country, with a strong defense and economy. 
I hope that we will accomplish this within a relatively short 
period of time and that we will not longer need to ask for aid 
from Serbia, but will help it as much as we can. 
  Milan Martic does not doubt that he will get the support of 
the RSK Assembly for everything that he intends to do, 
regardless of the fact that it is the SDS [Serbian Democratic 
Party] of Krajina and the SRS [Serbian Radical Serbian] for 
Krajina, which support Dr. Milan Babic, that have the majority 
in the new parliament. 
  Nobody has an absolute majority in our parliament, Martic 
says. The SDS of Krajina has 31 deputies and can only achieve a 
majority through a coalition. I am not worried by this because 
I will carry out talks with the chiefs of the parliamentary 
groups and the leaders of the parties and demand that they 
respect the will of the people. I recommend them to refrain 
from working toward the differentiation and obstruction of the 
authorities, as the people expect a better life and a stable 
country for all of us. I will extend my hand to everyone, and 
give them a chance to work in the joint interests. The national 
interest of the Serbian people must be above party interests, 
Martic says. 
<H5>  Adamantly Against Profiteers </H5>
  By saying this, President Martic emphasizes that the new 
government will carry a great burden and responsibility, as an 
extremely capable cadre is needed for the realization of such an 
ambitious program. Martic says that the government will be 
formed among the most capable people in the RSK, regardless of 
their party membership. The Krajina residents who are currently 
in Serbia or Montenegro, among whom are numerous acclaimed 
businessmen, will definitely be included, too. Martic's 
intention is to create capable teams of experts, consisting of 
powerful personalities and acclaimed businessmen, who will be 
prepared for round-the-clock, self-sacrificing work. 
  When asked whom he would like to see at the head of such a 
government, Martic did not wish to give a precise answer. It is 
inevitable, he says, that he holds consultations before he 
announces the name of the prime minister designate. However, he 
will do this soon. 
  One of the conditions for the RSK to become a truly stable 
country is also the information system, of which a real mess has 
been made in the electoral campaign. This is one of the 
priority tasks, the president says. In a moment in which 
efforts are being undertaken to create a unified information 
space of all Serbian lands, it is intolerable that our 
information system is being fragmented into some sort of 
communal, and other, media systems. 
  Asked to comment on the divisions between the "north" and 
the 
"south" of Krajina and the ways in which they reflect other 
problems, Milan Martic says that this division does not exist. 
There are differences that will definitely be overcome. The 
north and the south of the RSK wish to live together and none of 
them wish to secede, as has often been overemphasized, Martic 
says. We will find a way that nobody will be harmed, he adds, 
that all who work will be stimulated. 
  I have nothing against lavish hosts and rich people if they 
have acquired their property honestly. However, I am a fierce 
opponent of all who have acquired wealth through profiteering, 
theft, and criminal activities. With such we shall deal 
mercilessly. They will all be held responsible, that is for 
sure, Martic emphasizes. 
<H5>  No Bargaining With Krajina </H5>
  The economic, political, and other trends in the RSK are in 
many ways also influenced by the republic of Srpska. It is 
natural, Martic says, that we are also "interwoven" in the 
Geneva negotiations. If we do not stick together, there will be 
no survival. The main Krajina capacities are linked to 
companies in the republic of Srpska, and, with the formation of 
a consortium of experts, the economies of the RSK, the republic 
of Srpska, and Serbia have been thoroughly linked. This is a 
way toward the formation of a unified economic territory of the 
Serbian lands. There will soon be unification of the monetary 
system and the new Yugoslav "super dinar" is being introduced in 
the RSK. 
  It is realistic to expect that the unification of all 
Serbian 
lands will materialize this year already, Martic says. Many 
Krajina residents have left their homes and have ended up in 
Serbia, Montenegro, and all over Europe. Their fate is 
uncertain for the time being, however, the RSK president says 
that this will be resolved soon. We have already have prepared 
a program that will be applicable to all those who have left 
Krajina. We will cooperate closely with the High Commissioner 
for Refugees and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia and 
Montenegro. We will demand that all those who have 
unjustifiably gained refugee status be found and immediately 
returned to their homes. The majority of them have left their 
houses in Krajina. If they do not want to return, we will be 
forced to confiscate their property. Naturally, we cannot apply 
the same treatment to the Serbian refugees from Croatia, they 
are a special category, Martic adds. 
  Many see the way out of the situation, in neither peace nor 
war, in bargaining with the Krajina territories with Croatia. 
Significant regions and towns are on auction. Milan Martic 
categorically denies all these stories and malicious 
disinformation that are, according to him, aimed at disuniting 
the RSK. 
  There is no substance to these stories, Martic says. There 
is no bargaining with Krajina, not a single part of Serbian 
soil. True enough, we cannot regain Western Slavonija now, 
however we have not given up on this region. We cannot resettle 
the Serbs from that area there, and we cannot even promise them 
this now. However, it is definite that, if they return there, 
they will not be doomed to the Croatian checkerboard [reference 
to Croatian flag]. For the time being, I believe, they are 
safer in Baranja, Eastern Slavonija, and Western Srem, where 
they should feel like equal citizens. I expect the old settlers 
to accept them as their own. 
<H5>  [Box 1, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Only on an Equal Footing </H5>
  The statement about the cooperation of the governments of 
the 
FRY and Croatia is a positive step in the resolution of 
Serbian-Croatian relations. It represents the insistence on a 
peaceful solution of problems and offers a guarantee of peace. 
It is important that the statement does not prejudice a 
political solution, which gives hope that, with sufficient 
engagement and patience, a final solution will be reached, Milan 
Martic says. The fact that Croatia and its leaders use this to 
prove that the international community considers Krajina to be 
Croatian territory has no realistic grounds. I am not surprised 
by Tudjman's statements, because he has not prepared his people 
for the truth, and it is thus logical that he always looks for 
ways to throw sand in their eyes and placate them with promises. 
In the future, Krajina will strive to win an equal status in all 
international negotiations, just like the Serbian Republic. Our 
fate will not be tailored without us. 
<H5>  [Box 2, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Without Vengefulness </H5>
  The circumstances made Milan Martic become a politican, too. 
As he says he understands his current role as a transitional 
phase in the constitution of a unified Serbian state. He 
believes that his mandate will last a shorter time than 
envisaged. This legendary warrior and chief of the Krajina 
police, known as a man of high moral qualities, says the 
following about his role as a politician: 
  I believe that I will justify the trust of the nation and 
accomplish the joint goal -- the unification of the Serbian 
lands. This means numerous changes in the RSK, primarily cadre 
changes. Naturally, cadre changes must take place, but there 
will definitely be no revenge again anyone. All changes will be 
implemented exclusively for the sake of the faster development 
of Krajina's prosperity. Generally speaking, the army will 
undergo the biggest changes. If we realize the program 
according to the established schedule, I hope that the RSK will 
have a professional army and considerably stronger defense in 
half a year's time. 
<H5>  [Box 3, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Unified State </H5>
  There is no alternative to the unification of the Serbian 
lands. I believe that a unified Serbian state will be formed 
very quickly. This is the only solution by which we will grow 
economically stronger and become a stable European country. 
Naturally, the capital of this country will be Belgrade and its 
president Slobodan Milosevic, Martic says. 
<H5>  [Box 4, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Zhirinovskiy </H5>
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is a friend of the Serbian people and 
I 
am glad that he has visited the Serbian lands. I am awaiting 
meeting him joy. I believe that he can do a lot for the Serbian 
nation. We, of course, would not consider comparing him to 
anyone in Russia, as the entire Russian nation is our friend and 
we expect support from him, the RSK president says.

  [Text] Knin, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Croatia on Monday [31 
January] violated a ceasefire agreement it had concluded with 
the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), only a day after putting 
its signature on a document extending it to February 28, the 
R.S.K. army command said on Tuesday. Croatian mortars shelled 
Serb villages in the Novigrad hinterland, the R.S.K. army said 
in a statement and added that small arms fire had been reported 
in the areas of Vrlika and Drnis in the south of the R.S.K., and 
in the regions of Lika and western Slavonia. Late last year, 
the R.S.K. and Croatia had agreed to observe a ceasefire during 
Christmas. The agreement was first extended on January 13, and 
again on Sunday. The latest extension was mediated by U.N. 
peace-keepers. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed by Serbs in late 1991 within their 
ethnic and historic boundaries in parts of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia, in response to Croatia's violent secession 
from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempt to downgrade the 
Serbs to an ethnic minority. The R.S.K. was placed under U.N. 
protection in March of 1992, but this has not prevented Croatia 
from attacking it three times since in an attempt to impose its 
rule there by force.

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- Milan Babic, chairman of 
the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina, and Vojislav Seselj, 
chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, signed an inter-party 
agreement in Belgrade today on a coalition for the formation of 
new bodies of power following elections in the republic of Serb 
Krajina. It was stated that the newly-formed coalition will act 
jointly in the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina and will 
jointly form a government and other bodies of power. The 
agreement envisages that each party, i.e. member of the 
coalition, should participate in the government and other bodies 
of power in proportion to the number of seats in the Krajina 
parliament. 
  In last week's parliamentary elections the Serbian 
Democratic 
Party of Krajina won 32 seats while the Radicals won 16 of the 
overall number of 84 seats in the assembly of the republic of 
Serb Krajina. A statement from the meeting today says that the 
coalition partners reached an agreement on the division of the 
posts in the presidency of the Krajina assembly and Krajina 
government which correspond to these parties. 
  Following this meeting, Seselj stated that the two parties 
have agreed that one party will hold the post of assembly 
speaker while the other will have the prime minister's post. 
The political goal of the coalition, as the statement says, is 
the affirmation of the national and state interests of the 
Serbian people and the republic of Serb Krajina, and the 
securing of stable conditions for the democratic functioning of 
bodies of power, while the basic goal is the unification of all 
Serbian lands and the establishment of a unified Serbian state.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received in the 
presidential palace today a delegation of the Serb National 
Party [in Croatia] comprising party chairman Milan Djukic, 
Veselin Pejnovic, and Veljko Miljevic, a statement from the 
president's office says. They informed President Tudjman about 
efforts made by their party toward normalizing Croatian-Serbian 
relations, particularly about the party's initiative called 
Peace Without Alternative. President Tudjman said that Croatia 
was resolved to make necessary efforts for the Croatian areas 
under UN protection to be reintegrated into the constitutional 
and legal order of the Republic of Croatia, to achieve the 
normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, and to restore 
permanent peace and stability in the area, primarily through 
political means. The talks were also attended by the 
president's advisers Smiljko Sokol and Ivic Pasalic, the 
statement says.

  [Text] In an interview with TA SR [Slovak news agency], 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said that there have never 
been direct talks on MiG-29 aircraft between the Slovak Army and 
Israel. He was responding to the REUTER report in which Foreign 
Minister Jozef Moravcik said that Israel is able to refit this 
type of aircraft to Western standards and has allegedly already 
discussed cooperation. 
  Imrich Andrejcak said that the talks between Jozef Moravcik 
and the Israeli partners were not binding and were probably 
misinterpreted. However, the defense minister did not rule out 
the possibility that our Army would consider modernizing 
MiG-21's and MiG-29's as early as this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by radio </F>
editor David Stahlavsky; place and date not given--live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Stahlavsky] Let me conclude 
by asking you about a totally different subject. Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian nationalists, again spoke 
unfavorably about the Czech Republic last week. What is your 
reaction to his statement that the Czechs will soon lose Moravia 
and keep only Prague and breweries producing bitter beer? 
  [Klaus] I admire his general knowledge as he says such 
things 
without the slightest doubt--once about Japan, then again about 
Russia's southern Asian neighbors or about Europe. I do not 
think there is any need to comment on this. 
  As far as this is concerned, I am troubled by a very 
different thing, which was also very clearly demonstrated at the 
Davos Forum. The issue is not Zhirinovskiy himself because a 
considerable number of Zhirinovskiys can emerge provided certain 
conditions exist inside a country, if that country is not coping 
with its internal events, as Russia is not currently coping with 
its task of transformation, transformation of the country with 
its past into something totally different. And this creates 
fertile soil for such remarks. 
  Thus, there is no need to make witty comments on 
Zhirinovskiy's statement. The issue is what small contribution 
can be made in order to deprive such Zhirinovskiys of their 
fertile soil. 
  [Stahlavsky] What would be the Czech Government's reaction 
if 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy expressed an interest in visiting the Czech 
Republic? 
  [Klaus] I would not like to formulate any official stand 
right now. First, I hope he will not get any such idea. I hope 
no one will invite him here, although I can imagine some small 
extremist groups that might be interested in doing so. [passage 
omitted] 
  Of course, the Czech Republic is generally in favor of the 
free movement of people in the world. We would not like to 
create a precedent by preventing someone by default from 
entering our territory. This is what the communist regime did 
so many times. 
  We need to be careful in this field. However, I must say 
that we are not inclined to invite this guest.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Ministers Karel Dyba 
and Vladimir Dlouhy returned today from the session of the World 
Economic Forum in Davos. Shortly after his return, Klaus said: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] First, the Davos meeting presented, 
just as it has every year--and this is the fifth time we have 
been there--an exceptionally suitable opportunity to represent 
the Czech Republic in the world, which, I think, was carried out 
successfully during the whole series of meetings, talks, and 
speeches the three of us had there. 
  Second, the forum was an opportunity to say something about 
the world and European problems. We tried to do that, too, and I 
think the voice of the Czech Republic was audible and strong. 
  Third, Davos provided an opportunity for a large number of 
bilateral talks and meetings, which we had not only with a 
number of world politicians but also with bankers and 
businessmen, and we can name the individual countries with whom 
we had talks. We had a meeting with Chancellor Kohl. We had a 
meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto. There were talks 
with the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian prime ministers. 
There were talks with partners from African and Latin American 
countries, and so on. [end recording]

situation in Europe and about bilateral relations, which he 
designated as very good. He said that Finland, just as Austria, 
Norway, and Sweden, should soon become a member of the European 
Union, where it will seek its security guarantees. Finland is 
not interested in entering NATO or any other security 
structures. It considers the Partnership for Peace, however, a 
good initiative for East European countries. 
  In an interview for Radiozurnal, Haavisto praised the work

  [Excerpts] As we have already informed you, Finnish Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto continued his working visit to the 
Czech Republic today and gave an exclusive interview to Czech 
radio. Miroslav Konvalina was the interviewer. 
  [Konvalina] [passage omitted] At a briefing preceding our 
interview, the Finnish foreign minister said that his country 
was not applying for membership in NATO. My second question 
therefore concerned European security systems: Which would best 
suit Finland? 
  [Begin Haavisto recording, in Finnish fading into Czech 
translation] I think that, when we applied for membership in the 
European Union, we thought that if we became a member, this 
would be the best way to become part of European security 
structures. We wish to build our security with other countries 
within the framework of the European Union. This is the path we 
have chosen. 
  I also think the Partnership for Peace initiative is a good 
solution for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. If we 
are asked to join this initiative along with the other countries 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, we 
shall certainly find a way to join it. [end recording] 
  Finally, I asked Heikki Haavisto in which areas we could 
reinforce mutual cooperation. 
  [Begin Haavisto recording, in Finnish fading into Czech 
translation] It is, naturally, very important that Josef 
Zieleniec and I had a lively political discussion. I think we 
can strenghten our cooperation in the economy and also in 
political spheres, such as within the United Nations. Your 
country is now a nonpermanent UN Security Council member. This 
provides prospects for cooperation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Two-Thirds of Radio Audience Listen </F>
to Czech Radio"] 
  [Text] Prague--Last year, the number of listeners of Czech 
Radio (CRo) did not significantly decline. According to the 
surveys, the share of the CRo in the total number of radio 
listeners is approximately 65 percent. "The situation at the 
Praha, Radiozurnal, and Vltava radio stations is stable," 
Jaroslav Pochmon, director of programing, said when assessing 
1993. The most popular programs are the Radiozurnal Segments of 
Narrative and Music [bloky slova a hudby]. The Morning Stream 
[ranni proud] is listened to by an audience of 1.7 million, and 
the Praha station Good Morning [dobre jitro] has 1.2 million 
listeners. 
  On Saturday [29 January], the management of the Radio 
Metropolis radio station sent a proposal for a "nonstandard" 
solution to the complex situation of the CRo in connection with 
financing its newscast program on the long-waves band to CRo 
Director General Vlastimil Jezek. The Radio Metropolis proposes 
that a "nonbiased private entity with sufficient financial, 
professional, and political guarantees, assume the long-wave 
broadcast. A condition would be a close programing cooperation 
with Czech Radio.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary group leader of </F>
the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Peter Petan on 30 January; 
place not given: "Growth Will Start by Itself -- Gabor Kuncze 
Is Seeking the Answer"] 
  [Excerpts] After the three-day delegate meeting of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Gabor Kuncze, the party's 
prime ministerial candidate, gave an interview to UJ 
MAGYARORSZAG. [passage omitted] 
  [Petan] It has been said that you did not make the cause of 
the Hungarians living beyond the border part of your program. 
What is the reason for this? 
  [Kuncze] This has not been said. However, we did say that 
we do not wish to make the cause of the Hungarians beyond the 
border part of our campaign. As a matter of fact, other parties 
have also agreed with us on this. At our talks with Prime 
Minister Peter Boross, he also approved that this issue should 
not be made part of the campaign, rather, the settlement of 
their problems should be in all programs as a goal to be 
resolved. 
  [Petan] At the meeting of delegates, you were radiant with 
determination. It was stated many times that you cannot imagine 
the next government being formed without the free democrats, in 
fact, that you cannot imagine that it would not be the SZDSZ 
that forms the government. You called for unity and 
cooperation, advocated conciliation, and recommended the 
competition of the programs to everyone instead of flinging 
abuse at each other. Do you not think that this change of the 
image is a little late? How much formality and how much real 
content is in this determination? 
  [Kuncze] On one hand, the fact that the SZDSZ is able to 
appear as a party like this is not a change of image, rather, it 
is the result of much work and a long process. We have been 
working on this since Ivan Peto was elected chairman. On the 
other hand, there is no external appearance and inner content, 
these cannot be separated. The SZDSZ looks 100 percent like a 
party that is preparing for a governmental role. It has an 
accepted election program that can be turned into a government 
program when the situation arises, it has suitable candidates 
who can gain people's confidence, and we have adequate political 
experience and practice. In my view, the SZDSZ is indeed a party 
that can be elected. [passage omitted] 
  [Petan] The biggest emphasis was placed on economic issues. 
In your view, how many years will it take for the economy to 
become restored and what are the most important tasks? 
  [kuncze] The economy will be in order when the conditions 
for growth are established; after that, growth will 
automatically start in the economy. Therefore, the real big 
issue is the establishment of the conditions for growth. The 
necessary measures will have to be made this year, and the 
system of regulations will have to be adjusted from 1 January 
1995. Through these, it will be possible to establish the 
conditions in one or two years, and following this, it will be 
up to the economy whether growth starts, which, as a matter of 
fact, is the precondition for increasing living standards. 
  [Petan] Do you really think that the next government will be 
forced to do its work under much more difficult circumstances 
than the Antall-government was? 
  [Kuncze] The situation is worse than it was four years ago 
in several areas of the macro-economy. This is a fact whether 
we think about the foreign trade deficit, the foreign balance of 
payments deficit, or the domestic balance of payments. We are 
saying that the situation has to be honestly examined because 
solutions will have to be found to the real conditions. Today, 
the scope for maneuver in politics is much smaller than it was 
four years ago, there is little point in arguing about this 
because it is obvious. The unemployment of 700,000 is a terrible 
problem, and the budget deficit is a problem that obstructs the 
economy. Answers have to be found to these questions. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Petan] You clearly declared that the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] is an elections and political opponent of the 
SZDSZ. This was an answer to those who predicted the coalition 
cooperation of the two parties. At the same time, you also 
stated that, in the interest of solving the country's problems, 
you are willing to cooperate with anyone who can and wants to 
act. Do you not feel that you have opened another door by 
saying this? 
  [Kuncze] Why do you not ask if I feel that this is a door 
opened in the other direction? The SZDSZ has always emphasized 
that, as a party in the center, it is open to all democratic 
parties if the country's governability demands this and the 
principles and programs can be harmonized. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Radoman Bozovic, 
chairman of the Chamber of Citizens, one of the two chambers of 
the Yugoslav parliament, said on Tuesday that Serbian and 
federal authorities were ready to discuss with the Albanian 
minority from the Serbian Province of Kosovo and Metohija the 
utilization of rights they have been given but were unwilling to 
discuss the secession of this province from Serbia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians in the Serbian 
Province of Kosovo just as other national minorities in 
Yugoslavia enjoy all civil rights in accordance with the highest 
international standards, Bozovic told a seven-member Norwegian 
parliamentary delegation, which is on a visit to Yugoslavia. As 
it was announced the Norwegian parliamentarians were interested 
about the state of human rights in the Serbian Province of 
Kosovo and Metohija. 
  They assessed that it was in the interest of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and Norway to solve this problem in a 
peaceful manner, excluding all types of secession, and at the 
same time expressed the stand that the realization of human 
rights in general was being made difficult due to the 
international sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  At a separate meeting, the chairman of the Yugoslav 
parliament's Board for Foreign Policy, Borisav Jovic, told the 
Norwegian parliamentarians that the Albanians in Kosovo were not 
using the given rights due to their blind obedience to 
separatist organizations which are politically boycotting the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Under the influence of the 
separatists, Kosovo Albanians were banning their children from 
going to schools thought [as received] in their own language 
according to the state educational program, Jovic noted. He 
warned that the recognition of the Albanian separatism would 
lead to unforeseable chaos in Europe and to war in the Balkans. 
Jovic said that Europe's hugest contribution would be to 
convince the separatists in Kosovo that the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia was their state and that Europe would not stand 
behind them if they wished to tear this state. Jovic pointed 
out that not a single party in the federal parliament approves 
of separatist behaviour in Kosovo. 
  The Norwegian parliamentarians are to stay in Yugoslavia 
until February 6 and are to visit the Kosovo towns of Pristina 
and Pec. They are to pay a visit to the capital city of the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Skoplje.

  [Text] Trebinje, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Russian people have 
chosen a new political course in both domestic and foreign 
policy, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, stressed in Trebinje this evening. 
Zhirinovskiy was greeted by around 10,000 citizens of Trebinje 
and neighboring municipalities in eastern Herzegovina who 
gathered around Ducic's monument in Freedom Square. 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Russian people had suffered a 
lot of hardships in the past years, but that the Serb people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were exposed to greater hardships. 
  "This is the war which has been waged against the Slavs for 
more than a century. I represent a country which has for years 
defended the Orthodox world from barbarians," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  According to him, the enemies of the Slav cause and the 
Orthodox world are now looking for a different weapon to use 
"against us." That weapon is religion, because the Catholics 
from Rome and the Muslims from the south are trying to destroy 
the Slav world, Zhirinovskiy believes. 
  "You are standing at the very border of our Slav world," 
Zhirinovskiy said, recalling that there are no enemies in the 
north, east, and west, but, he said, the last enemy remains in 
the south [sentence as received]. 
  "You Serbs are in a difficult position, you have been 
encircled from all sides, but they forgot that you and we are 
one people and that there are 300 million of us," Zhirinovskiy 
said to tumultuous applause. 
  "If they created a community of nations in the west, we have 
to create another alliance with you, Serbs -- a Slav alliance in 
the east. Then peace and democracy will be everywhere and there 
will be no states to impose their will on us. Our East Europe 
is spiritually richer than the West, and if we take into account 
military issues, the Russian military factor is the strongest in 
the world," Zhirinovskiy stressed. 
  "You received moral support from us. But if it becomes 
necessary we will send you thousands of volunteers. If that 
proves insufficient, new weapons will come from us. We will 
throw our enemy into the sea," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  "We have to tell our enemies that the time has come to stop 
mistreating the Slavs. The time has come for the borders of the 
Slav-Christian world to be made secure. I am not threatening 
anyone, but let the Vatican know that the borders of the 
Catholic Church influence end in Italy," Zhirinovskiy said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Party of the Democratic Left Chairman Peter </F>
Weiss by Julius Gembicky; place and date not given: "The Policy 
of Subversion Is Destroying Slovakia"] 
  [Text] At a recent meeting in Spisska Nova Ves of Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] supporters, Sergej Kozlik, 
deputy chairman of the governing movement, cast doubts on the 
"erroneous" voting of two reputable individuals--L. Pittner and 
P. Weiss. We interviewed Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] 
Chairman Peter Weiss and sought a response to this statement. 
  [Gembicky] Suggestions have also been made in connection 
with the statement by the deputy prime minister that, in the 
wake of the Slovak National Party [SNS], there could also be a 
split, provoked from the outside, within the SDL. Do you think 
they are realistic? 
  [Weiss] Such statements testify to the lack of 
matter-of-fact arguments and the political uncertainty arising 
from the ratio of votes in parliament--75:75. They also testify 
to the political methods that are part and parcel of the 
HZDS--that is, it gains a serious partner not on the basis of a 
political agreement but by indulging in deception, bringing 
discredit, engaging in corruption, exerting pressure, and 
causing disintegration. However, the gentlemen from the HZDS 
are mistaken if they think they will succeed in breaking up our 
party the way they did the SNS--by corruption that even the 
nationalists' representatives themselves did not try to hide. 
We did not enter into politics with grand slogans only to swap 
them at the appropriate moment for lucrative posts for a few 
months. 
  [Gembicky] What is the fundamental difference between your 
own and the government's draft amendment to the law on large 
privatization? Is a compromise between the two drafts possible? 
  [Weiss] During the talks with HZDS representatives, we 
strove to ensure that the rational core of the government draft 
amendment would be enhanced in the Privatization Committee by 
utilizing the new elements from our draft in the new version of 
the law that would be submitted by the group of deputies. Thus, 
there would be no need to comment on each version of the draft 
law. This version, which was drafted by Mr. Tomecko and J. 
Plesnik, has been prepared, but the HZDS rejected this course of 
action. One obstacle, apart from other problems, is that the 
privatization minister and the president of the National 
Property Fund [FNM] are one and the same person and that the 
finance minister and the chairman of the FNM Supervisory Council 
are also one and the same. The fact that the government does not 
want to pull back from this concentration of power is an 
indication of its unequivocal intention to carry out 
privatization on the basis of political criteria. If the 
government draft law on large privatization is approved, there 
is a risk that it will become infested with corruption. 
Privatization will not be sufficiently under the supervision of 
either parliament or the public. The result could be such a 
structure of owners--and also their interlinking to the state 
administration--that it would take a whole generation for us to 
extricate ourselves from such a social mechanism. Therefore, 
the HZDS deputies who raise their hands in favor of this 
amendment will bear an extraordinary, perhaps historical, 
responsibility. If ownership relations in this country are 
changed by such a method, the kind of political regime I am 
concerned about will evolve here. 
  [Gembicky] There is also anxiety among the leadership of 
your party that, when important decisions are being made in 
parliament, the coalition could put pressure on you via the 
issue of returning the former Communist Party of Slovakia's 
property. Is this anxiety warranted? 
  [Weiss] Representatives from the Christian Social Union came 
out with the first wave of speculation. There is no reason for 
me, as the party chairman, to be anxious about anything. I have 
never done anything at variance with the law. This is a purely 
legal dispute. We proceed from the fact that it is absurd to 
interpret the resolution of the former Federal Government and 
Constitutional Law No. 496/90 in such a way that we should again 
return what we have already handed over to the state. It will 
merely depend on the proper course of action by the state 
bodies. If anyone succumbs to the illusion that it is possible 
to exert pressure on the SDL due to this case, he is gravely 
mistaken. 
  [Gembicky] What do you think of the scenario put forward by 
the government coalition, a scenario that envisages, first, the 
approval of a new agenda, proposed by it, for the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR], then the approval of a 
law on deputies, and, finally, the approval of a constitutional 
law on the transfer to a chancellory or presidential system? 
  [Weiss] We have seen how the HZDS leadership has managed to 
discipline and tame the SNS Deputies' Club. Its fundamental 
objective could consist of a return to the old idea of adopting 
a retroactive law according to which those who had resigned from 
their original deputies' clubs or had founded independent clubs 
would have to leave parliament, and substitute deputies would 
take their place. This would restore the ratio of forces that 
existed in parliament in January 1993, and only one or two votes 
would be missing for a constitutional majority. The beauty of 
this is also that the law would be valid only from 1 January 
1993 and that it would not extend back to 1992, when two 
independent deputies also "appeared." However, it would affect 
the Knazkoites [supporters of Alliance of Slovak Democrats 
Chairman Milan Knazko] or, as the case may be, the Cernakites 
[supporters of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak]. If only one or two 
votes were lacking for a constitutional majority, the methods 
tried and tested with the SNS would begin to be utilized. Then, 
if 90 votes were obtained in the NR SR, it would be possible to 
initiate a constitutional change, perhaps not for a chancellory 
but directly for a presidential system. I personally do not 
consider this scenario to be likely because its implementation 
would testify to the catastrophic level of the legal knowledge 
of those deputies who would vote for such a retroactive law. 
  [Gembicky] Realistically, however, what could stand in the 
way of this idea being put forward? 
  [Weiss] Respect for the principles of a law-governed state. 
Let us not punish the deputies who resigned from the HZDS Club 
or other clubs, even though we may have a different political 
and moral view of this, for something that was not at variance 
with the valid law when they did it. 
  [Gembicky] Would the SDL also be willing to cooperate with 
the SNS National Democratic Club in the event the extraordinary 
assembly in Zilina drives its members into the opposition? 
  [Weiss] It is never good to exclude anyone from cooperation 
in advance. If the situation referred to in your question 
arises, this will depend primarily on the club's program and on 
its specific political stances. 
  [Gembicky] From your point of view, what do you think of the 
recommendation made by the president to form a broad government 
coalition, and what is your reaction to the firm rejection of 
this idea by the HZDS district assemblies? For example, do you 
agree with their demands for the resignations of M. Zemko and P. 
Demes from the Office of the President? What do you say to 
their challenge that the deputies from the independent club give 
up their deputies' mandates in favor of the HZDS? 
  [Weiss] All of the demands made at the HZDS district 
assemblies are an expression of the governing movement's 
dominant social character. This movement is, more and more 
obviously, dividing into two streams. A stronger and therefore 
more dominant stream and a weak stream. This dominant stream, 
from which eight deputies have distanced themselves by their 
resignations from the movement, is made up of people who 
perceive politics as an instrument for satisfying their egoistic 
group or personal interests. These people, although they are 
often not up to their jobs, in fact comprise the most intrinsic 
part of the state administration and are "attached" to 
privatization projects. Therefore, they have an absolutely 
natural interest in boosting the power of the HZDS and, if 
possible, power that they would not have to share with anyone. 
These people are allergic to all supervision and to criticism of 
their course of action. They are assuming the right to 
determine who has an opinion or who must not have one. They are 
assuming the right to tell the president who he can and cannot 
have in his office merely because they have a personal aversion 
to someone or because they disagree with his political views. 
These elements of political impropriety, which we made 
substantial use of in the far-off times of the former regime, 
are incongruous in a democratic society and will increase 
tension and arouse anxiety about where the HZDS is heading. 
  [Gembicky] Despite what you have said about the HZDS, there 
are reports directly from the prime minister's circle that he 
has been successfully working on 15 SDL deputies who would 
support the HZDS at a critical moment. Five of them apparently 
are even supposed to be sure things. Do you know anything about 
such fishing in your territorial waters? 
  [Weiss] The prime minister more and more evidently is 
relying not on the quality of his economic policy and his good 
image abroad, but on destabilizing other deputies' clubs. I 
know that such attempts are being made against the SDL. Our 
deputies have told me this. However, the SDL is made of 
different stuff than part of the SNS, which fell apart under 
well-known circumstances. We are not intellectually or morally 
as bad as some people would like to think. 
  The policy based on subversion and disintegration is 
destroying Slovakia. Those who rely on it, like the proverbial 
drowning man clutching at a straw, may, in the end, become 
victims of it themselves.
