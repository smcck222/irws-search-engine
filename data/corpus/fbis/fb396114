<F P=106> [Interview with Endre Juhasz, administrative state secretary </F>
at the Ministry for International Economic Relations, by Katalin 
Bossanyi; place and date not given: "Customs Lifted, Rights of 
Freedom Extended"] 
  [Text] Hungary's Association Agreement with the European 
Union comes into force today, 1 February. We interviewed Endre 
Juhasz on this occasion on the significance of the agreement and 
the chances of the Hungarian economy to catch up with and 
integrate into Europe. 
  [Bossanyi] What do we have to know about today: What will 
change compared to the already known export allowances? 
  [Juhasz] The trade section of the association agreement came 
into force in March 1992, therefore, the paragraphs of the 
agreement that are valid from today do not affect the already 
functioning trade system. In fact, in 1993 in Copenhagen, a 
decision was made on accelerating and extending this. For 
Hungary, and the European Union [EU], the 1 February date rather 
has a significance of principle. From today, the regulations 
that deal with the other three market economy freedom rights -- 
in addition to the trade agreement -- will begin to operate. 
These apply to the movement of labor, capital, and services. 
Through this, rights and obligations that are very important 
for Hungary come into force, and at the same time, the 
implementation of the cooperation program can also begin. The 
preparation of the legal harmonization program belongs here, and 
the planning of projects affecting industry, agriculture, 
investment development, and education and training, which we 
have not been able to start yet. The cooperation also extends 
to various areas of transport and traffic, environmental 
protection, and culture. 
  [Bossanyi] Let us look at the already existing section of 
the Association Agreement, namely the trade section. In your 
experience, is the agreement entirely advantageous for the 
country or are there any areas where we are now in a 
disadvantageous position for various reasons? 
  [Juhasz] In 1992, the agreement had a clearly dynamic effect 
because Hungarian exports to the European Community increased 
much faster than exports to other areas that have similar market 
economies -- for example the countries of the European Free 
Trade Association [EFTA] or the United States. This no longer 
applied in 1993, mainly due to the western recession. The 
decline of our exports to the EU was more marked than to other 
regions. 
  [Bossanyi] Does this mean that the Association Agreement did 
not give us concrete advantages in the deepening recession? 
  [Juhasz] On the contrary. Without the agreement, our 
exports would probably have fallen even more. Even then, we 
managed to use our preferential quotas, except in some areas of 
agriculture. However, the lack of competitive Hungarian products 
was the main reason for the latter. 
  [Bossanyi] Did we also fill our textile quota? 
  [Juhasz] We had the opportunity to do so, exports were not 
hindered by the quotas. In this area, the decrease of labor 
applied to imported materials with the purpose of reexport was a 
disadvantage for us. Quotas no longer exist in other industrial 
areas. However, there are so-called customs ceilings and 
customs quotas. If we exceeded these, then in theory, the EU 
could reinstate the customs but this did not happen last year. 
All in all, we can say that the Association Agreement gave 
greater scope to Hungarian goods in spite of the recession. 
  [Bossanyi] When the Association Agreement was signed, many 
interest groups -- and mainly the domestic agrarian lobby -- 
argued that the Hungarian government had given concessions in 
the hope of achieving association relatively quickly, and it 
does not adequately protect, for example, agricultural exports 
from the EC's protectionism. Now they probably feel that their 
worries were justified. 
  [Juhasz] I do not think so because the fact that we did not 
make full use of the agricultural quotas mainly has domestic 
economic reasons. Naturally, it can always be said that the 
doors could have been opened wider in the area of technical 
conditions. However, it is our experience that we usually have 
problems filling the quotas. 
  [Bossanyi] The EU very firmly protects and supports its 
agricultural producers, while in Hungary, the opposite of this 
is happening. The producers of the countries that became 
associate members earlier -- Greece, Turkey, and Spain -- also 
suffered the same way. Will we also support the agricultural 
interests that they represent? 
  [Juhasz] In the current phase, we have a conflict of 
interests with the EU's agricultural lobby because we would also 
like to expand our marketing possibilities in the future. The 
EU's agricultural producers and their interest groups are our 
competitors. Naturally, we are trying to learn from the 
experience of other countries but this does not mean that we do 
not compete with each other. 
  [Bossanyi] Are you holding talks on further extending the 
quotas? 
  [Juhasz] In the light of the GATT Uruguay round, the quotas 
will presumably have to be renegotiated. The conceptual system 
of the association agreement will have to be amended because a 
decision was arrived at within the framework of the 1993 GATT 
agreement that measures other than customs have to be 
eradicated. One of these, for example, is the skimming system. 
Our concept was in accordance with a former system, therefore, 
this can now be changed. In my view, we will probably have 
talks on adjusting the customs and we are hoping to use this to 
expand our advantages. 
  [Bossanyi] These will not only apply to agricultural 
products, will they? 
  [Juhasz] They will. In the case of industrial products, in 
the spirit of the Copenhagen program, all limitations will be 
lifted within a foreseeable time. From 31 December 1994, all 
customs duties will cease to exist in the so-called sensitive 
product groups. There are almost 100 of these. Customs duties 
will cease to exist on steel products by the end of 1995 and on 
textiles by the end of 1996. This affects almost all industrial 
products, therefore, we consider that the possibilities of 
Hungarian products getting to Union markets are good. In 
addition to this, we are also making progress in standardization 
and in coordinating the quality requirements, but this is a 
continuous task, it is not determined by deadlines. 
  [Bossanyi] What changes can be expected in the assertion of 
the other three economic rights of freedom that are now becoming 
a possibility for us? 
  [Juhasz] The current step of the Association Agreement opens 
the markets for Hungary in areas other than trade. However, 
these deadlines are relatively long, some are five or 10 years 
away, but some areas come into force now. For example, in 
purchases by authorities, we can participate in the EU's 
contract awarding procedures according to national treatment 
from 1 February. This means that, in bids, the Hungarian 
suppliers will be treated the same way as the other enterprises 
of the Union. At the same time, we will only give them this 
right in 10 years' time. This is also part of the process of 
catching up. 
  [Bossanyi] Will our employment chances increase? 
  [Juhasz] It is well known that very little progress has been 
made in this area. However, it is not negligible that Hungarian 
workers will have to be treated without discrimination in the 
area of the EU as regards their working conditions and pay. 
  [Bossanyi] Is the associate membership a forerunner to full 
membership? 
  [Juhasz] The government declared that it wants to achieve 
full membership by the end of the century. The associate 
membership makes it possible for us to deal with this in an 
institutional form. Talks on Hungarian membership will begin 
when the EFTA talks are completed. This will probably be in 
1994. In addition to this, the Union will convene an 
inter-governmental conference in 1996 which is meant to 
reexamine the institutional system. This conference should 
ensure that the Union remains able to function in spite of the 
larger membership. It will be decided after this when we can 
begin talks on our membership. Based on our current 
information, we think that this will be in 1997. This is the 
planned scenario. However, a separate government decision is 
needed before the application for membership can be submitted.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Social Democratic Party of Hungary: </F>
"Dear Electors!"] 
  [Text] On 3 October 1993, the united Social Democratic 
Party of Hungary [MSZDP] was established, Zoltan Kiraly is its 
chairman, Istvan Podkoniczky its general secretary, and Endre 
Borbely is its deputy chairman. Thus, we can represent the 
100-years old social democratic values with a renewed force. 
  The MSZDP, the party of society, wants a Hungary, 
  -- where the state serves the interests of society and 
individuals, 
  -- where the basic human rights are respected, everyone is 
free to practice his religion, and, at the same time, state and 
church are separate, 
  -- where religious, ethnic, cultural, or other minorities 
cannot be discriminated against, 
  -- where the equality of women is not only true on paper, 
  -- where citizens' equality of opportunity prevails in 
education and culture, and participation in health and welfare 
provisions is ensured, 
  -- where the burden of taxation is justly shared and people 
can live in security, 
  -- where Eastern-Central European countries that are 
striving 
to establish democratic societies and welfare market economies 
can implement mutually advantageous cooperation, 
  -- where those forms of ownership that are most efficient 
from the economy's and society's point of view exist side by 
side, and the state does not interfere in the economy, 
  -- where the state accepts the obligation for ensuring 
education, culture, health, and welfare provisions, 
  -- where tax and customs allowances are given to those 
enterprises that create workplaces, and unemployment is fought 
through retraining and further training, 
  -- where modern agricultural production is done in 
cooperatives and farms, 
  -- where socially controlled privatization is accomplished 
with the participation of the employees, 
  -- where the influx of foreign capital helps technical 
development and the creation of workplaces, 
  -- where the state, local governments, and society 
institutionally ensure the reduction of natural and 
environmental damage, 
  -- where strong trade unions ensure the interest protection 
of employees, 
  -- where the real value of pensions is preserved through 
legal guarantees, 
  -- where the material subsistence level is guaranteed by a 
social insurance system that includes all citizens, 
  -- where young people beginning their working life can 
acquire dwellings through preferential loans.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "With the Election Program for the </F>
Family and Public Safety, the National Democratic Federation 
Proposes To Reinstate the Death Penalty"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's news conference by the National 
Democratic Forum focused on the family because this issue is an 
organic part of the election program of the National Democratic 
Federation [NDSZ]. According to NDSZ Chairman Imre Pozsgay, this 
is all the more timely because the United Nations has declared 
1994 the year of the family. 
  Analyzing this subject, the NDSZ issued a separate 
information booklet and NDSZ spokesman Karoly Lorant summed up 
the content of this booklet. Among other things, he pointed out 
that while the European countries with the smallest demographic 
increase showed an average of 0.5 percent increase in population 
annually in the past decade, the population of Hungary is 
dropping at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. The role of the 
family is constantly weakening and the percentage of one-parent 
families is increasing. In addition, the number of births is 
decreasing and the health condition of the population is 
constantly deteriorating. It is probably the result of all 
these factors that we are witnessing a worldwide unique 
phenomenon here, namely a decrease in the number of the 
population in peace time. The NDSZ is convinced that one can 
and must change this trend, and the key to this is an increase 
in the role of the family and return to its former social rank. 
  The NDSZ election program wants to find long-term solutions 
by taking all this into consideration, Karoly Lorant pointed 
out. The NDSZ is in favor of coexistence of several generations 
and of support for families with children and for starting a 
family. The NDSZ wants equal opportunities in education and a 
job for every person starting his career. In addition, the NDSZ 
finds it necessary to carry out a thorough modernization of the 
pension system, with particular emphasis on preserving the real 
value of the pensions. 
  In the second half of the news conference, Imre Pozsgay and 
parliament Deputy Zoltan Varga answered questions regarding the 
elections. Imre Pozsgay said that the NDSZ would probably have 
a candidate in every individual election district, as well as a 
list in all the counties and in Budapest. However, Imre Pozsgay 
declined to say anything about the nominees because the list 
must first be accepted by the national committee at its meeting 
scheduled for the middle of February. Imre Pozsgay and Zoltan 
Biro have not yet decided on whether to run as individual 
candidates. At the same time, Imre Pozsgay's words allow us to 
speculate that he would not reject such a development. 
  Zoltan Varga announced at this news conference that together 
with his colleague Peter Szell, they intend to present a legal 
amendment proposal to parliament regarding the restoration of 
the death penalty. Their decision came in the wake of the 
tragedies in their election district and in Szeged and the 
ensuing panic mood.

  [Text] United Nations, Feb 1 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here Tuesday [1 February] that French 
General Bertrand de Lapresle would be the new chief of UN forces 
in the former Yugoslavia. If confirmed by the UN Security 
Council, he will replace compatriot General Jean Cot at the end 
of March, Butrus-Ghali told a news conference. 
  Paris had proposed de Lapresle as Cot's replacement one week 
ago. France has the largest contingent of troops in the former 
Yugoslavia with 6,000 soldiers. 
  Butrus-Ghali and Cot had disagreed over the general's 
repeated public demands that he be given the authority to order 
use of air support in Bosnia-Hercegovina if he deemed it 
necessary. Butrus-Ghali delegated this authority to his 
civilian representative in Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, 
for two operations specific to Srebrenica and Tuzla.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Former Polish Premier 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki could resign from his post of UN rapporteur 
on human rights in the former Yugoslavia, an official said here 
Wednesday [2 February]. 
  "I've heard he is fed up," Pieter van Wullften Palthe, 
chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights told a press 
conference. "We are all disillusioned but I hope it's not a 
reason for giving up," Wullften Palthe said, adding that the 
resignation could be announced during the commission's current 
annual session, which started Monday. 
  Appointed in August 1992, Mazowiecki has prepared several 
reports on human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] A high-ranking NATO delegation has ended its visit 
in our country. Here is a report: 
  [Correspondent] Continuing last evening's talks with the 
high-ranking NATO delegation and after stressing that Albania 
actively supports the Partnership for Peace [PFP] plan, Defense 
Minister Safet Zhulali referred to the letter by President Sali 
Berisha to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner in which he 
officially expressed Albania's desire to participate in the PFP 
and develop extensive cooperation within NATO. The letter also 
reads: We are ready to work with the political and military 
structures of the alliance, participate in joint military 
maneuvers and consultations on defense and security, and take 
advantage of other possibilities offered by the PFP. We are 
willing to offer a company, as well as our naval and air bases 
for the PFP purposes. Albania is the first ex-communist country 
to have requested NATO membership. Albania's goal continues to 
be membership in the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  The talks concluded that Albania will be prepared to draft 
the position paper and sign the PFP agreement in Brussels. The 
meeting also defined those areas in which Albania commits itself 
to participate, such as joint exercises, peacekeeping and 
humanitarian operations, and the creation of air and port 
facilities. They also agreed that Albania will send its own 
permanent representatives to the relevant NATO institutions. 
  NATO Assistant Secretary General Gebhardt von Moltke stated 
that he was impressed by Albania's performance and its readiness 
to participate in the PFP. We will help to complete the position 
paper and everything else so as to ensure Albania's active 
participation in the PFP plan. He asked our defense minister to 
convey greetings to President Sali Berisha from NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner, as well as his high regard and best 
wishes on the cordial message and Albania's position considering 
PFP participation. 
  The high-ranking NATO delegation left our country this 
morning. Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, Foreign Ministry 
representatives, and high-ranking Defense Ministry cadres were 
at Rinas Airport to see the delegation off. Greek Ambassador in 
Tirana Khristodhoulos Tsalikis was also present.

  [Text] Tirana, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The editor and a journalist 
on an independent Albanian newspaper have been arrested for 
publishing a secret Defence Ministry document, prosecutors said 
Monday [31 January]. 
  Alexander Srangaj, editor of the KOHA JONE newspaper, and 
Martin Leka, a journalist on the paper, could face up to 10 and 
five years in prison respectively if found guilty of leaking a 
state secret. 
  The charges concern defence orders on arms issued to 
officers 
signed by Defence Minister Safet Zhulali, which prosecutors 
alleged were distorted in a story written by Leka. 
  Srangaj spent 35 days under house arrest last year after 
being arrested for publishing false information concerning the 
movement of Albanian tanks towards the Yugoslav frontier. 
  KOHA JONE denied the allegation in an article that said it 
was not the paper's business to keep secrets. "Can information 
that will be distributed to all officers and their families 
really be called a secret?" the newspaper asked.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduard Selami, chairman of the Foreign </F>
Policy Commission in the People's Assembly, by Artjan Tepelena 
in Tirana; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tepelena] Did the last session of the Council of 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly approach the question of Albania's 
membership? 
  [Selami] I would say yes, because from a procedural point of 
view, a further step was made -- namely, this session defined 
which correspondents will come here to draft a final report at 
the end of March. The commission will then discuss this and 
finally decide on Albania's full membership in the Council of 
Europe. Apart from Albania, the dispatching of correspondents 
was not granted to any other country, due to their own problems. 
Even in the meeting with Martinez, as well as with Atkinson and 
other group chairmen, all of them confirmed that there is no 
problem concerning Albania's membership. It is a procedural 
process for Albania to be admitted, which is why they sent 
correspondents. If there had been problems, then of course the 
contrary would have been felt -- we would have said the answer 
is positive, but there is a problem and for this reason Albania 
will not be accepted. 
  [Tepelena] Meanwhile, foreign news agencies have been 
broadcasting a report concerning a Council of Europe resolution 
on compensation for our country's losses due to the embargo, 
which amount to $80 million. What do you think about this aid, 
and is it sufficient, especially after your discussion there, in 
which you once again confirmed that Albania favors the 
continuation of the embargo? 
  [Selami] I do not think it is sufficient. Our losses are 
greater, and this was one of the goals of the discussion. I 
addressed the Council of Europe session in the name of the 
delegation. I think this is a good beginning. The other aspect 
that you mentioned, which was something special and was welcomed 
by some of the delegations, was the fact that despite the 
economic losses we are experiencing, we consider the embargo and 
its observation as an indispensable condition not only to stop 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina but to also prevent it from 
spreading to other parts, which would be very problematic. This 
was the message we transmitted there. 
  [Tepelena] Parliamentary group Chairmen Ali Spahia and Namik 
Dokle were also members of your delegation. Some newspapers 
have reported that in the discussion on human rights, the Nano 
question was particularly focused upon. What is your reaction? 
  [Selami] Of course, it was discussed. It is a problem that 
cannot be avoided because he is the opposition leader. Despite 
the fact that he is imprisoned on charges from the time when he 
was prime minister, it is understood that when the delegation 
and the commission of non-member countries arrived here, this 
problem was put forward. Even now, this has become the main 
focus of the opposition. We regret that a consensus to enter 
the Council of Europe has not been reached because the Nano 
question is always popping up. I think that such a 
personalization is not fair. However, this is a problem that 
belongs to the opposition. I would also like to say that this 
was not the main problem and that it was not treated in a 
special way, because if it had been, the correspondents would 
not have come. We have discussed this question, and we think 
that this is a problem that justice needs to deal with. Justice 
will have its final say. Thus, we feel that there is nothing 
more that we, as a political force, can do in this direction. 
  [Tepelena] Thank you. 
  [Selami] Thank you.

King"] 
  [Text] The Bulgarian Workers and Peasants Party [Bulgarska 
Rabotnichesko-Selska Partiya] [BRSP] was established in Stara 
Zagora. It intends to revive communism according to Marx, 
Engels, and Lenin but with the assistance of the king's "strong 
hand." 
  Tonyo Zhelev, the party's leader, declared himself in 
support 
of restoring the monarchy in Bulgaria. According to him, the 
key cabinet seats, such as the Ministries of Internal Affairs, 
Defense, and Finance, could be entrusted to the sons of Simeon 
Coburg-Gotha. The BRSP is trying to rally all unemployed and 
desperate people in the country and to struggle against greed 
for money and for equal rights and fraternity, he declared. The 
leader of the new party, which has 57 members from Stara Zagora 
and the neighboring villages, hopes that his party will be 
legally registered by May 1994.

  [Text] David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of 
the peace conference on former Yugoslavia, had a meeting with 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu in Bucharest this 
morning. At the end of the talks, the head of Romanian 
diplomacy said: 
  [Begin Melescanu recording] It was a discussion whereby Lord 
Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg briefed us on the results of the Geneva 
talks on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We had a 
discussion on the prospects for a peaceful solution of this 
conflict. Of course, the two mediators also expressed the 
desire to discover the opinions, views, and suggestions of 
Romania and the Romanian Government on the continuation of the 
peace process. I believe that I can sum up the visit by 
describing it as an integral part of the efforts undertaken by 
the two mediators to examine the way in which the countries in 
this region, the countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia, 
can contribute to the progress of the peace process. [end 
recording] 
  In his statement, Lord Owen said that, at the beginning of 
the year, the explicit decision was made for the two cochairmen 
to pay visits to all the countries in the vicinity of former 
Yugoslavia, since there is a very strong imperative demand in 
the region to solve the conflict. Here is Lord Owen's answer to 
a question put to him by our radio station correspondent Doina 
Saiciuc regarding Romania's possible contribution to a 
resolution of the Yugoslav crisis: 
  [Begin Owen recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Romanian] I believe that Romania has a 
considerable contribution to make. You have good relations with 
the countries in the region and the countries of former 
Yugoslavia. Obviously, this includes the relations with Hungary 
and Bulgaria, too, but not only with them. In a broader sense 
-- I am now referring to the whole region -- I know that there 
is a strong relationship between Romania and Turkey. You are 
feeling the economic consequences of the sanctions. These 
contacts with your foreign minister are not the first such 
contacts with Romania. I would like to introduce a dose of 
self-criticism here, since this is indeed my first visit to 
Romania. However, I have been in constant touch with Romania 
and I now believe that Romania's influence on this conflict 
should become more palpable. [end recording] 
  The two mediators in the Yugoslav crisis also had talks with 
Adrian Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies. At this 
time, they are meeting with President Ion Iliescu, our 
correspondents inform us.

  [Text] Esteemed listeners, during the broadcasting of this 
newscast we received a communique from the Romanian National 
Unity Party [PUNR], phoned in by PUNR Vice President Ioan Gavra, 
which reads as follows: 
  A protocol on a political understanding between the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the PUNR on setting up a 
coalition government was signed on 1 February in the evening. 
This openness achieved by the PUNR is the most important 
political moment in Romania life since the parliamentary 
elections of September 1992. Within the framework of this 
political partnership, the PDSR and the PUNR have established 
the scope of their cooperation at parliamentary, governmental, 
and territorial levels. 
  The assumption of the political responsibility of the 
government act by the PUNR will take concrete shape in the 
drafting of an anti- crisis and anti-inflationist governmental 
program capable of dynamizing the mechanisms of reform and 
privatization and of contributing to the efficient resolution of 
the people's social problems -- the communique received by 
telephone from Mr. Ioan Gavra points out. 
  Contacted also by telephone, PDSR Executive President Adrian 
Nastase confirmed the signing of the protocol and said that it 
is the outcome of negotiations conducted on the evening of 31 
January by the five parties of the parliamentary majority, 
namely the PDSR, PUNR, the Socialist Party of Labor, the Greater 
Romania Party, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania.

  [Text] [Announcer] President Ion Iliescu has been holding 
talks with representatives of the Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania [UDMR] at Cotroceni Palace this evening. At the end 
of more than three hours of talks, UDMR President Bela Marko was 
kind enough to answer several questions from journalists. 
First, he referred to a list of documents presented by the UDMR 
to the president. 
  [Marko] "This list actually contains a number of older UDMR 
documents as well as several more recent documents, including a 
draft bill on national minorities and autonomous communities 
worked out by the UDMR and already submitted to the Chamber of 
Deputies. Consequently, I actually put forth the idea that this 
package of documents, this list, contains all the more important 
problems of the minorities in Romania and of the Hungarian 
minority in Romania; on the other hand, in addition to problems, 
it also offers solutions to these problems, through the draft 
bill, that is, solutions to a number of concrete issues. 
  "Of course, the package presented to the president also 
includes our position regarding the recommendations of the 
Council of Europe, since the majority of these recommendations 
coincide with the problems raised in the UDMR memorandum, 
namely, the problem of the law on education -- or rather the 
problem of the chapter of that draft bill on education dealing 
with instruction in the language of the minorities, which has 
not yet been discussed or approved by the Education Commission 
of the Chamber of Deputies -- the problem of the law on 
minorities, the problem of church assets and religious schools, 
as well as other concrete problems that could have been solved 
without too much delay, such as the situation of the people 
imprisoned in the wake of the December 1989 events in Harghita 
County and of the events of March 1990 in Targu Mures; despite 
the promises of the representatives of the government and of the 
institutions of the executive power in Romania, these problems 
have not yet been solved." 
  [Announcer] Bela Marko was asked about President Ion 
Iliescu's reaction to the UDMR's proposals: 
  [Marko] "I must point out that we have very different 
positions on a number of major problems. At the same time, we 
conducted a rather thorough dialogue on all the problems raised 
today and we reached the conclusion that the presidency will 
examine the list of documents presented by us, with the promise 
that conclusions will be drawn on these matters. However, I 
would like to emphasize that our positions are very different on 
the majority of the problems discussed." 
  [Announcer] The UDMR president was asked by journalists to 
elaborate on the aide memoire sent by the UDMR to the Council of 
Europe. 
  [Marko] "The aide memoire assesses the current situation, 
since four months have elapsed since Romania's admission to the 
Council of Europe and, despite the fact that the Council's 
people will check on Romania's compliance with these criteria 
within six months, for the time being we note that no progress 
has been made in the past four months in terms of complying with 
those criteria."

<F P=106> [Interview with First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr </F>
Vondra by Stanislav Cervinka in Prague; date not given: "The 
Reform Developments in Russia Will Probably Slow Down"] 
  [Text] Last week, First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr 
Vondra made a two-day trip to Moscow. We were interested in the 
purpose of the visit and the impressions he brought back to 
Prague. 
  [Vondra] I attended a regular annual consultation between 
the Foreign Ministries. With the single exception of the 
parliament observer mission, there has been no official mission 
there from our country since the elections. We discussed the 
agenda for next year. I met with two Russian deputy foreign 
ministers, Churkin and Kirov. I mentioned the crude oil issue in 
the context of the planned joint commission for the economy, 
which is supposed to be headed by deputy prime ministers -- we 
are waiting for the Russian component to be formed, which will 
be possible only after the restructuring of the Russian 
Government. A protocol is signed annually on the supplies of 
crude oil and power plant fuel, and the new commission will also 
deal with this issue. Regarding the recent five-day 
interruption in supply, I can only say that I do not believe 
that it was caused by some political influence. Crude oil 
prices were declining on the world markets at the end of last 
year, and I have the impression that Chemapol and Transpetrol 
were eliminating their stock. They acted in a market-conforming 
manner, and did not think of the complications that could arise 
if reserves smaller than usual are maintained, as happened at 
the beginning of this year before the Russian Government was 
formed. The processing of the relevant documents was delayed in 
the still non-market environment in the Russian Federation. 
  [Cervinka] What is the new political climate like in Moscow? 
  [Vondra] I wanted to utilize the visit to Moscow to probe 
the situation in the Russian parliament. I met with the 
deputies of all the main political streams, and it is my 
impression that a somewhat new stage is beginning in the 
development in the Russian Federation, that the future progress 
of particularly the economic reforms will be limited by the 
political will of the parliament, and the support for a rapid 
transfer to capitalism and free market will clearly decline. 
  [Cervinka] Can these changes lead to a change of the 
development initiated in Russia? 
  [Vondra] It is difficult to predict. A complete retardation 
of this development backwards [as published] may not be 
possible, but it is likely that a slow down and a change in the 
style of the reforms will occur, and a trend will commence 
toward command methods in the management of the economy. 
  The anti-inflationary policy and budget stabilization will 
no 
longer be a priority. It is possible that inflation will be 
reduced in Russia by the non-market measures, a price regulation 
at the cost of a budget deficit. 
  [Cervinka] Can the changes you have indicated affect 
relations between Prague and Moscow? 
  [Vondra] I believe that we completed the basic 
transformation steps long time ago, and the distance between 
Prague and Moscow -- in this respect -- has grown sufficiently.

  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus expressed alarm 
today about Austria's consistently voiced doubts about the 
completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant construction. He 
pointed out that the Czech Government's stance on this matter is 
final. Our Prague correspondent Daniela Galikova reports in more 
detail: 
  [Galikova] According to Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Government 
does not identify itself with Austrian Chancellor Vranitzky's 
idea of a nuclear-free Europe. However, this does not mean that 
the government denies Austria's right to hold its own view. 
Nevertheless, being the government of an independent state, the 
Czech Government is also entitled to a different view. I am 
angry that Austria does not take seriously the fact that the 
Czech Government's decision on completing the construction of 
the Temelin nuclear plant is final. I do not understand the 
reasons for the debate on not completing the Temelin power 
station or rebuilding it to use gas fuel. 
  [Begin Klaus recording] Why should I continue to write 
letters or issue statements because somebody on the Austrian 
side seems to hold the view that we did not in fact mean our 
decision and that it was a joke by the Czech Government or 
perhaps an attempt to prod our neighbors? This is simply 
untrue. Should I put this in stronger terms or in very strong 
terms? I am simply saying it. [end recording] 
  [Galikova] The Czech prime minister went on to say that the 
entire affair has gone beyond the framework of the present 
Austrian Government's usual attitude toward the completion of 
Temelin. He goes so far as to consider this to be 
inappropriate, especially in the context, which he mentioned, of 
his talks a few days ago with officials from Switzerland and 
Germany, whose nuclear power stations are as close to the 
Austrian border as is Temelin. However, there are no protests 
against them. As regards Austria's attempt to choose whom they 
consider to be a weaker partner and use them as a testing 
ground, I have to say that we are not a weaker partner, Vaclav 
Klaus stressed when speaking in Prague a few hours ago.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 3 (AFP) -- A transformer fire Thursday 
morning at the Czech nuclear power plant in Dukovany, in the 
eastern Moravian region, caused no casualties nor radiation 
leaks, the CTK news agency reported. 
  The fire, which broke out shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) at 
the plant's third reactor, was extinguished two hours later, the 
agency said. 
  Power was maintained at minimal level throughout the 
incident, after initially dropping to 30 percent below minimum 
when the fire broke out, it added. 
  The state of the third reactor had "stabilized" after the 
incident, which was classed as level 0 on the INES international 
scale, according to an expert from the state nuclear security 
office quoted by CTK. 
  The plant, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of the 
Austrian border in Moravia, has four 440 megawatt 
ex-Soviet-built VVER [water-moderated water-cooled power 
reactor] reactors. 
  The incident came a day after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus confirmed his country's decision to press ahead with 
building a nuclear power plant at Temelin in southern Bohemia -- 
a project which has been heavily criticized by Austria, which 
fears radioactive fallout from possible accidents. 
  The Temelin plant, to be completed in two or three years at 
a 
site only 40 kilometres from the Austrian border, will have two 
1,000 megawatt ex-Soviet-type VVER reactors. 
  Austria, which has banned nuclear facilities on its 
territory, has asked Prague to build a gas-based plant instead. 
  Klaus said his government's decision was "final" and that 
Austria "should recognize the sovereignty of the Czech Republic." 
  Responding to Klaus's remarks later Wednesday, Austrian 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Vienna would continue its 
efforts to block construction of the plant. 
  A nuclear accident "would not only be a risk for the 
sovereign Czech Republic, but also for the neighbouring 
populations," Vranitzky said, adding that the April 1986 
accident at Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant "was not limited 
to sovereign contamination." 
  Austrian efforts to block the project were undermined last 
Thursday when the American EXIM-Bank decided to guarantee a loan 
needed to complete the Temelin project. Citi-Bank was authorized 
to grant a 317 million dollar loan to the plant's builder, 
Westinghouse.

  [Text] Fire broke out today at the tap transformer of the 
third bloc of Dukovany [South Moravia] nuclear power station. 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus reported on this at noon: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] The fire broke out at 0712 hours and 
was localized withing 30 minutes. I stress that the fire broke 
out as a result of a fault on the tap transformer. This electric 
facility is located in an open area about 50 meters from the 
reactor hall. From this point of view, this fire did not at all 
touch the area of nuclear safety and, from the point of view of 
the internationally recognized scale that is used to assess 
accidents from the nuclear safety point of view, the situation 
was of the lowest degree of alert, that is zero. This means 
that there was no infringement upon nuclear safety or radiation 
protection, and no radioactive substances escaped into the 
environment as a result of this emergency situation. 
  There was even no need to apply any emergency measures to 
protect the reactor against the tap transformer fire. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Frydl: "The Total Volume of Loans </F>
Enterprises Obtained From Abroad Last Year Surpassed $1.1 
Billion"] 
  [Excerpts] In 1993, the enterprise sphere in the Czech 
Republic obtained credits from foreign lenders to the tune of 
approximately $1.1 billion, Jiri Zimola, director of the Foreign 
Currency Department of the Czech National Bank has told 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. Approximately $285 million has already been 
paid off, leaving a balance of $825 million. In 1992, the 
balance was $339.6 million, and in 1991 $172.5 million. A 
further growth in the balance is expected this year. 
  According to Zimola, the overall structure of the capital 
flow into the Czech Republic is gradually changing. In the 
first stage, to 1992, government arranged loans from 
international financial institutions -- particularly the IMF -- 
were dominant. In 1992, direct investment exceeded $1 billion. 
This year, this has declined somewhat (to approximately $500 
million), but foreign credit and portfolio investment show an 
upward trend. 
  The reasons for the increasing loans from abroad are mostly 
their lower price (interest) and a shortage of, above all, 
long-term loans from Czech banks. Two-thirds of the foreign 
credits are loans for terms longer than four years. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the whole, according to Zimola, it can be said that the 
volume of credits from abroad shows a highly progressive trend, 
and favorably influences the general development on the balance 
of payments and the foreign currency reserves. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Prague -- The development of foreign currency 
reserves in the banking system shows a similar tempo as in the 
most dynamic periods last year. This follows from information 
provided to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY by Ondrej Kvacek from the Czech 
National Bank's Press Department. In January, the level of 
foreign currency reserves in the banking system rose from $6.2 
billion to $6.5 billion. The National Bank's foreign currency 
reserves rose from $4.1 billion to $3.8 billion at the end of 
1993. In the commercial banks, it remained at $2.4 billion.

  [Excerpts] The agenda of the 26th meeting of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic includes a document on the 
foreign policy of Slovakia in 1993 and its priorities in 1994. 
[passage omitted] Editor Magda Pospisilova reports from the 
building of the parliament. 
  [Pospisilova] It has already become a tradition that a 
discussion of such a fundamental topic of our foreign policy is 
being watched by ambassadors, heads of missions, and diplomats 
accredited in the Slovak Republic. The opening address on the 
report on the fulfilment of tasks and the current aims was 
delivered by Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik. 
  He stressed in the beginning that if there is a sphere where 
a high degree of consensus of all, or at least an overwhelming 
majority of political parties, is consistently sought, then it 
is the sphere of foreign policy. 
  Slovakia entered the international scene with a positive 
assessment of the peaceful division of Czechoslovakia. [passage 
omitted] 
  Three postulates were being stressed when dividing 
Czechoslovakia: first, the two new states will take over all the 
tasks of the disappearing states as two successor states; 
second, the international community should apply the principle 
of an undifferentiated approach towards the two successor 
states; third, the division of Czechoslovakia will not disturb 
stability in Central Europe. Following the division of 
Czechoslovakia we have concluded 2,014 bilateral treaties and 
987 multilateral treaties. Last year we signed 54 new treaties 
[all figures as heard]. Others are currently being discussed at 
the expert level. 
  Minister Moravcik considers that one of the most important 
of 
last year's successes was the signing of the European agreement 
on Slovakia's association to the European Union. The process of 
ratification of this agreement in the European Parliament and in 
the parliaments of the individual member countries of the 
European Union has already started. We shall pay priority 
attention to its success this year. [passage omitted] 
  Jozef Moravcik went on to say: 
  [Begin Moravcik recording] The principle of an 
undifferentiated approach towards the two successor states was 
generally accepted by the international community. It was fully 
implemented, for example, also during our acceptance into the 
Council of Europe. It accompanied our establishment on the 
international scene. Another matter is whether or not we will 
be able to continue keeping pace with the Czech Republic. This 
will depend on internal political viewpoints. This problem 
emerges strongly in connection with the deliberations on 
expanding NATO and with the separation of Slovakia from the 
first group of the states aspiring to NATO membership, which 
sometimes happens. The causes of this separation should not be 
sought in foreign political or even internal political 
conspiracy against Slovakia. Slovakia must concentrate on 
maintaining a good pace in building democratic instititutions, 
in developing basic institutions and values in the pluralistic 
society and the market economy environment. 
  The assurance that the division of Czechoslovakia will not 
influence stability in Central Europe, which we gave when 
dividing the federation, has been fulfilled to the extent that 
our common state has been divided in a peaceful and cultivated 
way. Our natural pledge towards Europe, but above all, towards 
ourselves, is to maintain the stability of Central Europe. It 
means developing cooperation with our neighbours and deepening 
the atmosphere of trust, possibly creating it where it is 
lacking. 
  This relates, above all, to Hungary. If we want to create 
mutual trust we must completely eliminate any confrontational 
tone and establish a dialogue as the fundamental method of 
seeking compromise. Apprehensions of irredentism, nurtured by 
unsuitable statements of some politicians in our country and in 
Hungary, are being felt in Slovakia. Allegations are spread 
from Hungary about non-adherence to fundamental rights of 
national minorities. The institutional mechanism must be 
created to eliminate suspicions on both sides. Its basis could 
be an agreement containing principles of correct behaviour, that 
is what is being created within the CSCE. I believe that the 
project of the pact of stability in Europe, which is being 
prepared under the auspices of the European Union, will 
contribute towards creating the atmosphere of trust. 
  It is important for stability in central Europe that the 
questions of rights of national minorites should not become a 
permanent problem. It is desirable as soon as possible to 
achieve a stabilizing solution so that we might avoid situations 
where satisfaction of one demand is a pretext for presenting 
other demands. It is also important, above all, for us, since 
we are characterized by ethnically mixed areas, that the rights 
of minorites do not create artificial boundaries among the 
citizens of various ethnic groups. I have in mind the so-called 
collective rights of national minorities. The principles of a 
multiethnic society rather than the principle of creating 
ethnically compact entities, could be useful in the process of 
uniting Europe. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The head of the Marek Borowski's office in Pila has 
told a Radio Koszalin reporter that the deputy prime minister 
and minister of finance has declared that he will tender his 
resignation from the post of minister [as heard]. This will 
ensue if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak does not reverse the 
decision last week on the dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister 
Stefan Kawalec. Stanislaw Wolny said that the decision by Marek 
Borowski is all but 100 percent certain. The resignation is to 
be presented to the prime minister most probably on Friday, 
after Waldemar Pawlak's return from Brussels. This news was 
commented as follows by spokesman of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski: 
  [Begin Siemiatkowski recording] The resignation of Marek 
Borowski was never considered. I can say more, Mr. Borowski is 
a sufficiently responsible politician to be fully aware of the 
fact that, first, he must continue that which he has undertaken. 
Second, he was designated by the SLD to fulfill this very 
important function and so he must be aware of the fact that only 
the adoption of the budget can lead to the political 
stabilization of the parliament, the Sejm, and the coalition. 
And these are matters far more important than even the very 
important considerations that have caused the crisis between 
Deputy Prime Minister Borowski and the prime minister. Really, 
all the issues that led to the crisis will be resolved only 
after the return of Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is in Brussels 
at the moment. Most probably he has already had the opportunity 
to meet the prime minister and clarify the issues that led to 
the sparks, the sparks along the government axis. Although this 
is not yet a matter that would have the character of a coalition 
crisis, this is a certain misunderstanding that we would wish to 
have resolved among the interested parties.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 3 (AFP) -- A convoy of British 
armoured military troop transporters headed Thursday to break a 
Bosnian Serb blockade west of Sarajevo with instructions to use 
force if necessary. 
  The force of four or five vehicles will negotiate first, and 
"use force if necessary," if Bosnian Serb forces did not lift a 
two-day blockade of UN forces using a key route between Sarajevo 
and central Bosnia, said UN spokesman Major Jose Labandeira. 
  All tracked UN vehicles have been prevented from passing the 
blockade at Kobiljaca, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of 
the Bosnian capital. 
  The blockade contravenes a Geneva agreement reached on 
November 18 guaranteeing free movement of UN peacekeeping 
forces, said Labandeira. The military leadership of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] forces in Bosnia was "determined" to exercise 
the right of free movement, he added. 
  A British officer was shot in the shoulder Wednesday as he 
patrolled in an unprotected vehicle on the "Diamond Route" in 
central Bosnia. The officer, whose life was not in danger, was 
evacuated from the British military base at Vitez. Gunfire came 
from Bosnian Croat positions. 
  British troops in an armoured "Warrior" armoured personnel 
carrier fired shots over the heads of a crowd which tried to 
ransack lorries carrying aid at Opara, on the "Diamond Route" 
between Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia, the 
spokesman added. The crowd dispersed after a few shots were 
fired. 
  Relative calm in Sarajevo on Wednesday was broken overnight 
by a bombardment with 395 incoming shells, while 24 shells were 
fired from the city, UN forces said. 
  A French sentry at the Skenderija base, south of Sarajevo, 
came under sniper fire but was not injured, the spokesman said. 
The sniper fire was not returned, he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Blue Helmets' Protect `Lilies'"] </F>
  [Text] Certain individuals without proper military uniforms 
are appearing on the roads in the area around Kalesije together 
with UNPROFOR personnel. The Serbian military consider this an 
unauthorized interpretation of the UN peace forces' mandate. 
  According to information obtained by TANJUG from 
highest-level military sources of the republic of Srpska, the 
Serbian side has gathered considerable evidence to conclude that 
these individuals are Muslim soldiers involved in reconnaissance 
of Serbian units' positions under the protection of UNPROFOR 
personnel. 
  "During the reconnaissance" the weapons of the "Blue 
Helmets" 
are turned toward the Serbian positions, though this is not 
supposed to happen. 
  The military of the republic of Srpska point out that 
UNPROFOR's mandate is not to establish peace, but only to 
provide security for the humanitarian aid convoys on land. This 
excludes any armed reconnaissance. 
  The Serbian side points at the fact that UNPROFOR has 
started 
building a watchtower north of Kalesija on Muslim-controlled 
territory, though they have no right to do so. 
  The Serbian military warns that the Serbian side will 
destroy 
the tower if the construction does not stop. Reacting to all 
the events taking place in the Kalesija region, the Serbian side 
has issued a strict warning demanding that the UNPROFOR command 
observe the mandate of the peace forces in the former Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to the letter.

  [Excerpts] Zvornik, Bratunac, 3 Feb (TANJUG) -- According 
to the latest reports, the level of Serb suffering in 
Muslim-held areas is growing and Croats are also being 
persecuted with increasing frequency, TANJUG has learned from 
sources close to the Srpska republic army. 
  According to the same source, many previous reports are now 
being confirmed by the Croat side in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The latest example is the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] report on Muslim terror against Serbs and 
Croats in Tarcin. According to the reports many Serbs and Croats 
have been imprisoned in Tarcin for a long time and all other 
Serbs and Croats from the area have been forced to join work 
details of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army. They have 
been transferred to Zabrdje near Kiseljak where they have been 
forced to dig fortifications for the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army. According to Croatian sources Muslim 
forces in the area plan to use the imprisoned Serbs and Croats 
as a human shield in attempts to recapture certain positions 
seized by the HVO. 
  According to the latest refugee accounts the position of 
around 100 Serb families remaining in Zavidovici is extremely 
difficult, Srpska republic army sources said. [passage omitted] 
  Serbs remaining in Zavidovici area are threatened with death 
on a massive scale if international, particularly humanitarian, 
organizations do not intervene urgently on their behalf, sources 
close to the Srpska republic army warned.

  [Text] Belgrade, 2 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, said in Belgrade today that 
one-sided support for the Muslims by some international circles 
and leading countries is making peace prospects in Bosnia more 
distant. 
  At a roundtable -- "A TANJUG guest" -- Karadzic expressed 
doubt that the negotiations on Bosnia, due to take place in 
Geneva on 10 February, can produce any result due to a lack of 
political will to influence the Muslims to accept a peaceful 
solution. 
  According to him, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic will, as 
he 
has done so far, act "as his sponsors say." 
  "It is therefore to be expected that the Muslim parliament, 
at a session due to take place in Sarajevo on 7 February, will 
adopt a platform unacceptable to both the Serbs and the Croats, 
or at least to the Serbs, in order to make sure that the war 
continues," Karadzic said. 
  He explained that the Muslim ambition to achieve domination 
in Bosnia and their obligation to secure the whole of Bosnia for 
Islamic interests in Europe caused the war and is the reason for 
its continuation. 
  He added that "the United States has said that the Muslims 
have the right to try to achieve their objectives by military 
means" and that this is the first time they said they will 
recognize the results of the armed struggle. "We, the Serbs, 
have nothing against this, provided the same standard is applied 
to us," Karadzic said. 
  He recalled that the Serbs have made huge concessions in 
exchange for an urgent peace and lifting of sanctions and added 
that, if the concessions do not result in peace and a solution, 
they will be withdrawn. 
  Karadzic underlined that the Serb side will continue to make 
any future agreement on Bosnia conditional on the lifting of 
sanctions against Yugoslavia.

aggressor's activities in the operational zone of the 6th 
Operative Group Zivinice. 
  Dozens of shells were again fired at Zivinice today. The 
prevailing view here is that the aggressor has decided to 
intensify combat operations so as to endanger the safe use of 
the nearby Dubrave Airport for humanitarian flights. It is well 
known that the United Nations are determined to open this 
airport soon, and it is also well known that the aggressor's 
side is rejecting this. 
  The general alarm in Zivinice has already been sounded three 
times today owing to the shelling.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Serb forces would agree to 
the reopening of the airport at Tuzla in northeast Bosnia 
provided they could control all traffic going through, a 
Yugoslav military official was quoted as saying Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, in 
remarks quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, added that 
if Serb observers were not present, "the airport could be used 
as a channel for arms deliveries to Moslems." He welcomed 
Russia's proposal to send observers to the airport but added 
that "the presence of Serb observers" was "vital." 
  It appeared unlikely the Moslems would agree to such 
conditions, observers said. It also seemed surprising that the 
rump Yugoslavia's army should announce the Bosnian Serbs' 
conditions on reopening the airport. Although Serbia openly 
backs Bosnia's Serbs, it does not officially have authority over 
them. Until now, Bosnian Serbs have steadfastly refused to 
yield on the airport issue. 
  Their leader Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday [1 February] it 
was up to the Bosnian Serb "parliament" to decide what to do on 
the issue. 
  While Tuzla itself is controlled by Moslems, the airport 
zone 
is within firing distance of Serb forces, whose positions are a 
few kilometers (miles) from the town. 
  The United Nations is considering authorising air strikes 
against besieging Serb forces to obtain the reopening of Tuzla, 
which is considered an essential channel for humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Bileca, 2 February (TANJUG) -- Smail Klaric, the 
chairman of the war presidency of the eastern part of Mostar, 
has informed the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander in 
former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, about the collapse of 
Muslim-Croat negotiations on Mostar. 
  Negotiations on European Union's proposal to proclaim Mostar 
an open city under the protectorate of one of the European 
states lasted for several days in the UNPROFOR base in 
Medjugorje, and they were attended by Owen and Stoltenberg's 
special envoy. 
  Klaric informed General Cot yesterday that the delegation of 
the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] demanded that Mostar be the 
capital of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna offering that the 
European Union protectorate only be in the part of the city 
currently controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina army. 
  The Muslims could not accept this Croat proposal and the 
negotiations broke down, Klaric informed Gen. Cot.

  [Text] Concerning the latest arrests of the leaders of the 
Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in Sandzak by the Serbian and 
Montenegrin police, we express our strongest condemnation and 
protest, reads a statement by the SDA of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Using the pretense of armed rebellion and endangering the 
territorial integrity of the self-styled Yugoslavia, the 
authorities of this unrecognized country have been terrorizing 
and persecuting Muslims in an unprecedented way, particularly 
prominent people and members of the SDA. This fascist state has 
been conducting ethnic cleansing for a long time now in an 
attempt to force the members of other nations to emigrate, and 
thus create a pure national state for the Serbian people alone. 
  We appeal to the relevant international institutions to send 
their representatives to Serbia and Montenegro, and to undertake 
every possible action to halt this criminal persecution, and 
ensure the observance of civil freedom and rights -- in 
accordance with standards of international law -- for all the 
nations on the territory of the so-called Yugoslavia. 
  This was said in a statement by the SDA of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto and her Turkish 
counterpart Madam Tansu Ciller flew into Sarajevo on an 
epoch-making visit to express solidarity with the Bosnian people 
struggling for the defense and the independence and territorial 
integrity of their country. At the airport of the war-ravaged 
Sarajevo, the two prime ministers were greeted by the commander 
of the United Nations Protection Forces, Lieutenant General 
Michael (Rose). PTV correspondent Qamar Muhiuddin reports from 
Sarajevo that the Bosnian leaders could not reach the airport to 
receive the two leaders as the area around the airport is under 
Serbian control. From the airport, the two prime ministers of 
the Muslim world drove straight to the presidential palace where 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller were welcomed by the 
Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic. 
  Later, the two prime ministers called on President Alija 
Izetbegovic who briefed them on the situation in his country 
subjected to wanton and dastardly Serbian aggression. The two 
prime ministers expressed solidarity with President Alija 
Izetbegovic and the people of the republic who have been victims 
of genocidal aggression and ethnic cleansing. The Bosnian 
president expressed gratitude on his behalf and on the people of 
Bosnia for having demonstrated the unprecedented gesture of 
solidarity with them in their hour of trial and tribulation. 
  Our correspondent understands that during the talks it was 
agreed that the world community must take effective measures to 
stop Serbian aggression and the United Nations resolution on 
Bosnia must be implemented. The need for immediate lifting of 
arms embargo was also emphasized. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
also informed the Bosnian president that a contingent of the 
Pakistan Army is ready to join the United Nations Protection 
Force in the war-ravaged Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  During their short stay, the two prime ministers also 
visited 
Kosevo Hospital in Sarajevo to sympathize with the victims of 
Serbian aggression. During their hour-long visit, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto and Madam Tansu Ciller went round various wards of the 
hospital. The two prime ministers were visibly moved to see the 
innocent people which included old, young and children injured 
and maimed in the holocaust unleashed by marauding Serbians. 
Our correspondent says Kosevo Hospital has also been a target 
of hand grenade attacks 193 times during the last 22 months. As 
in other hospitals, supplies of medicines in this hospital have 
become scarce and even water supply remains cut off because of 
continuing siege of Sarajevo by Serbian forces. 
  Pakistan and Turkey have called upon the United Nations 
Security Council to ensure implementation of all its resolutions 
and lift the unjust embargo against Bosnia with a view to 
ensuring a halt to the destruction of the republic. The call 
was made in a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of the 
most courageous and historic visit to Sarajevo by the prime 
minister, Benazir Bhutto, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of 
Turkey. 
  The two leaders said in the joint declaration that Bosnia 
must not be forced to negotiate at gun point. We will resist any 
imposed settlement which rewards the aggressor and legitimizes 
the fruits of aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot and should 
not be the basis of statehood. 
  The joint declaration said it is shocking that this apalling 
human tragedy is being enacted in the heart of a continent which 
prides itself on its commitment to human rights and respect for 
human dignity. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Madam Tansu 
Ciller said it is unacceptable that in this era in which the 
principles of the United Nations Charter are recognized as 
having universal validity, a sovereign independent state is 
being violently dismembered along racial lines and genocide 
perpetrated against the peaceful and enlightened people. They 
saluted the heroism of the people of Bosnia and supported their 
just struggle for their national survival and said we fully 
endorse their resolve to preserve the sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and political independence of their motherland. 
  About the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two leaders 
said rarely in the annals of human history have a nation been 
subjected to such merciless savagery in the full view of the 
world. They called for an immediate and strict implementation of 
a total cease-fire and cessation of hostility so that 
negotiations can be resumed and huge relief operation ensured. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller said the 
situation on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a universal tragedy. The 
degradation of the human person as practiced in Bosnia is of 
concern to the entire human race. We leave this beleaguered but 
great city deeply outraged at the injustices being done to its 
citizens, but in fullest admiration and solidarity for the 
resolve to reject an unjust dispensation. 
  Earlier, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived in Croatian 
capital Zagreb today. She was received by Croatian Prime 
Minister Nikica Valentic, the deputy prime minister and the 
foreign minister and the UN special representative. The prime 
minister was accompanied by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali, Interior Minister Major, retired, Nasiruddin Khan Babar and 
the foreign secretary. Later, Ms. Benazir Bhutto had a meeting 
with the prime minister of Turkey, Madam Tansu Ciller, who also 
arrived in Zagreb to accompany her to Sarajevo. The Pakistani 
and the Turkish prime ministers later renewed call to stop the 
destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin recording] [Bhutto] the prime minister of Turkey and 
I 
are both going to Sarajevo, less as prime ministers and more as 
mothers, to focus the attention of the world on the plight of 
the people of Bosnia and to give a renewed call for the end of 
fighting. It is tragic to see that in the heart of Europe so 
many of the principles upon which peace and stability in the 
world are based are being violated. The UN Charter enshrines 
the territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations. But here 
the territorial integrity is being violated. It is very 
important that the Croatians and the Bosnians also coordinate 
closely together to permit redrawing of borders. 
  [Ciller] We should try to make sure that the approach of 
Europe and the definition of Europe is defended, that the values 
of Europe should be defended, and we should do that together and 
there is no discrimination as to who does this. The value is 
that we should be defending the multinational, the multiculture, 
multireligion entity of living together. This is what Europe 
has been all about. [end recording]

Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic, 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and Pakistani Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto in Sarajevo on 2 February; Ciller and 
Bhutto statements are in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Musabasic] After a welcoming ceremony with the 
highest state honors in front of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency building, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and their associates 
were greeted by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija 
Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Turkish Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin was also with the Turkish delegation, 
while his counterpart Ahmad Sardar Asif Ali was with the 
Pakistani delegation. 
  The esteemed guests then held talks first with Presidency 
President Izetbegovic and then with Prime Minister Silajdzic. 
After the talks, decrees on friendship and cooperation were 
signed in front of a number of reporters. The decree on 
friendship and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Turkey 
was signed by Prime Ministers Silajdzic and Ciller, and between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan by Silajdzic and Bhutto. 
  After the signing ceremony, Presidency President Alija 
Izetbegovic made the following statement: 
  [Izetbegovic] It is a great honor and pleasure for me to 
have had a chance to welcome to Sarajevo Pakistani Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 
Our two esteemed guests come from countries friendly toward us, 
countries that base their relations with other countries and the 
world on the defense of the principles of the UN Charter, a 
dedication to human rights, and a respect for human dignity. 
  I would like to stress that our esteemed guests have been 
elected prime ministers in their countries through democratic 
elections, which is a fact that supports [words indistinct]. 
Therefore it is no coincidence that the two prime ministers are 
today guests of this besieged city, which symbolizes resistance 
and the heroic struggle of the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina for 
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the political 
independence of our country. Our tragedy provides our true 
friends with an opportunity to to show in deed that they are 
friends, but also to unmask the hypocrisy of a number of 
countries that defend human rights in words only. In adopting 
resolutions and declarations, these countries [words indistinct] 
but a lack of any concrete action on their implementation has 
contributed to the continuation of the war, and to the 
deterioration of the situation in our country. 
  I would like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Bhutto and Mrs. 
Ciller for the unqualified support we have received from their 
governments and people in our struggle for a just peace. This 
country, which is a victim of two (fascist) [words indistinct]. 
The joint declaration of the two prime ministers -- with which I 
have had a chance to acquaint myself -- reiterates their 
readiness to extend, on a bilateral level, concrete material and 
other assistance to our struggle. 
  Finally, I would like to congratulate these brave women on 
their personal courage to come to Sarajevo despite warnings not 
to do so. Their visit and support are an encouragement to us to 
persevere in the struggle for the defense of our homeland, and 
therefore for all those principles on which the United Nations 
rest. This is also a incentive to all the defenders of 
democratic [word indistinct] in the world to intensify their 
efforts in the search for a just peace [words indistinct]. 
  [Musabasic] The Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers also 
prepared a declaration on their visit to Sarajevo, and they 
addressed a few words to the reporters. 
  Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: 
  [Ciller] We are here primarily for humanitarian purposes. 
We believe that the Bosnians are fighting for freedom, 
territorial integrity, and human rights. We have always been 
concerned about human rights, regardless of where [word 
indistinct]. The basic right is the right to life. Thus our 
aim can serve as an appeal for the defense of human rights. 
  Second, we believe in territorial integrity, and we believe 
that territorial integrity always has to be defended. This is 
why we believe that the efforts by the European Commnity must be 
reassessed, and they must be complete. This is a humanitarian 
issue, and also a moral issue [word indistinct]. Civilians are 
being killed here. We have once again to draw the attention of 
the world community to the fact that this is a moral issue. We 
have always defended democracy and human rights, and territorial 
integrity. Now it is time to unite and defend the aims that we 
and the international community support. 
  It is an European idea, coexistence, coexistence among 
various religions, ethnic groups, and cultures, and we have to 
defend that. (That) is our treasure. This is the reason why we 
should defend that idea. The territorial integrity and 
coexistence in Sarajevo [words indistinct] but it has to be a 
just peace [words indistinct]. 
  [Musabasic] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the 
reporters that she did not want to reiterate the Sarajevo 
declaration, but she stated: 
  [Bhutto] We have signed this declaration less as prime 
ministers and more as mothers, daughters, and women, to express 
our solidarity with the suffering of the people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also to draw the attention of the world 
once again to this place where the people are suffering so. We 
have to do something to stop this human suffering. But it is 
not only a question of human suffering, it is also a question of 
the values on which the UN Charter is based, and upon which 
peace and stability in the world have been built. 
  Territorial integrity must be respected and aggression must 
not be rewarded. The international community has to act fast. 
First to stop the killing of innocent people, women, and 
children, and second, to protect the values that enable the 
world to live in peace. Territorial integrity must be defended, 
and aggression must not be rewarded if the world is to continue 
to live in peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Helene Despic-Popovic: "Bhutto, Ciller Demand </F>
Justice for Bosnian Moslems"] 
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Pakistani and Turkish 
Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller Wednesday [2 
February] called for lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and 
urged the govermment to reject any "unjust" negotiated 
settlement to the war. 
  In a joint declaration issued during their brief visit to 
the 
besieged Bosnian capital, the two Islamic heads of government 
said that "rarely has a nation been subjected to such merciless 
savagery in the full view of the world" as had Bosnia. 
  Stressing the humanitarian nature of their high-profile 
mission, Bhutto and Ciller called for the immediate lifting of 
the "unjust" international arms embargo, which "contravenes 
(Bosnia's) inherent right to self-defence." 
  With all-party peace talks on the future of Bosnia set to 
resume February 10 in Geneva amid signs of intensified military 
build-ups by all three sides on the ground, the two leaders 
denounced all attempts to impose a settlement on the 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian side. 
  "Bosnia must not be forced to negotiate at gunpoint," the 
statement said. "We will resist an imposed settlement which 
rewards the aggressor." [passage omitted] 
  Both women -- the most senior politicians to visit Sarajevo 
since French President Francois Mitterrand in June 1992 -- also 
stressed they were opposed to a carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Bhutto and Ciller, who were given the red-carpet treatment 
and a guard of honour on arrival at Sarajevo airport and for 
whose visit the UN Protection Force imposed tight security 
measures, called in their statement for an end to the siege of 
the capital. 
  They also called for the immediate lifting of all obstacles 
to the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the re-opening of Tuzla 
airport, northern Bosnia, which has been shelled by Bosnian Serb 
troops. [passage omitted] 
  The Bosnian premier was due to take the two leaders on a 
tour 
of the city's main Kosevo hospital. [passage omitted] 
  Izetbegovic said Tuesday his government would reject at 
fresh 
talks any settlement not offering the "just peace" which had so 
far not been forthcoming. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by Ali H. Zerdin in Bled; date not 
given: "You Will Polish the Boots of German and British 
Officers"] 
  [Text] [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the visit to 
Slovenia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am. Everything has been in order, peaceful, 
clean, cultured. The service in the hotel has been good. 
  [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the meetings with the 
representatives of the Slovene parties? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, we have agreed on cooperation. We signed 
a joint statement with the Slovene National Party and I have 
invited them all to the congress of my party on 2 April. 
Everybody liked this. Generally speaking, you do not have many 
problems here. For example, the Trieste area used to be 
controversial, namely, whether Trieste would go to Yugoslavia or 
to Italy. There were no other conflicts. However, conflicts must 
be resolved in a peaceful manner, and once they are over, the 
Slavs will only smile at our conflicts in the past. The problems 
must be resolved so that Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia will be 
more compact. 
  [Zerdin] Compact? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, compact and not in pieces. If there will 
Bosnia-Herzegovinas and Montenegros then there will be endless 
quarrels and wars there. There should only be three parts: 
Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia, full stop. And Bulgaria. All 
foreign armies should leave Yugoslavia. 
  [Zerdin] What about the Muslims? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is no Muslim question. Historically 
speaking, the Muslims are ethnic Croats and Serbs. This is a 
complex region, anyway. However, this was also the case in 
France. There used to be the Normans, the Gaelic, and the 
Bretons there.... And France, which is a peaceful country 
nowadays, has emerged from all this. This could have also been 
the case with you, the South Slavs who have had Yugoslavia, but 
it did not work out. If this must be so then let it be only 
three parts there: Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia. And not eight 
pieces. Such a quantity cannot ensure quality. If there are 
eight countries, there will be wars. 
  [Zerdin] What about Macedonia? 
  [Zhirnovskiy] Macedonia? That is Bulgaria. Actually, the 
Turkish Thrace, Romanian Dobrogea, Bulgaria, and Macedonia are a 
sort of unity. 
  [Zerdin] So what should this be, Macedonia or Bulgaria? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Instead of Bulgaria, it should be named 
Macedonia. This would be more fair. Serbia should get the 
Serbian part of the present Macedonia, but otherwise this would 
be a big country. Alexander the Great, who conquered all of Asia 
Minor and got all the way to India, was from this area. 
  [Zerdin] What about Russia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] See, what is Ukraine? It is Russia. 
  [Zerdin] And Czechia and Slovakia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Because of the Sudetenland and Moravia, the 
Czechs are closer to the Germans. Practically speaking, Czechia 
has no future. Germany will gradually take it over. Bratislava, 
however, could turn into a center for East European Slavic 
cooperation. This would be a counterbalance to the West European 
alliance. Bratislava could be something similar to what 
Strasbourg and Maastricht are for the Western Europe. 
Economically, the Slavs could have been stronger than Western 
Europe. However, they would have to act without ideologies. The 
entire Western Europe is infected with fascism: Spain, Italy, 
Greece, Germany. Eastern Europe used to be ailing from 
communism. Now there is a threat of nationalism. There is 
killing again and there are wars. This must be stopped. In the 
21th century, the arms will speak for the last time against 
those who will be against democracy. This will be a religious 
war against the Muslim world. Well, it is already happening. For 
this reason, I have also written the book -- the Last Push to 
the South. 
  At the end of the 20th century, there will be no more 
international wars, however, religious wars will begin. You see, 
Turkey toward the Caucasus, Azerbaijan against Armenia.... These 
are religious wars. Here is Tajikistan, and if these wars spread 
World War II will take place. We are in a situation similar to 
Europe in 1935. Nobody expected a war then and suddenly it has 
all started. Now Turkey and Iran can push toward Caucasus, the 
Turks are penetrating into the Balkans, Iraq in Central Asia, 
Afghanistan in Tajikistan. You will have pan Islamism, Balkans, 
Arabs. France and Germany will be destabilized. Finally, Europe 
will be in a state of war. 
  [Zerdin] Who can stop all this? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Only Russia. Russia could be a factor of 
stability. It could stop the process of disintegration of 
Europe, the Balkans, and central Asia. You see yourselves what 
has happened after Russia has withdrawn from the Balkans. A war 
has happened. If Russia helps, war can be prevented. 
  [Zerdin] Slovenia would like to become a NATO member. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Well, if Slovenia becomes a NATO member it 
will really be a servant. A servant! You were in the army, 
weren't you? You know how one has to polish boots. You will 
polish boots to the German and British officers. NATO will be 
able to send its troops in Slovenia and you will have to feed a 
foreign army. Only this and nothing more. Nobody will attack 
Slovenia, that is true, but it will be occupied by a foreign 
army. 
  [Zerdin] So what do you propose? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Neutrality is the best. If you join NATO you 
will lose everything. Foreign soldiers will idle around and 
drink in your courtyard, while you will have to work for them.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernard Nezmah: "Diplomacy Without a Tail"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry of Lojze Peterle, who has 
been criticized in the parliament for placing forestry engineers 
in the highest positions, approached Zhirinovskiy's visit in 
Slovenia in an ingenious fashion. To win the Russian 
authorities' approval, the ministry advised Mr. Girenko, charge 
d'affaires at the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, that V. 
Zhirinovskiy should leave Slovenia as quickly as possible 
because his group had flagrantly disturbed public order in Bled. 
The Russian ambassador is, of course, looking toward the future 
and wisely advised that this problem should be resolved by the 
Slovene juridical system. However, the hand of the Slovene 
Foreign Ministry obviously does not reach beyond the foyer of 
its own building. Who is going to take seriously a foreign 
ministry that the Croatian authorities can outmaneuver anytime 
they please and that is threatening to the Russian 
parliamentarian like a paper tiger. While Peterle has been 
granting diplomatic privileges all over the place, he treats the 
chief of the most powerful Russian party worse than a foreign 
hooligan. How many affluent foreign guests have broken a little 
something in hotels and had a bit of fun on the streets but were 
not expelled from the country because of it? Furthermore, a 
vehicle that Lord Carrington was racing through Styria a few 
years ago fatally ran over a Slovene citizen. The English 
gentleman was neither expelled from the state nor prosecuted. A 
grim image of independent Slovenia without a sovereign foreign 
policy. Appeasement of the West and hatred of the East have 
reached the outermost limits of insanity. There is no longer 
any mention of Slovene neutrality in the parliament, not even a 
shred of an idea about the possible benefits of a military 
alliance with the Russians. Slovene politicians, with the 
exception of bright Jelincic, take it for granted that the 
United States have a more favorable attitude toward Slovene 
independence than Russia. They are falling all over prima donna 
Albright, who comes empty-handed, but fear Zhirinovskiy like a 
devil fears the cross, even though he has signed a statement 
with Jelincic on Slovenia's independence, its position as an 
East-West bridge, and other related things. East Europeans are 
so very precious because they inspire some dignity in the 
Slovenes. Only next to the Ukranian Foreign Minister has 
President Kucan managed to regain the appearance of a serious 
statesman. Now if only he could get rid of a bothersome tic 
that automatically pulls his face into a smile at the sight of a 
western politician.

  [Excerpt] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received 
[Turkish Prime Minister] Tansu Ciller and [Pakistani Prime 
Minister] Benazir Bhutto at the presidential palace this 
evening, the president's office said in a statement. 
  Both prime ministers told President Tudjman about their 
impressions after their short visit to Sarajevo and stressed the 
need to establish peace as soon as possible as well as mutual 
trust between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey and Pakistan will do their utmost for 
this to be achieved. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto particularly stressed that 
international borders are inviolable, ethnic cleansing 
impermissible, and that the situation must be reestablished as 
it was before the war. 
  Pakistan upholds Croatia's justified demand to have the [UN] 
protected zones reintegrated into its state and legal system. 
She also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina must preserve its 
multicultural and multiethnic character and that the fighting 
between the Croats and Bosnian Muslims should end, as she had 
also told [Bosnian] Prime Minister Silajdzic during their brief 
talks. 
  Turkish Prime Minister Ciller said Turkey is pressing for 
the 
urgent establishment of peace in the area, but that only a just 
solution can be accepted. Continued hostilities will mean that 
the longer they go on the more difficult it will be to reach a 
political agreement, and the foundations for the communal life 
of Bosnian Muslims and Croats will be seriously threatened. 
  At the end of their talks President Tudjman said that the 
Croats and Bosnian Muslims must reach agreement and he proposed 
that both [the Pakistani and the Turkish] prime ministers press 
for a summit of all interested countries with the aim of 
establishing peace, which Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller 
accepted. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said her country 
is ready to host such talks, because the establishment of peace 
would be in the interest of the whole of Europe and the world.

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Pakistani Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto urged here late Wednesday [2 February] the use of 
NATO air strikes in Bosnia unless a rapid political solution to 
the war could be found. 
  Speaking here after visiting Sarajevo earlier in the day 
with 
her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller, the Islamic head of 
government said the United Nations should press for an "early 
negotiated political settlement" and, failing that, opt for air 
strikes. 
  The United States had already "made it clear that it is 
prepared to go ahead" with air strikes, but a lot depended on 
the stance of European countries and UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  She added: "If the UN Secretary General feels that he cannot 
reach a consensus for air strikes, the least that can be done is 
allow the arms embargo (on Bosnia) to be lifted, so that the 
people of Bosnia can defend themselves." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Kocak from Zagreb] </F>
  [Excerpts] The prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan held 
a joint news conference in Zagreb where they stopped over after 
their humanitarian visit to Sarajevo. Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller delivered the opening speech at the news conference 
where the foreign ministers of the respective countries also 
participated. 
  Ciller stated that they encountered a war for freedom during 
their visit, which was undertaken for humanitarian purposes. 
Ciller said: What the world should do is put 
Bosnia-Herzegovina back on the world map. We share the 
principles of the international community. Human rights is the 
most important value. Preventing terrorism and oppression is 
among the values we share. We should defend these values when 
and where the need arises. Calling for a tolerant approach to 
the religious and cultural unity of certain communities, Ciller 
called for the perpetuation of the values so that another Berlin 
Wall will not happen. 
  Indicating that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the 
joint goal of the whole world, Ciller appealed to international 
public opinion. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, a historical document -- termed the Sarajevo 
Communique -- concerning the joint Ciller-Bhutto visit to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was issued. Noting that the visit was for 
humanitarian purposes, the communique says that rarely in the 
annals of human history has a nation been subjected to such a 
massacre while the whole world is watching. 
  The Sarajevo Communique further states: It is terrifying 
that 
such a terrible human tragedy is being played out in the heart 
of a continent that prides itself on its commitment to human 
rights. It is unacceptable that in this era, where the 
principles of the United Nations are universally recognized, a 
sovereign and independent state is being violently wiped out and 
its people -- peace-loving and enlightened -- massacred. 
  We are respectfully saluting the heroism shown by the people 
of Bosnia. We are supporting them in their just struggle toward 
the continuation of their national existence. We are supporting 
them all the way in their determination to defend their 
territorial integrity, the sovereignty of their motherland, and 
their political independence. 
  The international disrespect shown in reaction to this 
aggression is horrifying. We appeal to the world community to 
halt the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN Security 
Council should make sure that all its resolutions are properly 
implemented. The embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina should 
be lifted. The embargo violates their most important 
international right -- the right to self-defense. 
  Bosnia should not be coerced into [word indistinct] 
negotiations. We will stand against any initiative that supports 
aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot be considered the basis for 
the emergence of a country. The conscientious efforts of the 
United Nations and other humanitarian organizations should not 
be belittled. We are appealing for an immediate lifting of all 
obstacles standing in the way of humanitarian aid for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this reason, Tuzla Airport should be 
reopened. The blockade on Sarajevo and the region declared the 
security region should be lifted and the bombing of the civilian 
population should be stopped immediately. Apart from this, an 
all-out cease fire should be imposed and negotiations renewed. 
  Ciller and Bhutto made a courtesy call on Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman. The Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and 
other officials saw Ciller off in Zagreb. It is expected that 
Ciller will arrive in Turkey at midnight.

  [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies has adopted the following 
conclusions on Croatian foreign policy: 
  The Chamber of Deputies gives its support to the joint 
declaration signed by the Republic of Croatia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, as a political means for achieving 
lasting peace. 
  The declaration is an important step toward mutual 
recognition of the two sovereign countries, and also paves the 
way for reaching a political solution and for unconditional 
re-integration of the UN-protected areas into the Republic of 
Croatia. The declaration will contribute toward normalizing 
relations between the two states and toward general stability in 
the whole of southeast Europe. An important step on the way is 
explicit recognition of all the states in their legitimate 
international borders. 
  The Chamber of Deputies called on Bosnian Muslims to 
unconditionally and promptly halt attacks on Croat-populated 
areas, in particular in central Bosnia. If they fail to do so, 
the chamber believes that the government and the president of 
the republic should examine the current state of diplomatic 
relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The deputies most strongly condemn all crimes and acts which 
are in breach of international law on warfare and humanitarian 
issues, and call on the president and government to do their 
utmost in the diplomatic, political, humanitarian and all other 
fields to guarantee the survival and normal life of Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  All sides in the conflict were called upon to persist in 
their efforts to end the war through negotiation and political 
means and to reach a just and lasting solution acceptable to all 
three peoples. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly 
wound up today's discussion on Croatia's foreign policy. Around 
20 deputies as well as Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, took part. After a recess until 
1600, the chamber is to vote on resolutions that a multiparty 
commission has proposed to the chamber. Kreso Zadravec and 
Jasenka Dudic have a report on the assembly's work so far: 
[passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Addressing the deputies, Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
spoke about the strategic goals of Croatian foreign policy. 
Explaining the goals of the joint Yugoslav-Croatian 
declaration, he said that the present situation is untenable and 
a military option would cause casualties and the complete 
isolation of Croatia, which, as he said, we were clearly told. 
There is no compromising over our fundamental goals -- 
reintegration and the return of refugees -- which will be our 
guiding idea in the normalization of relations. Asked why 
Croatia was not recognized by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
before the signing of the declaration, Granic replied: 
  [Begin Granic recording] Of course, we demanded that in 
precise terms. However, as Milosevic was not ready for it at 
that time, we did not establish relations at the level of 
ambassadors, but at the level of offices, bureaus, refraining 
from forming judgements in advance. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] He also dwelled on the resolution of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina where, as he said, Croat-Muslim 
relations ought to be permanently regulated for political, 
economic, and strategic reasons with the cessation of 
hostilities as a priority task. 
  He again denied allegations about the presence of Croatian 
troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that he had informed the 
Security Council about the fact that between 1,500 and 2,000 
Croat volunteers of Bosnian origin are in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
while at least 3,000 to 8,000 Muslim volunteers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina come from Islamic countries. 
  Among other things, Minister Granic spoke about Croatia's 
admission to the Council of Europe and said that the admission 
was primarily blocked because of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He supported [Serbian National Party Vice 
Chairman] Pejnovic's proposal that legitimate [as heard] Serbs 
from the assembly be included in the talks with international 
factors.

<F P=106> [Address by Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and </F>
foreign minister, to the Chamber of Deputies in Zagreb on 2 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] I wish to thank this esteemed chamber for giving me 
the opportunity to reply to many important questions and 
dilemmas -- including moral ones. However, I refuse to take 
part in any ideological debates or folkloric manifestations. I 
will focus on certain issues of major importance, and I believe 
I will disclose some new information, because it happens that 
people sometimes jump to wrong conclusions due to a lack of 
accurate information. 
  Conducting foreign policy is governed by highly complex and 
multifaceted rules imposed by moral and ethical values and 
dilemmas, as well as by the necessity of reaching short- and 
long-term objectives with precisely defined and limited means, 
by outside rules, and the imperative of the times. 
  What is the basic objective of Croatia's foreign policy, its 
state policy? A modern, European, democratic Croatian state 
with respect for human rights, minority rights, and the rights 
of ethnic communities; a state that guarantees the highest 
European standards. A state ready to accept international 
supervision by the Council of Europe or the CSCE. 
  What are its strategic guidelines? First and foremost, the 
reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] into the state 
and legal system of Croatia -- this is the first strategic 
guideline. Then comes the resolution of the crisis, the war in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, and the establishment of a just peace. 
There is the regulation of all disputed issues with our 
neighbors and joining European integrational processes -- an 
agreement on associate membership in the European Union [EU], 
the joining of all European projects -- and, last but certainly 
not least, global and regional security mechanisms. This 
includes regional security mechanisms that we have already 
proposed to the CSCE and, of course, Partnership for Peace -- 
NATO's latest proposal; an extremely important proposal, 
especially for the future. 
  Most dilemmas and questions, a joint declaration -- yes or 
no 
[as received] -- concerned this first strategic guideline. The 
only real difference in fact lies in expectation. There are no 
other differences. I have not heard that anyone is satisfied 
with the present situation. We all agree about this. Of 
295,000 Croats and non-Serb people in UNPAs and Pink Zones, 
almost all have been expelled. Except a few thousand elderly 
people. Ethnic cleansing is almost complete. There are still 
7,800 people either missing or forcibly taken away. Respect for 
human rights is zero and practically beyond the control of the 
Croatian authorities. We have an excellent resolution of the UN 
Security Council -- 871 -- but it is certain that no fundamental 
and definite progress can be expected from the present UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] mandate. 
  I have also not heard many people say they were in favor of 
war. There are some deputies, however, who have taken this stand 
consistently. This is, of course, their right. I need to warn 
at this moment that this option would not only cause victims -- 
and the generals are much better placed to speak about this -- 
but also total and immediate isolation. Not just sanctions, but 
also total isolation. This is not guesswork, we were told this 
directly. 
  What is the third option? Only this, brave and full of 
challenge [as heard]. The last thing that can be said of us is 
that we are naive. 
  It is naive to expect that Milosevic will come to Zagreb and 
say that he is abandoning his policy. However, both the 
internal and external situation has made him willing to talk. 
The joint statement means only the first step, but the step 
that crosses the Rubicon. How far-reaching it is -- time and 
results will tell. 
  We are not compromising our fundamental objectives: to 
reintegrate the UNPA zones, enable the return of refugees, and, 
prior to that, achieve an overall cease-fire and establish 
traffic links, all this in a consistent process. This will, of 
course, be our guiding light in the process of normalizing 
relations. 
  At the first meeting we agreed to form a joint commission 
for 
missing persons. I believe this is a step forward. Opening 
missions means, in any case, establishing good communication 
channels without drawing any premature conclusions on any other 
issues. 
  Questions have been raised, I think by Mr. Kovacevic, about 
why Croatia was not immediately referred to in its borders, as 
in Security Council Resolution 871. Of course, this is exactly 
what we demanded. But, since Milosevic was not willing to agree 
to that, we did not establish relations on the level of 
ambassadors but on the level of representative offices, 
refraining from making any premature judgement. 
  The other question was the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the establishment of peace. The second 
strategic objective of Croatian foreign policy is to reach a 
lasting resolution of Croatian-Muslim relations -- for 
political, economic, and strategic reasons. All our friends are 
giving us advice to this effect. 
  Obviously, the first short-term objective is to halt all 
confrontation. It is neccessary to say something about the 
dynamism here. I will not go too far back into the past, only 
to the beginning of the war or the Serb aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We proposed two things, and they were even agreed on during 
the talks before the referendum [on the independence of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina]: We proposed a united but decentralized 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a military alliance. This was not 
accepted. On 12 July [1992] only the possibility of cooperation 
in border areas was accepted and it was on the basis of this 
agreement that certain, very limited, forces [of the Republic of 
Croatia] were brought to defend the Dubrovnik hinterland. 
  The Vance-Owen plan was accepted in the same spirit. But 
after six weeks of procrastination by the Bosnian-Muslim side it 
was rejected by the Serb side. Everything else is well known. 
  This was at the time when the United States was ready for 
military intervention. They did not get the support of the 
European Community and the Russian Federation. After that, the 
European Community proposal was discussed. The basic proposal 
was a union of three republics. What happened then? A joint 
declaration was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic on 
14 September, as well as an additional agreement which envisaged 
a lasting solution for Croatian-Muslim relations. This 
agreement was not implemented, but certainly not through the 
fault of Croatia's state policy. 
  President Tudjman's proposal tabled at Petersberg in Bonn 
was 
primarily designed to halt the war and establish a lasting 
peace. It offered options for achieving this. The first option 
was a union of the three republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the talks that we have held, and I have witnessed all the 
events in the last two months, the main contentious issues were 
central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, and, of course, the 
hydroelectric system. Little was achieved with the first 
contentious issue, central Bosnia, for what was being proposed 
was practically for the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to withdraw 
from Vitez and Busovaca. 
  And that is where things remained. Some progress had been 
achieved on the issue of the outlet to the sea and on the 
primarily industrial Mostar and the hydro-energetic system. 
Proposals were made for an immediate ceasefire and separation, 
military separation. It was proposed that forces of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croat Defence Council should 
exclusively face Serb positions. This proposal was not 
accepted. What happened then? As you can see, the rejection of 
the European Union's concept -- which had previously been 
accepted -- accusations about the Croatian Army's presence in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are grave. 30,000 troops and 20,000 to be 
deployed additionally. 
  We informed the UN Security Council in our letter that there 
were 1,500 to 2,000 volunteers -- some of them former Croatian 
Army officers and soldiers demobilized in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
That is a realistic number. The chief of the Croatian Army 
General Staff, General Bobetko, is the best person to ask. 
However, it is certain that the number is much higher -- 
figures vary from 3,000 to 6,000 and even 8,000. It is hard to 
tell -- but there are definitely more volunteers from the 
Islamic countries. 
  There are curently at least five different approaches to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina problem: The European Union continues to 
stick to its proposal and wishes to exert pressure on all three 
sides; the United States differs in the sense that it does not 
wish to apply too much pressure on the Muslim side, they have 
said so publicly; the Russian Federation opposes any kind of 
military intervention; the Islamic countries advocating a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; and of course we must take into account what 
the other moral authorities in the world are saying, that the 
most important thing at this moment is to bring an end to the 
conflict and the suffering. 
  Our offer to the Muslim side is still open and we are 
prepared to talk immediately and anywhere about any rational 
proposal. The first thing is the end of these clashes, but 
without any preconditions. As far as Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, it is well-known that about 
200,000 to 210,000 have been expelled as a result of a Serb 
offensive and about 100,000 to 110,000 in central Bosnia as a 
result of a Muslim offensive -- this means about 320,000. 
  One has to be sensitive to disquiet, and the interests in 
certain regions must be different. One must not put special 
emphasis on the differences but instead insist on unity. 
  As far as strategy, final strategy is concerned, in any case 
a cease-fire and the resumption of talks... [pauses] We have 
not moved forward from the EU proposal, no one from among the 
other international factors has any other concrete proposals. 
Talks are being conducted in Washington at present between the 
United States, France, Germany, and England. Russians are 
included in the talks. We shall see whether any concrete 
proposals will emerge. But as far as the cease-fire is 
concerned, there must be no dilemma -- it is most important that 
agreement on the cease-fire be reached immediately. 
  As for the regulation of relations with our neighbors -- 
Slovenia -- most problems have stemmed from the break-up of 
former Yugoslavia. We hope that almost seven agreements, 
including a solution in principle for Krsko [nuclear plant], 
will be achieved by Monday, that we shall continue to work on 
the property and legal solutions and on a solution to the 
Ljubljana bank and resolve all these problems in a month or so. 
We also hope that intensive work will be carried out with the 
aim of defining the borders. A joint commission will meet for 
the first time on 15th February in Bled. 
  We also discussed Piran Bay. Our proposal for the 
demaraction line is well-known, but there were a number of very 
(?useful) suggestions regarding joint use which were welcome. 
  As far as Italy is concerned, I will go there tomorrow to 
meet Italian Foreign Minister Andretta, and I expect to be 
received by the Holy Father and Cardinal [name indistinct]. I 
will have an opportunity to convey President Tudjman's personal 
message to the Holy Father. 
  It is certain that the situation regarding the deaths of the 
three journalists in Mostar has made my visit more difficult, 
especially as far as the Italian public is concerned, because in 
the past two months Minister Andreatta had adopted very 
constructive stands during the last meetings in Geneva and 
Brussels. 
  Our aim is, naturally, to discuss all open questions and 
there is no doubt that Italy is not just one of the most 
important economic partners, but also an economic power. Italy 
has considerable influence within the EU and the settlement of 
all questions with Italy is one of our priority goals. 
  President Tudjman will visit Romania this month and Albania 
at the end of this month. As for European integration 
processes, the Council of Europe [word indistinct] with the EU 
are above all blocked because of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the main reason. 
  We are cooperating closely. Over 70 different missions of 
the Council of Europe visited Croatia and our parliamentary 
delegation was very active and successful in the work [of 
Council of Europe] for which it was comended. I was present. 
However, the present situation -- not to pursue the next step, 
which means the arrival of reporters in Croatia -- is linked 
exclusively with the situation in and the settlement of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard]. Of course there are 
other objections, which is natural for a country developing its 
democratic system, but they are no longer that important. 
  As far as regional and global security mechanisms are 
concerned our proposal was accepted and it will be further 
discussed within the framework of the CSCE. All countries 
expected to become part of this should adhere to this regional 
security mechanism. This would be of great advantage for the 
Republic of Croatia because -- if Serbia and Montenegro, the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], would like to be part of this 
system -- they would have to reduce their military troops and 
equipment to the level determined by the regional security 
mechanism and additionally meet all other conditions in line 
with the democratic institutions of the system. 
  Croatia welcomed the Partnership for Peace initiative. We 
are preparing a report we shall send to NATO. But this is, of 
course, a long-term project and the issue of borders should be 
resolved beforehand. 
  We must also answer a number of other questions raised by 
Mr. 
Pejnovic. Legitimate Serbs were elected to the Croatian 
Assembly and Resolution 871 envisages that we should have talks 
with the local Serbs. As for the benefit of the talks with all 
international factors I agree with you that it is necessary to 
[word indistinct]. 
  I will answer Paraga's question with a few words, it will be 
exclusively facts, nothing else. There are 261 persons in all 
of our diplomatic and consular offices. There are 36 embassies, 
five missions, and eight general consulates or consulates with 
an average of 5.3 percent of employed [as heard]. 
  I can also tell you that Hungary has 90, Slovakia 79, 
Denmark 
800 employed. Austria 800, Switzerland 2,000. [previous two 
sentences as heard] In no way have we exaggerated. The average 
income is 2,000, or in the case of a vice-consul 2,500 deutsche 
marks [DM]. A German consul earns about 9,000 DM. An ambassador 
earns about 5,100 DM. Anyone can get all the information if 
they want to. 
  As far as quality is concerned, we have some fortunate 
solutions, some less fortunate and few unfortunate solutions but 
as far as expert financial control it is total and this refers 
to all embassies. 
  It is necessary to say a few words about the present 
situation in conclusion. 
  The pressure over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past 48 hours 
has 
been immense. This concerns the presence of the Croatian Army 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, this is part of the strategic 
plan of applying pressure on the Republic of Croatia. Things 
might become even worse -- the Security Council will be in 
session on Friday [4th February], there might be a presidential 
statement to this effect, as well as a statement issued by the 
Council of Europe whose meeting on 7 and 8 February will be 
devoted to the same subject. This is the agreed form of 
pressure -- everybody agrees in this respect. 
  It is certain at this moment that we all have to persevere 
in 
our adherence to some basic guidelines. I believe that we all 
agree that a ceasefire and the search for a lasting solution 
with the Muslims is the first of the strategic objectives, while 
the other strategic objective is to find a peaceful resolution, 
through negotiations -- but bearing in mind our fundamental 
national interests -- with the Serb side. Thank you.

  [Text] If there is still anyone who wants to argue that 
Croatia will not have sanctions imposed on it and that this is 
yet another round of pressure under way, then he should support 
this view by putting his name to it and then perhaps somebody 
might believe him. However, there are no such political 
statements, just as there is no objective assessment of the 
reasons and motives for the imposition of sanctions and of the 
consequences that such a move would cause for the citizens of 
Croatia. 
  The threat of sanctions has been swinging like a pendulum, 
at 
times very close, at times on the opposite side; however, the 
pendulum has never stopped swinging. If it was at its furthest 
when U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright announced 
sanctions in the event of direct Croatian involvement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it started to move with seemingly 
marginal details such as the open participation of the deputies 
from the Croatian Parliament in HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
formations. The deaths of three Italian journalists in Mostar 
had a great influence on international public opinion. The 
assessments by foreign observers about the activities of 
military formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been analyzed 
more thoroughly in the foreign than in the domestic press. The 
fact that the Croatian Foreign Ministry and even the foreign 
minister himself must all too often put right the results of 
foreign affairs blunders committed by other ministries, thus, 
taking away the time and credibility needed to interprete the 
essence of Croatia's interests and policy, itself indicates how 
this threat has been underestimated. Why was Dr. Mate Granic 
put in a situation in which he had to discuss the mobilization 
of the editor of [the satirical newspaper] FERAL TRIBUNE in the 
Council of Europe? 
  Regardless of the nature of Croatia's engagement in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, it would pay to estimate what the sanctions would 
bring. The Serbian economy has been wrecked although it had 
many elements of resistance to sanctions that Croatia does not 
have. This was, primarily, the structure of the economy, in 
which the export sector is poorly represented. The agricultural 
population forms a considerable segment of the demographic 
structure of that country. Serbia did not need to care about 
the views of the West because it had the support on the other 
side, which for a long time permitted it to keep the borders to 
the east permeable for oil and other goods. Besides, when it 
started its conquests, it had considerably larger foreign 
currency reserves that Croatia has now. 
  In what state would the sanctions befall Croatia? In normal 
relations with the world, it is to Croatia's advantage that it 
has an open economy in which imports constitute over half the 
estimated GNP and exports slightly less than that. Left without 
foreign markets, it could not rely on its rural population. In 
the West it borders countries that could not compromise their 
own international position and reputation by violating 
sanctions. The economic disintegration that has taken place in 
Serbia would be considerably more rapid in Croatia. 
  Against all these points one should emphasize at least one 
infallible argument for which sanctions are worth the risk. 
Even if it is true that the Croatian side bears no guilt and 
the sanctions are merely an excuse for the West to distance 
itself from the Balkan crisis, it would pay to avoid even the 
slightest motives. Namely, if we are exposed to all this risk 
because of the sheer desire to help the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the situation is truly absurd: Croatia 
under sanctions could not even help itself!

<F P=106> [Article by B. Gulan: "We Will Open the Roads, Providing </F>
Certain Concessions Are Made"] 
  [Text] At the start of the normalization of relations 
between Yugoslavia and Croatia, the possibility arises of 
initiating the process of dealing with the Krajina-Croat 
problems that need to be solved. Namely, Croatia and the 
republic of Serbian Krajina have things to discuss, but only 
peacefully and with mutual respect. The opening of a Croat 
office in Belgrade and a Yugoslav one in Zagreb can only help 
and speed things up, says Slobodan Jarcevic, interior minister 
in the government of the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  I believe that the republic of Serbian Krajina was not 
discussed when the agreement between the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was signed. Perhaps 
Croatia is hoping that Yugoslavia will help it to reintegrate 
the republic of Serbian Krajina into the Croatian borders as 
defined by AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of 
Yugoslavia], but that is just an illusion. This is the fifth 
year that the republic of Serbian Krajina has not been a part of 
Croatia, and that must be accepted. Relations between the 
republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia will depend solely on 
Croatia's readiness to recognize our state, stressed Slobodan 
Jarcevic. 
  The agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia pertains only 
to 
those areas that are under Croatian control and that are not 
controversial. The peace process means the end of combat 
activity on the borders of the republic of Serbian Krajina and 
Croatia. There can be no discussion abut the republic of Serbian 
Krajina's territories without the legitimate representatives of 
the republic of Serbian Krajina, says Jarcevic. Croatia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are two sovereign states and, as 
such, they can sign agreements. The republic of Serbian Krajina 
never conditioned Yugoslavia's position toward Croatia. 
However, a similar agreement between the republic of Serbian 
Krajina and Croatia cannot be expected, because this would mean 
that Croatia has recognized the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
And it will most certainly not be the one to do so first. On 
the contrary. At the moment, no one wishes to sign a similar 
agreement with us, because both the Croatian and Muslim sides in 
Bosnia -- with which we share borders -- are adhering to the 
conclusions of the international community according to which 
our right to statehood has not been recognized. 
  One of the important elements of the Yugoslav-Croatian 
agreement is certainly the anticipated opening of roads, that 
is, the Belgrade-Zagreb highway, a part of which runs through 
the republic of Serbian Krajina's territory. According to 
Slobodan Jarcevic, it will be possible to open the highway if 
Croatia is willing to make certain concessions to the republic 
of Serbian Krajina. 
  We primarily have in mind the transit route to Hungary 
through Western Slavonia. All passengers travelling through the 
republic of Serbian Krajina will be subject to our laws. We 
shall have border crossings like any other state. For allowing 
the Croatian railroad to run through Knin, we shall demand to be 
allowed to use of one of the ports on the Croatian coast. Or, 
for example, we can solve the problem of supplying Zadar with 
water from the Zrmanja River, but in return, the Croat side has 
to enable the production of electric power at the Obrovac 
hydro-electric power plant, says Jarcevic. 
  Even before the war, some vital parts of the generator were 
dismantled and taken to Karlovac. The Krajina authorities 
understand the Croats' problems in trying to establish a traffic 
route connecting the north and the south, but we will demand a 
port in return for allowing the passage of trains from Zagreb to 
Split. Similar standards will be applied in the case of the 
highway, the oil pipeline, and telecommunications. We 
understand them, but we are also protecting our interests, which 
are unavoidable in a state whose existence has entered its fifth 
calendar year, stressed Slobodan Jarcevic.

  [Editorial Report] Zagreb GLOBUS in Serbo-Croatian on 28 
January on pages 2 and 9 carries an approximately 3,500-word 
report on the results of GLOBUS' "big" poll on the popularity of 
Croatian politicians and political parties. The report, 
entitled "Although More Than 90 Percent of Croats Are 
Dissatisfied, President Tudjman's Popularity Is Rising," does 
not contain any information on how the poll was conducted. The 
only information concerning the size of the sample is that 
"2,120 citizens were approached" and that "more than 1,100 did 
not refuse to answer the questions." 
  The results of the poll's question on the popularity of 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Drazen Budisa, leader of 
the main opposition party, the Croatian Social Liberal Party 
(HSLS), are expressed in percentages and show the following:

General Momcilo Perisic, chief of general staff of the Yugoslav 
Army, said today that the U.S. intention to use 
remote-controlled aircraft (?controlled from) Albania for spying 
on the territory of the FRY and Bosnia clearly shows that the 
Americans have decided to embark on a full-scale intelligence 
operation by involving countries with certain designs against us. 
  In the Kragujevac radio program "The Hallmark of Time," Gen. 
Perisic said that Albania is in a certain way getting involved 
in a struggle against Yugoslavia by expressing certain 
territorial aspirations. Planned infiltration of their people, 
sent to carry out certain activities, into our territory is a 
part of the scenario. According to Perisic one of the main parts 
of the scenario is "to cause border incidents in order to 
present a false picture to the world of the suffering of 
innocent Albanians. Our border guards use weapons in accordance 
with the regulations of their service and gravest consequences 
have occurred," he said. 
  "The ultimate aim is to achieve one thing only -- to create 
conditions for the international community to demonize the Serbs 
in this area too, as has been done in the Srpska republic and in 
the republic of Serb Krajina," the chief of the Yugoslav general 
staff said. 
  Asked to comment on increasingly frequent statements by 
politicians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that 
the Macedonians are under threat from the north, Gen. Perisic 
said that "the creators of the new world order were not sure 
that Yugoslavia would be securely sealed in this region, so -- 
under the pretext of preventing incidents -- they sent their 
forces." Perisic said incidents in this region "happen 
periodically, but increasingly often." 
  "Incidents at the Yugoslav border with Albania and Macedonia 
are aimed at creating the impression that it is Yugoslavia that 
causes them, while in fact it is just the opposite. The aim is 
clear -- to demonize the Serbs and Yugoslavia in the world's 
eyes in order to achieve the West's strategic objectives," Gen. 
Perisic concluded.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Saber Rattling 
While Talking Peace," published on page 10 of the 23 January 
1994 issue of Zagreb NEDJELJNI VJESNIK, the paper's military 
analyst, Fran Visnar, writes that Serbia has recently delivered 
new arms and equipment to the "Krajinas" to replace materiel 
"Serb rebels" lost during the war in Croatia in 1992-93 and in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbs did not even bother to camouflage 
tanks, guns, vehicles, and containers of ammunition loaded on 
trucks and railway cars sent to the Bosnian Serb Army, Visnar 
reports. All convoys for Baranja in eastern Croatia were 
escorted by military and police personnel of the so-called 
republic of Serbian Krajina, while transports bound for Bosnia 
were handled by military and police personnel of the so-called 
Srpska republic. Visnar believes that with the establishment of 
political relations with Herceg-Bosna and its army the Serbs 
have relieved the major burden on their forces, which will now 
probably feel free to "step up their attacks against the Muslim 
enclaves in eastern and central Bosnia." They might, he writes, 
launch their biggest military operations: "a combined 
motorized-infantry and airborne assault on Tuzla" and "a 
prolonged artillery and missile at tack" on the Muslim 
stronghold of Zenica. As evidence of Serbian military 
objectives, Visnar cites data on "huge supplies" of 
sophisticated weapons sent to Serb-controlled Bosnia before the 
latest round of peace talks in Geneva on 18 January as well as 
the injection of Serb "elite units" to finish off the 
Bosnian-Herzegovina Army. Units of the 72d and 63d airborne 
brigades from Pancevo (Serbia) and the 63d airborne brigade from 
Nis (Serbia) -- components of the Special Forces Corps within 
the 3d Serbian Army -- were relocated to Bijeljina in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, ostensibly for "maneuvers." Both brigades, Visnar 
points out, consist of professional personnel, 95 percent of 
whom are veterans of combat in Slovenia, Croatia, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their objective, Visnar states, is to take 
the Dubrava airfield near Tuzla to prevent UNPROFOR from 
reopening it and to "cleanse" the area of Muslims. He is 
convinced that to succeed the Serbs are prepared to endure even 
"a limited NATO air raid or air bombardment for a period of 
time." Visnar sees Belgrade as counting on Croatian support, 
since Croatia fears that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, supplied 
through the Tuzla airport, would turn against the Croats in 
central Bosnia. 
  Despite a professed desire for normalization of relations 
between Serbia and Croatia, the VJESNIK article warns, the 
"Krajinas" are not defeated, and Milosevic's satellite state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has a strong army ready to protect its 
"weaker" brothers in Croatia and to fight the Bosnian Muslims. 
The article includes photographs of what it identifies as 
Serbian arms and equipment: 90- and 120-mm bazookas, SA-341 
Gazelle attack helicopters, and T-54, T-55, and M-84A tanks, as 
well as a detailed description of the Dubrava airfield.

  [Text] Belgrade, 2 February (TANJUG) -- Serbian Patriarch 
Pavle received the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in the Patriarchate today. 
  Following their talks behind closed doors that lasted for 
half an hour, Zhirinovskiy told a TANJUG journalist: ``His 
holiness blessed us, and we invited him to come to Moscow where 
a congress of Slav nations is to be held on 4 April. 
  "We spoke of Russia's return to the right path of the 
Orthodox religion," Zhirinovskiy said stressing that the Russian 
and Serbian Orthodox churches should direct all their efforts to 
the spiritual renaissance of their nations. 
  "We shall invest efforts that the state make amends for 
everything that the Russian and the Serbian churches have lost 
over the past years. It would be better if the youths that have 
gone astray experience their purification through spiritual 
education than through prisons and emigration," Zhirinovskiy 
said. 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that he was moved in particular by a 
plea made yesterday by a little girl from Herzegovina who told 
him: "Vladimir, save my dad who is on the front, don't let NATO 
kill my dad." 
  "Such moving things brought us here," he said. 
  Asked if he would meet Serbian President Milosevic, 
Zhirinovskiy said: "Maybe." 
  Even though it had been announced that only Zhirinovskiy and 
his two associates would pay a visit, numerous members of the 
Association of Serb-Russian Friendship also came to the 
Patriarchate, including the leader of the Party of Serb Unity, 
Zeljko Raznjatovic, and the chairman of the Serb National 
Renewal, Mirko Jovic.

  [Excerpt] The assembly session only resumed a few minutes 
ago, but, believe it or not, it is already finished. Actually, 
it has been postponed until Tuesday [8 February]. 
  The new Assembly Chairman Dragan Tomic stated that the 
reason 
for the delay in the session were consultations among the heads 
of the deputy caucuses. They were supposed to agree on the 
candidates for the [four] posts of deputy assembly chairmen. 
The meeting was not attended by any DEPOS representatives. In 
addition, only two people were proposed as deputy chairmen. 
Tomic thought that the best thing would be to hold more 
consultations and that the session should be postponed until 
Tuesday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, leader of the Liberal Union </F>
of Montenegro, by Dragan Ogurlic; place and date not given: "The 
State of the Montenegrins Has Been Stolen"] 
  [Text] Recently, the Croatian public also heard about 
Slavko Perovic, leader of the opposition Liberal Union of 
Montenegro [LSCG]. Perovic realized that ideas advocated by his 
party were best presented in numerous interviews for the media 
in the "seceded" part of Yugoslavia, which he does not recognize 
as a state anyway. The 38-year-old lawyer from Cetinje, a poet 
and a member of the Montenegro PEN [International Association of 
Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists] center, 
one-time president of the Association of the Literary 
Municipality of Cetinje, who founded several magazines and radio 
stations, could write an interesting autobiography about the 
last ten years of his life. He experienced everything that an 
opposition leader would go through in a totalitarian regime: 
from arrests to tragic deaths of his family members caused by 
all kinds of attacks on Perovic and his party, whose members and 
followers are known by the symbol of the letter "L" made by 
separating the thumb and the index finger. 
  The LSCG was established as a political party on 26 January 
1990. It is different from other five valid parties in that, 
since its establishment, it has been advocating a Montenegro 
constituted as an independent state. Perovic considers the LSCG 
a party of political discontinuity in Montenegro. 
  [Perovic] We are very proud of the fact that, in our 
history, there was no party that we could use and add to. Our 
political project can be reduced to only one sentence, whose 
elements should be considered as they interact. Here is the 
sentence: Free individuals, free nation, independent 
Montenegro, liberal civic democracy, unlimited private property, 
and a free market. Therefore, we are a party that wants to shape 
the political public opinion of Montenegro. In that sense, we 
notice all assets of Montenegro: its enviable cultural and 
historical heritage, its extremely favorable geopolitical 
position, its exceptional nature, and potential natural 
resources. According to our estimates, if Montenegro functioned 
as an independent political and economic entity, all those 
potentials could make it one of the richer areas in the 
Mediterranean in three to five years. We consider ourselves 
privileged and thank God for having put us on such a divine 
land. We want to change the course of Montenegrin history, 
especially that of the post-World War II era, whose development 
concepts have been destroying Montenegro. 
<H5>  Friendship With Budisa </H5>
  [Ogurlic] There is a certain lack of clarity regarding the 
real political power of the LSCG. Some hold you are 
realistically the strongest opposition party, while others point 
at the Montenegrin parliament saying that you actually 
represented by only 13 deputies. 
  [Perovic] Let me tell you the truth. On 26 January 1990, we 
had 57 members, and today we have more than 19,000 members and 
that figure can best be appreciated in the light of the fact 
that, without refugees, Montenegro has about 620,000 
inhabitants. We mostly gather intellectuals, youth, modern 
people. We base our ideas on a sentence of our great ancestor 
Marko Miljanov, who said that he who defends himself from 
another man is a hero, and he who defends another man from the 
evil inherent within himself is a man. 
  Indeed, the Liberal Union today holds 13 out of the 85 
deputy 
seats in the Montenegrin parliament. Let me remind you that, in 
1990, on the basis of the elections held in December, we only 
had one deputy in the parliament, which then had 125 deputies, 
and that both the first and the second elections in Montenegro 
were undemocratic, a farce, for we mean much more for the 
political life of Montenegro then one can conclude from the 
number of seats we hold in the parliament. 
  [Ogurlic] Being a leader of the strongest opposition party 
in Montenegro, how familiar are you with the situation in 
Croatia and to what extent could you be compared with Budisa's 
HSLS Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS -- Croatia's leading 
opposition party]? 
  [Perovic] I think our program orientations are very close. 
Otherwise, we have very good contacts with the HSLS. We had 
contacts before the war as well, and to our great pleasure, we 
managed to preserve them regardless of all past and present 
conflicts. I can say that Mr. Budisa and I have a very friendly 
relationship. 

<H5>    We Do Not Recognize the FRY </H5>
  [Ogurlic] And what are your relations with the so-called 
FRY? Do you admit to living in Yugoslavia at all? 
  [Perovic] We simply do not recognize the FRY as a country. 
We did not go to the federal elections and we do not intend to 
in the future either. Let me explain why. The FRY is a result 
of an invalid referendum held here in Montenegro, and the 
quality of that referendum is best described by the fact that 
it, from passing the parliamentary decision of the voting 
apparatus of the Democratic Party of Socialists [DPS] on holding 
that referendum, to putting voting slips in ballot boxes, there 
were only seven days. Therefore, in just seven days, people had 
to decide on the state status of Montenegro, which is not a 
serious deadline in other states, not even regarding some 
municipal problems, let alone regarding those pertaining to the 
state. 
  We think that the referendum stole the country of the 
Montenegrins, and we did not want to take part in its work. I 
will tell you a story that describes the situation to people who 
are not very familiar with many Montenegrin qualities. This is 
the story: To recognize the FRY would be the same as when, for 
example, somebody steals 5 million dollars from you, opens his 
own bank with the money, appoints himself director, and offers 
you, whose money he stole, the position of a clerk in that bank. 
And you accept the offer, hoping that, using the internal legal 
organization of the bank, you will get hold of your money some 
day. The DPS, who promoted that theft, wants to convince us 
that the job of a bank clerk is great, they refer to it as being 
an equal in the FRY. We think that the position is 
unacceptable, we think the citizens and the international 
community must hear about that theft and try to achieve justice, 
i.e. to return what was stolen. 
<H5>  Milosevic Demands Acquiescence </H5>
  [Ogurlic] Does Montenegro have any state attributes at all 
in this situation? 
  [Perovic] No. It only has Minister Lekic, who thinks he is a 
minister, and a prime minister who thinks he is a prime 
minister, and the president of the Republic who thinks he is 
president. But we should look at it from a different angle. 
The ruling party, the DPS, does not exist at all. It is a 
small interest group that became very rich thanks to war 
profiteering and the black market. And they realized that 
Milosevic's iron grip is no longer in their interest. Now they 
are trying to distance themselves from Milosevic's regime, for 
he is no longer satisfied with the level of their sycophancy. 
Until now, they were kneeling before Milosevic, and now he 
demands acquiescence, i.e. for them to kneel and be down on 
their elbows. That is a little too much to demand, even from 
them. And they are trying to present to the world the fact that 
they are still on their knees as a kind of democratic effort, 
and so on. Consequently, by means of Minister Lekic and 
President of the Republic Bulatovic, who suddenly became a 
peacemaker although he organized war-time persecution in 
Montenegro, they are trying to present Montenegro as something 
different, which it really is, but not because they want that, 
but because civic opposition in Montenegro is an important 
factor. For foreign political representatives, Minister Lekic 
and President Bulatovic are the democratic face of an 
essentially antidemocratic power. 
  [Ogurlic] How do you interpret demands to abolish the 
Montenegrin Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry? 
  [Perovic] The Defense Ministry was abolished at the request 
of the army and because local authorities did not seriously 
resist, and as to the Foreign Ministry, it will abolish itself 
anyway. I think that in the next couple of months Mr. Lekic 
will not be able to go anywhere from the airport in Tirana, for 
nobody will want to have him. The essence of antidemocratic 
authorities is most obvious in its relation to the opposition, 
where that space for the opposition is being persistently 
narrowed, as well as the space for the media; people are 
arrested for being members of certain parties, they are 
maltreated, followed by secret police, their telephones are 
tapped. That is all a reflection of those authorities that 
actually function in legal and political provisory situation, 
for Montenegro is definitely not a state. 

<H5>    We and the Serbs Are Not One </H5>
  [Ogurlic] You are probably bothered by the fact that Europe 
and the world think Serbia and Montenegro are one, for I suppose 
that Montenegro is not a recognizable separate entity? 
  [Perovic] Yes, that is a great injustice to Montenegro. 
Indeed, it is not done on purpose, for they seem to be 
interested in the real situation. When they consider 
Montenegro, they look at the statistics and the result of the 
elections; they do not want to hear our explanation that those 
were undemocratic elections. 
  [Ogurlic] Let us get back to the country you do not 
recognize. Does the Federal Assembly exist at all? 
  [Perovic] The Federal Assembly is a circus that entertains 
Slobodan Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic, who writes 
homework for POLITIKA and DUGA. That body makes no decisions 
whatsoever; all decisions were made in Milosevic's study or in 
some other room. The Federal Assembly was destroyed the moment 
Seselj joined that body. Belgrade journalist Stojan Cerovic 
recently wrote a wonderful sentence describing the situation in 
the parliament; he said that ever since Mr. Seselj appeared in 
the federal parliament, that body looks like a cellar with a 
broken sewage pipe. It looks no better today. 
  [Ogurlic] Is it a coincidence that, lately, one hears the 
Montenegrins demanding their own church, news agency, airline 
company...? 
  [Perovic] That is not a coincidence. Regarding the 
Montenegrin Autocephalous Church, justice prevailed that day at 
Cetinje; the Montenegrin Orthodox Church has again become 
autocephalous, which it was for 300 years, and it became obvious 
that the Serbian Orthodox Church has been an intruder in 
Montenegro since 1920, when the then-regent of Yugoslavia, and 
later King Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, abolished the Montenegrin 
Orthodox Church against canon-law and annexed Montenegro to 
Serbia. Since that time, the territory of Montenegro has been 
exposed to the assimilation processes of Belgrade. 
<H5>  Elections? No, the People Have Not Yet Suffered Enough </H5>
  The process of imposing greater Serbian ideas on the 
territory of Montenegro gained momentum after Risto Radovic 
became the metropolitan bishop, for that man is telling the 
Montenegrins every day that they are the result of communist 
Balkan-Broz [Josip Broz Tito] fabrication, that they do not 
exist as a nation, and so forth. When people realized that they 
could not baptize their children in any of 660 Montenegrin 
churches -- if they want to baptize them as Montenegrins -- but 
that they can only register them as Serbs of Serbian religion, 
that was the final straw. The same holds for marriages. 
  [Ogurlic] You live under sanctions. I have been here only 
four days. Tell me how do you manage at all? 
  [Perovic] People still have some supplies left, many 
families have somebody working abroad, but the fact is that you 
cannot do much even if you have German marks, for there is 
nothing to buy. Shops in Montenegro have nothing on their 
shelves, except for perhaps two or three items. Until just a 
couple of months ago, street dealers would exchange German 
marks; today, that does not help, because prices are sky-high. 
One kilogram of something that costs 5 or 10 German marks [DM] 
in the West, costs DM30 in Montenegro. That is horrible. 
  [Ogurlic] Do you want parliamentary and presidential 
elections in Montenegro now? 
  [Perovic] No. People have not suffered enough yet. Given 
some time, the Montenegrins will have to decide which way to 
take: the road to total destruction, which is imminent in this 
situation, or they will realize that it would be best if they 
themselves decided about their destiny. We think that the only 
way out of this situation is to demand political sovereignty for 
Montenegro. For, Montenegro is suffering under sanctions for 
one reason only: because the political authorities were so close 
to Milosevic's regime. There are some signs from the West that, 
if Montenegro became independent, sanctions would be lifted from 
it. After lifting sanctions, we would be a little below zero 
and I am convinced that, due to the comparative advantages of 
Montenegro and the fact that it could be saved by a relatively 
small amount of money, Montenegro could recover, even with the 
present destroyed infrastructure. 
  [Ogurlic] You are accused of wanting to sell Montenegro to 
the Italians very cheaply? 
  [Perovic] Well, those imputations come from Belgrade and go 
to Belgrade. We definitely do not want to sell ourselves to 
anyone, but we would like to communicate with the world, if that 
were in our interest. Why can we not say that we will see who 
offers more? We know what Belgrade has given us and what it 
offers. 
<H5>  "A Fairy Brings Joy From Lovcen...." </H5>
  [Ogurlic] Tell us you opinion of an event that happened two 
years ago, when Dubrovnik was fiercely shelled. What do you 
think about that hundred-kilometers-long black spot on the 
conscience of the Montenegrins? 
  [Perovic] I will tell you what I think: The entire 
Dubrovnik operation, except for some goals revealed by General 
Kadijevic in his book "The War as I See It," had a much deeper 
meaning for Montenegro, and the idea behind that operation was 
to discredit Montenegro on a global level. And the operation 
managed to do that. Consequently, for one year, the entire 
planet was abuzz with rumors that the Montenegrins were shelling 
Dubrovnik, destroying it and plundering, and so forth. That is 
true, but, on the other hand, it is also true that several 
statements and interviews that Slobodan Milosevic gave to the 
world press confirm what I have said. Asked what he thought 
about the events in Dubrovnik, he always replied he had nothing 
to do with that, that they should ask the authorities in 
Podgorica. Indeed, the authorities in Podgorica were not 
responsible for the mobilization, but they did nothing to stop 
that campaign. 
  And then, in an interview, I told Mr. Bulatovic he should 
realize that those who aimed their guns and cannons at Dubrovnik 
are madmen and that was insane politics, and that, as the 
president of Montenegro he had to commit himself and choose 
between the glory of Dubrovnik and what it stands for in a 
Slavic world, and the glory of Kadijevic's epaulettes. So, if 
he should decide on Dubrovnik, and that would not be a dilemma 
for any normal man, I told him he should kneel before those 
people who were badly manipulated and try to get them back to 
the borders of Montenegro. However, he opted for the glory of 
Kadijevic's epaulettes, for the role of a pawn; he went to the 
battlefield, they took his picture while Vojislav Seselj 
personally reviewed some troops. The final result of that 
campaign was that the traditional Montenegro, all the stories of 
courage, bravery, morals, and so forth, were lost on that 
Dubrovnik battlefield and they can never be told again. 
  We feel very badly about those horrible events, not only 
because of the suffering of the inhabitants of Dubrovnik and 
Konavli. In Montenegro, we organized a vigorous anti-war 
campaign, which, unfortunately, was not broadcasted. We staged 
several rallies, and the one in Cetinje was the biggest of all 
with 15,000 people. 
  I realized that the Montenegro in my heart was saved the 
moment those 15,000 people started singing "A fairy brings joy 
from Lovcen, Dubrovnik, forgive us." The result of that antiwar 
campaign was that not a single attempt at mobilization in 
Montenegro succeeded, and if it were not for us, the 
consequences would have probably been much worse. Dozens of 
people returned from the battlefield, threw their weapons away, 
and accepted the political messages of the Liberal Union, so 
that, in a way, Dubrovnik became a catharsis of our movement. 
  On the other hand, we must do everything to apologize to the 
Croats and to Croatia, and especially to Dubrovnik and Konavli, 
and that, God willing, one day, the Montenegro I have in mind 
will do its best to help Dubrovnik heal its physical and 
spiritual wounds and that our two nations can start 
communicating again. 

<H5>    Not an Inch More, Not an Inch Less </H5>
  [Ogurlic] What borders do you want for Montenegro as a 
country? 
  [Perovic] The present ones. Our postulate is that the 
present borders of Montenegro are the borders of Montenegro as a 
state, and we consider them a realistic expression of 
Montenegrin political, military, and diplomatic power or 
impotence throughout history. Our motto is: Not an inch of our 
territory more, not an inch less. 
  [Ogurlic] And what about Prevlaka? 
  [Perovic] We know to whom Prevlaka belongs. Today, it 
obviously belongs to the Republic of Croatia, under UNPROFOR 
[United Nations Protection Force] command, and we have always 
said that those two and a half kilometers of rocky land are not 
worth the death of any Montenegrin, let alone those 200 
unfortunate young men who died in vain for someone's 
unreasonable goals. Prevlaka would be worth fighting for if 
this were 1852, but that became complete nonsense when fighter 
airplanes were invented. However, you must understand that 
propaganda in Montenegro was such that Goebbels was a real 
amateur in comparison. The entire historical milieu was 
reconstructed; everything Croatian was pronounced Ustashi, 
people were totally mislead, and it was all added to a very 
incomplete and bad education system in which history lessons 
boiled down to events from 1941 onward, and people had no idea 
about the deeper strata of their history. 
  [Ogurlic] In a way, the Croatian public is interested in the 
destiny of the Croats in Boka Kotorska.... 
  [Perovic] The Croats in Boka Kotorska, especially in Tivat, 
were under enormous pressure, we must say that, and we are 
informed that some of them left in the meantime, which we, in 
the Liberal Union, frown upon. We are trying to do everything 
to protect their human rights in Montenegro. Let me tell you, 
because we supported the Croats, we were accused of wanting to 
see Boka Kotorska belong to a greater Croatia. Due to the fact 
that our members are also Albanians and we protect the 
Albanians, we are accused of wanting a greater Albania. For 
defending the Muslims, we were accused of being a part of "the 
Teheran plot against the heavenly nation," and for being 
Montenegrins, it is obvious we are anti-Serbs, and so forth. 
However, exactly because our party is this open, things are 
turning to our political advantage. We must not be satisfied 
with that, for, today, Montenegro is facing destruction.

<F P=106> [Report by Dragan Djuric: "To the Last German Mark"] </F>
  [Text] The debate on the set of acts by which the program 
of reconstruction of the monetary system has been brought into 
operation was held in a half-empty conference hall of the 
Assembly. Thanks to the deputies of the Democratic Party of 
Socialists [DPS], the hall was filled only during the voting. 
This time, the quorum was ensured in time, and all 11 acts have 
been adopted without any major problems. Even Federal Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic performed his role of a cog in the voting 
machinery honestly, making no efforts to help his republican 
colleague and party comrade [Milo Djukanovic] in the 
argumentation and defense of the program, the main supporter of 
which is actually Kontic himself. It seems as though the 
silence of the DPS during the hot debate on the latest 
anti-inflation program was calculated. The entire activity of 
the ruling party's deputies boiled down to occasional attempts 
to irritate the opposition. This time it is the party's 
professional, Milutin Ojdanic, who was particularly active in 
such attempts, together with the usual Beba Dzakovic and Danilo 
Vuksanovic. 
<H5>  Prime Minister in Clinch </H5>
  [Montenegrin] Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic was not 
particularly convincing. Which is no wonder. It is difficult 
for anybody, except Sveto Marovic, to talk convincingly about 
something that he or she does not believe in. As for the 
long-term effects of Avramovic's program, nobody intelligent -- 
except, perhaps, Professor Mile Markovic -- believes in them. 
While he was retelling the contents of that program, he 
irresistibly reminded us of the good old days when he elaborated 
the party doctrine in communities. The DPS deputies did not 
react to the competent expert and political remarks by the 
opposition to the proposed program. They left Djukanovic to 
fight alone. The prime minister was courageously getting into a 
clinch, but it was also clear to him that he was giving a 
lecture on a very general topic. 
  Basically, the game was quite clear. The authorities were 
making efforts to use the Assembly as a cover, and to water down 
the responsibility for the imminent failure of the program by 
telling stories about a political consensus. Thus the members 
of the opposition were told in advance that it would be resented 
if the program failed to succeed as a result of their 
obstruction. 
  Milos Radulovic clarified the meaning vividly. When 
engineers plan a plane, it will certainly fly, which cannot be 
said for the planning of economic programs. And that is 
precisely because of the limitations that cannot be influenced 
by the government, since they are brought about by people and 
their conduct. Such a mechanism for creating enemies did not 
remain unrecognized. Though everybody competed in exposing this 
mechanism, still, the most convincing were populists and 
liberals. "The ruling party cannot demand our absolute and 
unconditional support for the program, and if that support fails 
to come, to declare us traitors," Dragan Soc said. 
  "The program is yours, you adopted it without asking for our 
opinion, and you are implementing it without our participation." 
The radicals were less eye-catching this time. They did not 
demand any consciousness-raising [osvestavanje] regarding the 
program this time. 
  The populists tried to refrain from any detailed discussion, 
and to toss the hot potato of responsibility into the hands of 
the DPS. Their general attitude is: "Why did you not adopt this 
program earlier? May the ruling party take all the credit for 
the program if it succeeds, but if it fails, it ought to take 
the consequences." Misko Vukovic took upon himself to explain 
the populists' unprincipledness by asking: "How could the party 
whose minister in the Federal Government, that is the actual 
architect of the program, is in charge of one of the most 
important departments -- employment and social care -- how could 
that party possibly dissociate itself from the program? In 
response, Djukanovic made efforts to show the people that the 
People's Party is unprepared to responsibly take part in dealing 
with the burden that the current period is bringing about. 
<H5>  Refreshment of Mind </H5>
  The liberals tried the impossible, to force the DPS into 
assuming responsibility for the implementation of the program: 
"If the program fails, can you, gentlemen from the DPS, bind 
your fate to it, and will you, in that, case announce early 
democratic elections?" "The DPS is ready to assume the 
responsibility, because the program has been elaborated by 
experts, and it has won, if not an absolute, then a dominant 
support of the economic intelligentsia of this country," 
Djukanovic responded. 
  Nevertheless, the Montenegrin prime minister put the key 
responsibility for the implementation of the program on the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia and the Office for Monetary Traffic 
[Sluzba za platni promet] that are supposed to protect the 
program from misuse. Petrovic's polemics referred to the 
elections: "All your projects have failed. If I had been you, 
I would have resigned as early as after the first failure, while 
you, you do not even allow elections after so many failures." 
The leader of the liberals adequately disturbed the atmosphere 
in the Assembly by efforts to refresh the memory of the regime 
representatives, reminding them of their countless "optimistic 
starts." The essence of his performance would be: Montenegro 
is looking more and more like Enver Hoxha's Albania because of 
the projects are based on great deceptions, while the latest 
program regarding the super-dinar is actually a super-swindle, a 
preparation for the introduction of a state of emergency. 
  Djukanovic made sure that each question received a proper 
answer. He connected the liberals with the odious West "that is 
mercilessly starving our children," and thereby "morally 
identified" the liberals' treason, as the, this time, quite 
reticent Marovic would say. However, in polemics, one 
frequently blurts out some quite important things. Djukanovic 
maintained that the lifting of the sanctions does not depend 
solely on Yugoslavia, and even explained that the government 
elaborated the program because it can no longer wait for the 
international community to recognize its mistake and lift the 
sanctions!? The Montenegrin prime minister also explained that 
the program actually means a return to the elementary economic 
alphabet, which will do away with the sweet illusion of the 
primary issue of money. Still, while saying that, he forgot his 
own statement that it is precisely the government that 
(independently from the elementary economic alphabet) 
consciously and deliberately went for that sweet illusion, and 
functioned with it quite well for a long time. 
  The social-democrats were particularly straightforward in 
their critique of the program. Zarko Rakcevic pointed out that 
everybody is aware of the necessity of endorsing such a program, 
since the further rise of the inflationary spiral will lead 
directly into an abyss. The cut was inevitable, but the 
question is still open: Whether it was a real cut, and whether 
it was made in the right place. The real causes of the existing 
situation are in the sphere of politics, and they cannot be 
eliminated by an economic program. Therefore the ruling party is 
wrong when it claims that the program has no alternative. It 
has, but for that alternative one has to change the trend in 
politics. The planned expansion of the monetary union to both 
Krajinas [in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina] means, actually, 
financing the war in a different way. "Such a manifestation of 
imperialistic policy will not find any support abroad," Rakcevic 
said. The crucial problem that exists in the program is the 
deficit of the public spending. The possibilities for that 
deficit to be really covered are quite unclear and doubtful. 
The fear that the pressure might be so great that in two months 
the printing of fake money would start again is quite justified 
as it happens, some extraordinary measures can be expected. 
"Let us not allow the last remaining reserves of the citizens 
to be exhausted in a fruitless battle," Dragisa Burzan warned. 
<H5>  Disobedient Dealers </H5>
  All in all, the opposition acted as an opposition, while the 
authorities acted as authorities. For the Montenegrin political 
circumstances even that is a considerable step forward. The 
program has been adopted without the accord of the opposition, 
who made great efforts, particularly the liberals and the 
social-democrats, to state their own views of how to get out 
from the civilizational blind alley. The way out is in a change 
of the overall political atmosphere. "It is necessary that 
Montenegro finally and resolutely dissociates itself from the 
policy of violently tailoring and destroying our former 
fatherland, and that the authorities finally stop disintegrating 
the state-making and national being of its people, and 
disturbing the cultural, religious, and national balance that 
has always existed in this part of the world," Dragan Ivancevic 
said. 
  Regardless of certain interpretations of the program that 
allege it is to buy time for the government, the set of 11 
taxation laws, by which the implementation of the program 
(regarding public revenues, employment, contributions to 
welfare, the tax on profit, the tax on property, the tax on 
citizens' incomes, the turnover tax, the tax on private firms) 
has been brought into operation, was adopted in a very short 
time. 
  That same evening, with the Assembly debate still going on, 
the street dealers in Podgorica were already exchanging 10 
German marks for 11 super-dinars.

  [Text] [Presenter] The Hungarians in Vojvodina were very 
pleased to hear about the discussion of Serbian President 
Milosevic with the chairman of the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK]. This was stated in the letter sent 
by Andras Agoston [VMDK chairman] to the Serbian president. 
(Szilveszter Varga) reports. 
  [Varga] The VMDK chairman informed Milosevic that the 
presidium of the Vojvodina Hungarian organization felt that the 
fact that Agoston was allowed to attend the meeting [on 27 
January] between the Hungarian foreign minister [Geza 
Jeszenszky] and the Serbian president was a gesture. In the 
view of the presidium, this could mark the start of a settlement 
of the unresolved problems of the Vojvodina Hungarians, whose 
basis could be the VMDK's autonomy proposal in both a legal and 
political sphere. 
  The VMDK presidium points out: The VMDK's plans guarantee 
the 
possibility for the Hungarians to survive as a true ethnic group 
[nepcsoport] in Vojvodina.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by correspondent </F>
Judit Jarai; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Jarai] Do you think that full 
membership of the European Union can be attained in five or six 
years? 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] As a matter of fact, it can. It 
can be attained if the Hungarian economy is no longer hit by 
crises such as the collapse of the Soviet market or the Yugoslav 
war. [passage omitted] Or a crisis like the West European 
recession. 
  [[Jarai] According to the prime minister, will this 
association membership cover security issues as well, apart from 
cooperation and political dialogue? 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] I have to mention here the 
Partnership for Peace, which provides an opportunity to get 
closer to NATO. [passage omitted] It is a rule for a country 
of Hungary's size to seek entry to security organizations, 
European and NATO, as soon as possible, because in this way we 
will be given definite security guarantees. I think it takes 
some time. 
  [Jarai] I think it is evident that the security of Eastern 
Europe depends on the settling of minority issues. [passage 
omitted] Can the Balladur plan help our region to sort out these 
conflicts through negotiations and peaceful means? 
  [Boross] Every plan that has the backing of sufficiently 
strong political forces and which aims to consolidate these 
conditions can help. [passage omitted] I would like to add that 
sometimes the minority issue becomes synonymous with fighting 
and the danger of war and so on. This is not true. In 
Yugoslavia, the war is going on between nations. I consider it 
inconceivable for neighboring countries with a Hungarian 
minority, however aggressive they become, to reach a stage where 
they would want a conflict. [passage omitted] 
  We are fully aware of our own intentions, [that is] to 
settle 
or at least improve these issues by political means: Applying 
peaceful means, seeking understanding, but at the same time 
strongly representing ethnic Hungarians living beyond the border. 
  [Jarai] In your view, what mechanisms can this plan 
[Balladur's plan] contain? 
  [Boross] What the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the border 
require -- and I say this in a very simplified way -- is to live 
as Hungarians. [passage omitted] Their demands have to be 
addressed first. In addition to this, atrocities, unnecessary 
provocation must not befall them. I think, for example, of the 
bill on population proportions [in Slovakia], which enables 
manipulation through a change of administrative borders 
[reference to Slovak aspirations to redraw administrative 
districts, a move which would result in districts with small 
Hungarian populations]. It is a crude method and the cloven 
hoof is showing. There are those who want to evade 
responsibilities in this way. 
  I think that the very simple needs have to be submitted. It 
has to be said again that the country, and the Hungarians 
[magyarsag] as such, do not strive immediately to swoop down on 
the borders -- that were guaranteed by peace treaties -- and to 
overturn them. This is the phobia that haunts many in our 
neighborhood. [passage omitted] 
  It is our responsibility to represent the interests of 
Hungarians beyond the border. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Bucharest, Feb 2 (AFP) -- A referendum of voters 
in the former Soviet republic of Moldova on whether they want 
the country to merge with Romania has no more value than an 
opinion poll, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday [2 
February]. 
  The Moldovan Supreme Soviet at the weekend approved a 
referendum question asking Moldovans if they wanted their 
country to be "an independent, integral state or to unite or 
reunite with another country," meaning Romania. 
  But Foreign Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana said here that 
for the referendum to be valid, all Romanians should be 
consulted. [passage omitted] 
  At the other end of the spectrum, Russian nationalists in 
the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic in eastern Moldova, who have 
been fighting to take their territory into Russia, have called 
for a boycott of the referendum.

that he is not willing to hold talks on the Hungarian minority's 
collective rights, because the rights of the Hungarian minority 
in Slovakia, as he said, are already excessive. 
  At a Bratislava rally of his party, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia, Meciar said, we quote: There is complete 
freedom in Slovakia, therefore, those who want to leave can do 
so at any time. He added that the Slovak Government will not 
pursue a policy to suit certain circles of the Hungarian 
Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, Polish deputy defense </F>
minister and chief of the National Security Bureau, by Andrzej 
Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of 
Radio Zet" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Good morning to you. 
  [Milewski] Good morning. 
  [Woyciechowski] Poland is a partner of NATO as of yesterday. 
Half of the Polish people do not understand what that means. 
  [Milewski] Poland has declared its willingness to 
participate in a program which was proposed at the NATO summit 
on 10 January and which is called Partnership for Peace. The 
program was offered to all postcommunist countries, as well to 
those of the former Soviet bloc. It is an individually oriented 
program, the contents of which contents will be negotiated and 
determined with each country separately. 
  [Woyciechowski] You say, "will be negotiated." That means 
Poland has not negotiated the program yet, in terms of details. 
  [Milewski] Not yet, since all Prime Minister Pawlak did in 
Brussels yesterday was to officially declare Poland's intention 
to join the program. 
  [Woyciechowski] Who will negotiate the details -- the 
Defense Ministry [MON], the Sejm, or the National Security 
Bureau? Which of these institutions will determine the details? 
  [Milewski] It will be the government, that is beyond any 
doubt. The most important ministries in the government that 
will be dealing with it will be MON and the Foreign Ministry. 
  [Woyciechowski] Poland is NATO's third partner -- prior to 
us, the treaty was signed by Romania and Lithuania, with Estonia 
signing tomorrow. Did we all sign the same thing [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Milewski] It is exactly the same thing. It is simply an 
official intention of a given country to participate in the 
Partnership. All the texts are exactly the same and the 
agreements that will be signed between specific countries and 
NATO -- these will be individually oriented. 
  [Woyciechowski] The document we signed -- is that a very 
detailed text comprising 100 pages, or perhaps is it half-a-page 
long? 
  [Milewski] It is just one page. 
  [Woyciechowski] So it is a very general kind of document. 
  [Milewski] Yes, it is a completely general kind of document 
which only expresses intentions which are in accordance with 
so-called Western standards regarding democracy in a given 
country, transparency of military budgets.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is the Polish military budget 
transparent? 
  [Milewski] In my view, it is too transparent.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Too transparent, meaning? 
  [Milewski] Meaning that there are simply no longer 
any....[pauses] A military budget should be a matter of 
confidence or secrecy regarding some items, because it is after 
all the issue of a country's entire defense system. As far as 
Poland is concerned, both our defense industry, the budget, and 
various military issues are too public nowadays -- no legal 
provisions concerning state secrets are being observed. 
  [Woyciechowski] So the devil is in the details, in how 
specific the treaty will be, I mean the treaty between Poland 
and NATO. It depends on the size of those military units which 
we intend to devote to cooperation with NATO. Do we know 
precisely how big they will be? 
  [Milewski] No, we do not. We are deliberating right now 
what kind of units should be proposed to NATO within our version 
of the Partnership for Peace program. It is definitely known 
that it is the West's intention for Poland to have a greater 
contribution to UN peace efforts.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Greater than Estonia and 
Lithuania. 
  Mr. Minister, what is a platoon? How many soldiers are there 
in a platoon? 
  [Milewski] There are about 30 men in a platoon, if you mean 
a classic platoon of infantry or mechanized units. 
  [Woyciechowski] You have heard -- just like everyone else -- 
a statement by a Polish officer who said on television a few 
days ago that Poland will designate an entire platoon for 
cooperation with NATO. 
  [Milewski] No, that is a misunderstanding. As far as the 
long term is concerned, Poland intends to be an equal member of 
NATO with full rights -- just as we want to be an equal member 
of the European Union, a member with full rights; our goal is 
full integration of our country with Western organizations, so 
as far as the long term is concerned, the entire operational 
Armed Forces of the Polish Republic will be placed at NATO's 
disposal in case of a conflict.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] So this will not be a 
platoon but many divisions, many armies. What do you mean by 
the entire operational forces? 
  [Milewski] The entire Polish operational forces currently 
comprise 11 divisions plus four independent brigades. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is that a great deal compared with our 
neighbors like Lithuania, Estonia, or Romania? Do we have more 
than them? 
  [Milewski] We have much more than Lithuania or Estonia -- 
what we have is within the limits which were granted to us by 
the Vienna treaties; that is to say, about 250,000 soldiers and 
officers. 
  [Woyciechowski] When you say long term -- what specific year 
do you mean? When will it happen? 
  [Milewski] It will happen when the member [as heard] will be 
a regular member of NATO -- I think it will happen in the next 
few years, before the year 2000; even Western politicians have 
been saying that recently. It seems that a period of three to 
four years should be sufficient to prepare Poland for membership 
in NATO, which would be with full rights and equal membership. 
Which does not mean that we are not looking for a political 
protection shield against increasing dangers from the East much 
earlier than that date. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us return for a moment to 
those divisions which we will be able to earmark for cooperation 
with NATO some day -- this could happen perhaps within three to 
four years, as you said. What must we do to those divisions and 
soldiers? Do we have to change their uniforms, machine guns, 
boots, and everything else, or will these preparations be easier 
than that? 
  [Milewski] No. All that has to be changed is the command 
system with regard to the aforementioned divisions and brigades, 
and also the way of communication among them and with the higher 
command -- that must also be changed. 
  [Woyciechowski] What does that mean? 
  [Milewski] Communications systems and fire-steering systems 
must be made uniform, simply.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it mean that military 
commands will be given in English as of now? Fire! -- will that 
be in English? 
  [Milewski] Not in the case of commands at the level of a 
platoon, about which you asked, but commands given at the level 
of a division will of course have to be in English. 
  [Woyciechowski] That means that Polish generals will be 
communicating with their British or American colleagues in 
English? 
  [Milewski] Not just Polish generals, but all Polish officers 
should speak English, just as is the case with armies of 
Western, non-English-speaking countries. 
  [Woyciechowski] Newspapers publish a poll today conducted by 
the Public Opinion Research Center in which Poles are asked the 
question: In case of a danger to its independence, can Poland 
rely on Western aid? Fifty-one percent of Poles say absolutely 
no, 32 percent say yes, and 17 percent -- don't know. Could you 
answer the question for those 17 percent of Polish people who do 
not know? So the question is: Can Poland rely on Western aid 
or not? 
  [Milewski] Poland can rely on Western aid on the condition 
that Poland can first demonstrate it is capable of making its 
own defense effort -- then Poland can rely on being provided 
additional foreign aid. But if Poland does not show any effort 
on its own and if it was to wait passively for someone to give 
Poland a protective umbrella as a gift, then in that case, it 
will not receive the umbrella. 
  [Woyciechowski] So to translate into plain language what you 
have said here: Poland should defend itself for some days or 
some weeks, and only then.... [pauses] Is my understanding 
correct, or did I overdo it? 
  [Milewski] You missed the point. Once the conflict is in 
progress, then it is too late since such conflicts erupt very 
suddenly nowadays. In practical terms, the issue is that in a 
situation where Poland has already joined the Partnership for 
Peace program, Poland should show its high activity as part of 
the program; it should demonstrate a real effort toward 
integration with NATO forces. In that case, we will have a 
response from the other side. But if all we do is passively 
wait and just keep asking for shipments of new tanks, new 
aircraft, and also keep asking for protection, and if we fail to 
demonstrate the effort I mentioned -- in that case we may not 
receive aid. After all, there is a simple rule in effect in the 
West: Help yourself first, and only then will I also [words 
indistinct] aid to you. 
  [Woyciechowski] Now, the efforts that you have talked 
about -- do they reflect the political will of the Polish 
Government and the will of other Polish authorities? Or is this 
simply money? 
  [Milewski] First, this is a political will.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Is this will present today? 
  [Milewski] Well, yes, it is declared by all three branches 
of authority in Poland: by the legislative, executive, and.... 
[pauses] Well, the judicial authorities are actually not making 
any statements.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But there is the problem of 
money. 
  [Milewski] No, an organizational effort must also be made by 
the entire defense system in Poland, in which, of course, the 
Army is the most important element. 
  [Woyciechowski] Today the arms industry has announced a 
four-hour strike. Some factories will be on strike all day. In 
one of today's dailies, SZTANDAR [MLODYCH], I have found 
information that one of the things that the unionists are 
protesting is the fact that the government has recently blocked 
two major contracts for the sale of tanks; they claim that these 
two contracts for the sale of Polish tanks abroad would have 
saved the arms industry in Poland. Is this true? 
  [Milewski] I do not know anything about the government's 
blocking any contracts of our arms industry. However, I do know 
that it is very difficult to sell our military equipment abroad 
because it really is of poorer quality than products available 
in the West. The advantage that we have is that our products 
are much cheaper. However, our closest neighbors are somehow 
more skilled in trade -- they are in the same conditions as we 
are.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are probably referring to 
the Czech Republic, are you not? 
  [Milewski] I am referring to the Czech Republic, Hungary. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it today not so that some countries would 
be willing to buy Polish tanks and Polish cannons; some 
countries would like to purchase them because they are not sold 
by anyone else -- for political reasons -- and we do not want to 
sell anything like that to those countries because they are 
under UN sanctions? 
  [Milewski] If a country is under UN sanctions, then we 
certainly must respect that. 
  [Woyciechowski] And we cannot violate them, even for 
economic reasons? 
  [Milewski] No, we cannot violate them because in such a case 
the political as well as material losses that our country would 
incur would be much greater than any profit derived from such a 
contract. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, let us change the subject for 
a while. Do you think that the prime minister has the right to 
recall a deputy minister without the consent of the relevant 
minister? 
  [Milewski] This question should actually be addressed to the 
prime minister. The prime minister appoints both deputy 
ministers and general directors in all ministries; that is to 
say, if we go by the rule that the mode of appointing those 
officials is the same as the mode of recalling them, then we 
must say that the prime minister undoubtedly is entitled to 
recall them. However, the relevant minister should be involved 
in this process because it is, in fact, he who selects his 
cooperators. Nevertheless, in exceptional situations, as we 
know, also such situations are possible -- not only in Poland, 
but also in the West. 
  [Woyciechowski] Some people believe that in recent days, or 
in recent weeks, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], one of the 
coalition partners, wants your scalp -- it wants the scalp of 
Milewski. It wants you recalled from the post of MON deputy 
minister. 
  [Milewski] Well, no one has told me about that; no one told 
me that someone is after my scalp. However, I can sometimes 
hear the criticism -- which is completely unfounded -- that I 
allegedly fulfill various functions in various segments of 
authority, which is said to violate the principle of the 
division of powers. I would like to say now that this is false, 
because the principle of division of powers means that different 
people are related to the legislative branch, different people 
to the executive branch, and different people to the judicial 
branch. These powers should not be combined; for example, 
deputies, who are members of the legislative branch, should not 
be appointed ministers and deputy ministers. Now, the 
president's and the prime minister's segments are two segments 
of the executive branch which should be integrated with each 
other. Therefore, shortening the distance between the Belvedere 
establishments and the establishments of the Office of the 
Council of Ministers is not only possible, but should be 
recommended. 
  [Woyciechowski] Like a good soldier, you are defending 
yourself through attack. I have discerned this allusion to the 
coalition's desire to introduce a minister of SLD to MON. You 
implied that a deputy should not simultaneously be a deputy 
minister. What does the situation in MON really look like: Is 
it going to have a minister proposed by SLD and the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL], or not? 
  [Milewski] If there are experts who will be able to fulfill 
various functions -- functions of deputy ministers, general 
directors, department heads -- then I can see no reason why they 
should not fulfill them; in MON, and certainly in MON under 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk, people are selected for reasons other than 
political-- the main criterion is that of expertise. However, 
if the only purpose of the operation of introducing new deputy 
ministers is the limitation of constitutional powers of the 
minister in his ministry, then this just cannot be accepted. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it possible, then, that within a month 
new deputy ministers -- proposed by SLD or PSL -- will come to 
MON? 
  [Milewski] I find it difficult to make any statement on 
behalf of the minister, who is on leave; however, as far as I 
know about the plans that he approved and submitted to us when 
he was taking over the office of MON head, I can tell you that 
he will not make any selection based on criteria other than 
substantive, and that he will not agree that any other -- 
political or ideological -- criteria be taken into account. The 
minister accepts exclusively the criterion of expertise. 
  [Woyciechowski] This means that new deputy ministers will 
come if they are nonpolitical experts. Can we say that? 
  [Milewski] This is what I think I can say on behalf of my 
superior. However, he has not authorized me to.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The minister is on holiday in 
the mountains. Do you not like winter in the mountains? Will 
you be in Warsaw, or will you leave? 
  [Milewski] I like winter in the mountains very much. I was 
a mountaineer. However, I no longer spend my holiday in the 
mountains -- not only because I have no time for that, but also 
because I am already past the age when one can climb mountains. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you ski? 
  [Milewski] No, I do not. I have never skied; I have always 
devoted my free time to mountaineering. 
  [Woyciechowski] Now, let us change the subject once again: 
Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy. What do you 
think of him? 
  [Milewski] I think that Zhirinovskiy himself is a dangerous 
character, maybe as dangerous as Hitler. However, the emergence 
of Zhirinovskiy is the result of a certain climate which has 
dominated Russia. This climate is dangerous. In a situation of 
great poverty in everyday life, many people in that country are 
still being fed by the vision of imperialism, a vision of being 
the most important country in the world; it is an abstract 
vision that is contrary to the well-understood interests of the 
Russian people and other peoples of the Russian Federation. 
Now, the emergence of Zhirinovskiy has made it obvious to us 
that such a social trend is dominating in that country. It is a 
very dangerous trend. Thus, I would say that Zhirinovskiy is 
actually doing us a favor -- by revealing this trend, the 
existence of which many Western politicians did not want to 
believe. Well, we know perfectly well that it is there. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Milewski] Good-bye.

  [Excerpts] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 2 (AFP) -- From 
their lookout high above this besieged Moslem enclave, the 12 
Swedish peacekeepers of the Tango 2 observation post scan the 
horizon for Serb guns, able only to count the shots, even when 
they are the targets. 
  From their post, located 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the 
airport of this major northern Bosnian town -- which the United 
Nations plans to reopen, by force if necessary -- the Swedes 
were able to determine the exact position of Serb artillery 
which shelled the airport and the nearby NORDBAT 2 Scandinavian 
battalion base Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Seated high in his sandbag bunker, in front of an enormous 
pair of binoculars, Private Fredrik Thorgren, 26, explained 
Wednesday what the peacekeepers witnessed. 
  "Yesterday, we saw shooting behind this hill, near Borogovo. 
We didn't see the detonations," he said. "There were 
speculations that it was near the base. One hour later we heard 
on the radio that it landed on the airport and 100 metres 
(yards) from the camp." 
  Serb artillery controls access to the Tuzla airport from 
three different positions, with several hundred artillery pieces 
at its disposal. 
  Tuesday afternoon, nine shells fell on the airport zone, 
including one within one kilometre of the main runway. There 
were no casualties. 
  "The nearest Serb position from the airport is 10 kilometres 
(six miles), so they could shoot with guns, mortars or tanks," 
said Tango 2 platoon leader Lieutenant Jan Almgard, 28. [passage 
omitted] 
  "A grenade landed on the roof. The Serbs are aiming at us, 
it's obvious. We have a blue flag with a light on it, it can't 
be a mistake," Almgard said, pointing out the blown-away tiles 
on their UN-leased villa. "The soldier on duty at the 
binoculars had time only to jump down. It's a miracle we had no 
casualties." [passage omitted] 
  "The problem is that the Serbs here think that we fight with 
the Bosnian Army and that we're part of their defence system," 
explained Almgard. "We tried to establish a radio link with them 
but they refuse to use it." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Drunken Croatian soldiers 
disarmed four Canadian UN troops and held them for an 
hour-and-a-half in a southern Croatian enclave until UN 
officials negotiated their release, a UN spokesman said Thursday. 
  The Canadian peacekeepers were on a patrol with two UN 
military observers -- whose nationality was not specified -- in 
the Medak region, which is under the protection of the UN 
Protection Force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), when the 
incident took place Tuesday. 
  The Croatian soldiers confronted the six men and fired shots 
into the air to force them to surrender their weapons. They 
were then taken to a Croatian Army post and released only after 
negotiations between local Croatian military officials and the 
local UNPROFOR commanders, the UN source said. 
  A similar incident occured in the Medak pocket on January 5 
when four Canadian UN troops were disarmed and detained for 
several hours by Croatian soldiers. 
  General Jean Cot, the French general who at the time was 
commander of UNPROFOR, protested to Zagreb authorities, calling 
the incident "outrageous." 
  Canada has a battalion of some 600 men in the region. They 
were deployed in Medak in September after the Croatian Army 
launched an offensive there, seizing three Serb vilages and, 
according to UNPROFOR reports, massacring several residents.

  [Text] Belgrade, 2 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, today 
warned that Russia will not allow any provocations of and 
threats against Serbia, that it will demand the lifting of 
sanctions, and that unless this happens it will raise the issue 
of Russia's UN membership. 
  Zhirinovskiy said this in talks with Vojislav Seselj, the 
leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who was his host today at 
the Federal Assembly. He said that an organization which allows 
children to die for want of medicines can no longer be called 
the United Nations Organization. This, according to 
Zhirinovskiy, is an instrument in the hands of a state that has 
become an evil empire. 
  I am telling the West from Belgrade today that war games in 
the Balkans are over and that a new historic epoch is beginning, 
said the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, which won the 
highest number of votes in the recent Russian parliamentary 
elections. 
  Zhirinovskiy reiterated that he sides fully with the Serb 
people and that he regards Western threats against Serbia as 
threats against Russia. If the Serb people seek help we shall 
offer moral, material, and, if need be, also military support, 
he declared, warning that the Russian Army is still one of the 
strongest in the world. He informed his host that a meeting of 
support and solidarity with the Serb people will be held in 
Moscow on 5 February, and that Serb officers, party officials, 
and representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church will be 
invited to come on 20 February, Russian Army Day. 
  The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party mentioned 
a proposal for the unification of Slav nations in an eastern 
European community. I am putting forward a proposal for the 
setting up of a Slav parliament in Belgrade or another Slav city 
which would be a counterpart to the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg, Zhirinovskiy said. He added that in relation to 
Western Europe, stretching from the English Channel to Vienna, 
the eastern European community would stretch from Knin to 
Vladivostok. 
  Zhirinovskiy announced that a congress of Slav nations will 
be held in Moscow on 2 April. With 1993 the withdrawal of Slavs 
and the passive attitude of the Orthodox Church ended. In 1994 
a new historical era of the renaissance of Slav nations begins, 
he added. The Slavs are, he said, one nation, and if the German 
nation united, if the Germans, British, and French are uniting, 
why should not the Slavs do the same? 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party supports democratic 
principles which should be respected equally by everyone. We do 
not support violence and we are not threatening anyone, we are 
just warning, he added. The Warsaw Pact has been dissolved and 
we also want NATO to be dissolved, Zhirinovskiy said, adding 
that the world is tired of hegemony. 
  The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
proposes, as he put it, the regionalization of the world, 
dividing it into north and south America, eastern and western 
Europe, the Far East and Japan. In a world divided like this 
political power would be balanced and that would prevent a major 
new war. 
  Zhirinovskiy and Seselj said they are satisfied with the 
similarity of their parties' standpoints. Seselj stressed that 
the Serb nation is engaged in a great struggle to liberate its 
western territories. The Serbs differ on many internal policy 
issues but they are united as far as the defense of national 
interests is concerned, Seselj pointed out. 
  He said that Croats and Muslims are tools controlled by the 
West, which wants to break the backbone of the Serb nation. We 
were alone until you appeared, he declared to Zhirinovskiy. 
However, we have never stopped believing that the great Russian 
nation will stand up on its own feet and say no to the West. We 
are one people, our origins are the same, our languages are 
similar, and we can survive in the new world only by leaning on 
each other, Seselj said. He expressed his wish that, as soon as 
possible, the Liberal Democratic Party becomes the ruling party 
and Zhirinovskiy the president of Russia.

<F P=106> ["President Berisha About His Visits to Malaysia and Brunei </F>
-- Interview of Mr. Berisha Over Radio-Television" -- ATA 
headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, February 1 (ATA) -- On January 31, the 
president of the Republic of Albania, Sali Berisha, had an 
interview with the Albanian Radio and Television about his 
visits to Malaysia and Brunei. He said that "the aim of his 
visit was further consolidation of cooperation and friendship of 
Albania with Malaysia and Brunei. Albania and Malaysia, 
although geographically far from each other, have similarities 
that unite them spiritually. Both countries have a religious 
pluralism. The different religions in Malaysia and Albania have 
in full harmony among them. The two countries have had a 
difficult past and backwardness. Malaysia has successfully 
overcome this period and is one of the countries which is 
considered a miracle for Southeast Asia with regard to 
development." Mr. Berisha said that "the secret of development 
of Malaysia is not in its great resources, but in the wisdom of 
the people of Malaysia, their untiring work, their discipline 
and determination to develop a market economy." Mr. Berisha 
added that they had signed several agreements, that on economic, 
cultural and technical cooperation with Malaysia, an agreement 
to lift double taxation, another for payments and the guarantee 
of investments. "I think that the agreements signed between 
Albania and Malaysia create a sound basis for a powerful 
cooperation between the two countries. Malaysia voiced its 
readiness to help Albania in the field of construction, 
telecommunications and infrastructure. 
  Malaysia has a great interest in the business with Albania 
with the aim of making investments in this country. About 50 
Albanian students are studying in Malaysia and some of them were 
going on very well with their studies in the university," Mr. 
Berisha continued. 
  Regarding the visit to Brunei, Mr. Berisha said that "it was 
a short working visit, during which we discussed development of 
relations between our two countries. I may say that His 
Majesty, the sultan, and the ministers whom we met, showed great 
interest in various projects, especially in communication and 
infrastructure. We presented there a number of projects which 
will be studied by the Investments Agency in Brunei and later, a 
decision will be adopted on respective investments. Albania and 
Brunei are two small countries but with great possibilities of 
cooperation."

  [Text] Sofia, January 31 (BTA) -- For nearly an hour and a 
half, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and his 
Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati who this afternoon 
arrived on a three-day formal visit here, conferred on 
bilateral, regional and international issues. "Bulgaria and 
Iran have traditionally friendly relations," 'Ali Akbar Velayati 
told the press after the meeting. The ministers agreed to 
continue to promote bilateral relations in trade, economy and 
culture. "We firmly believe Bulgaria and Iran can further 
strengthen relations," the Iranian minister also said. 
  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov said the sides paid 
special attention to economic relations, as lately bilateral 
trade and especially Bulgarian exports have seen a significant 
decline. Bulgaria reaffirmed interest in the construction of a 
transport corridor linking Burgas (on the Southern Bulgarian 
Black Sea coast), Poti (Georgia) and Iran. "We agreed on more 
intensive contacts between the economic ministries," said 
Daskalov. The Iranian delegation includes the first deputy 
minister of trade who will tomorrow hold meetings at the 
ministries of trade, finance, transport and at the Bulgarian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. During Velayti's visit the 
sides are expected to sign a Bulgarian-Iranian trade and 
economic Accord. On Wednesday morning Daskalov and Velayati 
will sign a protocol on cooperation between the two foreign 
ministries. 
  Daskalov denied a report in a Tehran newspaper that Velayti 
would raise the issue of announcements that Bulgaria violated 
the Yugoembargo. "We briefed the Iranian side on the Bulgarian 
stance on the Yugoconflict, which is well-known, on Bulgaria's 
relations with its neighbours and on Black Sea economic 
cooperation. The Iranian side reiterated their stand on the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on relations within their region," 
said the Bulgarian foreign minister. The sides also discussed 
the killing in Sofia last December of four Iranians, two of whom 
illicit drugs dealars, who confronted the police. Two Bulgarian 
police were also killed. "We raised this issue and the two 
sides reaffirmed their interest in clarifying the case. I 
think, the investigation will make things clear," said Daskalov. 
  In response to a question, Velayati reaffirmed the Islamic 
nations' stance in favour of a deployment in Yugoslavia of 
peacemaking troops under UN auspices. "This is our stance taken 
at the meeting in Pakistan, and we've been closely adhering to 
it," said the Iranian foreign minister. 
  'Ali Akbar Velayati tomorrow will be received by President 
Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.

<F P=106> [Article by Iva Toncheva: "Chief Iranian Diplomat Focuses on </F>
Economic Cooperation in Sofia Talks"] 
  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 1 (BTA) -- Economic cooperation 
tops the agenda of Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, 
who arrived here yesterday on a three-day formal visit. 
[passage omitted] 
  At his meetings today, the Iranian foreign minister was 
assured of Bulgaria's willingness to widen its economic 
relations with Iran. Iran used to be Bulgaria's principal 
trading partner in the Third World. Bulgaria hopes to regain 
these positions. "We expect Bulgaria to reestablish its 
traditional position in the Iranian market with a number of 
goods: Cigarettes, cheese, meat, chemical fertilizers, machine 
tools and materials handling equipment," the Bulgarian 
president's foreign policy adviser told journalists after the 
meeting. A bilateral trade agreement is expected to be signed 
tomorrow. A banking agreement and an agreement on payments are 
also being prepared. The Bulgarian-Iranian Commission on 
Economic Cooperation will meet in April. [passage omitted] 
  The problem of the Bulgarian debt to Iran was raised at the 
meeting with Prof. Berov. This country has already repaid $6 
million of the $20 million owed. The remaining $14 million will 
be gradually repaid in the future. Prof. Berov expressed the 
hope Bulgaria would become a regular consumer of Iranian gas. 
Dr. Velayati said there was no problem bartering goods other 
than petroleum products. So far, however, Iran has preferred to 
trade petroleum for hard currency rather than on a clearing 
basis. Dr. Velayati sees prospects in promoting transport 
cooperation not only on roads across Turkey, but also across the 
Caucasus. According to a government Press Office source, the 
Bulgarian prime minister is also warming to the idea of a 
trans-Caucasian route. Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati suggested the 
promotion of free trade areas. According to him, Bulgaria and 
Iran should pursue their relations not only on a bilateral, but 
also on a multilateral basis. One possible area for this are 
the Central Asian Republics. The prospects for cooperation 
between the private sectors were also a discussed at the Berov- 
Velayati talks. 
  In the words of the president's adviser, issues concerning 
the Islamic Conference Organization and Bulgarian Muslims were 
high on the agenda. "The Islamic Conference countries must 
reconsider the issue, acknowledging the recognition and respect 
for their (the Bulgarian Muslims') rights," the president's 
adviser said, adding that ample evidence could be produced to 
corroborate this fact. 
  Conferring with Dr. Velayati, National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov pointed out that the moment is ripe for the 
Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of Bulgarian 
Muslims off its agenda. According to Mr. Yordanov, the Iranian 
foreign minister has agreed to that. Bulgaria has set forth the 
same position before representatives of other Islamic countries, 
such as Egypt and Kuwait. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry and 
Parliament will shortly submit all necessary laws and the 
Constitution to prove, as the head of parliament put it, that 
the rights of Bulgarian Muslims are genuinely protected by 
Bulgarian legislation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, February 2 (BTA) -- The three-day official 
visit to Bulgaria by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati ended this morning with the signing of a protocol on 
cooperation and consultations between the Foreign Ministries of 
Bulgaria and Iran and of a trade agreement. Having signed the 
protocol, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and Dr. 
Velayati expressed their satisfaction with the talks held in 
Bulgaria which the head of Iranian diplomacy described as 
constructive. "There are good signs about the future 
development of Bulgarian-Iranian relations. They appear to have 
entered upon a new stage," said Dr. Velayati. Yesterday he was 
received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. 
  Under the agreement on trade and economic cooperation 
between 
the Governments of Bulgaria and Iran signed by Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev and Iranian 
Deputy Minister of Trade Hoseyn Noqrehkar Shirazi, the two 
countries grant each other most favoured nation status. It is 
agreed to settle payments in convertible currency, to use some 
other forms established in trading and to set up a special joint 
commission on the problems of trade. The two foreign ministers 
said that the next session of the Joint Commission on Economic 
Cooperation which is due early in April in Sofia would be a 
major step forward in the development of relations between the 
two countries. 
  "We hope the trade agreement will give an impetus to the 
promotion of Bulgarian-Iranian economic relations which have 
been on the decline over the last few years," Bulgarian Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters after Dr. Velayati's 
visit ended. In addition to the issues concerning bilateral 
relations, Mr. Daskalov and Dr. Velayati discussed international 
problems, the situation in the Balkans and the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It was a most useful exchange of opinions," 
Bulgaria's chief diplomat said. Answering a question if Dr. 
Velayati had assumed a commitment to support Bulgaria's request 
to the Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of 
Bulgarian Muslims off its agenda, Mr. Daskalov said that the 
Iranian foreign minister was willing to do so. "Of course, this 
does not depend on Iran only but on all other members of the 
Islamic Conference Organization, however, Dr. Velayati hopes 
this would be possible," Mr. Daskalov said. 
  According to the Bulgarian foreign minister, the incident, 
in 
which four Iranian citizens were shot dead last December while 
resisting arrest and two Bulgarian policemen were killed, was 
mentioned cursorily. "Both sides expressed their hope that the 
case will soon be clarified. The investigation has not been 
completed yet," Mr. Daskalov said. 
  Invited to comment on a Tehran press publication alleging 
that Bulgaria has busted the embargo against ex-Yugoslavia and 
asked if it had been discussed with Dr. Velayati, Mr. Stanislav 
Daskalov stressed Bulgaria observes the embargo. "Indeed, there 
are attempted violations, which is understandable for a country 
neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. But the issue was not 
discussed," the head of Bulgarian diplomacy said. 
  Commenting on Iran's suggestion to build a transport route 
across Caucasus, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov said that it had already 
been discussed and that the two countries were ready to continue 
the talks. "Building the route, however, would largely depend 
on the situation in Georgia and Azerbaijan. The prerequisites 
for such a route are good transport conditions and peace," Mr. 
Daskalov said.

<F P=106> [Report by Ani Parmaksizyan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 1 (BTA) -- "The political 
forces opposing the no confidence vote will have to take on the 
responsibility of Lyuben Berov's cabinet for the war raging 
among gangsters and the government's incompetence to enforce law 
and order and protect guarantee [as received] people's safety," 
Mr. Asen Agov, deputy chairman of the National Coordinating 
Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) told a news 
conference held after the councils' regular meeting today. 
[passage omitted] 
  The SDS National Coordinating Council and the parliamentary 
SDS will discuss whether the SDS MP's should boycott parliament 
if the no confidence motion is voted down or whether they should 
do it if parliament passes the 1994 draft budget, Mr. Agov said. 
The BSP's [Bulgarian Socialist Party] non-participation in the 
no confidence vote would be tantamount to evading 
responsibility, he went on to say. DEMOKRATSIYA, the SDS daily, 
wrote today that the BSP parliamentary group might decide 
against taking part in the no confidence vote the SDS had moved 
for. 
  The BSP also expressed its attitude to the no confidence 
motion today. "The Socialists are going to insist on the 
government urgently initiating changes in the legal framework 
concerning gambling and measures to tighten control over the 
illicit export of goods, capital and important information. The 
minister of the interior must undertake immediately structural, 
functional and personnel changes and take specific measures 
against the shadow structures that create a real risk and fuel 
mistrust among the separate Interior Ministry services," BSP 
spokesperson Klara Marinova told today's news briefing of the 
BSP. Reporters learned that BSP leader Zhan Videnov would meet 
Prime Minister Berov and Interior Minister Victor Mikhaylov and 
ask them for guarantees those demands would be satisfied. The 
BSP stand on no confidence vote will largely depend on the 
outcome of the meeting. 
  "If the measures we demand are not taken, when the no 
confidence motion prompted by growing crime it put to the vote 
we will have no ground to shut our eyes to the serious danger 
the country is faced by," Mr. Videnov said. He pointed out that 
the BSP parliamentary group would decide whether to abstain from 
voting immediately before the voting procedure. 
  In the stand taken by the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy] 
parliamentary group today the no confidence motion of the SDS is 
described as "yet another act aimed to draw political 
dividends," the NSD insists on tangible changes in the structure 
of the Interior Ministry and on professional selection of its 
personnel. NSD MP Gospodin Atanasov told journalists that his 
parliamentary group would vote one way on the SDS no confidence 
motion and none of its members would support it. 
  "I will support the no confidence motion because if a 
government cannot cope with the situation and if it cannot curb 
crime, it must go, an interior minister who just shrugs his 
shoulders instead of saying what he intends to do must also go," 
DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement] MP Mehmed Hodja, chairman of 
the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, told reporters today. 
Today he submitted a statement on his leaving the DPS 
parliamentary group to the parliamentary secretarial department. 
Motivating his decision, Mr. Hodja said that the leadership of 
the parliamentary DPS and of the DPS Central Operational Bureau 
forced upon their members close collaboration with the 
parliamentary group of the BSP, thus betraying the interests of 
the DPS electorate. He accused the leaders of the DPS 
parliamentary group of employing authoritarian methods adding he 
had serious evidence of a high degree of corruption among its 
members. The differences between Mr. Hodja and the leaders of 
both the DPS and its parliamentary group became especially 
prominent at the second conference of the DPS held at the end of 
November 1993. 
  MP Redjeb Chinar, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary 
Budget 
and Finance Committee, filed a statement on his leaving the 
parliamentary DPS today too. Motivating his decision, he 
accuses the parliamentary DPS leadership of "acting in a 
dictatorial manner and hindering dialogue, thus making it 
impossible to give any issue a proper consideration within the 
DPS parliamentary group." Mr. Hodja and Mr. Chinar declare they 
will carry out the duties assigned to them by the constitution 
as independent MP's. Some time ago another two MP's left the 
DPS parliamentary group. 
  Mr. Yunal Lyutfi, deputy floor leader of the parliamentary 
DPS, told journalists today that the DPS delegation headed by 
DPS leader Ahmed Dogan had put off its visit to Morocco and 
Libya for an indefinite time because of the complicated domestic 
situation. The delegation was to leave tomorrow. Mr. Lyutfi 
declined any further comment or details.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia Feb (CTK) -- Czech Economic 
Competition Minister Stanislav Belehradek today warned against 
underestimating Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statements because 
"there still exist politicians who would like very much to 
divide continents into their spheres of influence." 
  Speaking at a press conference of the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), of which he is a 
member, Belehradek was reacting to Zhirinovskiy's interview with 
the REUTER news agency of January 30. In it, Zhirinovskiy said 
that the Czech Republic would soon lose Moravia and that all 
that would be left of it would be Prague and several breweries 
were the beer was turning bitter. 
  Belehradek said that "Stalin's spirit and Russia's 
great-power policy" were radiating from the opinions of 
Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's nationalistic Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  He said that the KDU-CSL was sharply opposed to efforts to 
divide Europe into German and Russian spheres of interest, and 
added he did not understand at all why Moravia should become a 
political card in the game of great-power interests. 
  Replying to journalists' questions, Belehradek admitted that 
Zhirinovskiy probably knew little rather than much about 
Moravia. There may exist "a certain card" which may have been 
discussed with some representatives from Slovakia, because 
Zhirinovskiy had mentioned Bratislava and Slovakia as well.

  [Text] Prague Feb 2 (CTK) -- Russian Ambassador to the 
Czech Republic Alexandr Lebedev believes that Czechs should not 
take statements made by Zhirinovskiy too much to heart and 
should simply ignore them, Lebedev told CTK today. 
  Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which emerged victorious at the 
Russian recent parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the 
Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few 
breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the 
Czech Republic." 
  Lebedev said that Zhirinovskiy's views did not reflect any 
official or semi-official line, but were his own opinions. 
Judging by his statements, it can be said that Zhirinovskiy 
knows the rules of the "propagandist game" that the more 
extravagant and wild are the ideas expressed the greater 
attention they attract. "And this is what he needs. So let us 
take this with humour," Lebedev said. 
  He said he did not have information so far about 
Zhirinovskiy 
being prepared to visit the Czech Republic. Lebedev pointed 
out, however, that Zhirinovskiy is travelling to the states in 
Russia's vicinity. "We shall see what his plans are, but I know 
nothing about them thus far. However, if he were to decide to 
visit the Czech Republic, given his statement that in Czech 
breweries the beer will turn bitter, it would mean that he would 
try to drink some good beer in time," Lebedev said.

  [Text] Prague Feb 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
Legal Department today told CTK that a visit of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic cannot legally be prevented 
beforehand. 
  The statement says that Zhirinovskiy is the legally elected 
deputy to the Russian State Duma and is thus entitled to have a 
diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation. A new agreement 
on visa-free relations between the Czech Republic and the 
Russian Federation will change nothing in the position of 
holders of diplomatic passports. It points out, however, that 
holders of diplomatic passports just like all other foreign 
visitors should abide by Czech law. 
  Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which gained a victory at the 
Russian parliamentary elections in December, is currently 
travelling Europe. In an interview with REUTER he said that "the 
Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few 
breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the 
Czech Republic." 
  Tomas Hoffmann, a Prague solicitor, said today that 
Zhirinovskiy could come to the Czech Republic without any 
invitation. However if he were to violate the law he could be 
prosecuted in any way as any other citizen who violates the 
legally protected interests of the Czech Republic. According to 
experts, the State Attorney's Office should deal with 
Zhirinovskiy's statements and should consider whether or not 
Czech laws were violated by these statements. 
  Given the fact that Zhirinovskiy is a member of the 
parliament of a foreign state, who although he is travelling 
privately, uses diplomatic protection, the matter appears to be 
very delicate. If the State Attorney's Office were to take a 
preventative stand on Zhirinovskiy's remarks now, it would mean 
preparing for a visit and possible statements aimed against the 
Czech Republic and its interests.

  [Text] Prague Feb 2 (CTK) -- "We have no choice but to 
believe that the new Russian Government will continue reforms," 
Czech President Vaclav Havel said today. 
  In an interview for CTK, ITAR-TASS and AP, dedicated to the 
latest developments in Russia, Havel said he has always had much 
liking for the reform efforts of former Russian First 
Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar and former Finance Minister Boris 
Fyodorov. 
  "I hope that the current changes will not mean the freezing 
or stopping these reforms. If reforms were to be stopped 
half-way it would be even worse than if they had not been 
started at all," Havel said.

  [Text] Washington Feb 2 (CTK) -- The Partnership for Peace 
opens up some opportunities, but also leaves a certain 
uncertainty which is consistently exploited by Russia, Chairman 
of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Jiri Payne told 
Czech emigres today. 
  The space between Germany and Russia is to a large extent 
unclear and it is up to Central Europe to settle this, Payne 
said. Russia has also a solution for Central Europe, but we do 
not want to accept it and we are not about to deal with it 
again, Payne stated. 
  In his words, the Czech Republic has a special relationship 
to NATO. None of the post-communist countries can be admitted 
into NATO without the Czechs, Payne said, adding that there was 
no variant whereby the Czech Republic could be ruled out. 
  Russia says it does not want to divide Europe, but its 
policy 
is dividing it, and it is creating spheres of interest by 
defining "close abroad." The Czech Republic, Austria and 
Slovenia are not parts of Russia's "close abroad." This is the 
weightiest argument which singles us out from the Visegrad Four 
(the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary), Payne stated. 
  We are cooperating with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as much 
as possible but we cannot afford to wait for anybody, he added.

  [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- A fault in the transformer on 
the third block of the nuclear plant in Dukovany, South Moravia, 
caused a fire at 0700 [0600 GMT], Petr Brandejs, a nuclear 
security official, told CTK today. 
  The fire which was extinguished at 0900 did not result in 
any 
leakage of radioactive substances and no one was injured, 
Brandejs reported. 
  The fault, which caused reactor output to sink to 30 
percent, 
did not affect the nuclear safety of the bloc, Brandejs said. 
The fault has been provisionally rated as zero on the INES 
scale.

  [Text] Prague Feb 1 (CTK) -- Visiting Finnish Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto said today there were no political 
problems between Finland and the Czech Republic and economic 
relations between the two countries would continue to improve. 
  At a press conference following a meeting between Haavisto 
and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today, the two 
ministers assessed relations between their countries as good. 
During the meeting, bilateral relations as well as economic 
development and European questions were discussed. 
  Haavisto told journalists that his current two-day visit to 
Prague was very important for him. 
  Zieleniec said the talks provided a good opportunity for 
getting acquainted with Finland's experiences in the process of 
integration into the European Union (EU) and in its relationship 
towards Russia. Zieleniec said the Czech Republic considered an 
active promotion of Czech-Finnish relations to be of great use, 
adding that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus would visit Finland next 
month and a Finnish parliamentary delegation was expected in 
Prague. 
  Haavisto said Finland was seeking to conclude its 
negotiations on membership in the EU by the end of this month. 
He said the EU would be one of the most important factors of 
future European security and membership in it would thus make it 
possible for Finland to participate in its strengthening. He 
said Finland was not interested in membership in NATO or any 
other new security structures. He described the U.S. 
Partnership for Peace project as very good for the development 
of security especially in Central and Eastern Europe, adding 
that Finland sought to find ways to approach it. 
  Asked to comment on the statement made by Russian extremist 
and chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, that "if Finland was interested in Karelia then 
all Finland should go to Russia," Haavisto said that similar 
"extraordinary phenomena" also exist elsewhere and that 
excessive attention should not be paid to them. He said there 
were no problems in relations between Russia and Finland and 
that his country has no territorial claims against Russia. 
  He said that Finland considered its relations with Russia 
and 
the whole of Europe to be equally important and was striving to 
find a solution that would enhance security and stability in 
Europe and especially in its northern part.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 Feb (MTI) -- President of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his 
three-member entourage crossed from Yugoslavia into Hungary by 
car at Roszke at 4 a.m. on Thursday [3 February]. They boarded 
a plane for Moscow at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport. 
  National Police Airport Security Service Head Colonel Jozsef 
Balogh said that one of Zhirinovsky's companions carried an 
unloaded gun in his hand baggage. The gun was confiscated 
according to international regulations and given to the plane's 
captain in a steel box. Balogh said the group flew to Moscow 
from Ferihegy-2 terminal by Malev flight 100. 
  He added that when a protected Hungarian politician travels 
abroad, for example, the president or the prime minister, the 
security men accompanying him also hand over their guns to the 
captain, who gives them back upon arrival at the point of 
destination.

  [Text] Budapest, 1 Feb (MTI) -- The director of the 
Criminal Justice Department of the National Police, Brigadier 
General Antal Kacziba, called for more precise legal definitions 
to protect society more effectively from extremist phenomena, at 
a news conference in Budapest today. He proposed punishing 
extremist conspiracy as well. 
  Kacziba said that criminal proceedings had been launched 
against two members of the World National Popular Rule Party 
(WNPRP), suspected of having committed the crime of incitement 
against a community. The suspects are Albert Szabo, 29, a dual 
Hungarian-Australian citizen who heads the party, and Akos B., a 
juvenile activist. They made a confession, but did not plead 
guilty. 
  As previously reported, the complaint lodged by the National 
Security Office against the two had some connection with the 
WNPRP meeting in Budapest in mid-January, where they denied that 
the Holocaust had ever taken place and defined themselves as 
successors to the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its 
leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes 
against humanity. 
  The police investigated 16 skinhead attacks involving 88 
suspects, 22 of whom were taken into custody, Kacziba said. 
  In the same period, the Budapest court tried three cases on 
charges of serious bodily or mental harm caused to people for 
their affiliation to an ethnic, racial or religious minority. 
The court could not establish proof of this criminal motivation 
in any of the cases, but imposed a penalty for grevious bodily 
harm with base motives, and hooliganism. Appeals may be filed. 
  Seven lawsuits involved the use of extremist symbols. Most 
recently, the police received a complaint against the Budapest 
organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, for 
displaying a coat-of-arms with a five-pointed red star at their 
televised meeting on November 7. 
  Kacziba stressed that the criminal code uses no terms like 
"left wing" and "right wing," and the police are not supposed to 
qualify the political views of offenders. It is the duty of the 
National Security Office to detect extremist groupings. The 
police only conduct criminal proceedings.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 Feb (MTI) -- Hungary's Chief Public 
Prosecutor's Office on Wednesday told MTI that, in response to a 
complaint, it had examined the operation of the World National 
Popular Rule Party (WNPRP) for compliance with legal regulations. 
  Investigations showed that the party's aims and activities 
run counter to certain constitutional provisions concerning 
civic rights and freedoms, particularly the right to human 
dignity, minority rights and the equal rights of citizens. 
Also, legal proceedings are under way against the leader and 
another member of the party, on charges of incitement against a 
community. 
  On the basis of the findings of the Chief Public 
Prosecutor's 
Office, the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has filed a 
petition at the Metropolitan Court to dissolve the party. 
  As previously reported, on January 21 the National Security 
Office lodged a complaint with the National Police Headquarters 
against Albert Szabo, a dual Hungarian/Australian citizen who 
heads the WNPRP, and Akos B., a juvenile activist, for allegedly 
having committed the crime of incitement against a community. 
  The party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting in 
Budapest in mid-January where they denied that the Holocaust had 
ever taken place and defined themselves as successors to the 
Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its leader, Ferenc 
Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 February (MTI) -- The second largest 
Jewish community of continental Europe, after France, is found 
in Hungary, numbering approximately 80,000, but estimates reckon 
that an additional 70,000 people currently included in the 
Christian population are of Jewish origin. Since 1989, there 
has been a renaissance in the culture and traditions of the 
Jewish community. 
  Jews can freely exercise their religion in Hungary's 41 
synagogues, and the faith is recognized by authorities as a 
historical religion, indicated by the restoration of the army 
chaplain service. 
  The only rabbi training institute in eastern Europe is found 
in Budapest, the Jewish Pedagogicum, which is soon to be 
officially ranked as a college. There are three Jewish 
kindergartens, four primary, and four secondary schools, 
attended by more than 1,000 pupils. Traditionally 
well-qualified, 30 percent of Hungarian Jews are presently 
graduates of higher educational institutions, a proportion that 
is the highest in Europe, including even Israel. 
  The Hungarian state and society express their effort for 
reconciliation in many ways. Partial financial compensation is 
granted for individual grievances by the compensation laws, and 
talks are still under way between the Hungarian state and 
international and Hungarian Jewish organizations on compensation 
to be provided by the Hungarian state for Jewish assets held in 
its possession without beneficiaries. 
  A law passed last year, complementing the earlier law 
banning 
racist, anti-semite organizations termed the use of national 
socialist symbols to be a crime. 
  The government has, in real value, increased financial 
support for Jewish organizations in Hungary: From 44 million 
forints in 1990, 216 million in 1991, and 237 million in 1992, 
to 287 million forints in 1993. ($1 equalled approx. 103 
forints in January.) The government provides financial 
assistance to the national social movement which, relying on 
local authorities, encourages the restoration of Jewish 
cemeteries throughout the country. As a result, more than 30 
cemeteries have been retored, most recently in Kal, northern 
Hungary. 
  The activity of anti-semites in Hungary -- termed a "dwarf 
minority" by the government, the parties, and Jewish 
organizations -- has enlivened in the past period. A 
parliamentary committee registered 115 anti-semite 
manifestations in the last quarter of 1993, twice as many as in 
the first quarter. The Holocaust Memorial Committee protested 
this January against the bomb threats of synagogues and Jewish 
schools, and the fascist symbols painted on synagogues.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 1 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak on 
Monday explained to Finance Minister Marek Borowski the reasons 
behind the dismissal last Friday of Deputy Finance Minister 
Stefan Kawalec. The letter has probably reached the addressee 
by now, Ewa Wachowicz, the prime minister's press secretary, 
said on Tuesday. 
  Wachowicz did not disclose the contents of the letter and 
denied press reports to the effect that Finance Minister 
Borowski, unsatisfied with the explanation, has allegedly 
decided to quit. 
  Premier Pawlak dismissed Kawalec last Friday without prior 
consultations with Finance Minister Borowski. Deputy Prime 
Minister Borowski Friday asked the prime minister for a written 
explanation by Monday.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 2 -- One third of the respondents to a 
poll by the Public Opinion Research Centre (CBOS) Wednesday said 
the NATO "Partnership for Peace" proposal creates real chances 
of Poland's joining the Western military alliance, while twenty 
seven percent took the opposite point of view. Forty percent 
either knew nothing or had no opinion on the issue. 
  Fifty five percent of the polled argued that Poland's bid 
for 
NATO is now the best policy for guaranteeing the country's 
security, and according to twenty two percent of the 
respondents, it would be best not to join any military alliances 
and become neutral. Only seven percent claimed that the best 
solution would be to seek a military alliance with other states. 
  Almost half (48 percent) of the CBOS respondents believed 
there is no threat to Poland's independence, while thirty five 
percent stated the opposite. 
  Fifty five percent claim that Russia had objected to Poland 
and other former "socialist block's" efforts to become a NATO 
member because it sought to regain influence over the states, 
one fourth of the polled thought Russia feared that her own 
security will be jeopardized, while every fifth person had no 
opinion on the subject. 
  The survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,226 
adult Poles on January 14-17.

Gebhardt von Moltke, arrived in Bucharest on February 3 for 
consultations with the Romanian party on the next stages of the 
Partnership for Peace Romania has to traverse. 
  Gebhardt von Moltke told the press upon arrival at the 
Otopeni Airport that Romania was "very active" in the close work 
together with the NATO Cooperation Council. Heads of state and 
government of the NATO countries have decided to take an 
important step ahead in the military cooperation, he said, 
stressing that the Partnership for Peace "gives Romania the 
possibility to strengthen this cooperation." He said he came 
here to get more information and get this process started, being 
very interested in the talks that would follow. He added 
Romania was a partner of the North-Atlantic Alliance and the 
Partnership for Peace gave it the possibility to structure this 
cooperation to its benefit.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 2 (CTK) -- Slovaks are afraid of 
Hungarian irredentism stemming from "not exactly the most 
appropriate statements by representatives of Slovakia's 
Hungarian minority, as well as several Hungarian politicians," 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said in parliament today. 
  In an interview for CTK, however, he said that his statement 
"does not have to correspond completely to reality," but added 
that the ministry had decided to make such a statement in its 
foreign policy report to parliament only after much 
consideration. 
  "The ministry has analysed several specific statements by 
the 
chairman of the (Hungarian) Egyutteles movement, Miklos Duray 
and come to the conclusion that they contain elements of 
irredentism," Moravcik said. He added that some of these 
statements led to the holding of the January 8 meeting in 
Komarno, Southern Slovakia, where members of the country's 
Hungarian minority were to discuss the creation of an autonomous 
Hungarian "province" in the region, but eventually dropped the 
issue. 
  Moravcik reiterated his opposition to the idea that granting 
rights to minorities should create artificial borders between 
various ethnic groups. He said that a situation where the 
granting of one demand only leads to the raising of another is 
intolerable. 
  The Slovak-Hungarian friendship treaty under preparation is 
a 
"basic pillar" of cooperation between the two countries, he 
said, adding that Slovakia saw no reason to delay signing it 
soon.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 2 (CTK) -- The primary task of the 
Slovak foreign policy is to develop relations with the 
neighbouring and European Union (EU) states, says a report 
submitted by Premier Vladimir Meciar to the parliamentary 
session today. 
  Slovakia has been recognised by 123 countries and diplomatic 
relations have been established with 106 states. Among European 
states, only Liechtenstein has not recognised Slovakia, due to 
unclear property issues. 
  The mutual distrust and tense atmosphere in relations with 
Hungary have not been overcome in spite of (Slovakia's) 
accommodating steps. Hungary is to be blamed for the current 
situation since it has questioned Slovakia at international 
forums by stressing the problems concerning the ethnic Hungarian 
minority (ethnic Hungarians number 560,000 people, 11 percent of 
the 5-million Slovak population) and nourishing irredentist 
tendencies of several representatives of the ethnic Hungarian 
parties in Slovakia, the report states. 
  Turning to relations to Hungary, the report mentions the 
need 
to sign a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation and to 
resolve dispute over the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric 
project at the International Court in the Hague. 
  The report stresses the importance of the European agreement 
on Slovakia's association with the EU and the provisional 
agreement on trade and related issues between Slovakia and the 
EU signed last year. Membership in the Council of Europe was 
also a success, the report says. 
  It points out relatively poor dissemination of information 
about Slovakia abroad. The interest of foreign media and 
political representatives focuses on the expediently selected 
issues such as the protection of the ethnic minorities' rights, 
freedom of press, conversion of arms production and situation of 
Romanies (Gypsies), the report complains.

  [Text] Budapest, 2 Feb (MTI) -- Slovak Deputy Prime 
Minister Marian Andel met with Hungarian Ambassador Jeno Boros 
on Wednesday, for talks on minority affairs and bilateral 
relations. 
  "I told the deputy premier that the current system of 
minority education in Slovakia is in any case more advanced than 
that it should give cause for introducing alternative education, 
which would mean a step backward," the ambassador told MTI. 
  Since the plan gave rise to protest from ethnic Hungarians 
in 
Slovakia, the ambassador suggested to Andel that the Slovak 
authorities should consult with minority leaders before 
introducing alternative education. Both sides agreed on the 
need for revising and prolonging bilateral agreements on 
cultural and educational cooperation. 
  The ambassador asked the Slovak politician to decide where 
the Hungarian Cultural Centre in Bratislava should find its 
final home, an issue which he stressed has remained unresolved 
for eleven years through no fault of the Hungarian side. The 
Hungarian cultural mission opened in 1989, and has been 
operating in a temporary building for three years. Andel 
promised to examine the issue and come forward with a proposal 
in a month. 
  The ambassador also raised the still unsettled issue of 
teachers' training in Nitra, pointing out that Slovakia's 
failure to launch a department of national and ethnic cultures 
gives reason for justified anxiety. The deputy premier promised 
that after considering the issue the Slovak Government will find 
a reassuring solution.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 2 (CTK) -- By a vote of 109-102, the 
Slovak parliament today approved a report on the fulfillment of 
the "Tasks and Urgent Goals of the Slovak Republic's Foreign 
Policy" delivered by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik. 
  Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), 
the 
strongest opposition party, criticised the government's foreign 
policy, arguing that it was not a coincidence that German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Premier John Major and other 
European politicians have forgotten to include Slovakia among 
the candidates for NATO membership. 
  He said the reason was the lack of political definition of 
the government coalition Movement For a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), which have no 
political partners in Europe. He said the SDL was a suitable 
partner for left-oriented parties in other European countries, 
adding that the victory of the left in Poland has not brought 
difficulties on the international scene. 
  Anton Hrnko, member of the SNS breakaway National Democratic 
Parliamentary Group, said foreign policy was a continuation of 
internal policies. It is thus difficult to make a successful 
foreign policy given the poor credibility of top-ranking Slovak 
officials, including Premier Vladimir Meciar, he said. 
  Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the deputies' club of 
Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement in 
Slovakia, speaking on behalf of Hungarian deputies, rejected the 
accusation of irredentism and of the efforts to question and 
complicate Slovakia's international position. He described the 
phrase that the ethnic minority rights in Slovakia are in 
harmony with international law as meaningless one. 
  Ex-Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats (ADSR) Milan Knazko voiced disappointment that 
Slovakia had not utilised the advantages stemming from the 
peaceful division of the Czechoslovak Federation.

  [Text] Bratislava January 31 (CTK) -- Slovak Minister of 
the Economy Jan Ducky today said miners' claims were justified 
and promised leaders of the Miners', Geologists' and Oil 
Industry Workers' Union that their social demands would be met 
for the first three months after the Slovak Government's 
programme of mining reductions began. 
  After the first quarter, Ducky and Finance Minister Julius 
Toth would push for changes in the state budget with regard to 
the demands of the miners, Slovak Radio reported today. 
  Ducky said that the problems of the Slovak mining industry 
were caused by changes in the structure of Slovakia's fuel and 
energy base, and because market conditions made it possible for 
bad quality but competitively-priced products to be imported to 
Slovakia. 
  "We do not want a protection of the coal market which would 
give the domestic product an unfair advantage, but we have to 
find ways of limiting the import of substrates which destroy the 
environment," Ducky said. 
  Union Chairman Marian Mesiarik expressed satisfaction with 
the results of today's meeting with Ducky, especially with the 
fact that the minister "did not doubt the social demands of the 
miners were justified." 
  He said a council would be meeting on February 15 to discuss 
the problem of the Slovak mining industry. If the proposals of 
the unionists are approved, the coal industry will survive 
without state subsidies, he said. 
  He said today's announcement of a sit-in after Ducky failed 
to arrive on time had now become insignificant.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 1 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today approved a parliamentary bill that would strike two 
controversial articles from the Criminal Code. Articles 102 and 
103, which were left over from the former Czechoslovak Federal 
Criminal Code, prescribe punishment for defamation of the state 
or its symbols or top representatives. 
  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, who informed journalists of the 
decision, said the government had based its decision on the 
views of the human rights organisation Amnesty International and 
Slovakia's committee on monitoring the 1975 Helsinki human 
rights agreement. 
  Article 102 is the basis for the current prosecution of Ivan 
Lexa, head of the Government Office and state secretary of the 
Privatisation Ministry, as well as a strong supporter of Premier 
Vladimir Meciar. Lexa made allegedly defamatory remarks about 
President Michal Kovac after Kovac refused to name him minister 
of privatisation. 
  In the Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel has called 
upon 
the government and the Constitutional Court to abolish or amend 
the two articles.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 1 (CTK) -- The Czech side 
"concealed" 18 seagoing ships during the split of the 
Czechoslovak Shipping Company (CNP), Slovak Transport, 
Communications and Public Works Minister Roman Hofbauer told 
journalists today. 
  He said he did not consider the question of the split of the 
Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) and the CNP to be a closed one, 
adding, however, that the CSA was privatised by the Federal 
Government. When the Czech Government finally owned up to the 
ships, it marked out 12 of them as having zero balance value, he 
said. 
  The Slovak Government today approved a report on the federal 
property settlement. Three agreements concerning the split of 
the Czechoslovak National Bank assets, golden bullion, federal 
state deficit and the final agreement are yet to be signed. 
  The government also passed a draft document on railway 
transport subsidies. The two million crowns (60,000 USD) 
earmarked for the railways will only benefit passenger 
transport, Hofbauer said, adding that freight transport has been 
functioning on a commercial basis. 
  The government approved a road transport bill that would 
create room for competition, Hofbauer said, adding that he 
believed the bill to be "fully compatible" with similar 
documents passed by the European Union countries.

  [Text] Tirana, February 1 (ATA) -- Well-informed sources 
in Tetove report that Mithat Emini, former secretary of the 
Democratic Prosperity Party of Macedonia [PDP], was arrested on 
January 28. The same sources relate this act of police with the 
arrest some time ago of nine Albanians, one of whom was in the 
post of the deputy defence minister. Despite statement by its 
number one, Lubomir Ferckovski, that the question is closed now, 
Macedonian police continued with other arrests. Detention of 
the former senior official of the main party of the Albanians in 
Macedonia is a warning that other arrests will be made. Another 
proof to this is also the fact that the date of the trial for 
the above group of Albanians arrested by the end of 1993 is not 
yet fixed.

  [Text] Tirana, February 3 (ATA) -- The campaign of 
house-searches, maltreatment and questioning of parties's 
activists by the Serbian police continued also last week in the 
Ferizaj commune. Under the pretext of looking for arms, the 
Serbian police maltreated Shaip Avdullahu and his nephew, Aziz 
Arifi, from the Prelez village, though they had no arms. The 
Serbian police inspectors questioned the DLK [Democratic League 
of Kosova] activist, Mustafe Aliaj, asking him on how the DLK 
spends its money and if the DLK is buying arms. The DLK 
Information Commission in Mirash reported that Serbian police 
has recently searched 10 houses and confiscated the arms for 
which the owners had a permit. The Human Rights and Freedom 
Defence Commission in Ferizaj reported that a Serbian couple, 
Petar and Mira Gavriloviq, has broken into the house of Pajazit 
Gjoni although he has a contract for it since 1984.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion in the "World Studio" program </F>
entitled "NATO, the Promised Land, Viewed From the East" with 
Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign minister; Gyula Horn, 
chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party; Gyula Kodolanyi, 
state secretary and foreign political adviser to the prime 
minister; and Jozsef Szajer, leader of the foreign policy group 
of the Alliance of Young Democrats; moderator not identified -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Moderator] Let us start with the question of 
whether Hungary is threatened by any outside danger, and from 
this point of view, just how necessary this NATO membership is. 
  [Jeszenszky] Perhaps I shall start, since at present I am 
responsible, with several of my colleagues, for the security of 
the country. I think that at the moment, no direct danger 
threatens us. I do not know of a country which would want to 
attack Hungary with its soldiers and army. 
  However, Hungary has been occupied several times in the 20th 
century. [passage omitted] I think even a child knows in Hungary 
that in the past 50 years in Europe, peace was saved by NATO. 
Thus, in Europe, NATO is the only effective security 
organization in possession of armies and forces; I think it is 
totally understandable that I would like to see Hungary in NATO. 
  [Horn] I agree with the foreign minister that there is no 
immediate danger. It is my conviction that none of our 
neighbors would have any reason or perhaps means to initiate any 
kind of attack against Hungary. [passage omitted] However, I 
feel that this region, Hungary included, is in a security policy 
vacuum. 
  I fully understand NATO, that it did not want to take on 
this 
unstable region by offering NATO membership. Even if the 
Russian behavior, or the Russian issue does not mean a veto 
factor for them [NATO], they had to consider whether the region 
was a destabilizing factor for the world or for Russia. 
  I would argue with Mr. Woerner on one point: I do not 
believe 
that if a new situation develops, any sort of consultation with 
NATO will help us. 
  There is something else which is more important for me: The 
important thing is how can we come to an agreement with the 
neighbors and what sort of policies shall we follow in 
connection with Russia and other countries of the region. This 
will be the key question concerning our security. The other is 
our relation with the European Union. [passage omitted] 
  [Szajer] [passage omitted] I think that the main principle 
of 
Hungarian foreign policy must be to ensure the conditions for 
Hungary to complete the integration strategies. The real token 
of this is full NATO and European Union membership. I think 
that there are no other priorities. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] What is our hope, until perhaps NATO accepts 
Hungary as a member? 
  [Kodolanyi] [We can trust] in the fact that Hungary is a 
stable country at present and no neighboring army threatens us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Horn] I cannot agree with the idea formulated by Jozsef 
Szajer that our only savior -- either from an economic or from 
security aspect -- is NATO membership. Because Brussels and 
Prague made one thing clear, and that is that a very long period 
has to pass before NATO will accept us. I understand this NATO 
position. But what should we do now? Will our security be 
doubtful until then? No. I see this: that the Partnership for 
Peace program is progress of a kind. [passage omitted] 
  I do not narrow the question of our security down to our 
neighbors. However, I consider it a fundamental issue. All 
external attacks throughout history came from there. We have no 
say in the formation of parliaments and governments in the 
neighboring countries and God forbid that Hungarian foreign 
policy would become involved in this. This is the internal 
affair of the people living there. 
  We have to cooperate with the people who are elected and 
considered legitimate in the respective countries, like it or 
not. I do not like quite a few members of the Romanian 
leadership, but I do not elect them. We must take the 
initiative in order that reconciliation should come about. 
  We must strive for reconciliation and must not keep harping 
on about our historical grievances. Step by step, we have to 
establish the trust which is lacking. For this is the situation 
today. And the West will also be a partner to us in this. The 
West will be no partner of ours if we clash with each other and 
increase tension among ourselves. 
  [Jeszenszky] I entirely agree with [Hungarian Socialist 
Party] Chairman Horn that we have to strive for good relations 
with our neighbors, this is obvious. This is also included in 
the program of the Hungarian Government. 
  Anybody who followed the events of the past three and half 
years, can see that Hungary made several initiatives which were 
sometimes answered, sometimes not. My latest visit in Belgrade 
also indicates that Hungary always took steps even in situations 
laden with new conflicts. It is out of the question that 
Hungary would be responsible for these [present] relations. 
[passage omitted] 
  I can most categorically state that the Hungarian Government 
and other responsible factors -- I include the opposition, too 
-- did everything possible recently to bring about a compromise 
with our neighbors. So this compromise is not up to us. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Szajer] In reaction to what Mr. Horn said, I did not mean 
that NATO membership is the only guarantee for our stability. I 
also agree that approaching the European Union is the primary 
political goal of the country. [passage omitted] However, it 
could happen easily that we miss the boat, for signs already 
indicate that the West is taking more and more notice of 
Russia's opinion. [passage omitted] 
  So we have to draw the conclusions from this and we have to 
relate to the situation in a pragmatic and realistic way, but at 
the same time, every opportunity must be utilized. 
  [Moderator] But what will happen if the negative alternative 
comes about, that is, if Zhirinovskiy or the likes of him come 
to power in Russia? Since Mr. Kodolanyi has already referred to 
the possibility of having a common border with Russia again in 
the future. Are we prepared for this negative scenario? 
  [Horn] I do not see the situation as being so dramatic. 
However, I consider the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon to be a big 
challenge and one must react to the situation by all means, 
because unfortunately, this phenomenon can find followers easily 
in other eastern-central European countries, too. However, the 
danger of this does not exist for the time being. 
  As regards the issue of our neighbors, we should survey the 
past four years as a whole and there were manifestations during 
this period which did not do much good for our relations with 
our neighbors. However, let us leave this and look ahead. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is not disputed by anybody that our wish to join NATO 
must 
be [officially] maintained. However, I have to add that when 
touring the country I found that people do not seem to think the 
same way about this. On the contrary, many people question the 
wisdom of joining NATO after having gotten rid of the Warsaw 
Pact. [passage omitted] This is why our party proposes to hold a 
referendum on the matter in order to form a true national 
consensus. 
  For the West, the Soviet factor in the past, and now the 
Russian factor, has always enjoyed absolute priority. They have 
always approached their former allies -- today the 
central-eastern European states -- via the Soviet factor and 
Moscow. This will prevail all along as long as Russia remains a 
superpower and, chiefly, a main nuclear power. Unfortunately, 
this is the reality. And no matter how much we wriggle, we 
cannot avoid facing this. [passage omitted] 
  [Jeszenszky] I do not want to boast, but Hungary -- and 
perhaps Poland -- played a very significant role in devising the 
Partnership for Peace program. When it was announced the first 
time, back in October, it was rather a lean offer. It was 
expanded a lot since then, and it was the Americans themselves 
who acknowledged at the Prague meeting that this was already 
something different from what it had been at the start. [passage 
omitted] 
  The issue, where there is rather a sharp conflict between 
the 
HSP and other parties, is the issue of the referendum. I do not 
consider the method of referendum a good one, especially not 
before an election. I said a few days ago here on the radio 
that the MDF is in favor of NATO membership, but I did not say 
that everybody who wants NATO membership has to vote for the 
MDF. What I say is that if you vote for the MDF, or Fidesz 
[Federation of Young Democrats] for that matter, you vote for 
NATO membership at the same time. [passage omitted] 
  I think that we can spare the country from an unnecessary 
and 
costly referendum if all parties state their position clearly in 
their election manifesto. [passage omitted] 
  [Horn] As for the question of Partnership [for Peace], I 
would be cautious with the adjectives. I say that it is a 
clever invention which is rooted in reality and I can only 
support it, not that this matters much. On the one hand, it 
maintains the opportunity of cooperation but on the other hand, 
it does not oblige NATO to anything which would be impossible 
for NATO. [passage omitted] 
  And just to remind everybody, to clear any misunderstanding, 
Hungary was not liberated by NATO. True, Western help was 
necessary, but in Hungary, a conscious process, directed from 
above, took place in the interest of changing the regime, in 
cooperation with the opposition at the time. I think you can 
all agree with this. 
  As for the other issue, whether or not the Warsaw Pact or 
Moscow considered us as cannon fodder, I would be a bit cautious 
with this, I did not feel it that way. It was true that they 
wanted to create a buffer zone and this is how they looked on 
the central-eastern European states. 
  I have to say that we weirdly encounter the same today in 
quite a few Western manifestations, when their policies in 
connection with Russia are discussed; we are a kind of buffer 
zone here. Let us not kid ourselves. [passage omitted] 
  It is no use telling NATO or Mr. Woerner to handle us 
separately [from the other eastern-central European countries]. 
It became fully clear after the summit [in Prague] that these 
countries are handled together -- you can keep on saying the 
same in the next few years, it is totally unrealistic. [passage 
omitted] 
  What is most important for us in these matters is that 
reality has to be taken into account to the greatest extent. It 
is not a bad thing for foreign policy to be adapted to reality 
and to be flexible, [while at the same time] preserving its 
essence. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Here at home, the first round of the parliamentary 
elections will be held on Sunday, 8 May, Arpad Goncz, president 
of the Republic, announced in the parliament. 
  The president said he had made this decision so that a new 
and stable government could be formed as soon as possible. On 
the other hand, the elections should be as cheap as possible, 
with as many people attending as possible. He also said he had 
to take several other aspects into consideration; for example, 
that the day of elections should not clash with the graduation 
ceremonies in secondary schools and that it should not be a 
working day. In his speech, the president called the cleanness 
of the elections important because, as he said, the second 
ballot was perhaps even more important than the first one in a 
new democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, by Gabor F. Havas and Ferenc Koszeg; place and date 
not given: "If the Liberal Parties Together...."] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [BESZELO] In your speech 
[at the national meeting of deputies, 28-31 January] you said 
that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is a true people's 
party. At the former meeting of deputies, you used the term 
social-liberal people's party. Contrary to this, our political 
opponents, including the prime minister himself, has often said 
that the SZDSZ is a civic radical, rather than a liberal, party. 
Does this kind of distinction mean anything and does it have 
anything to say for us? 
  [Peto] Today these terms are not unequivocal in Hungary. If 
I call the SZDSZ a people's party, this in itself does not 
clearly define the SZDSZ for others. However, it can be used as 
a self-definition. The SZDSZ can be called a people's party in 
the sense that it has become a lasting institution of Hungarian 
society, and no one any longer assumes that it will play an 
insignificant role in the elections. For the SZDSZ to achieve 
similar results to those in the 1990 elections, the support of 
the intelligentsia who follow otherwise attractive 
turn-of-the-century civic radical traditions is not enough -- 
just as it would not have been enough in 1990, either. Today, it 
is possible to find many people in all strata of Hungarian 
society who are receptive to the political efforts -- which by 
no means can be called civic radical -- represented by the 
SZDSZ. The SZDSZ's supporters and members are represented in 
all strata of society, and the reason they vote for us can also 
be grasped to a certain extent. It might be easier to put this 
into words in negative statements. They vote for us because 
they seek a kind of party for themselves that is not like the 
current government parties, not like the current Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP], and not like the current Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz]. However, it is also possible to 
explain the differences because the SZDSZ's image has been 
established fairly firmly over the past five years. It is a 
party of modernization that does not delve much into history or 
ideology, and does not formulate Christian-national or other 
similar goals that can be seen as ideological goals. It 
professes to be liberal, but at the same time, the difference 
from, for example, the Fidesz can be perceived, and this is when 
we say we are social-liberal. [passage omitted] 
  [BESZELO] What kind of cooperation would you consider 
desirable between the liberal parties, especially the two "big" 
ones, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz? 
  [Peto] It would be desirable for these two parties if, 
rather than eyeing each other distrustfully, their cooperation 
was determined by common interests. If I accept that these are 
two clearly distinct parties, not only in age but now also in 
their principles, it would be good if they represented their own 
principles until the first round in the elections and put their 
own candidates in the best possible positions, while in the 
second round, in accordance with the principles laid down in the 
SZDSZ-Fidesz agreement, candidates would be mutually withdrawn, 
and we would try to determine the character of the next 
government through forming a small coalition. 
  This would be the optimal situation but I would not like to 
appear unaware of the obstacles. In spite of the agreement, the 
Fidesz is putting much energy into differentiating itself from 
the SZDSZ by strengthening its own identity, even in cases when 
cooperation would be better. There is no point in denying that 
the Fidesz's goal is to become a bigger liberal party than the 
SZDSZ, and it is putting an awful lot of energy into this. It 
is also obvious that the Fidesz would be happier to form a 
coalition with the current government coalition than with the 
MSZP. However, in the SZDSZ's view, one is worse than the 
other, and, therefore, it does not yet want to decide on this 
issue. Finally, it would be no use denying that there is a fair 
amount of mutual mistrust. I do not know what the Fidesz 
actually thinks and what it is just saying or doing for tactical 
reasons; however, its behavior is determined by the unfounded 
assumption that the SZDSZ has intimate relations with the MSZP. 
On the other hand, the SZDSZ is suspicious because there are 
many signs that the Fidesz has particular links with the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the government. [passage 
omitted] 
  [BESZELO] Actually, it would be of vital interest to the 
Fidesz to try to reduce the mistrust because it is obvious that 
the liberal line could really determine the next government if a 
liberal small coalition were formed before the actual government 
were. 
  [Peto] This is true but it is not always the practical 
solutions that happen. For a long time -- here there is no 
change -- the Fidesz has been forming its relations with the 
SZDSZ from viewpoints of rivalry, rather than general political 
principles. In certain cases in the past, we could have 
achieved much more if the Fidesz, rather than seeing the 
assertion of its self-identity as the main task, had looked at 
the issue itself on which we could have worked together. 
However, we have to accept the Fidesz as it is. It would be bad 
politics to impose our own norms on them. If the Fidesz thinks 
that it can only work in a coalition where the MDF is on one 
side, perhaps the SZDSZ on the other, and the Fidesz in the 
middle, this indicates what they might do. If, in addition to 
this, they did not consult the MDF before making this decision, 
the MDF could all of a sudden upset the whole thing by saying 
that it cannot imagine a coalition with the SZDSZ; if in the 
meantime, the Fidesz could not afford to be angry with the MDF 
so became angry with the SZDSZ even for this, well, this would 
be bad luck, but what could one do? The two big liberal parties 
with the Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party can 
only jointly be sure of becoming inevitable parts of the 
government. Whatever kind of coalition is formed, if only one 
liberal party is part of it, then its importance will be much 
less than its numerical proportion. However, the liberal 
parties together could be a determining force in any coalition.

  [Text] The question of the possible intervention of 
Croatian forces in the Bosnian conflict was the focus of a 
meeting in Zagreb between Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
and the Croatian prime minister. Solana ended his visit to 
former Yugoslavia this afternoon. Our special correspondent 
Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports. 
  [Cespedes] Good evening. Croatian Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic met Minister Solana and denied the direct intervention 
of regular Croatian troops in the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Spanish foreign minister was forceful 
and clear when it came to asking the question in Zagreb at 
midday today. Valentic gave an assurance that it is not the 
case and Javier Solana spoke about a different report. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Whatever the case may be, the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces, the UNPROFOR commanders, 
say that Croatian troops have indeed been seen on the ground. 
[end recording] 
  [Cespedes] A negotiated solution to the problem of 
Srebrenica 
without the need for air strikes is on the way, and hopes of a 
similar -- though more distant -- outcome for the opening of 
Tuzla Airport have not been ruled out. These are the two most 
important pieces of information obtained by Minister Solana 
following his talks with the UN secretary general's 
representative for the military conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, with whom he agrees that the threats of air strikes 
are bearing fruit.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime </F>
minister and foreign minister, by Zagreb Television 
correspondent; Granic in Rome -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] We have Mate Granic, Croatian deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, on the phone line from 
Rome. Good evening, Mr Granic. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you for granting us this interview, I 
know that you are very busy. First of all, could you tell me 
what is Italy's stand on sanctions against Croatia? 
  [Granic] Italy is concerned about the news on the presence 
of 
Croatian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was also with 
great understanding that they accepted my explanations that 
these are only volunteers, and only up to 2,000 of them, and 
that there is a much larger number of volunteers from Islamic 
countries than Croatian volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Also, 
I explained that Croatia had no intention of initiating a 
military intervention, and that it suggested that all 
Bosnia-Herzegovina borders be supervised. 
  [Correspondent] Alright. You had this to say about the 
presence of volunteers. You therefore stick to your statement 
that there are up to 2,000 volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Can you comment on Butros Ghali's letter to the Security 
Council this evening in which he states that there are 3,000 to 
5,000 soldiers of the regular Croatian Army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Granic] They call the volunteers: elements of the Croatian 
forces -- and that is the only difference. Concerning the 
figure of 3,000 to 5,000, they have received it from various 
sources, although not everyone agrees with these figures, 
including NATO. 
  [Correspondent] In addition to the sanctions, did you 
discuss 
with [Italian Foreign Minister] Mr. Andreatta what could happen 
at the EU meeting in Brussels on 7 and 8 February? Was there 
any talk of a new plan by the three members [of the EU]? 
  [Granic] The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly 
be discussed at the meeting, but no discussion about sanctions 
has been envisaged. Likewise, a presidential communique is 
expected in the Security Council as well as a certain warning to 
Croatia, but no proposal of sanctions. Concerning the EU and 
the discussion they will have, an offer is expected from the EU 
for more efforts to be invested in organizing a meeting between 
the Croatian and Muslim sides, and an offer that representatives 
of the three important EU countries -- Great Britain, France, 
and Germany -- in addition to the United States, will be present 
at the meeting. 
  [Correspondent] However, it must be admitted that it is 
unlikely that any progress in that respect will be made, seeing 
that [Bosnian Foreign Minister] Mr. Ljubijankic's statement was 
made public this morning, and he is still insisting on the 
sanctions. 
  [Granic] You see, Mr. Ljubijankic is usually the one who 
voices the toughest statements of the Bosnian leadership. We 
believe, and we have had confirmation that there will be a 
meeting between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides early next 
week. 
  [Correspondent] Talking about the improvement in relations 
between Muslims and Croats, will you perhaps mention some facts 
from the field. Namely, it is well known that Croats and 
Muslims are still fighting the Serbs together in some parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example in Usora and Posavina. 
  [Granic] The basic aim of Croatia's policy is to stop all 
clashes between Croats and Muslims, without any preconditions, 
and also to establish a permanent peace, and not only peace, but 
also permanent cooperation, because that is in the strategic 
interest of both Croat and Muslim nations. 
  [Correspondent] OK. Thank you for now. Tell us just at the 
end what is awaiting you in Rome tomorrow. 
  [Granic] Tomorrow, I will have a meeting, that is, a 
reception with the Holy Father, and then with the state 
secretary, Cardinal Sodano, and the Vatican foreign minister, 
(Torano). 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you, and I wish you a 
successful day tomorrow. 
  [Granic] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Mario Nobilo, the permanent representative of the 
Republic of Croatia in the United Nations has sent a letter to 
the Security Council [UNSC] chairman. The letter refers to the 
claims presented to the UNSC chairman by UN Secretary-General 
Butrus-Ghali in his letter dated 1 February. We will broadcast 
Nobilo's letter in its entirety. 
  My government does not deny that regular Croatian forces are 
deployed in the border areas between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They have been deployed there in accordance 
with the joint agreement between my government and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government of 12 July 1992. The redeployment 
of those forces would put in serious jeopardy the territorial 
integrity and security of the Republic of Croatia. Considering 
the defense of towns on Croatia's Dalmatian coast, such a change 
in the balance of power in relation to the Serb side would put 
in serious jeopardy the support for the [Croatian] president's 
peace initiative, which is currently being discussed in the 
assembly, aiming at normalizing relations with Sarajevo and 
Belgrade. 
  My government cannot accept the simplified interpretation of 
the joint declaration with Belgrade of 19 January 1994 that the 
declaration is directed against the side that did not sign it 
[the Muslim side]. In fact, my president [Tudjman] proposed to 
the prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan to mediate in the 
negotiations between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides -- as 
the Croatian side proposed in Bonn -- before all sides resume 
their negotiations in Geneva scheduled for 10 February. 
  The Security Council will conclude that the joint statement 
by my government and Belgrade is fully in line with Security 
Council Resolution 871 from 1993, the CSCE final documents from 
Rome, and the EU's modus vivendi action plan of 22 November 
1993, Nobilo said in his letter and added: 
  My government remains concerned for the well-being of the 
Croats, citizens of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are 
besieged by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in Vitez, Kiseljak, 
Usora, Zepce, and elsewhere. We have warned the Security 
Council on several occasions that the ethnic Croats, citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, should be treated in the same way as the 
Muslims who are besieged in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Sarajevo, 
Tuzla, and Bihac. The enclaves of Vitez, Kiseljak, Usora, and 
Zepce should be proclaimed protected areas in line with 
principles of Resolution 824 from 1993. 
  On 2 December 1993 and 24 January 1994, my government called 
on the Security Council to review the problem of large-scale 
violations of international humanitarian law committed by the 
[Bosnian] government forces, against Croats, citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have 
carried out at least eight mass executions of Croats, citizens 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, since July last year. 
  Under such circumstances, when the Security Council has no 
means of protecting Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, my 
government has no moral right to prevent Croat volunteers from 
helping the threatened community of Croats in Bosnia, who 
account for 18 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina population and 
have been forced into 10 percent of the territory. My 
government believes that a military solution to the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the problem of the UN protected areas in 
Croatia, is not acceptable, and in this respect it will continue 
supporting international mediation. We lend special support to 
international mechanisms supervising the number, presence, and 
intentions of the Croatian Army and Croatian volunteers in the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this context, I would like 
to repeat the Croatian president's invitation to the Security 
Council of 16 July 1993 to supervise the Croatian and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina borders. Croatia will immediately give its 
support to such a mechanism. 
  If the Security Council is ready to suggest a better 
solution 
to the crisis in the area, than the one offered by the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia, my government 
is ready to review their proposal. However, my government would 
like to warn the Security Council that any serious change in the 
balance of power in the area would derail the current process. 
In this respect, my government calls on the Security Council to 
give its full and unconditional support to the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, and especially to the 
Owen-Stoltenberg peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to tell 
all interested parties that this is the only possible way to end 
the difficult human tragedy in the area. 
  This is said in the letter by Mario Nobilo, permanent 
representatives of the Republic of Croatia in the United Nations.

  [Text] Knin, Feb 2 (TANJUG) -- President of the Republic of 
Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic and a European Union delegation, 
headed by the new head of the E.U. monitors in the former 
Yugoslavia Konstandinos Yerekostopoulos, on Wednesday called for 
a resumption of the negotiating process for the resolution of 
the conflict between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia. 
Martic said in a talk with the E.U. delegation in Knin, the 
RSK's political centre, that the Serbs in the RSK expected of 
the E.U. monitors only objectively to report on the struggle of 
the Krajina Serbs for bare survival. Martic said the only way 
to assist the warring sides was to enable the RSK and Croatia to 
separate in a civilized manner and to live as two neighbouring 
states. Martic said it was an illusion to insist that the 
Krajina Serbs and Croats live in the same state. Peace must be 
achieved first and a political solution sought only then, Martic 
said. 
  Greek Ambassador Yerekostopoulos, for his part, said the 
talk 
was constructive. He set out that his country, which chairs the 
E.U. for the first six months of this year, would continue 
making efforts for the resumption of the peace process and its 
successful conclusion. 
  The ceasefire between the RSK and Croatia was last weekend 
extended until February 28. The `Christmas' ceasefire agreement 
was reached on December 17 last year. The RSK was three years 
ago proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated territories of 
the then Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession 
from the former Yugoslav Federation and the attempt of its 
authorities to turn Serbs from a constituent people into a 
minority. Although the RSK has been a U.N. Protected Area 
(UNPA) since March 1992, Croatia has carried out aggression on 
it three times since in the hope of establishing its authority 
there.

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec gave a news 
conference in the Mirror Hall of the Cernin Palace in Prague. 
David Stahlavsky was present on behalf of Czech Radio 
Radiozurnal. 
  [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] Josef Zieleniec does not 
believe that the visit by Russian nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic is imminent. Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy was invited by the Association for the 
Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. The minister is 
surprised that Zhirinovskiy, who professed the demise of the 
Czech Republic recently and made improper remarks about our 
country, could have been invited by anyone. He said he found it 
difficult to understand this. 
  The foreign minister responded also to the Austrian effort 
to 
block the American guarantees for the completion of the Temelin 
nuclear power plant [south Bohemia] and to the Vienna 
government's endeavors to stop this construction altogether. 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] Our course of action is not only 
in line with the law, it is also fair to our neighbors. It is 
neither the fault of our nuclear power plant nor of anyone else 
that Austria has to cope with the preelection situation. Of 
course, we keep in touch with the Austrian Government. We try 
to explain to them that these matters create unnecessary tension 
in our neighborly relations and that there is no need for such a 
spectacular approach. It is a pity. I sincerely regret that 
irrational elements emerge in our relations with Austria. [end

  [Excerpts] A news conference by Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec took place today in the Mirror Hall of the Cernin 
Palace. David Stahlavsky reports. 
  [Begin Stahlavsky recording] [passage omitted] Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec mentioned the coming state visit by 
President Vaclav Havel to India and Thailand. The foreign 
minister, together with Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and 
Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Sabela, will accompany the 
president. 
  [Zieleniec] This visit is important for us not only from the 
viewpoint of publicity and symbolism but also from the practical 
viewpoint with regard to developing trade contacts with this 
region. 
  [Stahlavsky] Czech radio asked Zieleniec why President 
Havel, 
on his return from Thailand to Prague, is stopping in Kuwait for 
brief talks. The foreign minister answered: 
  [Zieleniec] Precisely because we want to use this 
opportunity 
to emphasize contacts with Gulf countries. In principle, Kuwait 
is very close to us. We have had intensive contacts since the 
Gulf war, as well as rather good political, and particularly, 
trade contacts, and for us Kuwait is a kind of gateway to this 
region. As foreign minister, I must say that Kuwait's diplomacy 
has always been very helpful in opening up new roads for us into 
that area and, above all, has behaved always in a very friendly 
manner toward us. These are the reasons we will make a stopover 
there. We will also use this opportunity to have talks with the 
highest representatives.

  [Text] According to Karel Kovanda, Czech ambassador to the 
United Nations, who chaired the UN Security Council in January, 
peacekeeping by the United Nations is a question for the distant 
future. 
  Karel Kovanda sees his success and that of Czech foreign 
policy in the Security Council mainly in the fact that the other 
countries view the Czech Republic different from the way they 
did a month ago. Kovanda said that he purposely managed to cut 
down the length of the council's meetings but increased their 
efficiency. 
  He said it is a hard fact of the present world that the 
council has only limited powers that could be further curtailed 
by the decreasing interest of the individual states in 
supporting the council by, for example, being reluctant to offer 
their soldiers for service.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 4 (TANJUG) -- The Serbian Government 
has announced that industrial producers should receive 200 
million new dinars (equivalent to 200 million deutsche marks) in 
the next two weeks for reviving production which has been at a 
stand-still since international economic sanctions were imposed 
on the country nearly two years ago. The step is just one of 
production-boosting measures envisaged under a programme of 
reconstructing the monetary system and healing the economy of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). 
  The programme, launched on Janury 24, has already given 
results, curbing what was a world record inflation and improving 
supply on the market. The businessmen warn, however, that funds 
are low for swinging the production cycle anew. The 200 million 
dinars should be paid out of a fund that should be set up for 
financing the economy, one-half of the money to be put up by the 
banks' hard currency reserves, and the balance by the firms by 
selling stock-piles and buying futures. However, not all of 
Serbia's 199,500 firms can hope for a financial injection, but 
only the manufacturers of easily marketable goods, Serbian 
Industry Minister Momir Pavlicevic has told TANJUG. 
  Yugoslavia is implementing its monetary and economic 
recovery 
programme alone, without any outside assistance and in 
conditions of draconic international sanctions, the worst ever 
imposed on any nation, with its firms banned from the world 
markets for both import and export of commodities and fuel.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has, with 
amazement and bitterness, received reports that the prefecture 
of Le Bas Rhin in France has made a decision to ban the rally 
entitled "24 Hours of Solidarity With the Serbian People," 
scheduled to take place on 6 February. The Ministry's statement 
says that the explanation that "a protest rally against the 
sanctions affecting the Serb community could threaten public 
order due to the risk of counterdemonstrations by associations 
hostile to the Serbs or by those associations whose aims 
contradict those of the rally organizers" is particularly 
surprising. The explanation and other circumstances indicate 
that the competent prefecture could not have made the decision 
without the consent of the French Government. 
  Such measures by the French authorities point to the 
existence of double standards which some countries, and -- 
unfortunately -- France among them, apply to the crisis in the 
former Yugoslavia. The decision to prohibit the Serbs from 
expressing legitimate protest and dissatisfaction against the 
unfounded and genocidal sanctions against the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia and the Serb people gives even more reason for 
concern, bearing in mind that such measures have never been 
taken against anti-Serb demonstrations in France. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, Yugoslav citizens who live and work in France, and 
the entire Yugoslav public, rightly expect that the relevant 
authorities in France will reexamine their decision and enable 
Yugoslav citizens and their French friends to express their 
viewpoint on the sanctions in a peaceful and dignified manner. 
Following the surprising decision by the French authorities the 
Federal Foreign Ministry has ordered the charge d'affaires of 
the Yugoslav Embassy in Paris to lodge a protest note with the 
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statement says.

  [Text] Skopje, Feb 4 (AFP) -- US troops serving with the 
United Nations, many of whom had been drinking, provoked a 
scuffle with police here last month, the newspaper VECER 
reported on Thursday [3 February]. It said the January 28 
incident occurred after a confrontation between an American UN 
soldier and a plainclothes policemen, during which the latter 
was insulted despite having made known his profession. In an 
ensuing brawl involving some 20 UN troops and Skopje police, 
witnessed by several passersby, a shot was fired but caused no 
casualties, according to the paper. It did not say who had been 
responsible for the shot. UN military police then intervened to 
end the scuffle, after meeting resistance from U.S. forces, 
according to Vecer. Macedonian and United Nations officials, 
embarassed by the affair, refused to comment on the report, 
other than to say that the incident was under investigation. 
  An estimated 1,000 UN troops, 315 Americans and 700 from 
Scandinanvian countries, have been deployed in Macedonia to 
prevent the republic from getting caught up in the conflict 
raging elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.

Between the Russian Federation and Republic of Macedonia"] 
  [Text] "The Russian Federation established diplomatic 
relations with the Republic of Macedonia at embassy level on 31 
January," the undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry Viktor 
Gaber states at today's press conference. Gaber announced that 
a high government delegation of the Russian Federation will 
arrive in Macedonia at the beginning of March, which is also 
when the embassy will be opened in Skopje. 
  In its announcement, among the rest, the Macedonian Foreign 
Ministry says: "The Russian Federation was among the first to 
recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional 
name, and sponsored the resolution for the acceptance of our 
country to the United Nations. The support from the Russian 
Federation of Macedonia's request for admission as a full member 
of the CSCE has been continuous, which represents a clear 
confirmation that an independent and sovereign Republic of 
Macedonia is an unsurpassable factor of peace and stability in 
the region, and broader in Europe." 
  As it is known, the Russian Federation recognized the 
Republic of Macedonia in August, 1992, while it is establishing 
diplomatic relations after a year and half. Otherwise, the 
Republic of Macedonia has been recognized under its 
constitutional name by 11 other countries, besides the Russian 
Federation.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia will soon conduct its census. In this framework, it 
is very important to know the exact number of Albanians living 
there. The government there has been, and is, creating obstacles 
regarding the exact number of Albanians. For more details, we 
have invited Bujar Muharremi into our studio: 
  [Muharremi] It is true that a census is expected to be 
conducted in Macedonia during April. Much has been and is still 
being spoken about this problem. There are malicious 
anti-Albanian attitudes, and there are also manipulations. This 
census is especially important for determining the status of the 
Albanian people living in the ancient land of their forefathers. 
This is a census that will show whether the number of Albanians 
living in Macedonia is 40, 20, or 22 percent as declared by the 
Macedonian officials. This census will show whether the 
Albanians are a state-forming people in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia. 
  The Albanian Government has expressed its support for a 
correct census, in the presence of international observers to 
ensure that it is accurate and convincing. This census should 
be conducted in such a way as to ensure the full participation 
of the Albanian people. However, there are several facts that 
account for the obstacles that have been put in place to prevent 
the full participation of Albanians in this census. The top 
Macedonian authorities have decided that the persons who will 
take part in the census should have passports issued during 1993 
or after. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, if a person does not have a passport issued during 
this 
period, he will automatically loose the right to be registered. 
This problem becomes more acute if we consider that hundreds of 
Albanians can come from Western European countries, where they 
are temporarily employed, to be registered. Thus, it will be 
almost impossible for them to take part in this census. 
  Reports from Macedonia confirm that, every day, hundreds and 
hundreds of Albanians gather near the police stations waiting to 
get new passports, so as to be able to register. There are even 
reports, such as those coming from Tetove and Gostivar, that the 
police have used violence against Albanians who want to have new 
passports as soon as possible in the face of delaying actions by 
the Macedonian authorities. 
  Let us point out something else. The enrollment commissions 
are not allowed to compile lists in two languages, in Albanian 
and Macedonian. This creates the conditions for manipulation, 
especially in those cities such as Prelep, Manastiri i Rese, 
etc., in which the population is mixed or where the majority is 
Macedonian. Under these conditions, we can pose the question: 
Do the Macedonian officials favor a correct and convincing 
census of Albanians and will they create the conditions for a 
normal census of the Albanian people? On the contrary, the 
Albanians in Macedonia, as they have ascertained, will boycott 
this census. However, let us wait and see what the future will 
bring regarding this problem.

  [Excerpt] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, was the guest of today's 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio open studio. We will now broadcast 
President Izetbegovic's comments on the next round of the peace 
talks scheduled for 10 February in Geneva, the opening of Tuzla 
Airport, and on the possibilities that UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] and the UNHCR might withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin recording] [Izetbegovic] I am reluctant about going 
on 
the scheduled date. When they asked us whether we agree to the 
resumption of the talks on 10 February, I told David Owen that I 
most probably would not be attending these negotiations. 
Namely, I assessed at the time -- and I still do -- that this 
will be another futile attempt, a waste of time. Of course we 
have to take part. I am not sure whether we all have to go and 
waste time. I told them that Silajdzic would come with a 
delegation, fully authorized to negotiate. I might join in if I 
see there has been some progress and if Silajdzic informs me 
that things are going well. 
  I have many responsibilities here, so does Silajdzic, but 
someone has to stay; I believe it is me. Silajdzic is younger, 
so he can keep up with the pace. The pace at the negotiations 
is terrible, indescribable. Sometimes one works for 13 to 15 
hours without a break -- working, negotiating, haggling, and so 
on. The negotiations so far have shown that there has been very 
little progress. I reckon that no miracle will happen on 10 
February, but on the other hand that is not ruled out. 
  Now there is this four-part initiative from America, 
England, 
France, and Germany. It is expected that they could propose 
something new which would make a breakthrough at the 
negotiations possible. If that happens -- the details of the 
initiative have not yet been revealed -- I might decide to go, 
and the complete delegation will go to try to solve [word 
indistinct]. [passage omitted]

the reopening of the airport at Tuzla in northeast Bosnia 
provided they can control all the traffic going through, a 
Yugoslav military official was quoted as saying Thursday [3 
February]. Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Ljubodrag 
Stojadinovic was quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA. 
The United Nations is considering authorising air strikes 
against besieging Serb forces to obtain the reopening of Tuzla, 
which is considered an essential channel for humanitarian aid.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 3 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb 
Republic (S.R.) on Thursday said it accepted the U.N.-proclaimed 
"Olympic truce" during the Winter Olympic Games held in the 
Norwegian town of Lillehammer February 13-19, adding that it 
would simultaneously stage its own "mini winter Olympics." The 
"mini winter Olympics" will be held on Serb-controlled Mount 
Jahorina near Sarajevo, as part of a ceremony marking the tenth 
anniversary of the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, the capital of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, said 
Ljubomir Zukovic, the S.R. minister of education, culture and 
sports and president of the S.R. National Olympic Committee. 
  Zukovic told a press conference in Belgrade that 
International Olympic Committee (IOC) Chairman Juan Antonio 
Samaranch had been asked to attend the games. "We should like 
him to pay us a visit and see for himself that we are not opting 
for war, but for restoring peace and multilateral cooperation," 
he added. To a question about what would happen if the Bosnian 
Muslims turned up with their own team to participate in the 
games, Zukovic answered that "if they did, it would mean they 
recognize us. In that case, we would be pleased to accept their 
presence. We do not want to compete with guns, but to separate 
our territories and try our strength at such contests." 
  "Mini winter Olympics" will comprise four events -- slalom, 
giant slalom, cross country and biathlon. 
  Gruja Bjekovic, the secretary-general of the S.R. National 
Olympic Committee, said the Bosnian Serbs fully accepted the 
U.N. resolution proclaiming the "Olympic truce," although they 
could not vouch for the Moslem side to do the same. He added, 
however, that they had taken all precaution to provide maximum 
safety on Mt. Jahorina. Invitations had been sent to all 
countries which participated in the 1984 Winter Olympics in 
Sarajevo. 
  Bjekovic said that about 80 per cent of Olympic facilities 
was situated in the S.R. territory, and competitions would be 
held on the same pistes used by the world's best skiers ten 
years ago. 
  Djordje Perisic, secretary-general of the Yugoslav Olympic 
Committee (JOK), said his organisation fully supported the games 
on Mt. Jahorina adding that the Yugoslav team would take part in 
the games. The JOK would, by using its international 
connections, do everything in its power to bring to Mt. Jahorina 
as many participants from abroad as possible, Perisic said.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT 4 February within its 
regular 17-minute newscast carries the following reports on the 
situation in Sarajevo. According to a communique from the 
Information Service of the 1st Corps of the Army of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina read by an announcer, "a calm morning in 
the Sarajevo region was interrupted by enemy artillery shells 
that ended their lethal flight in the region of Dobrinja. The 
aggressor fired them from the region of Vranjes. They were 82-mm 
mortar bombs. There were three bombs and Sarajevo has thereby 
added one more massacre to its list. The victims of this one 
are innocent civilians." 
  Jasna Niksic then reports live from Dobrinja that "so far 
seven people have been killed and 17 injured, of whom four are 
extremely seriously wounded and have been taken to the City 
Hospital. This is the balance of the morning Chetnik shelling 
in the Sarajevo Dobrinja district. Namely, the morning was 
extremely calm, but this calm was interrupted by two Chetnik 
shells that suddenly fell on Dobrinja One as civilians gathered 
to divide humanitarian aid. This is all the information we have 
now. We shall report with more details in our next newscasts."

  [Text] Zvornik, Feb 3 (TANJUG) -- Moslems are exercising 
terror over Serbian and Croatian civilians in Tarcin, a locality 
in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, and plan to use them as a human 
shield in the offensive prepared against local Croat armed 
formations, Bosnian Serb military sources learnt from Bosnian 
Croat forces. The sources affirmed on Thursday [3 February] 
that many Serbs and Croats are incarcerated in Tarcin, while the 
rest have been moved to Zabrdje and Kiseljak, near Sarajevo, 
where they are forced to perform fortifications for the needs of 
Moslem armed forces. 
  According to the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), Moslems 
forces are planning in that region to use Serbian and Croatian 
prisoners as a human shield when they try to recapture from 
Bosnian Croats certain positions. Bosnian Serb military sources 
affirmed also that about one hundred Serbian families remaining 
in Zavidovici, a locality under Moslem control in central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, are being terrorized and in danger of being 
massacred, if international especially humanitarian 
organizations do not come to their rescue in the shortest 
possible time. The sources, citing refugees who managed to 
escape, stress that the Serbian population in Zavidovici is 
constantly threatened by blackmail and brutal torture, while all 
the men even the ill are forcibly engaged by Moslem military and 
civilian authorities. 
  Serbs in Zavidovici, according to eye witness accounts, have 
been robbed of all valuable property, and Moslem authorities are 
excluding them from the distribution of international 
humanitarian aid.

  [Text] On the majority of the battlefields in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina provocative and offensive activities of the 
Muslim units toward the Serbian side have continued. From the 
direction of Kalesija two 120-mm projectiles filled with a 
chlorine-based chemical agent were fired at the Zelina region. 
The Serbian side has officially notified the command of the UN 
peace troops for former Bosnia-Herzegovina about this.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 3 (TANJUG) -- The commander of the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, Gen. 
Jean Cot has called on the Bosnian Croats to stop continued 
shelling of the Muslim section of Mostar, a city in southwestern 
part of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. An UNPROFOR statement, a copy of which was 
submitted to TANJUG on Thursday, said the French general 
addressed such a demand to the commander of the Bosnian Croat 
army (HVO), Gen. Ante Roso, during his visit to Mostar earlier 
this week. Cot said no provocations by the local Muslim forces 
'could justify the kind of retaliation endured by the population 
of Mostar (Muslim-controlled) east.' 
  The Bosnian Muslims and Croats, the erstwhile allies against 
the Serbs, have been waging merciless battles since the spring 
of 1993 for control over territories with a mixed Muslim-Croat 
population. According to Spanish U.N. troops' reports, Bosnian 
Croats in January fired more than 1,400 shells on the Muslim 
section of east Mostar, while Muslims fired no more than 75 
shells on the Croat-held west Mostar.

<F P=106> [Report by the Information Service of the 4th Corps of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 
  [Text] The aggressor's formations of the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] and the Croatian Army have virtually not stopped 
artillery attacks in the zone covered by the 4th Corps in the 
last 24 hours. Ustasha fighters were attacking virtually all 
defense regions and the enemy fired dozens of projectiles from 
(?different) artillery pieces. Unlike their [word indistinct] 
practice so far, the ustashas especially intensified their 
artillery activities during [word indistinct] morning. In the 
region of Potocari in the north of the Mostar commune, over 50 
mortar bombs of various calibers have been fired. Other regions 
in the north of the Mostar Commune, such as (Plice) and (Racici) 
were exposed to increased shelling, and the ustashas shot at the 
lines of separation with [word indistinct]. There was also no 
peace in the central parts of Mostar, so that about 30 
projectiles, mostly mortar bombs of the largest caliber, have 
been launched on the district of (Dalic) alone in the last 24 
hours. However, other Mostar districts have not been spared, 
because it has been registered that, late last night, the 
Ustashas fired several rockets at the village of (Jelice) from a 
multiple rocket launcher, and shells and mortar bombs were fired 
at all districts in the region of Pracevac. At the separation 
line, on the right bank of the Neretva River, along with 
increased fire from infantry weapons, 25 mortar bombs were also 
fired. Despite all the assaults by the enemy (?Ustasha) 
formations, all lines of separation in the zone covered by the 
4th Corps have remained unchanged and stable.

  [Text] The Velika Kladusa War Presidency today issued an 
appeal to its citizens, asking [word indistinct] residents and 
members of [Fikret Abdic's] paramilitary formations in 
particular to be sensible and to place themselves under the 
command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Velika Kladusa has 
been experiencing unprecedented terror and (?suffering) under 
the veil of [word indistinct] quasi democracy for (?six) months, 
the appeal states. The peace that was established on 12 January 
has only partially helped us to alleviate the consequences of 
Abdic's insane idea. 
  We are most concerned by the fact that our town, your town, 
is now full of foreigners, who are pushing arms into people's 
hands, people who, for their own aims, have caused a fratricidal 
war. The arms that they have pushed into people's hands will 
always be an obstacle to peace and therefore we should listen to 
reason. 
  The appeal further states that Velika Kladusa has been 
burdened by about 2,000 orphans since 3 October last year, 
children whose fathers have been killed. They were forced into 
a struggle for some kind of a quasi state. There are many more 
children in this region who are without fathers. This should be 
a warning to listen to reason and find a peaceful settlement of 
the crisis, the appeal of the Velika Kladusa War Presidency 
states, asking its citizens, particularly members of the 
paramilitary formations, to be sensible and place themselves 
under the command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10 
February of this year.

  [Text] Rome, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The number of people threatened 
by famine in Bosnia is rising because of blocked food convoys, 
with only half available supplies getting through, the World 
Food Programme (WFP) warned here Thursday [3 February]. The 
population of central Bosnia is most at risk following delivery 
of only 28 percent of its food needs in December, added the UN 
food relief organisation, which is based here. Airdrops of food 
will be more than trebled to 3,600 tonnes a month to prevent a 
threatened spring shortage caused by the fact that only 65 
percent of needed supplies are in place, the WFP said. 
  Throughout Bosnia, only half the available food aid reaches 
its final destination, the WFP added. Between 20 percent and 30 
percent of children in the Moslem enclave of Maglaj, central 
Bosnia, are suffering from malnutrition, because of a Serb 
blockade of humanitarian relief, it said. Three quarters of the 
food aid required was parachuted in during November and 
December, but it was unknown how much actually reached the 
population, the WFP said.

according to which issues related to the deployment of U.S. 
missiles on Bulgaria territory were discussed during the visit 
to Bulgaria by the NATO delegation led by Gerhard von Moltke, 
assistant to the NATO secretary general on political issues. 
  We did not discuss, even for a moment, the deployment of any 
heavy weapons, including missiles, on Bulgarian territory, Mr. 
Noev said categorically. He accused certain daily newspapers of 
literally lying. Mr. Noev again confirmed that the meetings 
with the NATO delegation were devoted to specific issues 
regarding Bulgaria joining the Partnership for Peace plan.

Thorvald Stoltenberg from Sofia on 4 January, including recorded 
statement by Owen in response to a correspondent's question -- 
in English fading into Bulgarian translation] 
  [Text] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of 
the international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, 
ended their visit to Bulgaria this morning. 
  In a brief statement prior to their departure, Lord Owen 
stressed that it is too early to evaluate the results of their 
tour before they complete their meetings in Tirana and Rome. 
Lord Owen said that it was his general impression that the 
voices of the neighbors of the former Yugoslavia, who are 
suffering serious losses from the Yugoslav embargo, should be 
heard more loudly and clearly. 
  Here is what Lord Owen said when asked by a correspondent 
whether he would support the cancellation of the Yugoslav 
sanctions: 
  [Owen] No, I do not favor lifting the sanctions. At this 
stage, such a step would be premature. Anyway, it is not my job 
to lift them; it is a matter for the UN Security Council. 
However, the sanctions were imposed for a specific purpose, and 
in the final analysis they should serve to achieve this aim. If 
it becomes clear that there is no way that the sanctions will 
bring about a settlement, then indeed it will be necessary to 
raise the question of lifting them.

Yugoslav crisis, have arrived in Sofia on their tour of former 
Yugoslavia's neighboring countries. 
  They had talks with Stanislav Daskalov, minister of foreign 
affairs, while their meeting with President Zhelev is still in 
progress. 
  After the meeting with Daskalov, Lord Owen pointed out, in 
reply to a journalist's question, that he has never abandoned 
the original plan to solve the Balkan conflict, and that the 
plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into three parts on the basis 
of ethnic principles has recently emerged as the only possible 
alternative for a peaceful solution of the problems.

  [Text] An Ukrainian cargo ship refused to stop at Ruse 
port, as we have just learned from our local correspondent 
Natasha Dimitrova. 
  The ship is called Khabarovsk and is transporting six barges 
of iron ore for the port of Linz. 
  Around 2300 local time (2100 GMT] on 1 February, the 
vessel's 
captain, in a telephone conversation, refused to obey the order 
of the officials on duty from the Bulgarian State Navigation 
Inspectorate to stop and await the embargo investigation. 
  According to the latest instructions, such an investigation 
should take place during the day. The captain explained that he 
was in a hurry for the obligatory investigation that was 
awaiting him in Calafat. 
  The investigation teams in Calafat, where the ship is 
expected to arrive tomorrow morning, were briefed on the case.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Boyka Bashlieva: "The SDS Is Again Pretending </F>
That It Is Toppling Berov"] 
  [Text] For the fifth time since Berov's government was 
elected, the parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS], instructed by the SDS National Coordinating 
Council, has decided to bring down the government through a 
no-confidence vote. Nevertheless, despite the fact that this was 
reported on the front pages of all the newspapers, it failed to 
impress anyone and the chances of success are very close to zero. 
  The most frequent explanation of the no-confidence vote 
proposal, which could be heard last week in political circles, 
was that this is an attempt to delay the adoption of the 1994 
budget. Two sessions will certainly be wasted, which still does 
not mean that the budget debate could not start as soon as this 
week. 
  Some of the SDS deputies did not tire of repeating that the 
purpose of the proposal was to topple the cabinet and bring 
forward the elections. However, when asked about the real 
reason, another section of deputies only shrug their shoulders 
and develop a great interest in their shoelaces. This is so 
because, if anyone really wanted to topple Berov, the SDS 
leadership would have proposed the no-confidence vote after 
rather than prior to adopting the budget. Perhaps then the 
chances would not have been so close to zero as they are now. 
  Unlike previous reasons that prompted no-confidence votes, 
such as the "beating" of Stefan Savov, the sidewalk taxes, and 
other such lunacies, this time things are more serious. 
Burgeoning crime and the police shoot-out could easily generate 
enough votes against the government. However, this will not 
happen when the country is without a budget. Even a child could 
understand the economic consequences of such a situation. 
  If we assume that this is, nevertheless, unclear to some SDS 
deputies (which is highly questionable), then we would have to 
believe the thesis that they repeat ad nauseam, namely, that the 
government, only the government, and no one but the government 
is responsible for the crime rate, and if the government is 
brought down and new elections emerge on the horizon, the sticks 
and the firearms on our streets will disappear, and the same 
will happen to the vicious fight between economic groups and to 
corruption. In other words, life will become as pretty as a 
picture. 
  This is more than absurd. There is no more fertile soil for 
the crime, corruption, and anarchy than the absence of laws, a 
legislating institution, and an executive institution 
responsible for implementing the laws. It is a completely 
different question as to how the cabinet and parliament cope 
with their obligations. 
  In addition, if the Socialists boycott the voting, something 
that was mentioned over the weekend, the no-confidence motion 
will not gain the 121 votes required by the Constitution, and 
the thesis that "by supporting the government the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party is supporting crime," will vanish into thin air. 
  Thus, regardless of which direction the no-confidence vote 
is 
viewed, it always looks like total lunacy.

<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Mitova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, 31 January -- Within the next few days, the 
government will decide what to do with the 500 metric tons of 
uranium concentrate that is stockpiled in two stores in the 
Rhodopes. The general view is that the material should leave 
the country in the very near future. 
  According to one of the proposals to unload the material, 
the 
Russian firm of Tekhnosnabeksport, acting as an agent, would 
acquire the concentrate at $17 per kilogram, and then sell fuel 
rods filled with the uranium to the Kozloduy Nuclear Power 
Station for $27.20 each. The price reportedly includes the cost 
of shipping, safeguarding, and storing the rods. 
  In the view of experts specializing in this market, which is 
monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the 
uranium concentrate will be sold for $26.59 per kilogram. 
  On the free market the prices are lower, ranging from $18.44 
to $19.35. 
  The cost of producing uranium in Bulgaria ranges from $202 
to 
$73, and is on average 4.5 times higher that free market prices. 
  Before the uranium industry was shut down, Bulgaria produced 
about 250 tons of concentrate per year, which satisfied 35 
percent of its own needs. These 250 tons can be used to 
generate 8.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. 
  There are two possibilities for supplying the Kozloduy 
Nuclear Power Station with nuclear fuel. The first is to buy 
uranium rods filled with Russian fuel, and the second is to fill 
the rods with Bulgarian material. 
  Experts claim that then a kilowatt-hour of electric power 
would be 166 times more expensive. 
  The Council of Ministers will designate the organizations 
that will engage in putting the uranium concentrate onto the 
international market. One of the possibilities is the state 
company Rudmetal, another is the private Intersteel company, 
which belongs to Multigroup.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Visiting French Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard on Thursday [3 February] pressed 
France's call to mount air strikes against Serb forces to open 
up Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the same time, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said 
during a trip to Athens that the facility must be opened within 
a month. 
  Leotard briefed Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Mikhail Kolesnikov on the 
idea of "air strikes at close intervals" so humanitarian aid 
could be brought in to suffering civilians, but the Russians 
remained "very cautious," Leotard told a news conference. 
  However Leotard added that he believed despite "differences 
in analysing the situation and on what action to take... we are 
not very far apart." [passage omitted] 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) last month 
reaffirmed the principle of using air strikes to reopen the 
airport, if necessary. Since then, Russia, a traditional ally 
of the Serbs, has come out against the idea. 
  France thinks "there must be air cover and that if air raids 
are ever carried out, they must be for protection, not 
aggression," the defense minister said, but "The Russians think 
such action could cause a slide into war." 
  The Russians, who "undoubtedly" have influence over the 
Serbs, "are very cautious at the moment," he added, but "talks 
must be continued with them." 
  Leotard is on a three-day official visit to Russia. 
  Meanwhile Juppe, on a visit to Athens, set a deadline of 
about "a month" to reopen Tuzla airport. 
  During an official 24-hour visit, he said that both that 
operation and NATO's decision to relieve Canadian UN 
peacekeepers in the eastern town of Srebrenica, where Serb 
forces are preventing them from leaving, must "be implemented as 
quickly as possible." 
  He said he did not want to name a date because "this would 
sound like an ultimatum" but that it should be "on the order of 
a month," adding, "things should move quickly now." 
  Juppe added, "that's what we're going to try to do Monday" 
during a meeting of European Community foreign ministers in 
Brussels. 
  "If within a month or two," he added, "things have not moved 
on the diplomatic level, we must really draw conclusions." 
  Juppe said the belligerents should be given "one last chance 
to (reach) a political settlement" which could only be based on 
a peace plan proposed by the European Community, bringing in 
more directly the United States and Russia. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said he "agreed 
entirely" with the idea of carrying out air strikes, but only to 
bring in aid. 
  Earlier, international peace negotiators Lord Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg during a visit to Bucharest expressed "full 
support" for air strikes to protect UN peacekeepers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] A while ago we received from the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry a Slovak Government memorandum on our country joining 
the Partnership for Peace program. 
  The memorandum points out that the NATO summit brought 
closer 
the prospects of Slovakia's full incorporation into a developed 
Europe, including the economic, political, and security aspects 
thereof. The summit has offered further possibilities of 
involvement in setting up new models of cooperation within 
Europe by supporting the development of the European security 
and defense (?identity). 
  The Slovak Republic is aware that the development of 
security 
mechanisms is a process. These mechanisms will guarantee 
stability on the continent. This has been reflected in the 
proposals and programs put forward by the Brussels summit. The 
Slovak Republic will continue to pursue its initiatives aimed at 
obtaining full NATO membership, as well as the security 
guarantees that are needed for successful completion of the 
economic transformation and the strengthening of democracy, says 
the Slovak Government's memorandum about [Slovakia] joining the 
Partnership for Peace program.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Slovak parliament was scheduled to 
discuss the so-called draft law on large-scale privatization 
today. However, the debate did not happen. More from our 
colleague, editor of the weekly PRACE Renata Havranova. 
  [Havranova] Today was a tense, chaotic, and at times very 
undignified day for the deputies of the Slovak parliament. 
After a three-hour long delay, the session started with an 
argument about who was entitled to chair it. The deputies voted 
to take away the right of chairing the session from Ivan 
Gasparovic [chairman of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic] for failing to keep time and authorized Ludovit Cernak 
[chairman of the Slovak National Party and deputy chairman of 
parliament] to do so. Gasparovic protested that only he, as 
chairman of parliament, had the right to call and chair the 
session. He therefore announced a recess. 
  Prime Minister Meciar, who wanted to withdraw the bill on 
large-scale privatization but failed, demonstratively left the 
chamber [declaring] that he did not accept the chairmanship of 
Ludovit Cernak. 
  Since morning, the game in parliament was all about nerves 
and time. The coalition, in an attempt to equalize the voting 
score of opposition, is alleged to have brought by police 
helicopter Deputy [Peter] Brnak [Slovak National Party (SNS)] 
from medical treatment and Augustin Marian Huska [Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], who is in serious medical 
condition, straight from the hospital. Even so, they did not 
match the opposition votes. 
  In the meantime, the cross-party parliamentary standing 
committee decided to continue the debate. Soon after the 
opening, deputy [Tibor] Cabaj from the HZDS announced that the 
coalition clubs of deputies considered the withdrawal of Ivan 
Gasparovic's right to chair the debate to be anticonstitutional 
and therefore proposed that the matter be decided by the 
Constitutional Court. Until its decision, the HZDS deputies and 
some of SNS deputies would not be taking part in parliamentary 
meetings. Deputies of both parliamentary clubs then left the 
chamber. 
  The remaining deputies took strong exception to such 
procedure. They said that it was an intentional attempt to avoid 
a debate on such a very important law as was the law on 
large-scale privatization. 
  For Slovakia, it was tragic behavior. According to the 
opposition deputies, the principle of parliamentarism was put in 
doubt, and that was particularly dangerous for Slovakia in the 
present political situation. The majority of the cross-party 
standing committee that met after this situation had arisen, 
agreed to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow morning.

  [Text] [Announcer] At a brief news conference, we asked 
Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and Slovak prime minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Prime 
minister, what will your movement propose to other parliamentary 
parties at the meeting of the cross-party standing committee 
[gremium] tomorrow [4 February, following today's parliamentary 
crisis]? 
  [Meciar] We will address the basics. The basis of the 
problem 
is the fact that the parliament chairman was stripped of his 
rights in an unconstitutional way [deputies voted that the 
deputy chairman should chair the session today]. The essence of 
the problem lies in the fact that this parliament has been 
deliberately led into crisis for a long time now. They try to 
change election results so that the structure of parliament 
changes. That is immoral and politically wrong. There cannot 
be two moral codes in parliament. One has to dig even deeper 
into the efficiency of this political system that has emerged in 
parliament. For example, when voting, let us say in the 
cross-party standing committee, everyone stands for one 
political entity. Thus, the antigovernment coalition has the 
majority. In reality, though, with the number of votes, it 
represents a minority. They [the antigovernment coalition] 
cannot assume a majority stance on some issues. 
  We have to make it clear what the position of Ludovit 
Cernak, 
the National Council's [parliament] deputy chairman is. He 
became deputy chairman on the basis of the coalition agreement, 
which he later trampled on. Does he have any moral or political 
right to be a deputy chairman of the National Council? This 
question has to be resolved as well. 
  It is not our intention to create a crisis at any cost in 
the 
way the opposition is trying to do. The whole opposition is 
trying to do so, including Peter Weiss [chairman of the Party of 
the Democratic Left]. Our aim is to find a model for 
cooperation. We will either cooperate or let us confess to 
citizens that we are not able to do so. Let them then choose 
from among us with whom they want to cooperate. This situation 
has been coming to a head for a long time now, several months 
now. I still do not consider this to be a critical moment. I 
consider it to be an element of the first conflict, which will 
still be resolved. However, if essential, deeper, systemic 
changes are not adopted, there is a danger that the crisis will 
recur. It might change into a permanent parliamentary crisis. 
That, already, is a very serious matter. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] At the moment, there is in fact 
a stalemate in parliament--75 for and 75 against. Do you think 
the National Council will be able to continue discussing the 
government bill [on large-scale privatization] tomorrow? 
  [Meciar] It is not appropriate that I should take a stance 
on 
parliamentary matters from my position as a Cabinet member. I 
would rather speak on behalf of the HZDS movement. There is no 
stalemate [in parliament]; the balance is still in our 
[government coalition's] favor. We do not do this out of fear. 
We have the majority in parliament, even the majority needed to 
adopt necessary laws, as the law on large-scale privatization is. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] One lady deputy allegedly left 
the HZDS yesterday? 
  [Meciar] I do not know anything about that. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did you change your opinion on 
early elections after what happened today? 
  [Meciar] My opinion remains the same. First, those who left 
their [deputies'] clubs--namely, nine deputies from the HZDS, 
several SNS deputies who left for the so-called national 
democratic [club]--should leave their seats in parliament. The 
citizens voted for particular parties. The election system is 
based on parties. 
  Therefore, it will be one of our duties to initiate a 
change, 
both through a bill on internal affairs and by asking the 
citizens to petition and support the referendum, which would 
decide on this matter. If the referendum fails, the next option 
for a solution, in my opinion, would be early parliamentary 
elections. However, I still prefer other options--i.e., I prefer 
tackling the internal situations in deputies' clubs in harmony 
with the election law and not in the spirit of two moral codes, 
two sets of rules, two approaches regardless of the law. That 
would be dishonest. [end recording]

  [Text] As we have already informed you, the 26th session of 
the National Council was suspended today following the walkout 
of the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] deputies and 
some SNS [Slovak National Party] deputies. Subsequently, the 
opposition deputies were unable to start discussing their 
version of the large-scale privatization law. The parliament 
session might continue on 4 February, following a consultative 
meeting of the parliamentary parties' officials. It is still 
possible that the deputies of the ruling coalition will change 
their decision about not attending the parliament's 
deliberations until a decision is reached by the Constitutional 
Court on whether it was legal to deprive parliament Chairman 
Ivan Gasparovic of the chairmanship of today's session. 
  As HZDS chairman, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar told TA SR 
[Press Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Constitution 
clearly defines the powers of the chairman of the National 
Council. Therefore, Meciar considers the vote on whether 
Gasparovic should chair the session to be an informal vote of 
no-confidence in Ivan Gasparovic and an effort to question his 
honor. 
  According to Vladimir Meciar, the initiative of the HZDS 
deputies and some SNS deputies to turn to the Constitutional 
Court is correct. He stressed that the issue was not the 
chairmanship of the session; it was the issue of respecting 
constitutional principles.

  [Text] Milan Cic, chairman of the Slovak Constitutional 
Court, spoke to the Press Agency of the Slovak Republic about 
his stand on today's events in parliament. He said that his 
post as chairman of the Constitutional Court does not give him 
the right to interpret the Constitution on his own. However, he 
perceives the entire problem as predominantly a political 
conflict. Therefore, it should be tackled using political means 
and forms--first at a session of the cross-party standing 
committee chaired by the chairman, at meetings of deputies' 
clubs, through the cooperation of the clubs chairmen, at the 
level of committees and political bodies--and only if this fails 
should the issue be presented to a plenary session [of 
parliament] or, if need be, to the Constitutional Court. 
  Milan Cic does not perceive the current situation in 
parliament as a parliamentary crisis or even a constitutional 
crisis. It is a misunderstanding that can be overcome provided 
there is goodwill, the chairman of the Constitutional Court 
stressed.

  [Text] The beginning of today's deliberations of the 26th 
session of the National Council scheduled for 0900 hours was 
postponed. First deputy chairman Peter Weiss told the deputies 
who were present that parliament chairman Ivan Gasparovic had 
left the parliament building together with Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar immediately after the unsuccessful talks held by 
the representatives of parliamentary parties this morning. 
  According to TA SR [Slovak news agency], this meeting had in 
effect ended after the prime minister refused to join the talks 
because Milan Knazko, chairman of the Alliance of Democrats, was 
present at the meeting. Vladimir Meciar does not recognize 
Milan Knazko as an elected parliamentary representative. 
Because the representatives of parliamentary parties refused to 
accept Meciar's request that Milan Knazko should leave the 
meeting, Vladimir Meciar said, according to parliament deputy 
chairman Ludovit Cernak, that the meeting was not legitimate and 
was anticonstitutional. Immediately after that, Vladimir Meciar 
left the room.

and date not given: "The Prime Minister About Relations with the 
President" -- reprinted from an undated issue of EXTRA SLOVENSKO 
weekly in the "Who, What, Where -- Said, Wrote" column] 
  [Text] On the whole, I can say that we, with Mr. President 
[Michal Kovac], have working relations, and I do not believe 
that we have different political objectives. I am afraid that 
the president is not the only person responsible for the tense 
atmosphere. Do you want an example? We used to share a box in 
the Slovak National Theater and it did not bother anyone. 
Suddenly, however, some people came from the Chancellery of the 
President of the Slovak Republic maintaining that the prime 
minister and the parliament chairman [Ivan Gasparovic] have no 
place in the box. (By the way, I used it only on the occasion of 
the funeral of Roman Zelenay because I simply do not have time 
for such perfunctory actions). Eventually, they came up with 
the idea that the box would have three doors. It was not 
technically feasible. Thus, they arrived at the idea that the 
president must have a higher chair. I replied with a 
recommendation that they do not raise the president's chair, but 
rather saw off the legs of the chairs for Gasparovic and 
myself.... The staff of the Chancellery of the President 
determines the flow and content of information reaching his 
person. The later the president realizes this, the worse for 
him. A more fortunate solution for the president would be the 
employment of nonpartisan, neutral experts. I will not give any 
details regarding the reason for the current state of the 
president-prime-ministerial relations at this time, although 
they are obvious not only to me, but also to the president and 
the parliament chairman. We are in complete agreement with Mr. 
Gasparovic.

<F P=106> [Article by "mh": "Vladimir Meciar: The Movement for a </F>
Democratic Slovakia Knows Who Its Coalition Partner Is"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--During yesterday's coalition talks, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak 
National Party [SNS] agreed to seek a compromise solution with 
regard to the amendment to the law on large-scale privatization. 
At a joint meeting with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] 
Club of Deputies, the coalition partners want to accommodate SDL 
demands and thus achieve the submission of a single draft 
amendment. As Prime Minister Meciar noted, the only issue of 
dispute between the government-sponsored draft and the SDL 
deputies' draft is the combining of government posts with 
positions in the National Property Fund (FNM). Asked when the 
talks with the SDL Club of Deputies would be held, Vladimir 
Meciar replied: "Who knows? They may be under way already." As 
SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told SME shortly after the conclusion 
of the coalition talks, so far he had not received any official 
offer for talks with the coalition on the amendment to the law 
on large-scale privatization. As for the SDL's own draft, they 
stick to their positions. Weiss said that it was unacceptable 
and unconstitutional to combine government posts with FNM posts 
and that he did not see any possibility of reaching an agreement 
on this point. 
  At their talks yesterday, the coalition representatives 
returned to the nonacceptance of the so-called law on 
[bilingual] signposts [by Slovak Parliament on 28 January]. 
According to Vladimir Meciar, the government can submit it 
again to parliament for another discussion in six months at the 
earliest. 
  As Vladimir Meciar reported further, the coalition partners 
dealt with the existence or nonexistence of the so-called SNS 
National Democratic Club [of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak] in the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic. According to the HZDS 
chairman's words, the HZDS upholds the opinion that it signed 
the coalition agreement with the SNS Central Council, which is 
the partner for the HZDS. This partner announced that there 
exists only one SNS Club of Deputies, so the HZDS has no doubt 
as to who its coalition partner is. 
  SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak told SME in this context that, 
during the coalition talks, he had advised Vladimir Meciar to 
read carefully what he signs. According to Cernak, the 
coalition agreement was signed by two legal entities--the HZDS 
and the SNS. Ludovit Cernak confirmed that the existence of the 
SNS National Democratic Club had been a subject of the coalition 
talks. The participants did not arrive at a final stand, 
however, because, according to Ludovit Cernak, a meeting of 
coalition partners is not a forum that is entitled to assess the 
founding of the SNS National Democratic Club. As he went on to 
say, in this context, the promise could be heard from the other 
participants that, if members of the SNS National Democratic 
Club gave up their SNS membership, the establishment of the SNS 
National Democratic Club would be respected. The SNS chairman 
rejected this offer. He said that he would continue to 
participate in the coalition talks in line with the decision of 
the SNS Central Council.

  [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 3 February publish 
TA SR and correspondents' reports, ranging from 300 to 500 
words, on statements made by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar at a 
rally of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] supporters in 
Bratislava's Park of Culture and Repose on 2 February. 
  Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 3 February on page 13 
carries a 500-word Bohumil Olach report entitled "Will There Be 
a Referendum Against Knazko's Followers?" The report includes 
the following passage: "In the first round of replies to 
questions from the audience, the prime minister said that he 
will not hold talks on collective rights for the Hungarian 
minority because, in Cyprus, too, it once started with 
collective rights and ultimately led to a war between Turkey and 
Greece. He who feels bad here is absolutely free to leave, he 
said, for which he earned great applause. He also touched on 
the differences of views between the government and the 
president on some issues. He said, for example, that it is not 
good when the president and the government both push for their 
own version of the law on names and surnames. The opposition 
operates with the cliche that everything will be better without 
Meciar, he continued. The president has called for the 
formation of a multicolor government, but the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] is ready to talk [about joining the 
government coalition] only when there will be early elections. 
The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the Alliance of 
Democrats [AD] only want an agreement without Meciar. "And the 
president said that they must be accommodated," the prime 
minister added. 
  "The president was awarded with `Phooey!' and the chanting 
of 
`Shame!' from a group of enraged women in the left corner of the 
audience in front of the stage. No one made an attempt to 
silence them." 
  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 3 February on page 3 carries 
a 
500-word Martin Krno report entitled "Our Mr. Meciar." The 
PRAVDA correspondent observes that, in addition to the 
"traditional" criticism of "the Hungarians, the Czechs, the 
correspondents, the head of state, and the opposition," the 
participants in the rally "heard also something new from the 
prime minister's mouth. According to the prime minister, the 
ruling movement is increasingly consolidated. If parliament 
does not approve a law under which all `disobedient' deputies 
must surrender their seats, a referendum will decide on this 
issue. Three large electoral blocs are taking shape, the prime 
minister said: 1. The SDL, Social Democrats, and farmers; 2. The 
KDH, Conservative Democratic Party, and Knazko's followers; and 
3. The HZDS, together with the anti-Cernak part of the Slovak 
National Party, Klepac's Christian Social Union (frenetic 
applause), and, possibly, the Greens. It goes without saying 
that this last bloc will be victorious again." 
  Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 3 February on page 2 
carries a 300-word TA SR report entitled "Vladimir Meciar: 
Devaluation Is Not Being Prepared." According to the report, 
Meciar told the meeting of 2,000 Bratislava residents that "no 
devaluation is being prepared, fares will not go up, and the 
government will do everything within its power to accelerate the 
sale of [community-owned] apartments into citizens' private 
ownership." He reportedly also "rejected speculations that the 
government might tender its resignation and denied reports that 
he is divorcing his wife."

<F P=106> [Statement by Ivan Vaclavik, press spokesman for the Slovak </F>
Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works: "Split 
Time for the RFE"] 
  [Text] The exhausting 11-hour talks, from 0900 to 2100 [as 
published], only confirmed that Radio Free Europe's [RFE] 
broadcasting in Slovakia is a complex technical and legal issue. 
Even RFE Deputy Director Gary Thatcher agreed when Vladimir 
Zeman, the director general of the Communications Section at the 
Slovak Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works, 
emphasized that not once during the several-hour talks was it 
mentioned that it is a political matter. The participants in 
the talks between the RFE and Slovak Telecommunications 
expressed it even in the accord memorandum, and both interested 
parties can now peacefully concentrate on the technical side of 
RFE broadcasting in Slovakia. 
<H5>  The Frequencies Situation Is Becoming Clear </H5>
  It should be noted that the Geneva plan originally assigned 
the 1287 kHz frequency on medium-wave to transmitters in the 
Czech Republic, while the 1521 kHz frequency is used by Slovak 
transmitters. There is just one catch. Presov was assigned the 
same frequency as the Czech transmitters, while the "Slovak" 
frequency has also been assigned to the Ostrava transmitter. 
However, everything was settled at the talks between the Slovak 
Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works and the 
Czech Economics Ministry. Both parties agreed there that the 
1287 frequency belongs to the Czech Republic and the 1521 
frequency belongs to Slovakia. That is the precise reason the 
Slovak Telecommunications offered the RFE a different frequency 
on the AM band. But the RFE representatives do not want it. 
<H5>  They Insist on the Original Contract </H5>
  They insist on the original contract even though the Slovak 
side points out that the RFE broadcasts in Slovakia on a 
frequency that does not belong to us. Hence, the broadcast is 
illegal. Eventually, the two interested parties agreed that 
Slovak Telecommunications will apply through the Ministry of 
Transport, Communications, and Public Works at the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Geneva for an investigation of 
the entire affair, and its decision should then be sufficient 
reason to change the contract in effect. Because of this, 
Slovak Telecommunications retracted its original decision on the 
termination on 31 January 1994 of RFE broadcasting in Slovakia 
from the transmitters in Presov, Poprad, and Velke Kostolany. 
<H5>  They Insist on 1287 kHz </H5>
  It is in the interest of the Slovak Republic that the entire 
broadcast network be placed in line with the law as soon as 
possible. The RFE representatives have opposed all of the 
provisions, however, and that made the talks difficult. It is 
paradoxical that the Slovak side kept offering a different 
wavelength on the AM band but the RFE insists on the 1287 kHz. 
Why has it remained obfuscated? 
  According to RFE Deputy Director Gary Thatcher, they heard 
the arguments that the current contract could cause a conflict 
in international agreements in the context of the assigned 
frequencies. They acknowledged (several proposals by the Slovak 
party on) the possible ways to settle these problems. The RFE 
is still willing to take part in the search for a solution that 
would satisfy both parties. Thatcher indicated that one 
feasible solution could be a change of the frequency for the RFE 
programs. 
  So far, however, as RFE Slovak Broadcast Director Ivan Cikl 
phrased it, "We (the RFE--editorial note) are convinced that the 
contract is valid until the end of 1995, and one of its articles 
even refers to the possibility of further expanding the term of 
its validity." 
  In any event, it is important that RFE broadcasting reaches 
the legal status required by international regulations.

  [Text] Bratislava--In opinion polls conducted by the 
Slovak Statistical Office in December 1993, a total of 13 
percent of the respondents said that their standard of living 
was better than in the same period in 1992. Compared with the 
results obtained in September 1992, when 10 percent said the 
standard of living had improved, this is a slightly positive 
trend. A total of 29 percent of respondents said in December 
1993 that their standard of living did not change--32 percent of 
respondents responded the same in September 1992. In both 
cases, 58 percent of respondents described their standard of 
living as deteriorating. 
  The polls have shown that people view the standard of living 
depending on political preferences, education, and membership in 
social and professional groups. There was a relatively higher 
percentage of respondents who said that their standard of living 
was improving in the group of sympathizers with the Movement for 
Democratic Slovakia sympathizers (25 percent) and the Slovak 
National Party (18 percent).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poland Signs Up for Partnership With </F>
Little Enthusiasm; Warsaw Expects More From NATO and the 
European Union"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, one week after Romania and Lithuania 
had done so, Poland became the third country to sign up for the 
Partnership for Peace, which is intended to involve the 
countries of Central and East Europe in NATO via practical 
military cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  However, unlike Lithuanian President Brazauskas and Romanian 
Foreign Minister Melescanu, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak openly stated that Poland is not really happy with the 
partnership. "We can accept it if we are certain that Poland 
will ultimately be able to become a full member," said Pawlak. 
  On this issue, the prime minister sees eye to eye with 
Polish 
President Lech Walesa, who only went along with the NATO 
proposal after being subjected to heavy U.S. pressure but 
subsequently let it be known that, in his view, it can in no way 
be said to meet Polish demands. Poland, probably to a greater 
extent than its neighbors, fears a resurgence of Russian 
imperialism that would threaten its borders. Poland had counted 
on receiving adequate protection against any threat from the 
East in the form of security guarantees from NATO. However, a 
badly disillusioned Warsaw is now having to face up to the fact 
that NATO is not prepared to give these guarantees. [passage 
omitted] 
  Consequently, Warsaw has no option but to take the long road 
to accession, and the only one leading in that direction is the 
Partnership for Peace. NATO has already let it be known that 
Poland and the other Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, and Slovakia) could find themselves placed on a faster 
track, enabling them to gain full membership before the 
Romanians or the Bulgarians. However, no one is daring to say so 
openly so as not to create new dividing lines in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska from Brussels: "Prime Minister </F>
Pawlak's Talks With `12'; One Day Everything Will Be 
Possible"--last paragraph attributed to Katarzyna 
Szymanska-Borginon] 
  [Excerpt] "Integration with the European Union [EU] is our 
strategic goal. The treaty of association--a chance to put an 
end to the artificial division of Europe"--this was stressed by 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during his talks with the "12" on 
the last day of his visit to Brussels. In his talks with EC 
Chairman Jacques Delors and members of the Commission, the prime 
minister appealed for both greater opening of markets to Polish 
goods and for a greater influx of investments. 
  The prime minister stated that "Poland expects the '12' to 
propose a schedule of joint work on inroads to membership and to 
establish the date for a conference which would review our 
mutual relations." 
  Delors avoided answering a question concerning the 
timetable. 
At a press conference, the EC chairman merely recalled that the 
"12" had made a political commitment to admit new countries; 
however, it will do this only when it is possible. 
  The prime minister also indirectly criticized the West 
publicly for its trade policy toward Poland. In a paper 
delivered before Polish and Western dignitaries, invited to 
Brussels by the Washington Center of Strategic and International 
Studies (CSIS) and by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Prime Minister Pawlak 
declared that Poland is threatened by, among other things, the 
maintenance of barriers in the economic and civil development. 
  "Our efforts to take part in Western structures are supposed 
to serve the purpose of European cooperation and extending the 
zone of stability, and, as a consequence, the purpose of 
strengthening the entire continent," he said. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" initiative was referred to by 
the 
prime minister as "a first step" toward improving our security. 
According to him, Poland and NATO should begin cooperation in 
such areas as making systems of communications and logistics 
uniform, because without any great financial investments they 
could contribute to the adjustment of our Armed Forces to 
Western standards. At a breakfast with members of the press, 
when asked about the attitude of Moscow toward Polish efforts to 
become a NATO member, the prime minister said that Russia's 
reservations show that the time when some states meddled with 
the affairs of others is not yet over. German Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe, who was present at the CSIS conference, saw 
"Partnership for Peace" as a preparatory step for Polish 
membership in NATO. 
  He stressed that "stabilization in the Euro-Atlantic region 
is possible only with Russia, but the security zone cannot be 
limited from outside by any state." "Germany does not want its 
eastern border to be a line of division between the area of 
stability and the area of instability. Poland is entitled to 
membership in Europe and to the protection of its democratic 
development," said Ruehe. 
  Waldemar Pawlak, in talks with EU General Secretary Willem 
van Eekelen, tried to convince him that the organization's 
council, jointly with the Central European states, should 
negotiate the draft of the status of their association with the 
Western European Union [WEU]. Pawlak emphasized that "we are 
interested in obtaining the association status we already have 
with the EU." Eekelen gave assurances that the status of such 
states as Poland is being discussed in the WEU. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Maja Narbutt from Vilnius: "Poland-Lithuania: </F>
Fifth and Last Round"] 
  [Text] The next round of Polish-Lithuanian negotiations on 
the state treaty will be held in three weeks. Lech Walesa's 
special envoy, who on Thursday [3 February] spoke in Vilnius 
with [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas for the second 
time, said optimistically that it will be "the fifth, and 
probably last round." 
  Andrzej Zakrzewski, secretary of state in the President's 
Office, suggests that the controversial issues which kept 
delaying negotiations on the treaty have in fact already been 
resolved. 
  The bone of contention was first of all the evaluation of 
historical events, especially the so-called Zeligowski mutiny 
and its consequences. For over a year, the Lithuanians firmly 
rejected Polish suggestions that the evaluation of the past 
should be left to historians. On Thursday in Vilnius, it was 
established that part of this declaration pertaining to the 
evaluation of the past would constitute the treaty's preamble. 
Different parts of it will be included in the speeches of the 
Polish and Lithuanian presidents, who will deliver them when the 
treaty is signed. However, Andrzej Zakrzewski added that "this 
is what will probably happen." The final decisions will be made 
during the fifth round of negotiations, held in Warsaw. His 
statement suggests that the Polish side decided that the 
formulations proposed on 3 February in Vilnius, concerning the 
evaluation of the past, are acceptable.

<F P=106> [Article by E.K. and M.W.: "Evening Talks Between Pawlak and </F>
Kwasniewski; Behind Closed Doors"] 
  [Text] On Thursday [3 February] evening, in the Office of 
the Council of Ministers [URM] there was a meeting between Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
  Pawlak and Kwasniewski were driven to the URM through a side 
entrance; after the meeting, they drove off without talking with 
journalists waiting outside the building. The subject of the 
talk was the recall of Finance Deputy Minister Stefan Kawalec, 
as well as methods of governing and joint governing within the 
coalition. Kwasniewski held over three hours of talks with SLD 
ministers before the meeting. At that time, Deputy Prime 
Minister Borowski suggested that the powers of each of the three 
deputy prime ministers be clearly defined, so that each of them 
understood their responsibilities. 
  On the same day, on the plane from Brussels to Warsaw, 
Waldemar Pawlak told journalists accompanying him that internal 
relations between the coalition parties are much more quiet than 
it might seem when one views them from the outside. The 
coalition agreement signed by the Polish Peasant Party and SLD 
does not regulate all relations between the governing parties, 
and even though there are no major frictions between them, their 
stands on many issues are different. This is why the situation 
requires patience and dialogue, which will make it possible to 
find good solutions. 
  During the meeting of the prime minister and SLD leader in 
Brussels, Aleksander Kwasniewski is said to have expressed his 
dissatisfaction over the existing conflict. Journalists who 
witnessed this had the impression that Kwasniewski was voicing 
his opinions very firmly--but not so firmly as to let the crisis 
rock the government coalition. After the Thursday evening talks 
between both politicians, journalists came to the simple 
conclusion that their faces were rather glum. Both politicians 
are supposed to issue information on the results of their talks 
at a press conference on Friday.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Deputy Prime 
Minister Marek Borowski, and Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of 
the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic last night discussed 
reaching a new coalition agreement. We were told this by 
today's guest, Aleksander Kwasniewski. Later today the leaders 
of the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance 
will meet. 
  [Begin recording] [Kwasniewski] I am trying to convince both 
Marek Borowski and the prime minister about the hierarchy of 
issues. The most important issue for today is the budget; the 
most important issue is an effective government; personal 
matters are somewhere behind. I am convinced that if such 
principles are accepted by the prime minister then Marek 
Borowski will not submit his resignation--he is a responsible 
politician.... 
  [Unidentified correspondent, interrupts] But did he say 
yesterday that he was withdrawing his resignation? 
  [Kwasniewski] The resignation has not been submitted... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] It was submitted last Friday. 
  [Kwasniewski] No, it was not submitted; it was just 
announced... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Then did he withdraw his 
announcement? 
  [Kwasniewski] Yes, if these principles are accepted then I 
think that the whole issue will be settled positively. [end 
recording] 
  Kwasniewski added that he expects Prime minister Waldemar 
Pawlak's reply on the question of possible nominations for 
deputy ministers of defense, foreign affairs and internal 
affairs from among the coalition members. The prime minister 
will also explain the role of Jerzy Milewski, deputy defense 
minister and the head of the National Security Office, in the 
government.

the government coalition is not threatened at present. In a 
statement for the Signals of the Day, the early morning slot of

there was no possibility at present to replace the coalition of 
the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] and the SLD with any other

  Kwasniewski said that his talks yesterday with Prime

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of Social </F>
Democracy of the Polish Republic, by Christophe Lamfalussy in 
Brussels on 2 February: "The Strongman of Warsaw: Attitudes 
Must Change"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Aleksander Kwasniewski, 39, is 
the new strongman of Warsaw. He is leader of Social Democracy 
of the Polish Republic [SdRP], which won September's elections 
and marked the return of the former communist left in Poland. 
[passage omitted] 
  LA LIBRE BELGIQUE met Mr. Kwasniewski on Wednesday morning 
and asked him what he thought of the partnership offered by NATO. 
  [Kwasniewski] It is obviously in Poland's interests to be a 
full-fledged member of an effective European security structure. 
NATO is the only real structure. We understand that the 
integration process takes time. But that is not enough for us. 
I do not want, as Chancellor Kohl said in Davos, a border 
between the two Europes running between Germany and Poland. We 
must do two things. On the one hand, integrate our economies, 
make them more open because, without this, a new economic wall 
will be created between the two Europes. Also, we must change 
the thinking behind European security. Before, it was one of 
opposition--opposition to Russia, opposition to the Warsaw Pact, 
and, on the other side, opposition to NATO. And this change in 
attitudes must take account of Russia. 
  [Lamfalussy] Of Russia? 
  [Kwasniewski] Yes, because Russian politicians believe that 
a 
NATO strengthened by Poland and other Central European countries 
will oppose Russia. What is happening in Russia is not a 
resurgence of geographically limited nationalism. It is the 
feeling that the great Russia has lost land. Russia and Ukraine 
must therefore participate. 
  [Lamfalussy] What form of participation? 
  [Kwasniewski] That is up to the Russians to say. It is 
impossible to totally integrate Russia, which is bigger than 
Western Europe. 
  [Lamfalussy] Do we need a European Army that can intervene 
in 
domestic conflicts, such as in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Kwasniewski] Rather than a large army, it would be useful 
to 
develop cooperation instruments between well-prepared troops, 
which would be able to help resolve such local conflicts. 
  [Lamfalussy] The association accord between Poland and the 
European Union entered into force on Tuesday [1 Feb]. How can 
this help the Polish economy? 
  [Kwasniewski] For the past two years, we have had a trade 
deficit with the EEC: We import more than we export. 
Protectionist barriers exist, principally for our agriculture 
and the steel industry. We hope that this accord is going to 
help us to export more. It is also important to give Poland the 
prospect of membership. It would be good to be members of the 
European Union by the year 2000. 
  [Lamfalussy) Which countries are the major foreign investors 
in Poland? 
  [Kwasniewski] The United States is the most active. The 
Netherlands, Italy, and Austria follow. Paradoxically, Germany 
ranks no higher than fifth, probably because it has been so busy 
with the rehabilitation of the former GDR.

<F P=106> [Article by D.P.: "January Results of Public Opinion </F>
Research Institute for RZECZPOSPOLITA; Correction: Coalition 
Loses Support"] 
  [Text] In reality, the poll [conducted for RZECZPOSPOLITA 
by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute] showed a 
noticeable drop, not a slight increase, in the popular rating of 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], as well as a declining trend 
in sympathies for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. 
  Growing is support for the Democratic Union [UD], which is 
the strongest opposition party; support for its closest ally, 
the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD], is on the wane. There 
would be seven parties in parliament: all of the present 
parliamentary parties plus the KLD. 
  The SLD has lost a lot of support where it felt strong in 
November: among the employees of state enterprises, unskilled 
workers, as well as inhabitants of small and medium-sized towns. 
Support for the SLD especially dropped among people who have 
the best educations and the highest incomes. Also people 
employed in private companies back the party of Aleksander 
Kwasniewski much less frequently than they did before. The SLD 
is still supported by the poorest people, as well as by the 
unemployed, who back this party more often than any other. 
  Over the past two months, the PSL has discouraged many older 
voters--60 years old and older. It is still the 
second-most-popular grouping in this milieu (the most popular is 
the now nonexistent election coalition "Fatherland," comprising 
such parties as the Christian-National Union and the Party of 
Christian Democrats). However, support for this party among 
60-year-old respondents is no higher than in the other groups. 
The PSL is still the favorite party of peasants and 
agricultural employees; almost 60 percent of respondents in 
these groups would vote for it today.

  [Text] Warsaw, 3 Feb (PAP)--The Sejm National Defense 
Commission has not changed its stand and continues to be against 
the linking of posts in the Ministry of National Defense and in 
the National Security Bureau by Minister Milewski. It is also 
disturbed at the changes being carried out in the Ministry of 
Defense, weakening civilian control over the military. This was 
reported by Tomasz Nalecz, deputy chairman of the National 
Defense Commission, after the Thursday meeting of its Presidium. 
  On 16 December last year, in a recommendation to the prime 
minister, the commission queried the linking of posts in the 
Ministry of Defense, the National Security Bureau, and the 
Presidential Chancellery. In the view of deputies, this 
"strikes at the constitutional principle of the division of the 
supreme state authorities and also creates confusion as to 
prerogatives." The deputies are still waiting for the prime 
minister's reply. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, the linking of posts by 
Milewski is in accordance with the law. 
  In the view of the commission, the announced reorganization 
in the Defense Ministry is leading to the weakening of civilian 
control over the army. "Deputies [in the commission] found out 
about these changes from the press, despite the fact that 
Minister Milewski promised the commission that he would not have 
any secrets from them," Nalecz said. He added that he is "also 
surprised by the tone of hostility toward parliament in certain 
statements by representatives of the Ministry of Defense." 
  The changes in the Defense Ministry are based on the 
reorganization of the ministry's management structures and also 
of the departments answerable to the secretary of state in the 
Ministry of Defense, Milewski. The plans envision that two 
deputy ministers posts will remain and the linking of two 
civil-military hierarchies, those for welfare matters and for 
defense policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Cezary Gmyz: "The Church Is Regaining Its </F>
Property"] 
  [Text] Of the 180,000 hectares of farmland nationalized 
from 1945 onwards, the church has so far regained 16,000. The 
Property Commission dealing with this issue has already 
initiated proceedings concerning half the compensation claims 
filed by church authorities. 
  The return of church property is taking place according to 
the provisions of the law "on the relationship of the state with 
the Catholic Church." 
  The Property Commission has so far received 2,985 
applications for the return of church property. Although the 
deadline for the receipt of such applications expired on 31 
December 1992, fresh applications are still being received by 
the Commission, but they will not be considered. 
  By the end of 1993, the Commission had initiated proceedings 
on 1,560 claims, over 50 percent of the total received. Some 
684 claims have been settled, 573 of them in favor of the 
church, in other words in favor of a parish, diocese, monastery, 
or church foundation. But the size of the property regained by 
the church is often less than the amount claimed by it. 
  Until now, the church authorities have regained 16,000 
hectares of farmland and forest land. After the war, the church 
lost about 130,000 hectares of land out of the 180,000 it held 
at the time, and that does not include prewar territory east of 
the Bug River, nor parts of Poland that formerly belonged to 
Germany. Of its so-called built-up property, the church has 
regained slightly less than 200 hectares, the largest of which 
are the monastery in Henrykow and the church estate in Frombork. 
  Even though the law allows the payment of compensation for 
lost land out of the state treasury, not once has the Property 
Commission applied this solution. That does not mean that the 
church has not received any money. In some cases, instead of 
the actual property, church authorities received a financial 
settlement from a local government body or other corporate user 
of the property in question. Such settlements total 2 billion 
zlotys so far. 
  Some 111 church claims for compensation have been rejected 
or 
postponed, mainly in cases where the return of church property 
would have been in breach with the law. 
  Boguslaw Skreta and Dr. Jan Chmiel of the Property 
Commission 
have assured me that in reaching a decision the Commission takes 
care that neither the interests of the church nor those of the 
state are jeopardized. 
  The Property Commission was set up in 1989. It consists of 
12 members, six on the government side and six on the church 
side. Four members constitute the so-called adjudicating body, 
which decides on the outcome of a case by means of a vote. The 
Commission's meetings take the form of a court hearing, at which 
each side presents documentary evidence and employs legal 
arguments. The Commission tries to reach an amicable settlement. 
It may restore the original property to the church, or it can 
offer the church an alternative property. There is no appeal 
against the Commission's rulings.

<F P=106> [Article by B.C.: "In Slask, Occupations, Blockades, </F>
Strikes"] 
  [Text] The headquarters of the Jastrzebie Coal 
Partnership [Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa] has been occupied by 
trade union activists for nine days now. Following yesterday's 
two-hour warning strike in the partnership's six mines, a 
Protest Committee sponsored by "Solidarity," "Solidarity 80," 
and "Kontra" is sticking to its demands for a 15-percent salary 
increase. 
  On the other hand, management says that the partnership 
cannot afford such an increase when you take into account, for 
instance, the fact that its financial obligations exceed claims 
it is entitled to by 2.2 trillion zlotys. To prove the argument 
is true, the management ordered that an expert economic analysis 
be conducted by the end of the week. The partnership's 
president proposes that in the meantime, both sides come up with 
mediators to provide assistance in salary negotiations which 
started at the beginning of the month. The Protest Committee 
informed the partnership's management that, if the talks fail, 
the committee will avail itself of Article 15 of the Trade Union 
Law--that would mean initiating a continuous strike. 
  The headquarters of the Gliwice Coal Partnership [Gliwicka 
Spolka Weglowa] is also under occupation now, but this time it 
is by several dozen activists from "Solidarity 80." 
"Solidarity" has been supporting the strike since Tuesday [1 
February]. The activists are demanding salary increases 
without, however, defining the limits of increases; they also 
demand an increase in the value of coal allowances (8 tons) from 
850,000 zlotys to 1.35 million zlotys, which is the market price 
for coal. But the occupying trade unionists categorically 
reject one-time payments of 1.8 million zlotys to the 
partnership's miners. That increase is the result of a recent 
strike by activists of "August 80," which competes with 
"Solidarity 80." Talks with the partnership's management are 
under way. 
  For its part, "Solidarity" organized two-hour warning 
strikes 
in the mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership [Bytomska Spolka 
Weglowa] on Wednesday. The strikes went on from 0600 to 0700 in 
six mines; there were strikes until 0800 in two mines, and there 
were no strikes at all in three other mines. An open 
demonstration was announced in "Jowisz" mine before the second 
shift. 
  About 600 employees of the Bytom Mining Enterprise are on 
strike. They are occupying the management's building. The 
strike is sponsored by "Solidarity" and by the Miners Trade 
Union. The trade unionists are demanding salary increases.

  [Text] Foreign Economic Cooperation Minister Leslaw 
Podkanski, who was quoted by TYGODNIK ZAMOJSKI and then by PAP, 
issued a negative evaluation of the joint-venture agreement 
between the FSO automobile plant and General Motors. 
  The head of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation 
said 
that the agreement does not resolve the global issues related to 
the restructurization of the Polish automobile industry. He 
stated that the sum of 16 million German marks, which the 
concern promised to invest in FSO, was "no sum." He also added 
that he is against granting the company the guaranteed 
preferential system for sales of Opel Astras. He most probably 
meant the customs licenses for those cars and the possibility of 
selling those cars, just like Fiats, to those who made 
prepayments to receive Fiat 126's or FSO's [system of selling 
rationed cars under the communist system]. 
  "Our contract has all the necessary signatures," 
RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by John Passadis, the GM representative 
in Poland; he added that "the contract is permanent and final. 
GM representatives have already arrived at FSO and we are 
getting ready to begin manufacturing." Far more painful for GM 
Poland was the decision by the Finance Ministry which, as of 1 
February, lowered the limit for the 15-percent excise tax on 
imported cars from 7,000 ECU's to 8,000 ECU's. 
  FSO General Director Andrzej Tyszkiewicz said that the 
implementation of the contract is in line with the schedule: The 
day of "closing" is scheduled for March; the installation of 
equipment and machines in the factory will begin in April.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by Larisa Ivshyna, </F>
deputy editor in chief of the Russian-language Ukrainian daily 
KIEVSKIYE VEDOMSTI; place and date not given -- "translated from 
the Russian-language audio recording"] 
  [Text] [Ivshyna] I believe that the people of Ukraine 
want their country to be part of a united Europe. As far as we 
are concerned, it is obvious that this is also one of the 
characteristic features of Romania's foreign policy. At the 
same time, the Ukrainians would like to know your opinion on 
this and also whether your are satisfied with the relations with 
your neighbors, particularly Ukraine. 
  [Iliescu] Regarding your first question, I believe this is 
the common desire of all European countries, which is in 
accordance with the new trend in the evolution of international 
relations on our continent. The old state of affairs and the 
old division of the continent into two parts have been done away 
with. The old opposing military alliances and 
political-ideological divisions have been abandoned. I believe 
that all European countries are now moving toward the 
establishment of a new climate of general integration of all 
European countries into a single community. Of course, this 
does not exclude the existence of good relations with one's 
neighbors. Therefore, our foreign policy is aimed at developing 
overall relations with all the European countries, while also 
improving relations with neighboring countries, primarily 
Ukraine, since both our countries are going through the same 
difficult period of changes. I believe it is to our mutual 
benefit to have good-neighborly relations. 
  [Ivshyna] The first question was rather diplomatic, while 
the second one had more to do with the human aspects of 
relations between people. For instance, when I left Kiev, it 
was no easy matter to get to Bucharest. I would have liked to 
have been able to board a plane in Kiev and fly directly to 
Bucharest. Will that become possible? That would be a good 
sign in view of the fact that we are, after all, close 
neighbors. Do you not think that we can move toward closer 
economic cooperation if we develop our transportation links? Is 
this a real possibility? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that we will find ways and means of 
facilitating these links as well as the human links so that 
people can communicate more easily with one another. In this 
way, we will also be able to eliminate the relics and vestiges 
of the past, when we proclaimed "fraternal relations" between 
our countries, while extremely tough and forbidding obstacles 
were being raised to block communications between people. I 
believe that, with the development of democratic structures in 
our countries, we will manage to establish new and good links 
for direct communication. 
  [Ivshyna] As far as I know, you are already expected in Kiev 
and we hope that you will meet with our president there. Could 
you specify when that visit is going to take place? 
  [Iliescu] I hope that we will be able to pay this visit to 
Kiev in 1994 and meet with President Kravchuk. 
  [Ivshyna] Will the visit take place at the beginning of the 
year? 
  [Iliescu] This will be established through democratic [as 
published] channels. 
  [Ivshyna] I hope we will not have to wait too long. 
  [Iliescu] No. I believe it will take place in the first 
half of the year. 
  [Ivshyna] In this regard, I would like to ask you another 
question, one which is equally important for us, namely whether 
work is proceeding on the drafting of a treaty between our 
countries and whether you expect it to be signed in the near 
future. If this is not the case, maybe you can tell us if there 
are any obstacles to its drafting. Or maybe the drafting of the 
treaty is not so important as its essence. 
  [Iliescu] Right now, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs is elaborating a political document -- a political 
statement -- to be signed by the two presidents. I believe that 
we will manage to finish it so that we can meet and sign it in 
the first half of 1994. This will be a good signal for the 
overall development of our relations. 
  Of course, there are various problems between our countries. 
History has left us a difficult inheritance regarding 
territories and borders, but we are approaching these issues 
realistically by taking into consideration the new realities 
prevailing on the continent and between our countries. In view 
of these realities, we must find political solutions to all 
these problems in order to promote a climate of good 
neighborliness between us. 
  [Ivshyna] Mr. President, you are known as a man with 
progressive views in Ukraine. We do not think of you as a 
revolutionary in politics, but rather as a politician who 
believes in consensus, something which is good for politics, 
since the people are tired and want some quiet for a change. 
They seem to think that, if things proceed at a slower pace, 
such a process may ensure that confrontations can be avoided. I 
realize that a politician of your caliber must take into 
consideration the entire political spectrum. In this respect, 
it would be very important for our countries to engage in a 
dialogue of trust so as to dispel the doubts nurtured by some 
people in Ukraine. I am referring to the problem that might 
hamper the signing of a treaty between our countries, namely the 
territorial problem. If I understand correctly, the real issue 
is the recognition of existing borders. 
  [Iliescu] The problem raised by you is a complex one. I 
consider myself a revolutionary but also a politician who is a 
realist. I was at the center of all the events that 
characterized the Romanian revolution that was spontaneous and 
tougher than all the upheavals that took place in the other 
countries. This has also led to an abrupt change in the 
political structures. Romanian society was given a 
revolutionary jolt but, then, we had to create new structures, 
foster new relations between people, establish a democratic 
climate in political and social life, reorganize the economy, 
and implement economic reforms, something which requires a 
climate of overall cooperation among all the constructive forces 
in society. This requires exactly what you have just said, 
namely an open approach to all problems and an open attitude 
toward all social categories and all political and social 
forces. This is what I am striving to achieve in my practical 
activity and what is important for international relations too. 
In other words, there is the need to tackle concrete situations 
in a realistic and unbiased manner, something which can create a 
good climate for the development of international relations. 
This is what we are trying to accomplish in our foreign policy. 
  [Ivshyna] Of course, there are also certain people in 
Romania who disagree with this and demand a radical solution. 
What is your attitude toward them? 
  [Iliescu] We are trying to solve all these problems through 
dialogue because there are also persons who maintain that the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was not only antidemocratic but also 
illegal and that we must reestablish the rights of all states 
and nations proceeding from the historical realities and on the 
basis of the legal principles governing relations between 
states. At the same time, as I have already said, one must take 
into consideration the prevailing realities because nothing good 
can come out of any other approach. 
  [Ivshyna] The approach suggested by the extremists is very 
dangerous. 
  [Iliescu] Yes, because it would upset the entire situation 
in Europe. Such problems exist not only between our countries 
but practically between all countries. Let us just take Ukraine 
for example. You have similar problems with the Slovaks, Poles, 
Russians, and so forth. 
  [Ivshyna] That would be tantamount to opening a "Pandora's 
box...." 
  [Iliescu] Germany also has such problems. I am referring to 
Koenigsberg that has become Kaliningrad and so forth. If one 
starts delving into this problem, there is going to be no end in 
sight. Therefore, I believe that the only realistic approach to 
the problem is a political one that takes into account existing 
realities. All efforts should be made to create a good climate 
for relations between states. 
  [Ivshyna] You said that you do not speak Russian very well 
but I see that your Russian is very good. 
  [Iliescu] I have some difficulties in speaking it. 
  [Ivshyna] I would like to ask you how you assess the 
economic situation in Romania. It seems to me that you started 
from a very low level, under very harsh conditions, and have now 
advanced to creating the mechanism of a market economy, whereas 
Ukraine has probably reached the "critical point" regarding its 
problems right now. Your experience would be very useful to us, 
particularly since you recently held consultations with the 
opposition that has expressed its dissatisfaction with the 
government's activities. How do you assess the current efforts 
to promote the process of reform? 
  [Iliescu] There are two aspects to economic life. On the 
one hand, the difficulties created by the "overthrow" within the 
country; that is to say, the very rigid and centralized 
framework and system of economic management of the past was 
destroyed overnight, at the start of 1990, something which has 
led to a number of hardships in the development of economic 
relations within the country. This is one of the aspects. The 
second one is the collapse of our system of international 
economic relations particularly with our neighbors -- members of 
the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance -- and the 
entire space of the former Soviet Union that was our main 
partner and a very important source of raw and energy materials 
as well as an important market for the sale of our industrial 
products. This has been primarily reflected in the fall in 
industrial production. At this time, our industrial enterprises 
are operating at half their capacity, something which is 
obviously creating great social hardships, particularly due to 
unemployment and inflation. 
  [Ivshyna] The number of unemployed has reached almost one 
million in Romania. Is this true? 
  [Iliescu] Yes. It is about one million. 
  [Ivshyna] Has it reached the figure of one million? Or 
maybe even exceeded it? 
  [Iliescu] Yes, it is maybe more than a million. However, as 
early as the first half of 1990, we started taking steps to open 
up our economic system and redress our economic situation by 
giving impetus to the private sector. At this time, the private 
sector is playing quite an important role in our economy, with a 
share of more than 30 percent of the labor force. There are 
over 400,000 private enterprises: The first ones appeared in 
the trade network, then they extended to services. Now, there 
are also several small and medium-sized production enterprises. 
The aforementioned sector is already playing a very active role 
in the economy, contributing to a reduction in the level of 
unemployment that otherwise might have been even higher. 
  At the same time, we have been implementing economic reform 
since 1990, proceeding from an early study on the structure of 
our economy. That study also represented a first attempt to put 
together a single strategy for economic reform. We set up a 
group of experts and economists from various fields, including 
experts in macroeconomy, who elaborated the general outline of 
this economic reform: The liberalization of all elements of 
economic relations and the restructuring of the entire economy, 
industry, and so forth. It is on this basis that we have taken 
certain measures in the direction of privatization. The 
large-scale privatization process is being implemented at a 
slower pace. We have reorganized industry in its entirety. 
Some 6,000 industrial enterprises have been reorganized and 
turned into commercial companies that, in turn, will be 
transformed into private enterprises on a share-holding basis. 
However, this process will last a long time due to a shortage 
of capital for the purchase of those shares. However, in order 
to facilitate this process, 30 percent of the social capital of 
these enterprises has been distributed free of charge to all 
citizens over 18 years of age in the form of value bonds, while 
the government plans to turn these bonds into shares in 1994. 
About a third of the 6,000 enterprises will be privatized in 
1994. Measures have been taken to liberalize domestic and 
foreign trade activity as well as prices. This has been a more 
difficult process; it resulted in the emergence of a number of 
social problems during the first half of 1993. The entire 
system of taxes and revenues has been changed with the 
introduction of value-added-tax that plays a new major role in 
relations among economic units. This was one of the more 
radical steps taken in 1993. We also did quite a few things 
toward laying the foundations of a market economy system, but 
there is obviously quite a lot still to be done in this respect, 
hence the new measures envisaged in the government's program. I 
believe that we will solve some of these problems in 1994 and 
this will enable us to place our economy on new foundations. 
  [Ivshyna] What is it that upsets the opposition so much that 
it is demanding a change of government now? 
  [Iliescu] The opposition will always find something to be 
upset about and will always try to change the government. This 
is obviously the case with all societies. However, this is not 
the main problem. The most important problem is the people's 
discontent; this has its own valid reasons that are linked to 
the outcome of this "involution" of our economy. By that, I 
mean the decline in production, inflation, and unemployment, 
which are causing many hardships for the people and lie at the 
root of all this discontent that the opposition is obviously 
trying to exploit. 
  We hope that 1994 will be the year that will see the 
normalization and revival of our economic activity. We have 
already had several positive signals in 1993 since we have 
managed to stop the decline in production; the industrial 
activity curve is hovering at the "zero level," something which 
will create the basis of the economic recovery that we are 
counting on in 1994. 
  In agriculture, we have also had three very difficult years 
because of the drought. This year was the first one with good 
crops. Of course, we were faced here with other hardships too, 
since the cooperative farm system had been disorganized. That 
was due to the reaction of the peasants after years of brutal 
interference by the state in the life of cooperative farms that, 
actually, were not cooperative at all. Hence the reaction of 
the peasants against the cooperative farms as such, but this has 
led to other hardships as well. Nevertheless, certain positive 
trends have already emerged. The peasants are beginning to 
associate without coercion in order to carry out agricultural 
work communally, to use jointly the available agricultural 
technology and the irrigation system, and so forth. Therefore, 
we hope that, in 1994 and in the coming years, prospects will be 
created for our agriculture that will enable us to achieve a 
normal situation. The agricultural sector should play an active 
role in our economy. 
  Likewise, regarding our exports, we have reached a negative 
foreign trade balance in the past three years, meaning that 
imports have increased rapidly while exports have decreased. 
This has had a very negative impact on our economy and has led 
to the depreciation of the national currency. In the last three 
months, we have made certain progress in the sphere of exports. 
We hope that this will give further impetus to exports in 1994, 
since this is an important prerequisite for our economy. 
  Consequently, there are certain positive elements that have 
marked 1993 and we want to develop them further in 1994. 
  [Ivshyna] Many people recall that, a few years ago, 
foreigners who came to Romania were not able to see neon 
advertisements and public lights but only a poor market, with 
only occasional street lighting. We would like to know how you 
have managed to do away with this energy crisis, so to speak. 
  [Iliescu] This issue has both positive and negative aspects. 
First, the decrease in industrial production has reduced energy 
consumption in industry. This has created conditions for 
improving energy and fuel supplies to the population that had to 
suffer a lot in this respect in the last years of Ceausescu's 
regime. 
  [Ivshyna] Did you extract more of your own oil or did you 
take other measures as well? 
  [Iliescu] No. Simply, the industry has started to consume 
less, hence my statement about a positive aspect associated with 
various negative elements. 
  [Ivshyna] As far as we are concerned, this problem of energy 
resources is a painful one in Ukraine. What is the situation in 
your country? Do you use your own resources or do you resort to 
imports? 
  [Iliescu] We are importing crude oil, for instance. Our 
national production of crude oil is only 6-7 million metric tons 
per year while we consume some 15 million tons annually. Our 
refineries have a capacity of 35 million tons. Therefore, we 
are not even exploiting our refineries to full capacity since we 
have lost some major suppliers such as the Russian space, Iraq, 
Libya, and Kuwait and we do not have the necessary financial 
means to extract more crude oil. Hence, we are limiting 
ourselves to refining some 15-16 million tons per year. 
  [Ivshyna] When you talked about the serious changes that 
have occurred in your country, you obviously referred to not 
only the changes in the economic structure but also those in the 
political sphere. 
  [Iliescu] The biggest progress of all has been made in the 
political sphere. The economy is registering a slower pace in 
this respect. 
  [Ivshyna] I would now like to raise the issue of security, 
namely how one should fill the "security gap" that has emerged 
after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. I am not referring to 
"bloc" matters but I would nevertheless like to know your 
opinion on the way in which Romania intends to ensure its 
security in the future. Do you plan to become an unconditional 
NATO member or do you have other alternatives? For instance, 
what is your opinion about our president's initiative on 
creating a security zone in East Europe? 
  [Iliescu] Today, the problem of security is more of a 
political than military nature. It should reflect all the 
progress made on our continent in view of the new political 
relations that have been established between all the countries 
on this continent. Therefore, we have become actively involved 
in the CSCE process and we believe that this institution is an 
important political framework for expanding political relations 
between all CSCE countries. 
  At the same time, we look toward other international bodies 
that should radically change their content, such as NATO and the 
West European Union [WEU], with a view to ensuring that all our 
countries are included in this framework. We speak out against 
any discrimination on this matter. There is some talk on 
whether to include only certain countries in NATO while others 
are going to be left out. I believe that, if NATO is to become 
a broader framework for cooperation, then the problem should be 
broached in the same way for all the countries in our zone. 
That is why we supported both the initiatives to create a new 
framework of cooperation with our countries -- there is a 
partnership and cooperation council at NATO and the WEU -- and 
the new U.S. initiative Partnership for Peace that advocates a 
nondiscriminatory approach to all the countries in our region. 
  Generally speaking, we also appreciate the initiative of 
Ukrainian President Kravchuk as a further possibility of 
cooperation between the countries in Eastern Europe; an 
initiative that takes into consideration both the West and 
Russia so as not to create elements of tension among our 
countries but to create a general climate of understanding among 
states. 
  [Ivshyna] It seems to me that you are treating your 
opposition quite kindly. I would like to know your opinion 
about the results of the elections in Russia. 
  [Iliescu] There are two aspects there. On the one hand, you 
have the general results on the adoption of the Russian 
Constitution with their positive aspects, since the Constitution 
creates possibilities for the development of the democratic 
forces in Russia. We hope that these forces will become 
stronger as this is important both for Russia and for the 
overall climate in our region, Europe, and the world over. 
  At the same time, there are also certain signals that make 
us 
wonder: Zhirinovskiy and all those extremist forces as well as 
those longing for Russian imperialism whose activities pose a 
real danger for all domestic forces in Russia but also for our 
countries. However, we hope that the democratic forces will 
manage to remove this danger. 
  [Ivshyna] Yes, this worries us too, since we keep being 
reminded of tragic things regarding a greater Russia and so 
forth -- something which is rather dangerous if we just think of 
Germany in 1933 -- at a time when our nations are going through 
painful changes in the economic and social spheres. Regarding 
cooperation zones, I would like to ask you another question in 
connection with the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia. Since 
both Romania and Ukraine have had to suffer from the embargo, 
how do you think that our countries could be compensated for the 
damage incurred by observing this embargo? 
  [Iliescu] We pin no great hopes on compensations as such. 
Of course, we acted and raised this problem with all the 
relevant bodies, including the Sanctions Committee of the UN 
Security Council, but we have no great hopes of any real 
compensation. 
  There is another thing that is important, namely to search 
for a radical solution to the Yugoslav problem and to find 
political solutions to all those problems. This primarily 
depends on Yugoslavia's internal forces and the newly emerged 
states that themselves have to find solutions to their own 
problems, something which would lead to the lifting of the 
sanctions imposed against the internal forces there, sanctions 
which cause suffering to all innocent people. We also have to 
suffer, those who are neighboring on the region. I believe that 
nobody stands to gain from the continuation of this abnormal 
situation. We hope that political solutions will be found to 
these problems by establishing normal relations between our 
countries. 
  [Ivshyna] Mr. President, how do you view the fact that all 
the West's plans for reestablishing peace in former Yugoslavia 
have borne no results? 
  [Iliescu] It is very easy to create tension and conflict, 
but it is very difficult to normalize the situation. I believe 
that the problem has not always been tackled in a realistic way 
within Yugoslavia itself, where the internal forces have failed 
to make the necessary efforts to ensure a normal evolution of 
the changes that have occurred in Yugoslavia. At the same time, 
neither have the international bodies treated Yugoslavia's 
internal problems with adequate understanding and I believe that 
such an approach has been quite dangerous not only for 
Yugoslavia but also for the stability of our entire region. 
  [Ivshyna] Mr. President, I would like you to talk about a 
specific sphere, namely your government's official policy on the 
issue of guaranteeing the rights of national minorities. I 
realize that this humanitarian problem is quite important for 
both our countries. 
  [Iliescu] We have tackled this problem from a political 
point of view. I believe that we have created the 
constitutional and legal conditions for all national and 
religious minorities to become freely involved in the 
development of our society. We have created conditions for them 
to be represented in the political bodies. All national 
minorities are represented in our Parliament, not only the 
Hungarians, who are the largest minority and have the highest 
percentage of representation, namely 39 representatives in our 
Parliament. The smaller minorities also have their 
representatives in Parliament and in local administration. We 
have also created conditions for them to be able to develop 
their culture and specific features in all directions. We 
consider this a political necessity, in view of the conditions 
prevailing in our country, while being aware of the fact that 
this problem is being treated differently in other countries. 
For instance, many Western European countries do not even have 
the notion of "national minorities," as the minorities are 
considered citizens of the respective country and members of its 
national structure. Take France, for example: If a person is a 
citizen of France, then he is French. 
  [Ivshyna] This approach has its positive and negative 
aspects. 
  [Iliescu] For France, there is no such thing as a "French 
German," but just a "Frenchman." The Germans in Strasbourg are 
bound by the status of the citizens of that city, hence they are 
members of the French nation. 
  However, we have a different historical tradition and we 
have 
always treated this problem in another way. Our Constitution 
provides the necessary framework for solving the problems of the 
national minorities. There are two elements to which one should 
pay great attention. There are certain separatist trends that 
are concretely expressed in such slogans as "territorial 
self-determination on the basis of ethnic criteria." This 
cannot lead to normal relations between people. How can we 
isolate the Hungarians living in the center of our country, 
actually in two counties where they represent the majority of 
the population? You see, there are Romanians and other 
nationalities living in those counties as well. Such an approach 
would lead to a dangerous tendency of isolation and separatism. 
We view as equally dangerous the desire of certain circles to 
patronize minorities living on the territory of other states. 
This could lead to tension in relations between states. In our 
political activity, we attach great importance to monitoring 
these two trends that we obviously reject. 
  [Ivshyna] You are distancing yourself from them? 
  [Iliescu] We are in favor of using the national minorities 
as a binding element between neighboring states and not as an 
element of creating tension in relations between our countries. 
  [Ivshyna] From press reports, I learned of a sad and 
undesirable incident that occurred during the protest 
demonstrations recently held in front of the Russian Embassy in 
Bucharest in connection with the Ilascu trial [trial of a group 
of Moldovans headed by Ilie Ilascu, official of the Christian 
Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, sentenced to death by a 
court in Tiraspol, Dniester region]: Hooligans destroyed the 
busts of Russian writers, including Shevchenko. I would like to 
know your reaction to this incident and whether the busts will 
be restored. 
  [Iliescu] There can be no doubt at all that we are against 
such demonstrations organized by some very vociferous groups 
that are in a minority. From a sentimental viewpoint, I might 
understand their motivation, but one cannot approve of such 
deeds. 
  [Ivshyna] As far as Ukraine is concerned, Shevchenko is 
not only a monument but also a symbol. 
  [Iliescu] The same as Eminescu [classic Romanian poet] is 
for us. 
  [Ivshyna] I would like you to tell us something about your 
life outside politics. What else do you do? 
  [Iliescu] Right now, I have no time for anything else. 
Politics takes up all my time. As a matter of fact, I have no 
free time left at all. 
  [Ivshyna] Do you like your work? 
  [Iliescu] Of course. Otherwise, I could not do anything. 
  [Ivshyna] Do you have a large family? 
  [Iliescu] No. But I have a lot of brothers and nephews. I 
live just with my wife. We do not have any children. 
  [Ivshyna] Do you have time for travel? Maybe you like to go 
hunting or fishing. 
  [Iliescu] No. I have not had time for such things during the 
last few years. 
  [Ivshyna] Let us make a small incursion into history. It is 
obvious that your destiny as a politician has obviously blended 
with the destiny of other personalities and prominent people. 
What was your relationship with Ceausescu, for instance? 
  [Iliescu] Not very close, although I worked with him 
directly for some six months in 1971, when I was secretary of 
the Central Committee [of the Romanian Communist Party]. Until 
then, we had pretty good relations because, at that time, he was 
one of the people who worked for openness in our political 
activity. That was a good time -- the 1960's; I mean, when one 
can say that Romania was at the forefront of the political, 
cultural, and economic openness as far as the countries in the 
East were concerned. In Romania and Czechoslovakia, people were 
talking for the first time about economic reform, market 
economy, and merging the plan with the requirements of life. A 
national conference on this subject was even held in 1967. 
However, the intervention in Czechoslovakia [Russian invasion 
of Czechoslovakia in 1968] was followed by a period of 
involution not only for the countries where Soviet troops were 
deployed but also for Romania. The political tension that 
emerged at the time was used by Ceausescu as a pretext for a new 
kind of policy based on the personality cult and on a hardening 
of the political regime. In 1971, I was in direct contact with 
him and our differences came to the fore. This happened after a 
visit he paid to certain Asian countries -- to China and 
particularly North Korea. Afterward, he removed me from the 
political leadership.... 
  [Ivshyna] Nevertheless, what is your opinion about him as a 
man? 
  [Iliescu] He had an intuitive intelligence, otherwise he 
would not have been able to advance so far, but he had a limited 
education and culture; actually, he was quite a primitive man. 
When he got hold of power and began to dominate political life, 
all these primitive trends came to the fore, that is to say the 
characteristics of a man who wanted to control and know 
everything. 
  [Ivshyna] This is an explanation that makes you understand 
such a phenomenon better. You see, many postsocialist countries 
are faced with a common danger, namely the danger of nostalgia 
for the past. What is your opinion on this? What kind of 
politics should one implement so as to prevent people from 
developing these feelings of nostalgia? 
  [Iliescu] This is quite a difficult thing to accomplish at 
such a time as this, when the economy has had to suffer a lot. 
The Romanian revolution occurred as a reaction of the people 
against very difficult living conditions. Right now, the 
situation for some people is even worse than then. The 
transition is creating such an amount of discontent that some 
people are beginning to think that it was better before, despite 
the dictatorship, since they at least had secure jobs and, 
although they lived modestly, they enjoyed a certain security. 
But now, when there is unemployment and inflation and the 
commodity prices keep going up with every passing day, certain 
people have become melancholic and are longing for the past. 
Such a danger exists and it can compromise the very idea of 
reform. Therefore, we are doing our best to make headway along 
these lines, but it is no easy thing to accomplish. We must get 
through a very tough period and must openly tell the people 
about the hardships inherent in the transitional period. 
  [Ivshyna] However, your meetings with the people have become 
rarer of late. Maybe it is not so comfortable to meet the 
people at a time when they are having such thoughts, to talk to 
them about unpleasant things, and tell them to be patient and 
work.... 
  [Iliescu] No, it is not easy to do that, but it has to be 
done, and I must say that most of the people realize what is 
happening, although life is quite hard for them. On the other 
hand, there are also people who are exploiting such moments; I 
am basically referring to certain political forces and trade 
union leaders who are paid to do that. 
  [Ivshyna] What should one do to ensure that the government 
ship can sail on without being hampered by populist 
pronouncements? 
  [Iliescu] It is necessary to engage in a frank and constant 
dialogue with the people and tell them everything openly. When 
you are frank with the people, they are ready to understand you, 
even though it may be quite difficult for them to do this. 
  [Ivshyna] I had prepared a few more questions for you but I 
do not want to take up too much of your time. I would like to 
thank you for this discussion and ask you to say a few words for 
our Ukrainian readers. 
  [Iliescu] I would like to take this opportunity to convey my 
best wishes and my feelings of friendship to the readers of your 
newspaper. I would also like to express the hope that we will 
manage to cover this difficult road together, that we will 
create new and good living conditions for both our peoples, and 
that we will develop traditional good-neighborly relations 
between our countries. 
  [Ivshyna] Of course, it is very nice to have relations of 
friendship. Thank you.

Brigade, and the 128th Rijeka Brigade, as well as units of the 
101st and 102d Zagreb brigades, and the 112th Zadar Brigade, 
numerically equivalent to one battalion. These units, military 
sources in Knin claim, are mainly engaged against Muslim forces 
from Stolac [in Herzegovina, southeast of Mostar] to Gornji 
Vakuf [in central Bosnia].

<F P=106> [Interview by Vlado Vurusic with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F>
leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, in Bled; date 
not given: "Four Countries Will Emerge on Territory of Former 
Yugoslavia: Greater Croatia, Greater Serbia, Greater Macedonia, 
and Little Slovenia With Trieste"] 
  [Text] While the boat floats calmly on the cold Lake Bled, 
Zhirinovskiy, completely relaxed, explains how sex and morals 
influence politics. "A man and a woman," Zhirinovskiy says, 
eating a mandarin slowly, "have two ways of establishing a 
relationship -- either by consent, or the man rapes the woman. 
So, today in Russia, you have politicians, like Gaydar, for 
example, who rape the country, rape the economy. We do 
everything slowly, which is the result of my way of life and my 
eating habits, and that is why the Russians rejected the 
barbarians and the crooks at the elections. They tell us that we 
give them hope, and they no longer want to put up with Gaydar's 
deceptions. We are for true democracy. So far, we have had 
democrats-hermaphrodites in power." Zhirinovskiy quickly 
switches from politics to women. He says that he likes calm and 
quiet women that do not smoke, do not drink, and do not wear 
makeup, women that knit and do embroidery. "I particularly like 
women that moan and weep during intercourse, but women that cry 
out `More, more,' I do not like them, that is no longer 
democracy," Zhirinovskiy explains his sexual philosophy. 
  We continue the conversation in his presidential suite. 
Since 
the translator he asked for did not come, Zhirinovskiy asked me 
to translate for him the declaration given to him for signing by 
[Slovene National Party leader] Zmago Jelincic. 
  The fifth point of that declaration contains Jelincic's 
proposal that Zhirinovskiy should help Slovenia move the 
Slovene-Croatian border in Istria to the Mirna River. 
  "What do you think about that?" Zhirinovskiy asked me. I 
told him that it was not fair for everybody to snatch parts of 
Croatian territory. "Besides, you said that you are against the 
changing of borders," I said. "You are right," Zhirinovskiy 
said without much interest, but he theatrically crossed out the 
fifth point of the declaration, which in the end was left out 
from the document. 
  When most of the reporters had left Lake Bled, Zhirinovskiy 
invited a British reporter, a Norwegian one, and I to join him 
in the sauna and the pool, where -- in an atmosphere of sweat 
and burning brains -- he chatted about his political views 
regarding the world, and his intended trips to Spain, Turkey, 
and Poland. The conversation and the photo session in the pool 
and the trim-cabinet confirmed his eccentricity. Zhirinovskiy 
wanted us to play with him, who can stay under water longer, who 
can dive, jump the longest, lift more weights. All this 
bewildered the cold-blooded and condescending British colleague. 
He finally left without saying goodbye, while we had another 
drink by the pool (Zhirinovskiy had a soft drink). We 
completely lost awareness of the fact that we were in the 
company of a controversial and bizarre politician, seen by many 
as a very dangerous possible initiator of a third world war. 
  [Vurusic] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, the 13 million votes that you 
got make you a very important politician. Is not everything we 
witnessed at Lake Bled just an eccentric show? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, politics should be like that. You have 
to be sincere and open in politics. I am open, I hide nothing. 
During these last few days reporters have been following me 
freely. They have photographed me eating, walking, swimming, 
talking. I am like that. In politics, as in nature, there can 
be volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes. I want to 
prevent that. I am very peace-loving, although there are 
constant attempts to smear me with mud. Actually, in order to 
prevent even worse consequences of the present situation, I am 
prepared to apply somewhat harsher measures. Sometimes a little 
violence has to be applied to prevent a lot of violence. 
  [Vurusic] Russia's public prosecutor has brought charges 
against you for spreading hatred and for war-mongering? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] That is all nonsense. They want to get rid 
of me, they want to discredit me because I won the elections, 
and because I will become the president of Russia after the next 
elections. I am in favor of a peaceful solution to all issues, 
and I have been fighting with all my might to find a peaceful 
solution to this bloody war in the Balkans. The events in the 
former Yugoslavia are, in a way, a preamble to what certain 
circles would like to see happen to us in Russia. 
  [Vurusic] Your views about the war in the former Yugoslavia 
have been causing some confusion, and even dismay. How do you 
see this war? Is it true that you support the Serbian side? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It hurts me to see our brother Slavs killing 
each other. I love the Slovenes, the Croats, and the Serbs 
equally, and that is why I think that this war has to be 
stopped, but in a peaceful way. Our party has several solutions 
to stop the war. Believe me, it is no coincidence that it is 
the Slav countries that have disintegrated, Yugoslavia, 
Czechoslovakia, and the USSR. 
  [Vurusic] You told me in Moscow that you would like to see 
the reintegration of Yugoslavia, but that you would not insist 
on that. What does that mean? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Why do you not want to be a powerful Slav 
state? There are 300 million of us Slavs! We are a force. Why 
should they constantly divide us, why should we wage wars, why 
should we defend the West from invasions from the East? All 
right, Yugoslavia does not have to be reintegrated if you do not 
want it so, but you must not fight. We, the Slavs, we have to 
stick together. If you do not want to be together, then three 
states can be formed: Slovenia, greater Croatia, and greater 
Serbia. 
  [Vurusic] You did not answer whether you nevertheless 
support the Serbs in this war? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, I do not support the Serbs, I support the 
Slavs. Perhaps the Serbs are closer to us, the Russians, 
because of religion. Besides, the Serbs love us and we have 
helped them a lot throughout history. However, I repeat, I also 
love the Croats and the Slovenes. 
  [Vurusic] You are going to Serbia, but not to Croatia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would have gone to Croatia if I was 
invited. Actually, the representatives of one of your parties, 
with whom I met in Bled, have invited me now. I will come, of 
course, and I will tell your president to negotiate. I will say 
the same thing to Milosevic. 
  [Vurusic] What kind of solution do you offer for the end of 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The foreign troops, including the UN forces, 
must first leave Bosnia-Herzegovina. The possibility of any 
sort of foreign involvement in the clashes, especially the 
possibility of an intervention against only one side -- the 
Serbian side -- must be eliminated. Afterward, clashes must be 
ended and the status quo frozen. If you wish, we can send the 
Russian battalions to stand between the warring sides and 
guarantee that there will be no more clashes. 
  [Vurusic] By freezing the status quo, Serbia will get the 
greatest part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What is wrong with the Serbs getting the 
largest part of the territory? In this way they will grow into 
a force that will defend Europe from the Islamic fundamentalism, 
from the invasion of Islam toward the heart of Europe. Serbia 
will defend you from new wars and poverty. What will happen 
when the Turks advance via Bulgaria toward Europe one day? 
Somebody should stop them. The Serbs being in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is like a flu, as they are preventing the 
spreading of AIDS to Europe. Better a flu in Bosnia than AIDS 
in Europe. Beside, one of the solutions is a greater Croatia 
and a greater Serbia in the Balkans. 
  [Vurusic] What do you mean? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let there be a greater Croatia, naturally 
slightly smaller than the greater Serbia. Three states should 
exist in the Balkans: little Slovenia, perhaps with Trieste, 
then Croatia with roughly half of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
greater Serbia. 
  [Vurusic] Will "krajina" be part of the greater Serbia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Whose is "krajina" actually? 
  [Vurusic] Croatia's. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Good, then let it stay in Croatia while 
Serbia can get a part of Albania. 
  [Vurusic] What about the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What Muslims? They do not exist as a nation. 
They are an invention. How do I know what will happen to them, 
they can move to Iran! 
  I would like to stress the following: If the borders start 
to change then what I call Europe 2000 will emerge, and within 
it the Balkan pyramid. In principle, I am opposed to changes of 
borders, however, it they do start to change, they should change 
everywhere and not only in the Slavic countries. I have 
proposed the borders from 1900, 1918, 1945, 1975, or 1994 to the 
West. If the West does not want this, then my message to them 
is -- O.K. it is time for the borders of the year 2000. This 
time around, the Slavs must not come off badly again, but must 
change borders to our advantage. 
  [Vurusic] What is the Balkan pyramid? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Little Slovenia with Trieste. As I have 
heard here, Trieste is rather controversial. Initially, a "free 
town" model can be applied, similarly to the free royal towns 
that existed in Europe in the past. Numerous towns in Europe, 
also in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nagorno Karabakh, even Vukovar, 
about which I am constantly being asked questions ever since it 
has been learned that I will visit it, could get this status. 
Once the system of "free towns" is setup, the interested 
parties should agree peacefully what will go to whom. Anyway, 
to continue. Within Europe 2000 and the Balkan pyramid, Tirol 
must go to Austria. Italy will be a little debilitated, but we 
should help it in Sicily around its problems with the Mafia. 
The top part of the Balkan pyramid is Slovenia, the next, 
somewhat bigger, Croatia with a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
third, Serbia with Montenegro, the greater part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a part of Albania, while the last and 
the fundamental part of the pyramid will form the biggest 
country -- Macedonia with its capital in Sofia -- which will 
stretch from the Adriatic sea to the Black and Aegean Seas. It 
will entail a part of Albania, Macedonia, Greek Thrace, 
Bulgaria, and the Romanian Dobrogea. In return the Greeks would 
get Cyprus, Gallipoli, and the Turkish islands in the Aegean 
Sea. Hungary with Transylvania would also be linked to this 
pyramid, however, this will happen later. 
  [Vurusic] You intend to accomplish all this without a war? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] All this can be resolved very easily. In the 
first phase, new Slovenia, greater Croatia, and greater Serbia 
will be created. Then it will be Macedonia's turn. True 
enough, the question of Austria can be resolved in the first 
phase, although it does not have such a complex situation as the 
countries of former Yugoslavia. The safety of these countries 
will be guaranteed by five Russian corps. One in each country. 
There would be no more war and you could concentrate on trade. 
  [Vurusic] How will you react if NATO nevertheless attacks 
the Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We shall oppose it adamantly. We will demand 
through our parliament and our diplomacy that intervention 
definitely be prevented. If need be, Russia will threaten to 
leave the UN. 
  [Vurusic] The Italians will probably be surprised that you 
wish to give Trieste a similar status to Vukovar? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You see, there are numerous problematic areas 
in Europe, which should be marked. These are: the Basque 
Province, Catalonia, Tirol, Lvov, and Dniester, and Nagoro 
Karabakh. If we approach border changes, we must mark exactly 
all the problematic areas and give them a special status. 
Afterward, we will agree to whom what will go. 
  [Vurusic] What will you say in Vukovar? Is this a Croatian 
or a Serbian town for you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I will say that we, the Slavs, must not kill 
each other. I will seek that the Serbs agree with the Croats 
about the status of Vukovar peacefully. I will say that I shall 
do everything within my power to have the sanctions against 
Serbia lifted. Beside, I will advocate that sanctions not be 
imposed on Croatia, which some in the world demand. Why do they 
demand sanctions against Croatia? To exhaust yet another Slavic 
country and prolong the war. 
  Had the West cared about ending the war in the Balkans, it 
would not have demanded the isolation of Serbia and Croatia. 
The Serbs and the Croats must negotiate, and if they do not 
want to, the case of Northern Ireland will repeat itself. 
Little countries are dangerous, they merely escalate the 
possibility of clashes and wars and that is why I am sorry that 
Yugoslavia has disintegrated. In 1990, I was in Ljubljana, 
Zagreb, and Belgrade. I liked the towns and the people, 
however, now you are at war and in order to get from Ljubljana 
to Belgrade I have to travel via Hungary. 
  [Vurusic] So you nevertheless wish for the reconstruction of 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I think that this is the best. Why are you 
fighting? All the Slavs should be united. Like the Communists 
used to say -- Proletarians of all countries, unite! -- I call 
on you: All Slavs, unite! Nobody will be able to do a thing to 
us. However, I will not insist on Yugoslavia if that is the way 
you agree. It is your decision how you will link up: A 
federation, a confederation, or nothing at all. As I have said 
earlier, there are three countries, while other parts of the 
former Yugoslavia will enter one of these three countries. On 
these territories, either Yugoslavia or the Balkan pyramid, as I 
have proposed it, is possible. 
  [Vurusic] Why did you come particularly to Slovenia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There are parliamentary holidays right now 
and my friend Petar Ivanovich invited me to come here to rest. 
I need a rest, but I must again defend myself from attacks that 
I am a fascist. You see that I am not a fascist! I only want 
peace and happiness for the Slavs. I wish this to all other 
nations. To Russia I wish that it finally overcomes the chaos 
in which it is currently. 
  [Vurusic] However, you are feared in the West and in Russia? 
  [Zhirivnoskiy] Let them fear me, we have feared and curtsied 
to the West long enough. They fear me in the West because I 
speak the truth and fight for a more just solution. Why is 
America meddling in European affairs when it does not belong 
here? Why all this bowing to the West? In what way is Russia 
worse than the West? Is our culture poorer? Of course not. Is 
our Russian man less talented? No. Are our women less pretty 
than in the West? Those hermaphrodite democrats who are afraid 
of the true Russia are afraid of me. 
  [Vurusic] I would return to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
What about the Muslims, who are a majority ethnic group in 
Bosnia? Do you really want them deported to Iran? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We have the same problem with the Muslims in 
Russia. The Muslims would like to take over Europe and they 
would like to do it through a Muslim state in the heart of 
Europe. I have nothing against the Muslims, let them live 
according to their traditions and Muslim laws. However, then 
they do not need television, roads, contacts with the 
Christians. Let their women wear a veil from the age of 12, let 
them bow five times a day, and live in their houses. They 
should not print books because they say that everything they 
need is written in Koran, anyway. I have nothing against them 
living in accordance with their customs. However, I think that 
they cannot live like this in the heart of Europe.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "Vaclav Havel's Empathies and Wishes"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--At a meeting yesterday with the press at 
Prague Castle, President Vaclav Havel, among other things, 
expressed his empathy with the reform efforts by the former 
Russian first deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaydar, and former 
Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov. He hopes that the current 
changes in Russia will not translate into a freeze or halt the 
reforms. "If they (the reforms) were to stop halfway, it could 
be worse than if they were not implemented at all," he 
emphasized. 
  Havel, who assumed the post of president of the Czech 
Republic just a year ago, was also asked what developments he 
would wish for. "Regarding our Republic, I would like the 
economic transformation to be successfully completed, our 
country to be politically stable and quickly integrated into the 
European structures. I would like a civic society to flourish 
here, and decency, gentlemanliness, and political culture be 
enhanced here," Havel answered.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Apostolovski: "Two Hundred Million Dinars for </F>
Reviving Production"] 
  [Text] If we are to believe the words of Momir Pavlicevic, 
republican minister for industry, at yesterday's meeting with 
managers of large industrial concerns in Belgrade, Serbian 
factories can count on some 200 million new dinars (German 
marks) in "heavy" financial support as early as next week. The 
meeting was held in the capital's Chamber of Commerce. 
  The minister said that talks between the government, its 
expert team, and banks were drawing to a close, and that the 
"plan for reviving production would be finished and ready for 
implementation" by Monday. The plan envisages establishing a 
fund, half of which -- 100 million dinars -- would be secured 
from the banks' foreign currency reserves, while another 50 
million would come from the reserves of companies that will have 
to put it onto the market, Minister Pavlicevic said. The 
remaining 50 million will be secured from advance payment for 
the companies' products that are being manufactured. Yesterday, 
several assessments of the funds needed to revive production in 
the mainly idle factories were made. Rade Borojevic from the 
city Chamber [of Commerce] said that 208 million German marks 
[DM] were needed for this endeavor, and that these funds would 
be invested in 13 companies. The economy has only 24 percent of 
these funds. Rade Kolakovic, assistant manager of Beobanka, 
estimated that during the first three months, some DM500 million 
should be secured to help 60 companies. He warned that even 
five or six former Yugoslavias would not be enough to satisfy 
the industrial and labor capacities, and asked which criteria 
would be applied in dividing the sweet 200 million cake [as 
published]. 
  The managers of Belgrade industry agreed on one thing 
yesterday: Economy and production must be put on the agenda and 
they must receive the funds. 
  We must have the money by the end of next week in order to 
revive the production, said IMT [expansion unknown] manager 
Ljubomir Stevanovic. "Not a single pensioner, policeman, or 
civil servant (who has received the money) will be buying a 
tractor or combine harvester, but bread and milk. Why wait, if 
we get the loans, we should reopen Rekord [not further 
specified] as well. We also have a shortage of tires. This can 
be solved by freeing the merchant banks," said Stevanovic [as 
published]. 
  According to him, the social situation in the factories is 
highly inflammable, and the workers are exhausted. He said that 
the majority of Belgrade factories had not even paid out half of 
the December salaries. 
  In terms of production, we have lost two months, warned 
Slobodan Maric, manager of the Zemun-based Zmaj plant. 
  Talking about the current problems that the companies face, 
Milan Samardzic, manager of the Industry of Metal Products from 
Zemun, said that the net revenue of his factory equaled the 
electricity bill, and was smaller then the funds needed for the 
monthly public transport tickets of his workers. He asked who 
had allowed the GSP [expansion unknown] to reintroduce social 
policy in companies. 
  In response to the managers' many questions, Minister 
Pavlicevic stressed that the program's priority task was to 
create real resources for filling the budget, that is, reviving 
production. He said that the "budget must be leveled out by 
May." 
  Last year, 98 percent of money issued into circulation went 
into the budget. This will not be repeated this year. We shall 
invest in companies that have a short production cycle, and 
those that manufacture finished products. In this way we will 
also revive the associated companies, said the minister. 
  According to him, the price of public utilities will be 
decreased next week, because the government has calculated that 
prices are not based on the population's real wages.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Alija Izetbegovic by Amir Hodzic </F>
in Sarajevo on 3 February; monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Hodzic] ...the two aforementioned prominent ladies 
[Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller] would like the situation concerning the 
delivery of humanitarian aid to our country to improve. I think 
that the reopening of Tuzla airport would to a great extent 
improve the humanitarian situation. After the talks at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, let us recall, you said that the West 
was close to a decision on taking military action to open Tuzla 
airport and carry out the replacement of Canadian troops in 
Srebrenica. However, Butrus-Ghali is still opposed to the use 
of force, and this has not been done to the day. 
  [Izetbegovic] This has not been done, but I think that 
regardless of how much Butrus-Ghali and others oppose it, I 
think that Tuzla airport will be reopened at the end. Things 
are moving in this direction. I think that these things are now 
almost impossible to stop. There will still be some haggling 
over this, but I think that Tuzla airport will be opened by hook 
or crook. I think that the Serbian side will realize that they 
should not run the risk of being attacked from the air and that 
it will agree to this under certain conditions. 
  [Hodzic] They are obstructing it. In the past few days, the 
shelling by the Serbian aggressor has intensified in the area 
around the airport. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes. 
  [Hodzic] They are doing this to show the international 
community that the airport is not safe. 
  [Izetbegovic] I visited this airport about a month ago. 
They are threatening the airport from some Crna Planina, Crni 
Vrh, or whatever it is called. I think this is the name of the 
hill where their artillery is. The hill from which they are 
controlling the airport is approximately 5 km away, as the crow 
flies. They know very well that if they put up resistance, this 
position would probably be bombed, silenced, and neutralized. I 
think that they will have to (?agree) to the opening of the 
airport. Regarding the replacement of the Canadian battalion in 
Srebrenica with the one from the Netherlands, I think that this 
will also be accomplished in approximately 15-20 days. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. President, regarding the humanitarian 
situation, the possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] and the UNHCR is frequently mentioned. What should be 
done in this situation, if it arises? 
  [Izetbegovic] First, I would like to say that this is a kind 
of blackmail at the time of negotiations. This is a kind of 
unfair blackmail, a blackmail through food with starvation. Our 
resistance is obviously resting on two factors -- arms and food. 
Both of these factors, as you can see, are only partly in our 
hands. Only a small part of it is in our hands. Food is hardly 
in our hands altogether. We totally depend on humanitarian aid 
for food. This is something that is unfortunately in someone 
else's hands, in their hands. They are now trying to blackmail 
us through this food to force us to accept something that we 
should perhaps not accept. 
  However, we told them that in case they do decide to 
withdraw 
the troops, there would be no reason whatsoever for the embargo 
to remain in force. We demand and will demand that in case this 
decision is made, the arms embargo be lifted on the same day so 
that we can defend ourselves and they can go their own way. 
  However, assessing the future course of events, it does 
appears that they will stay here for some time. Therefore, in 
my view UNPROFOR will not be withdrawing soon, in the 
foreseeable future. I think that the situation will continue to 
develop more or less in the same way as it has been developing 
up to now. Food will be arriving in Bosnia-Herzegovina with a 
varying degree of difficulties. There has recently been some 
mention of a possibility of military helicopters escorting 
relief convoys. I think that this will come about. They would 
be able to remove the difficulties that could possibly (?arise). 
We recently sent our soldiers, our army, a letter in which we 
told them how important it was that we ourselves do not create 
any difficulties. 
  As you known, there was an attack near Zenica, the murder of 
a Englishman. This was actually supposed... this could only 
have been done by someone totally blind, deliberately (?blind), 
someone who is (?deliberately) working for someone else's 
interests. 
  [Hodzic] This second reason is more likely. 
  [Izetbegovic] This second is very likely to have been the 
case, because this was a direct attack on our main interest, 
namely to secure a normal supply of food. Some forces in the 
world were waiting for this to happen to raise the question of 
UNPROFOR's withdrawal, to use this as an argument. 
  We acted swiftly and we found those responsible. 
Unfortunately we cannot establish their motives [words 
indistinct] all three kidnappers [words indistinct] stopped. 
However, I think that there will be fewer difficulties in this 
respect in the future. 
  [Hodzic] The Presidency of our state recently proposed that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro recognize each 
other. Would this be a fresh contribution toward the settlement 
of the crisis of the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, this would certainly be a step forward if 
such mutual recognition did take place. We made that move but 
are not convinced that they will accept this. Of course, we are 
making a political point because we are showing that we do not 
want war here. It is their turn now. They could accept it. 
That would be a step forward. They could reject it. This 
would then show that they have (?extreme) intentions concerning 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. If they really want peace, they ought to 
recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina and we will recognize them. We 
could then negotiate [words indistinct] Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 
we are negotiating now, but this would then be done from the 
position in which our borders are mutually recognized. I do not 
believe that they will respond positively to our move. 
  [Hodzic] Talking of Serbia and Montenegro, the two 
aggressor states against Bosnia-Herzegovina, many international 
agencies have recently written about the arrest of the Muslims 
and the leaders of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in 
Serbia and Montenegro. Do you have any more detailed 
information about what is really going on there? What do we 
want when it comes to Sandzak? Should the issue of Sandzak have 
been stressed more vigorously in the international negotiations? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, we have been trying to do that, but our 
words have always fallen upon deaf ears in that respect. We 
have been demanding that the representatives of Sandzak 
participate in the negotiations and are involved in the 
negotiations, but that has been rejected. We keep repeating 
this demand, and we will reiterate it at the next round of 
talks, that the Sandzak delegation be allowed to participate in 
the talks about the future of Bosnia- Herzegovina as an 
interested party. As for this court trial, it is meant to 
worsen the position of the Muslim people in Sandzak, both in its 
Montenegrin part and the Serbian part. The SDA members have 
been persecuted in both parts. 
  Two nights ago Montenegrin television showed pictures of a 
group of 12 people who had been arrested, and who were said to 
have had 13 rifles in their possession, as if they were going to 
undermine Montenegro and Serbia with these 13 rifles. That can 
convince no one. However, it can do something else. This is an 
extraordinary political exploitation of a case in which the 
entire Muslim nation has been accused of working against the 
state, of being one disloyal part of it, which should then be 
put against the wall. They have managed to do that. I think 
that the position of the Muslims in Montenegro and Serbia is 
very difficult. It was difficult even before, but now it has 
deteriorated so that no one feels any security [words 
indistinct] 12 people as far as I know, and the court trial 
[word indistinct], while over 50 people here [words indistinct]. 
  We have lodged protests from here, to no effect most likely, 
but we have to draw the attention of the world to the very 
difficult position of a part of our nation in Serbia and 
Montenegro. This is an attempt to satanize a nation, to make 
other people revolt against it, and make life and existence 
impossible for the nation there. The trial that is in progress 
in Serbia and the one that is being prepared in Montenegro have 
that as the aim. 
  [Hodzic] Serbian mobilization has increased recently, 
particularly of Serbian refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
Serbia. They have been forcefully mobilized and returned to the 
fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What does that mean? 
  [Izetbegovic] You see, they have problems -- we know that; 
their military might is suffering from a shortage of people and 
weapons. They have not had vast problems as far as weapons go, 
since they had stocks of arms. For 40 years the Yugoslav Army 
amassed arms in a paranoid way, spent huge amounts of money, and 
stockpiled arms for 40 years. Just in the region of Sarajevo -- 
and I only established that later when I got here to this 
building -- there were six or seven barracks just in the 
Sarajevo region, and barracks and warehouses of arms throughout 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  So they have never had problems with arms, but they have 
always had problems with the other element, manpower, and with 
the morale of that manpower. I think that this mobilization is 
an attempt to improve the situation in that respect, to find new 
youngsters to fight in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that has more of 
a psychological aim -- to raise the poor morale a bit. I do not 
think that this will significantly affect the balance of power 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Hodzic] Let us go back now to our western neighbor, the 
Republic of Croatia, which -- after overwhelming evidence of its 
open military deployment in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has officially 
been proclaimed the aggressor on our country. Mr. President, 
you have had a chance to get to know the Croatian politicians 
well. How can you explain this policy of theirs, a policy that 
has led to open armed intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] How to explain it? That is an interesting 
question, and the answer will be long in coming. But I would 
like to give you my private view here. Tudjman is obsessed 
about creating a Croatia with borders [words indistinct]. He is 
a historian, by the way, and one that not only studies the past 
but also lives in it. He cannot understand that this is not 
1939, the eve of the World War II. If you remember, if you 
recall, that was the climate in which Bosnia-Herzegovina was so 
infamously partitioned, and this was on the eve of World War II. 
Fascism ruled in Europe. But democracy rules in Europe now, so 
the situation is completely different. In the old Yugoslavia 
there was a different balance of power, and the Muslims did not 
even exist as a political factor. Bosnia, as they say, fell 
silently then. But not this time. We are putting up a 
tremendous fight, and Bosnia is not falling. 
  Tudjman does not understand that, and he keeps pushing for 
this partition of Bosnia. We would have defended ourselves from 
the main culprit in the partition of Bosnia had it not been for 
this stab in the back from the west. After all, this has also 
damaged Croatia, since -- from the Serbian aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- this diversion by the HVO and Croatia 
turned the conflict into some kind of civil war with three 
warring factions, which in essence it is not. So the picture of 
this war has been distorted, and the international public has 
been confused about the character of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. So the result of one vision from the past, 
of one obsession to create a Croatia with certain borders [words 
indistinct] thanks to such a balance of power, and generally the 
constellation of the powers in the world, which today cannot be 
established. Tudjman does not seem to want to see that. He is 
pushing for partition, and at the same time signing agreements 
with us, which we can see are not sincere, or is offering new 
arrangements. Meanwhile he is negotiating something else with 
Milosevic, something completely the opposite. We know that. 
  The Croatian Convention will be held here in two days, and 
I think that it will steer things in another direction, or at 
least we hope so. We know that the mood of the Bosnian Croats 
is not for such an option, nor is the mood of a large part of 
the Croatian public. Opposition parties and forces are against 
such a policy. Changes are probably ahead. We will follow this 
closely. 
  [Hodzic] Has President Tudjman perhaps stressed 1939 in your 
talks? I think it is important to point out that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not exist then, and also that the 
existence of the Muslim nation was neglected in 1939. Now we 
have a completely different situation. 
  [Izetbegovic] Exactly. I have said so to Tudjman, 
particularly when he told me that we were faced with the threat 
of a bipartite partition of Bosnia. He said that what is on 
offer now is a tripartite partition of Bosnia, and we are being 
given a large part, the best part of Bosnia, and so on, but, he 
said, if you reject that, you are risking the danger of Bosnia 
being divided in two, just like in 1939. I told him that we did 
not have 200,000 soldiers then, that the Muslim nation was 
organized now, that this was the case now, and of course that 
plan will not wash. 
  [Hodzic] Tudjman's recent proposal for a union of Croatia 
and the Bosnian republic was rejected. If that proposal had 
referred to the two internationally recognized states, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, would it have been accepted? 
  [Izetbegovic] To tell you the truth, this is an issue of 
great importance. None of us would have been authorized to 
accept that definitely. We would have probably turned to our 
Assembly and our public to decide whether that suited us. One 
kind of link with Croatia would certainly suit us, a firm link, 
because we are turned toward the West because we are driven in 
that direction in our development. We would have a link with 
the Western countries through Croatia. A sincere relationship 
based on equality and mutual respect would suit us, if such a 
relationship could be established. The public would probably be 
in favor of such a firm link with Croatia. The problem is 
obviously not between the nations but in the regimes. I do not 
know whether it is possible to arrange something with the 
current Croatian regime [words indistinct] a hypocritical 
policy. We have to be very cautious about every arrangement. 
  [Hodzic] After everything that the Serbian and Croatian 
aggressors have done to Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly to the 
Muslim Bosniak people, will it be possible to preserve the 
multinational Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] That is a very hard question. I would say 
very briefly: We would have to have a bad case of amnesia for 
that. You know what that means [words indistinct] to forget, to 
forget many things, to wipe many things from the memory. 
Whether one case of amnesia or more would be needed, I do not 
know, but we will need to forget. Whether the people will be 
able to forget is another question. 
  [Hodzic] Could you briefly sum up the work of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government led by Dr. Haris Silajdzic? You 
know how busy the government is, particularly as far as the 
humanitarian needs of the population are concerned. We spoke 
about that earlier. How do you assess the results of the work of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think we should wait a few more days for 
that. The government will then have been in office for 100 days, 
and it is common practice [words indistinct], after 100 days the 
government normally comes out in front of the Assembly or the 
public and reports on the results of its work. I think that the 
prime minister will come out with a report to the Assembly on 7 
February. He will report on his results. Let us wait for that. 
Then we will see how realistic the results are. What can be 
seen now is that the government has finally started functioning, 
because we practically had no government [words indistinct] you 
could not have called that a government. That was more of a 
[word indistinct] body, which was paralyzed [word indistinct]. 
This government is without a doubt putting in a sincere effort 
to do something, and under very hard conditions, too [passage 
indistinct]. 
  There is a division of duty, according to our laws. The 
division of authority is not so strict, but it is known that the 
Presidency has the final say in the field of foreign policy, the 
army, and interior affairs. So the foreign affairs, interior 
affairs, and the army are within the authority of the 
Presidency, the body that I chair. All other things are more or 
less within the authority of the government. The three fields, 
probably the most important ones [words indistinct] are within 
the authority of the Presidency. I think that the government 
has no problems when it comes to support; it has our full 
support. Everything it has proposed has been accepted without 
serious problems [words indistinct] nor will it have any in 
future, I hope [words indistinct]. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. President, at the end of this program, I 
would like you to answer some questions that every so often tend 
to confuse the public. I am referring to the support of the 
Muslim countries to Bosnia-Herzegovina. How do you see this 
support, and is it sufficient? 
  [Izetbegovic] Regarding the support of the people, this 
support is general. This support is total and we are completely 
satisfied. Therefore, the Muslim people support 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and are profoundly interested in what is 
going on here. 
  Regarding the governments, the situation is not the same. 
Some governments do not support Bosnia-Herzegovina at all, 
while some are indifferent. These countries are in the 
minority. Some governments strongly support Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
although this number is not so great either. Some countries are 
extending support, (?limited) political and material support. 
Therefore, to be brief, there is a general support from the 
people and fairly selective support by the governments. 
  Nevertheless, one should say that this support is important 
and has perhaps been crucial for Bosnia-Herzegovina in all 
respects. We (?have) friends all over the world. We also have 
many friends outside the Muslim countries. However, the support 
from this category of countries, the Muslim countries, has 
indeed been crucial and decisive. I think that this support 
will continue. The Muslim world, which is an enormous world of 
a billion people, could have perhaps done more. 
  The prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, two very 
important countries, were here yesterday. I suppose Turkey will 
become a small giant in this part of the world. Turkey today 
has approximately 60 million people, and its national income is 
over $100 billion. This is a strong economic power whose 
strength is on the rise. This also applies to Pakistan. These 
two countries have over 200 million people alone. These two 
countries, for instance... Saudi Arabia must also be mentioned 
as a country that is helping Bosnia-Herzegovina; Iran, too, 
[words indistinct] then Malaysia is very important country, even 
though it is very far away, several thousand kilometers. We are 
in opposite time zones, so you can see how geographically far 
away this world is and yet it is very interested in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ordinary citizens there know quite a bit 
about our situation. Their government is very interested. 
Indonesia is a very large country that is just beginning to 
display an interest in our problem. This is a big country with 
almost 200 million people; it has very strong potentials. All 
this is something that is of great importance (?for our country) 
right now and in the future. 
  [Hodzic] It is claimed that the support and help from these 
countries is more concrete than the declarative support of the 
countries in the West. 
  [Izetbegovic] We must not forget one thing regarding 
humanitarian aid. The help from the West is not negligible. 
For instance, regarding the sending of UNPROFOR troops, you 
must know that France is well represented, as is Britain. The 
Netherlands has also become well represented, while Canada used 
to be. I am sorry that the United States is not among them. 
This would then be a decisive factor. 
  So, we cannot ignore the help from the Western countries. 
This help is, of course, selective and is precisely worked out 
to maintain a balance, a situation in which they can dictate a 
political solution. They are not letting us significantly gain 
in strength so that we may set our own conditions. All in all, 
we are managing to somehow coordinate this help, to use this 
support for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and prolong the 
resistance, to strengthen the defense. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. President, our program Open Studio is coming to 
an end. I would like to ask you whether, at the end of our 
program, you perhaps have a message for the people and the 
defenders of our country. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes. I would like to say to our people and 
our defenders to keep going. I would like to express gratitude 
on the part of the government and the people for what they have 
done in the defense of the country. My message to the people is 
not to lose hope, for things will improve, that we are not alone 
in the world, and that, as you can see from what I said earlier, 
we have many friends, and that the cause for which we are 
fighting cannot be defeated. 
  [Hodzic] Mr. President, thank you very much for being a 
guest of Open Studio of the Radio of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Poli Vasileva: "Russian Card"] </F>
  [Text] Can the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] overcome 
the stagnation in Bulgarian-Russian relations? At first glance 
the answer is no. There are several reasons for this. The SDS 
coalition is not in power and does have the necessary levers to 
directly affect official relations with the Kremlin. The 
natural anti-Soviet tendencies among the supporters of the blue 
[SDS] coalition are interpreted in Moscow by some "well-wishers" 
as hatred for the Russian people. The current government is the 
hostage of business groups that rely on the chaotic interstate 
relations and the paralysis of the Bulgarian Embassy in Moscow, 
in which there has been no ambassador for the last two years, in 
order to monopolize trade with the former USSR. The suspicion 
that KGB structures played an active role in toppling Filip 
Dimitrov's government is well-grounded. 
  Recently, however, one could also observe different 
processes. They provide certain commentators sensitive to 
Bulgarian-Russian relations with an opportunity to assume that 
we could soon see a sharp change in those relations. It is not 
very plausible to assume that the Bulgarian neocommunists will 
play a fundamental role in this process. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin clearly implied this last year, when he refused to 
receive Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. This was a 
diplomatic slap in the face not only for the government of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS], but mainly for President Zhelev, who is Berov's 
patron. 
  It was only the SDS that issued a fundamental position 
against the participants in the coup against Yeltsin, when the 
Russian Parliament was dissolved. This was done without waiting 
for a favorable outcome of the events. A bit later reports 
emerged about unofficial contacts between SDS figures and 
Yeltsin's advisers. Last week it became clear that the talks on 
Filip Dimitrov's visit to Russia have made progress. We also 
learned that intelligence chief Brigo Asparukhov visited Moscow 
with the purpose of foiling the contacts between the blue 
coalition and Russia's liberal circles. 
  After the failure of this mission (General Asparukhov was 
recalled to Bulgaria on 21 January before the end of his visit), 
three other persons who are very close to President Zhelev -- 
Ivan Krustev, Deyan Kyuranov, and Evgeniy Daynov -- departed for 
Moscow. It is indicative that on this occasion the president 
sent more intelligent advisers who do not hide a certain 
sympathy for the SDS and its leader. 
  Will Dimitrov succeed in making a new beginning in 
Bulgarian-Russian relations? One should first answer the main 
question: Is the "northern bear" prepared to seek friendship 
this time rather than control? For the time being everything is 
in the realm of initial positive signals. However, it is clear 
that the democrats in both countries already understand that the 
stagnation in the two countries' relations serves only the 
forces of restoration and organized crime.

<F P=106> [Article by "eb": "For Extraordinary Situations; Slovakia, </F>
Too, Has a State Material Reserves Administration"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--One of the central bodies of state 
administration that had to be established in the independent 
Slovak Republic following the partition of the CSFR is the State 
Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) of the Slovak Republic, 
the founder of which is the government. The Administration is 
made up of eight organizational units, four warehouses, and EAN 
[European Article Numbering] Slovakia, a budget-funded 
organization. The SSHR employs 200 people. 
  As SSHR Chairman Peter Ryska stressed at a news conference 
yesterday, it is not necessary to keep the SSHR's existence and 
operations secret, as was the case until recently. Quite the 
contrary, citizens should know that there exists a state agency, 
whose objective it is, in cooperation with individual government 
departments (economy, health care, transportation, and so 
forth), to secure an adequate level of supplies in order to 
ensure the operation of the economy and to supply the population 
with vital basic provisions in extraordinary situations (natural 
disasters, epidemics, local conflicts, and the like). The state 
material reserves consist of several thousand items, among which 
are, for example, fuels, cereals, pharmaceuticals, staple foods, 
industrial raw materials, and nonferrous metals. Essential food 
reserves are generated so as to last 10 days and fuel reserves 
so as to last up to 40 days. As transpired from SSHR Chairman 
Peter Ryska's words, however, even this specific agency must 
today contend with a deficit, which amounts to 200 million 
korunas. With respect to some items, the SSHR's budget does not 
reach even 50 percent of the 1993 level. 
  The SSHR regards as its priorities this year the approval of 
the bill on state material reserves and the passage of the law 
on mandatory reserves of oil, oil products, and the distribution 
system. The task for the next few years will be to follow the 
example of advanced countries and to transfer the burden for 
generating material reserves from the state to producers and 
retailers and, with respect to specific reserves, such as staple 
foods, for example, to the population.

<F P=106> [Text of speech by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in </F>
Brussels on 2 February] 
  [Text] My visit to the NATO Headquarters is taking place 
at a particularly important time. Today, I will sign on behalf 
of Poland a framework document pertaining to "Partnership for 
Peace." To say that we are shaping the future prospects of our 
continent's secure development is not an overstatement. A few 
weeks ago we witnessed a NATO summit which took place here, in 
Brussels. We awaited that event with no less interest than the 
member countries themselves. We have spoken out on many 
occasions to present our problems and our concerns, to share 
with others our vision of European security and our expectations 
with regard to the NATO partners. We have faith that the 
decisions reached at the NATO summit create a chance and a hope 
for a better future and security in Europe. Security must be 
thought of as a process of eliminating divisions and tensions, 
and developing cooperation and partnership. 
  We recognize NATO's special role in contemporary Europe. At 
the same time we understand that European security cannot be 
regarded as the exclusive responsibility of NATO. Decisions 
made by NATO countries will be successful only if they are 
appropriately responded to throughout Europe. I want to assure 
you that Poland is ready for comprehensive and serious 
cooperation. 
  We were happy to take note of the fact that NATO has 
confirmed a relationship which exists between the security of 
its member states and the security of Central and East Europe. 
In my view, that confirmation not only contributes to a 
strengthening of the external security of the countries of the 
region, but it also has a role to play in terms of success of 
the radical internal reforms being implemented by those very 
countries. 
  Our intentions with regard to NATO are clear and widely 
known. Even though the most recent NATO summit in Brussels did 
not fulfill all of our expectations, we were happy to take note 
of NATO's declaration of openness to development of cooperation 
with the partner countries. We were also happy to take note of 
the prospect created at the summit of a future widening of NATO 
to include new members. 
  Poland accepted "Partnership for Peace" and intends to 
actively participate in the program. We perceive "Partnership 
for Peace" to be a new and promising element of the process of 
building European security. We also regard the initiative as 
Poland's chance for strengthening its links to NATO, for better 
cooperation with the Alliance. We also perceive the initiative 
as a chance for the future implementation of our strategic goal 
of Poland's integration with Western security structures. 
  We see the implementation of "Partnership for Peace" not 
only as a way of getting closer to NATO. We also want to avail 
ourselves of the opportunities that the program creates for 
maintaining good, partnershiplike cooperation also with our 
eastern neighbors. Maintaining such a mutually beneficial 
cooperation with the countries of our region, a cooperation 
which would be based on equal rights, remains a crucial issue 
for Poland. 
  "Partnership for Peace" has a chance of becoming a wide area 
of concrete, day-to-day cooperation among European countries for 
the sake of common security. 
  Taking into account a certain skepticism which has emerged 
in 
the public opinion on this issue, it is important to go beyond 
mere political declarations and to provide the program with a 
clear content and complete credibility. 
  "Partnership for Peace" is a factor which has the potential 
to positively shape security relations. But while thinking 
about the future, one should reach beyond mere security. 
Security, broadly speaking, also means successful economic, 
cultural, and social development. 
  Those same goals were also the guiding ideas for the authors 
of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. It is worth recalling 
that under Article 2 of the Treaty, the parties to the Treaty 
took upon themselves an obligation to "contribute to the further 
development of peaceful and friendly relations" among others 
"through supporting the conditions of stability and prosperity." 
The parties also obliged themselves not only to eliminate 
conflicts occurring in their economic relations, but also to 
"support economic cooperation between every one of them and 
among all of them." So, while implementing "Partnership for 
Peace" in the area of political and military cooperation, we 
should also strive to create a "Partnership for Development," 
which would be a multiaspect, broad kind of cooperation among 
America, West, Central, and East Europe. It would be a 
cooperation among different structures and governmental and 
extragovernmental institutions, taking into account both 
regional and local cooperation. 
  That cooperation should in particular cover those countries 
which are on their way to a market economy. The cooperation 
should contribute to increasing the countries' growth rate, to 
an increased sense of stability, to promoting economic 
transformations, and to a widening and a strengthening of the 
market economy in the entire area covered by the partnership 
concept. 
  These forms of a broad, open cooperation may significantly 
contribute to the final elimination of the existing divisions, 
to Europe's integration, and, as a consequence, to securing 
stability and prosperity, and to eliminating many sources of 
current and potential conflicts. 
  I have faith that together, we will achieve these goals.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Feb (TANJUG) -- In response to the 
massacre in the center of Sarajevo, Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, chief of general staff of the republic of Srpska 
army, demanded that General Rose, UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] commander for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, urgently 
form a mixed team of military experts to [passage indistinct due 
to technical failure] Gen. Milovanovic asked Gen. Rose to 
include representatives of UNPROFOR, the republic of Srspka 
army, and the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army on the 
commission of experts. The commission should investigate 
ballistic and other circumstances under which the massacre 
occurred to establish which side committed the crime. 
  Gen. Milovanovic requested of Gen. Rose that the 
commission's 
work be recorded on TV cameras and in photographs and documented 
with all other necessary facts and data and that the world 
public be informed about it. If the Serbian side's request is 
not accepted, the main headquarters of the republic of Srpska 
army will suspend all cooperation with UNPROFOR and humanitarian 
organizations until the case is completely clarified and the 
world public informed about it, the chief of general staff of 
the republic of Srpska army stressed in a letter to Gen. Rose. 
He asked Gen. Rose to answer his letter by 1800 hours today.

<F P=106> [Extraordinary news conference given by Bosnian President </F>
Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in 
Sarajevo on 5 February, with questions by unidentified 
correspondents -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We are now going to broadcast a 
recording of the extraordinary news conference given by Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. 
Senada Cemurovic reports. 
  [Cemurovic] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, addressed a large number of 
domestic and foreign journalists. Several tens were killed and 
an enormous number injured, although the final toll is not yet 
known, by a Chetnik shell that landed at about 1230 on 
Sarajevo's busiest market, Markale. The Presidency has already 
held an extraordinary session. The Executive Committee of the 
city of Sarajevo, which also met, decided to declare 6 February 
as a day of mourning. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Ladies and gentlemen, according 
to the latest report of the Bosnia-Herzegovina press agency 49 
people were killed and 140 wounded killed by a 120-mm mortar 
shell fired from the direction of either Mrkovici or Poljine. 
The mortar shell was recently made and had not been painted 
yet. That is one report. 
  As you may already know President Izetbegovic has ordered 
our 
state delegation to withdraw from the negotiations at Sarajevo 
airport in the light of what has happened. I would now like to 
ask President Izetbegovic to comment on this crime. 
  [Izetbegovic] First of all, my deepest condolences to the 
families of the victims. This is a black and horrible day for 
the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have decided to withdraw 
from the talks at the airport. We have decided to hold an 
emergency session of the Presidency, a joint session of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and government, to examine the 
justification of our presence at further talks in Geneva. We 
are preparing a very brief letter to 30 or 40 statesmen of these 
countries to inform them of what [happened] in Sarajevo today. 
It will be a brief letter in which we will say that we feel as 
if we have been condemned to death. We will demand that the 
right to defend ourselves -- that was taken away from us -- be 
granted back. We will let them know that all those who are 
depriving us of this natural right to self- defense -- contained 
in Article 41 of the UN Charter -- will be considered as 
accomplices in this crime. Prime Minister Silajdzic and I are 
now at your disposal to answer your questions. 
  [Correspondent] I would like to ask Prime Minister Silajdzic 
-- who was at the airport at the time with representatives of 
the Serb aggressor side -- how that side reacted to the largest 
massacre in Sarajevo so far. 
  [Silajdzic] As always, they have rejected any responsibility 
for this attack in Sarajevo. 
  [Izetbegovic] I should add here that I saw an UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] document today that unambiguously confirms 
that the shell that killed those people -- two children among 
them, if you recall -- in Dobrinja yesterday, had been fired 
from Serb positions. This was a classified report to their 
superiors. 
  [Correspondent] What do you expect from UNPROFOR as a result 
of this? 
  [Izetbegovic] We do not need confirmation as to where the 
shell had come from but nevertheless, they will investigate into 
this. We want them to tell the world about what happened today, 
to present their view to the world. 
  It has become common practice for the Serbs to claim, 
whenever a heinous crime like this is committed, that we are 
killing ourselves -- [Nikola] Koljevic, [republic of Srpska vice 
president] said this about Dobrinja. If I get killed some day 
they will claim it was a suicide. 
  [Izetbegovic's spokeswoman] We are receiving information 
from 
moment to moment. The figure we gave you -- 49 dead -- is 
unfortunately, not final. However, it was confirmed that the 
mortar shell came from Mrkovici. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think there is any special 
significance in the fact that these two incidents happened in 
two successive days in the week before the beginning of the 
Geneva talks? 
  [Izetbegovic] We are wondering whether they wish to goad us 
into making the wrong move. The first emotional response would 
be to refuse to take part in any negotiations. However, I 
believe we will not make such a wrong move, we will most 
probably go to the talks. Of course, the final decision will be 
made at the joint government and Presidency session, but I 
believe we should keep a cool head and think rationally about 
what we should do next. 
  [Correspondent] When will this joint session take place? 
  [Izetbegovic] At 1800 today. Are there any more questions? 
Thank you.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Feb (TANJUG) -- "I categorically state 
that not a single shell was fired today from the Serbian 
positions on the Sarajevo battlefield," Major General Milan 
Gvero, deputy commander of the main headquarters of the republic 
of Srpska army, said at a news conference this evening. At the 
news conference held in the republic of Srpska presidency and 
also attended by Nikola Koljevic, the vice president [of the 
republic of Srpska], and Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the 
[republic of Srpska] people's assembly, in response to today's 
massacre at the market in the center of Sarajevo, Gvero stated 
certain facts that cause suspicion that the entire massacre was 
staged. 
  On the basis of film material recorded at the market, Gen. 
Gvero said it is obvious that there a lot of injuries to legs 
and lower parts of the body. It is incredible that market 
stools, and even bottles and eggs on sale, remained undamaged, 
as the film material confirms. Those, and some other facts, 
point to the possibility that this was a planted explosive 
device, Gvero said. 
  Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik said that today's 
massacre was a "blow to the attempt to establish peace in this 
area." We heard the news during a meeting with the Muslim 
delegation at Sarajevo airport, where we discussed humanitarian 
issues and ways of restoring trust, within the framework of 
preparations for the next round of talks in Geneva. 
  Krajisnik expressed condolences to the families of the 
victims in today's massacre and said that the Serb side would 
make sure that all circumstances behind this crime were examined 
and its culprits uncovered and punished. 
  "We do not have one single reason for applying such terrible 
methods," said Nikola Koljevic. "We are doing everything in our 
power in order to resolve the crisis by political means, restore 
trust, and begin talks regarding all matters, from political to 
humanitarian, but it is obvious that some factors are not 
interested in peace," said Koljevic.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 5 Feb (TANJUG) -- After learning about the 
horrific massacre at the Markale market, the Main Headquarters 
of the republic of Srpska army sent an urgent demand to the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command for former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to immediately establish a mixed team of 
military experts to investigate all circumstances and find the 
culprits of the crime committed against the civilian population 
of Sarajevo. 
  "Since UNPROFOR's command did not respond by 1800 as we 
demanded, I made a phone call to the UNPROFOR command in 
Kiseljak. General Ramsey, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR 
command for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, told me that the Muslim 
side had refused to take part in the setting up of the joint 
military experts team and its activities," Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, the chief of staff of the republic of Srpska army, 
stressed. 
  The main headquarters [of the republic of Srpska army] is 
dissatisfied with the UNPROFOR command's insufficient insistence 
on the Muslim side's participation, and on the need to establish 
the truth and inform the world public about it, outraged and 
horrified by the massacre, for which the Serbs are being accused 
without any proof, the statement by the main headquarters 
stresses. 
  Since the Muslim side refuses to take part in the work of 
the 
mixed commission of military experts, the main headquarters of 
the republic of Srpska is convinced that they planned and 
carried out the horrific massacre. Therefore, the republic of 
Srpska army categorically refutes and does not accept any 
involvement or responsibility for the serious crime. The 
UNPROFOR command has rejected [the proposal] that UNPROFOR's 
chief of staff and the chief of staff of the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, together with the chief of staff of the 
republic of Srpska army, go to the scene of the crime together 
and investigate the consequences and circumstances of the 
tragedy, the statement says.

  [Cot] You can say what you want, but technically speaking, 
it

the shell that landed on Dobrinja came from Serbian positions. 
Everyone knows that. It killed 10 people. It is a difference

  [Text] Zvornik, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- The Serb side has strong 
reasons for doubting the objectivity and veracity of the 
official report on the latest civilian deaths caused by a mortar 
exlosion at a crowded Sarajevo market on Saturday, the Bosnian 
Serb Army commander, Major General Manojlo Milovanovic, told 
TANJUG on Sunday [6 February]. This comes after the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had `unfoundedly and 
unsubstantiatedly blamed the Serb side, without coming up with 
any material evidence,' for Friday's mortar attack which killed 
nine people in a food queue in Sarajevo's Dobrinja suburb, Gen. 
Milovanovic said. 
  In order to prevent similar moves, the Serb side on Saturday 
proposed that a joint committee, made up of military experts of 
the UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, visits the scene of 
the attack together with the military commanders of the Bosnian 
Serbs, Muslims and the UNPROFOR. The Muslims immediately 
refused to allow its experts to go to the scene of the explosion 
as did UNPROFOR chief-of-staff for Bosnia, General Angus Ramsey, 
although he had first accepted this proposal, Gen. Milovanovic 
said. 
  According to him, all this gives much reason to the Serb 
side 
to doubt the objectivity and truthfullness of the report on the 
blast at the Sarajevo market which killed 66 people and wounded 
close to 200. Gen. Milovanovic recalled that at the eve of all 
previous major peace talks, the Muslims had orchestrated even 
the killings of civilians in order to blame the Serbs for 
everything and cause the internationalization of the war.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 6 (AFP) -- The UN and Red Cross 
Sunday [6 February] began to evacuate 58 wounded people, 
including 30 survivors of Saturday's attack on a crowded 
Sarajevo marketplace and Friday's attack on a food line in 
suburban Dobrinja. Armoured troop transport vehicles bearing 
red crosses drew up at Sarajevo airport where a plane from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and two U.S. hospital 
planes waited on the runway. Some 60 wounded people and their 
relatives -- about 100 people in all -- would be flown out of 
the besieged Bosnian capital Sunday, said the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) coordinator for medical 
evacuations, Dr. Genevieve Begkoyian. 
  Thirty of them were wounded in the Friday and Saturday 
attacks in Sarajevo and Dobrinja, while the remaining 28 were 
already on HCR lists of seriously ill and wounded waiting to be 
evacuated before the latest atrocities occurred. The planes 
were to fly their human cargo to a U.S. hospital near the Rhein 
Main U.S. airbase, near the German city of Frankfurt, Begkoyian 
said. 
  A spokesman at a military airport in Ramstein, Germany, said 
a U.S. plane carrying a dozen people seriously wounded in the 
marketplace attack was expected to land there at around 4 p.m. 
The wounded would then be taken to the US military hospital in 
Landstuhl, near the western town of Kaiserslautern. He was 
unable to say if the plane, which carried eight doctors, nurses 
and evacuation specialists when it left for the Bosnian capital, 
would return to Sarajevo after depositing the wounded. Some of 
the wounded in Sarajevo were to be evacuated to Italy on a 
French plane, he added. 
  In the Croatian capital Zagreb, officials said a 60-bed U.S. 
mobile army surgical hospital (MASH) erected at Zagreb airport 
was ready to take in Sarajevo wounded, if asked, but that no 
decision had been made for the moment. Most of the wounded that 
could be moved would probably be flown to Italy and Germany, 
Colonel Stewart Watkins, commander of U.S. forces in 
ex-Yugoslavia, told reporters.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 6 (AFP) -- UN special envoy to 
ex- Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and UNPROFOR commander General 
Jean Cot visited the Sarajevo market Sunday where 66 people died 
in a mortar attack, as preparations were underway to evacuate 
some of the wounded. 
  Akashi and Cot were escorted to the site of Saturday's 
massacre, the worst single attack since the siege of the Bosnian 
capital began 22 months ago, by Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed 
Kresevljakovic and Bosnian Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. 
  They were to meet with Bosnian leaders Sunday before heading 
back to Zagreb later in the afternoon. 
  Akashi said an investigation was underway to determine who 
had fired the shell that slammed into the crowded market, 
killing 66 and injuring 197, many of whom are not expected to 
survive because of the gravity of their wounds. She said 
although there were assumptions as to who was responsible, no 
final conclusions could yet be drawn. 
  The UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said in a statement 
Saturday that it had "confirmed that the explosion was caused by 
a single, 120 mm mortar bomb fired from northeast of the 
market." But UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said the 
investigation was difficult as the shell first hit a tower 
without fully exploding and then crashed into the market.

  [Text] Here is what Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the 
Serbian republic, said in our Sunday At Ten program: 
  [Begin Koljevic recording] In my opinion, today we witnessed 
the greatest provocation since the beginning of the war in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the international community 
insisted on stopping the war at any price, regardless of the 
political solution that would ensue, and regardless of how long 
the political talks would take. However, in an attempt to 
manipulate and, particularly, to stage massacres, the Muslim 
side has done something that, despite repeated attempts, has not 
occurred up until now. Massacres have been staged in Sarajevo 
on two consecutive days; today we were able to see this clearly 
from the photographs available to us and yesterday it was 
possible to deduce from the information available that our side 
had not opened fire. 
  Why do I say that this is the most dramatic event? Because 
it took place on two consecutive days, because the first 
[massacre in Dobrinja] took place during the negotiations at the 
airport that aimed at furthering mutual trust. Moreover, this 
entire scandalous Bosnia-Herzegovina war chronicle happened five 
days before the Geneva conference scheduled for 10 February. I 
think, hope, and believe that Europe will find the strength to 
learn its lesson from such manipulation, and that it will 
finally accuse, or at least condemn, the side guilty of 
continuing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael 
Rose on Sunday said that analysis had been completed but it was 
impossible to say which of the warring sides had on Saturday 
fired a mortar shell on an open air market in Sarajevo, killing 
68 people and wounding nearly 200. REUTER said that General 
Rose had visited the market on Sunday together with UNPROFOR 
Commander for the former Yugoslavia, Gen. Jean Cot, and civilian 
head of UNPROFOR Yasushi Akashi to inspect `the mortar crater 
and surrounding shrapnel holes.' The UNPROFOR officials were 
accompanied by Sarajevo's Muslim Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic 
and Bosnian Muslim Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. Akashi 
was quoted by the AFP as saying there were some suspicions but 
it could not be said with certainty who was responsible for the 
tragedy. 
  The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically rejected the 
Bosnian Muslim accusations that Bosnian Serb troops were 
responsible for the crime, and it called for an urgent 
investigation to be carried out by a joint commission of 
representatives of UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serb and the Muslim 
sides. The proposal was turned down by the Muslims. 
  After visiting the market in Sarajevo, Akashi and General 
Cot 
went to meet with the Bosnian Muslim presidency, according to 
the AFP. The two officials are to leave Sarajevo on Sunday 
afternoon, according to the same source. Representative of the 
office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sergio 
Mele on Sunday said the evacuation of the wounded had begun. 
  Mele said that U.N. armoured personnel carriers were being 
used to take the wounded from city hospitals to the airport. He 
said 58 wounded were expected to be evacuated.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina's embassy 
in Vienna charged Sunday [6 February] that the UN Security 
Council was responsible "de facto" for the latest bloody attacks 
in Sarajevo by failing to carry out air strikes on the Serb 
besiegers. "The Security Council is empowered to prevent 
attacks on safe havens (in Bosnia-Herzegovina), which can be 
done by taking any action necessary, including air strikes," the 
embassy said in a statement published Sunday after a mortar 
attack on a Sarajevo market Saturday killed 66 and wounded 200. 
  The Bosnian capital is one of six UN-designated "safe 
havens" 
in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic. 
  "The international community has also pledged to prevent any 
further strangulation of the city of Sarajevo," the statement 
added. "It stands to reason that by not using its full powers 
and commitments, the Security Council in fact supports the 
aggressor and encourages his crimes." 
  Differing with the UN, the embassy went on to say that an 
attack on a food line in the suburb of Dobrinja on Friday killed 
12 people and wounded 40. Latest figures from the UN Protection 
Force in Sarajevo put the number of deaths at 10. It added that 
the mortar shells which exploded at Dobrinja "were fired in a 
precise way at the line of people waiting for humanitarian aid." 
  The statement confirmed that 66 people were killed when a 
shell hit the Markale marketplace in Sarajevo on Saturday.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb military 
sources on Sunday evening said there were indications that the 
Muslim side is responsible for the massacre which occured in 
Sarajevo on Saturday, when 68 people were killed and nearly 200 
wounded. There are indications that the projectile which hit 
the market in Sarajevo could have been fired from the positions 
of the Muslim Army's Second Motorized Brigade, two to three 
kilometers north-east of Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources 
told TANJUG. 
  The Bosnian Serbs on Saturday categorically denied being 
responsible for the crime, and called for the immediate setting 
up of a joint commission of representatives of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Serb and Muslim sides to 
investigate the crime. The proposal was turned down by the 
Muslim side. UNPROFOR military experts have analyzed the crater 
left by the shell but have not so far been able to determine for 
sure from which side the shell was fired. 
  U.N. military observers at the Bosnian Serb military command 
at Lukavica and Bosnian Serb military sources agree on one point 
-- that the number of casualties is too high to have been caused 
by a single 120mm mortar shell.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" statement by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the </F>
Serbian republic assembly, to Novi Sad Television Dnevnik on 6 
Feb; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] What is certain is that the Serbs are not the 
perpetrators [of the massacre in Sarajevo]. In addition to the 
routine investigation that we conducted immediately after 
learning what happened at the produce market in Sarajevo, we 
also carried out an additional investigation, and we can say 
with certainty that the Serbs did not do this and that the 
Serbian side did not gain any political advantage. 
  It is impossible to grasp that the Muslims would do 
something 
like this, and usually when we know that it was not us we are 
inclined to blame the other side. We have reached certain 
conclusions that a third side exists that is very interested in 
massacres such as this one happening, as certain political aims 
of foreign factors in former Bosnia-Herzegovina are thereby 
achieved. This said, we cannot today identify this side. There 
are many parties interested in preventing closer relations 
between the Serbs and the Muslims. They wanted to undermine 
these talks precisely at the moment when we were making positive 
progress on establishing trust between Serbs and Muslims, and 
when we were close to an agreement similar to the one signed 
with the Croats. We cannot now say that we cannot exclude the 
possibility of this being the Muslim side, but one thing is 
certain, and that is that the Serbs did not do this [sentence as 
heard].

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 7 (AFP) -- Sixteen people wounded by a 
shell that crashed into a Sarajevo market over the weekend were 
to be evacuated to hospitals in Italy and Germany on Monday [7 
February], UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Regugees] 
medical coordinator Genevieve Begkoyian said. She said the 
victims, among some 200 people injured by the Saturday blast 
that also killed 68, would be transported to Ancona, Italy, 
where officials have offered 10 hospital beds. The remainder 
would be transported to American hospitals in Germany. 
  On Sunday, 50 wounded people and 74 family members were 
evacuated from the Bosnian capital. Among the wounded were 24 
people injured in the market blast and a similar attack on a 
food line on Friday. The rest of the injured had been on a 
waiting list for evacuation. Begkoyian said only mothers of the 
victims were allowed to accompany them as their fathers must 
fulfill their military obligation. She said 96 of those wounded 
by the market attack are being treated at the city's Kosevo 
hospital and 31 others are at the French hospital. She said 
those slightly injured by the blast have been sent home and many 
have been amputated. 
  Begkoyian said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
is also seeking to evacuate 160 additional patients from 
Sarajevo, most of them suffering from kidney problems. 
  In Germany, a spokeswoman at the the Ramstein US airbase 
near 
Kaiserslautern said the victims were expected to arrive around 
6:00 p.m. (1700 GMT). According to a spokesman at the Frankfurt 
airbase handling humanitarian aid to Bosnia, among those due to 
arrive would be between 12 and 20 stretcher cases. 
  Sunday evening three planeloads of Sarajevo wounded and 
their 
relatives arrived at Ramstein. They comprised 35 stretcher 
cases, 15 walking wounded and 79 relatives, the spokeswoman 
said. The wounded were taken to the US hospital at Landstuhl 
near Ramstein.

  [Cutovic] These were mortar and howitzer shells, as well as 
projectiles from BST [expansion unknown]. We do not have any

  [Text] According to the latest information from Dobrinja 
Hospital, this morning in Dobrinja, Chetnik shells killed eight 
people, including two children, and 26 people were seriously or 
lightly wounded. After they were administered first aid, six 
people were immediately transferred to the City Hospital, and 
others received medical treatment and were then hospitalized in 
Dobrinja Hospital. The first results of the expert military 
teams in Dobrinja say that three shells were fired. Two of them 
were certainly of 120-mm caliber and the third is assumed to be 
of 82 mm. As the first results of the investigation show, the 
bombs were fired from Lukavica, that is, the Chetnik lair of the 
Slobodan Princip-Seljo Barracks. I hope we shall be able to 
provide even more precise information in our next newscast.

  [Text] Zvornik, 6 February (TANJUG) -- The cochairmen of 
the peace conference on former Yugoslavia, David Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, held talks with republic of Srpska [RS] 
President Radovan Karadzic in Zvornik this evening. The talks 
were also attended by RS Vice President Nikola Koljevic and the 
RS Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik. After the talks, held 
behind closed doors, Stoltenberg said that the talks were part 
of continued peace efforts and "especially of the efforts to 
pull Sarajevo out of the current war situation." Asked to give 
more details about the talks, Stoltenberg stressed that "Bosnian 
Serbs have agreed to a separate peace for Sarajevo." 
  Stoltenberg stressed that it "cannot be said that the event 
in Sarajevo market yesterday is the only reason, but it is one 
more reason for attempting to establish peace in the area." He 
said he believed that the events in Sarajevo could affect the 
course of the Geneva negotiations "in that they are an 
indication of how necessary it is to establish peace." 
  In reference to the Serb side's readiness to help to find 
those responsible for the plight of the civilians in the 
Sarajevo market, Lord Owen stressed that it was necessary to 
find the offenders but that he was, as he put it, skeptical 
about it. "Despite, or rather because of it, I think it is 
necessary to bring about peace in that part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a step toward total peace," Owen said. He 
went on to add that "at this juncture we must not forget Mostar 
and the victims there." 
  In Owen's view, an agreement on UN control of Sarajevo 
"could 
mean a great deal." "The acceptance of UN administration over 
Sarajevo would be the first step toward peace," he said. Owen 
stressed that he expected "all three sides to understand that we 
have to make a resolute step toward peace" at forthcoming 
negotiations in Geneva. 
  RS President Radovan Karadzic said that the talks were very 
useful and stressed that this was "perhaps the final stage of an 
agreement on peace in Sarajevo." Karadzic said that the Serb 
side had hoped that "the pacification of Sarajevo would be a 
part of the overall solution but that it was ready to take part 
in negotiations on Sarajevo even before the final political 
solution was reached." He said that the talks on Sarajevo 
represented "a logical step in our constant efforts to improve 
the situation in Sarajevo." 
  Karadzic said that the Serb side demanded "a very strict 
investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo by a joint 
commission" and went on to say that this was not the first time 
that this had happened. Karadzic said that those "who planned 
such tragedies expected too much from them" but that despite 
everything peace talks must be resumed. Asked about the 
pacification of Sarajevo, Karadzic said that "all this should be 
discussed during the work on an acceptable solution for 
Sarajevo." 
  "The best thing would be for the citizens of Sarajevo to get 
peace and for Sarajevo to become an open city. All conditions 
will be discussed during the negotiations," Karadzic explained.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale </F>
on 6 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] The meeting with Mr. Akashi, Generals Cot and Rose, 
attempting to find a solution for a long-term and stable 
cease-fire in the Sarajevo region, passed in a constructive 
atmosphere. The Serbian side is very interested in complete 
calm in Sarajevo, and I believe that we are well on the way to 
achieving a cease-fire that would begin tomorrow, providing of 
course, that the Muslim side accepts it. 
  The Muslim side has one motive for accepting the cease-fire 
in Sarajevo, and one motive for not accepting the cease-fire. 
The motive for accepting is that this would free a large part 
of its forces that they could deploy on the fronts in central 
Bosnia against the Croats, and on other fronts throughout Bosnia 
against the Serbs. The motive for not accepting the cease-fire 
is that Sarajevo would stop being an international media hit, 
that is, the Muslims would lose a significant trump card, which 
they use to apply international pressure to the Serbs. However, 
I hope that reasons for accepting a just and stable cease-fire 
will prevail.

  [Text] [Announcer] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, held talks on two occasions today 
with the special envoy of the UN secretary general, Yasushi 
Akashi. Let us now hear what President Alija Izetbegovic and 
Yasushi Akashi had to say following their second meeting this 
evening. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just completed the 
second round of talks with Mr. Akashi and his aides, including 
General Rose and General Cot, and a number of other aides, seven 
or eight of them. The gist is that we will agree to a 
cease-fire in the Sarajevo region under the irrevocable 
condition that the Serb side withdraws its heavy artillery from 
around the city that they use to kill the population. As far as 
I was told, and it is my understanding, the Serb side refuses to 
accept this, but wants some kind of soft monitoring or something 
of that kind, which will not stop them from pounding the town 
again. We will not accept this. 
  I asked Akashi to explain how else can they [the Serbs] 
explain their insistence on keeping the artillery on the hills 
around the city but for a desire to kill the people whenever 
they wish. For, it is obvious that such actions have no 
military importance and serve to threaten the civilian 
population of the city. I am convinced that out of the people 
killed so far, 99 percent were civilians, the civilian 
population of the city which, as you know, includes 1,300 
children and a very small number of soldiers. In other words, 
they have no military reason to keep their artillery there. 
  The talks will resume tomorrow. We will insist on the 
withdrawal of their artillery and on placing it under effective 
supervision. Whether the other side will accept this I do not 
know, but we will tell the world about it. The world must learn 
what the artillery means, what its task is. I repeat, its task 
is exclusively to blackmail the town and to kill its civilian 
population. They want to keep the town dead, for as long as 
there is artillery above the town we cannot open our schools, 
shops, and people cannot go about their business in a normal way. 
  This is more or less our stand. I think that they [UNPROFOR] 
can find out [who committed the carnage] but they are playing 
the game of not wanting to offend the other side, they avoid 
saying so. There is reliable evidence that the shell was fired 
from Donji Biosak. Our experts have established this as has 
UNPROFOR, but it refuses to present it as evidence. In other 
words, from deep behind Serb lines. They most probably want to 
leave enough room for maneuver to avoid taking any action that 
will tie them down. 
  What can be said with certainty -- and I think our and their 
experts have come to the same conclusion, but they [UNPROFOR] 
refuse to say so -- is that understandably, the shell came from 
Serb positions. In any case, all of the million shells that 
have destroyed the city, originated from the same positions. 
Why should this one be an exception? [end recording] 
  [Akashi -- announcer-read] Ladies and gentlemen, since this 
morning I have continued my efforts with the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency and the Serb side, and with the Bosnian Presidency 
again to achieve a total and immediate cease-fire. I regret to 
say that these talks have not resulted in an agreement. We will 
have to resume efforts to find a solution acceptable to both 
sides. 
  One of the main differences is that the Bosnian Government 
wants the Serb artillery and heavy weapons deployed around 
Sarajevo to be withdrawn and to be placed under UNPROFOR 
supervision. This is not acceptable to the Serbs, as they put 
it. I put forward some of my own ideas but no agreement was 
possible. 
  Who do you think is responsible for the failure of the 
talks? 
  I do not wish to blame any of the sides, but I want to 
stress 
that I will continue to talk until a solution acceptable to both 
sides is reached. The Serbs insist that regardless of its 
nature, the agreement on Sarajevo should be the first step 
toward reaching an agreement on the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This is one of their conditions.

  "The major difference is that the Bosnian side wants to have 
the withdrawal of artillery, mortars and other heavy weapons out 
of range of the city of Sarajevo and be placed under UNPROFOR 
(UN Protection Force) control. This is not acceptable for the

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- Chief of the U.N. 
operation in former Yugoslavia Yakushi Akashi has said that 
U.N.-mediated talks on a truce between Bosnia's Serbs and 
Moslems collapsed on Sunday [6 February]. REUTERS quoted Akashi 
as saying he had tried to mediate and effect a total and 
immediate ceasefire, but that vast differences existed between 
the conditions made by the two confronted sides. He regretted 
that no agreement had resulted at this time, but refused to 
attribute responsibility to either side. 
  The Japanese diplomat added that the biggest obstacle to an 
agreement was the Moslems' insistence that the Serbs withdraw 
their artillery from positions around Sarajevo and place it 
under U.N. control. Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic had drafted a truce agreement at their meeting earlier 
in the day. The truce, subject to Moslem approval on Sunday 
evening, was to take effect at 10 A.M. local time (09:00 G.M.T.) 
on Monday, February 7.

  [Text] [Announcer] Malcolm Rifkind, the defense minister 
[title as received] of Great Britain, visited Sarajevo today. 
The guest from Britain conveyed his government's deep concern 
for the situation in Sarajevo and the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Edin Nusic has the report. 
  [Nusic] Malcolm Rifkind and [Bosnian Prime Minister] Haris 
Silajdzic gave statements following the talks. The British 
defense minister conveyed the concern of the British Government 
for the situation in Sarajevo, and added: 
  [Begin Rifkind recording, in English, fading to superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that the whole world was 
struck by the horror that befell the citizens of Sarajevo. 
  Although this is the most serious incident, we believe that 
it is by no means the only one. The citizens of Sarajevo have 
for a long time faced fatal agony and fear. We must consider 
every possibility of improving the situation and restoring peace 
to Sarajevo and the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as 
possible. [end recording] 
  [Nusic] Prime Minister Silajdzic had the following to say 
about his talks with the British defense minister: 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] The visit by Mr. Rifkind, the 
defense minister of Great Britain, shows Great Britain's current 
new interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I tried to explain our 
situation concerning humanitarian aid and in the field. 
Humanitarian problems are huge, and they must not be forgotten 
under the circumstances, although it is very difficult to speak 
about humanitarian convoys after 66 deaths and 196 injuries 
yesterday. We said that we believe that force should be used 
against those who stop humanitarian convoys and, of course, 
against those who kill civilians in the way that it was done 
yesterday. We said that we have been waging a war against 
fascism on our own for two years now, and that Europe surprised 
us. Fascism is an issue that concerns all of us, something we 
all must fight. I hope that after this visit, which is well 
timed, this will no longer be so. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Rasusic and Faruk Hajder from the </F>
Information Service of the 4th Army Corps] 
  [Text] Exploiting the attention of the international media 
and politicians on Sarajevo to the maximum, members of the HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] and the Croatian Army continued their 
merciless artillery attacks on the lines of separation and 
civilian parts of the free parts of the Mostar commune. A 
sudden mortar attack on Blagaj from the positions of the Ustasha 
forces left one person dead. Several persons were wounded in 
this treacherous attack. The central part of the town and the 
defense lines in this part of the town were subjected to 
intensified attacks by the aggressor all day yesterday and 
throughout the night. 
  Over 80 tank and mortar shells were fired on the central 
part 
of the town from the enemy's positions on the left side [of the 
Neretva River]. These were accompanied by constant fire from 
infantry weapons. In addition to firing dozens of mortar 
projectiles on the Bijelo Polje region yesterday, the Ustashas 
attacked civilian targets in Potoci with multiple rocket 
launchers on three occasions yesterday, killing two civilians. 
  At 0815 this morning, Ustashas fired several projectiles 
from 
multiple rocket launcher on the city center, fortunately, 
without tragic consequences. Despite the stepped up attacks by 
the aggressor, the attained defense lines remain unchanged and 
are under the control of the 4th corps.

In the last 24 hours it attacked civilian targets in Sije, 
Kalosevic, and Potocic. It is amassing huge forces and hardware 
in the zone of operations of the independent battalion [word

a new offensive that is being prepared by the criminal Mladic, 
using troops from Serbia and Russian and other mercenaries. 
Tanks and tank drivers are being brought from the so-called

agents, and surface-to-surface missiles, and carry out assaults, 
and subversive and terrorist actions. 
  It is known for sure that the aggressor has concentrated 
toward our units the forces of more than 20,000 troops, over 200 
tanks and heavy artillery pieces, and two surface-to-surface 
systems. Air support would be provided by aircraft from Banja 
Luka and Serbia.

  [Excerpts] The Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats 
opened to the strains of the Lijepa Nasa [Our Lovely Land] 
anthem, [Croatia's national anthem], following which it paid 
tribute to the people killed in yesterday's massacre. The 
assembly was then addressed by Tvrtko Mevkestoc, president of 
the Croat Coordination Council. The assembly's main task is to 
define the general social position of Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, to chart the course of future social trends, 
and to articulate the Croats' national aims. 
  An undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is in the vital interests of 
the Croatian people, Nevjestic stressed. The participants in 
the assembly were also addressed by Zvonimir Separovic on behalf 
of the World Victimology Society. Speaking about the conflict 
between the Croats and Muslims, Separovic pointed out that this 
had only helped the aggressor and that the conflict ought to be 
brought to an immediate end. He also read out a joint statement 
by the Academies of Sciences of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
In it, the members of the academies demand an immediate end to 
hostilities, peace, freedom of movement, and the return of 
refugees to their homes. 
  The Assembly of Croats is a historic event as it is 
beneficial to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as to its citizens, 
Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency said in 
his address. The assembly's decisions are of decisive 
importance as life in the future Bosnia-Herzegovina will depend 
on them, Miro Lazovic, president [speaker] of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly says. [passage omitted] 
  The former allies have clashed and have started hating each 
other, thus enabling the aggressors to do whatever they want. 
The Croatian people's interests lie in coexistence with others. 
At the moment, a defensive and just war is being waged in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ivo Komsic [member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
presidency] said. 
  [Begin Komsic recording] We certainly know that one war was 
imposed on us whereas some of our people [Croats] should also 
take the blame for our being drawn into the second war. We 
demonstrated that we can organize defense by defending ourselves 
from Serbian aggression. In many areas Croatian fighters should 
take credit for the fact that the Serbian aggressor has not 
crushed the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina and completed its 
conquest. [end recording] 
  Following the debate, during the course of which a large 
number of those present voiced their views, the assembly passed 
a declaration demanding an immediate end to the war since an 
undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
the Croats desire. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Croats regard 
territorial conquest and its legalization by any side as 
unacceptable and impermissible. This is why the participants in 
the assembly demand that the plan for the partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must not be signed. Even if it is signed the 
Croats will regard it as null and void, as stated in the 
declaration adopted at today's Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
Croats.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister of foreign </F>
relations and interrepublican cooperation of the Croat republic 
of Herceg-Bosna, by an unidentified correspondent; correspondent 
in studio and Akmadzic in Siroki Brijeg--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Our guest this evening is Mile 
Akmadzic, minister of foreign relations and interrepublican 
cooperation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Mr. 
Akmadzic, good evening. 
  [Akmadzic] Good evening. 
  [Correspondent] We are pleased to welcome you once again to 
our program. It seems that many interesting things have been 
happening on the eve of the next round of the Geneva talks that 
are scheduled for 8 February. It looks as if Croats are in 
vogue once again. Several events have led to the conclusion 
that considerable pressure has been exerted on the Croatian 
negotiating team and on the Croatian state. Do you have the 
same feeling? 
  [Akmadzic] I have this feeling, naturally. However, I would 
like to say that pressure is being put on all the three warring 
sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. on all the sides that are 
taking part in the Geneva talks, which means the three warring 
sides as well as the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
and Croatia, which are also taking part in the Geneva talks. 
The pressure has been planned in advance. It has been exerted 
for a long time, and I believe that it has now been intensified 
to a certain extent. 
  [Correspondent] Within the context of this pressure, the 
most 
interesting thing was the recent speculations about sanctions 
against Croatia. How would you comment on yesterday's 
accusations and claims contained in Butrus-Ghali's report, i.e. 
his letter to the UN Security Council about members of the 
Croatian Army fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina? As we could see, 
the figure in question is 3,000-5,000 Croatian soldiers. 
  [Akmadzic] This first started with a letter to the UN 
Security Council president by Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic 
in which Silajdzic accused Croatia of armed intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have -- I personally and many other 
structures in Herceg-Bosna and in the Republic of Croatia -- 
strongly denied these accusations. There are no regular units of 
the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is certain; this 
is absolutely true. Namely, there are only volunteers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who reported as individuals or as small 
organized groups to defend their homes, their homeland, and 
their families in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This is, therefore, not an intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
from the outside. I said before that both Mr. Izetbegovic and 
Mr. Silajdzic have known this. They knew about the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina a year ago, and the situation has not changed 
since. There is nothing new. The new situation is that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been suffering defeats in its [word 
indistinct] actions against the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. 
Because of this, it is looking for excuses and looking to 
justify itself by accusing the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] Either way, the fact is that everyone has 
taken yesterday's Butrus-Ghali letter seriously. For instance, 
the Danish foreign minister has already announced that Denmark 
would call for sanctions against the Republic of Croatia at the 
next session in Brussels on 7 and 8 February. On the one side, 
we have your stand, and on the other is a report from the United 
Nations. 
  [Akmadzic] Of course, what the world is thinking is what is 
important and not just what has been happening. I must say that 
the present situation -- in this respect -- is very serious. I 
believe, however, that the world will see and that we will prove 
-- through international observers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] -- that there are no regular units in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Likewise, the world cannot consider 
individuals from Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the Croatian 
Army's presence and then threaten Croatia in some way. I would 
not say that sanctions will be introduced in Croatia. I think 
that this would be too strong. There will be no sanctions. The 
international community is aware of the fact that it would be a 
very bad and risky move on their part. I do believe, however, 
that the Croatian delegation will be cautioned in Geneva, and I 
hope it will end on this. 
  [Correspondent] But could this pressure result in the 
Croatian side's concessions at the Geneva talks -- in unwanted 
concessions? 
  [Akmadzic] There is no question of any concessions. As far 
as the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, 
we are negotiating about a lasting political solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are not talking about an isolated case 
that happened and that could [word indistinct] such fundamental 
decisions as the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There will 
be no concessions. The international community -- both the EU 
and the United Nations -- gave us their support so that what has 
been promised and given as concession [words indistinct] will 
remain and that the Croatian side will keep to that. There will 
be no fresh concessions or demands for fresh concessions. 
  [Correspondent] In our program last night, we talked to Mr. 
Jelic about the Croatian convention, which is to take place on 
Sunday, 6 February in Sarajevo. You are also going to be there. 
What information do you have about the convention? What are 
its objectives, and what stance will you take there? 
  [Akmadzic] I have registered to take part at the Croat 
convention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would call it a so-called 
convention. It is really a gathering of Croats that has no 
legitimacy with regard to representing the Croat people. 
[passage omitted] 
  I will travel to Sarajevo on 5 February to take part in the 
talks between the Croatian, Muslim, and Serbian people--which 
regularly take place at the airport. These talks on 
reestablishing mutual trust are held on the level of a working 
group. If it is possible for me to stay the night in Sarajevo, 
if UNPROFOR gives me permission, I will stay and attend the 
convention. As things stand now, however, this is not likely. 
It seems that it will not be possible for me to stay. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that there will be nobody 
from 
Herceg-Bosna in Sarajevo? 
  [Akmadzic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna has requested 
that UNPROFOR allow some people to attend, the people who were 
designated to attend by the coordination committee in Sarajevo 
that convened the gathering. We have not received any reply to 
confirm that we will be allowed to enter Sarajevo. If we do 
receive it, we will go to Sarajevo, of course. 
  You also mentioned the extraordinary session of the Chamber 
of Deputies, our fifth session so far, scheduled to take place 
in Livno on 8 February. This will be a session of the extended 
Chamber of Deputies. I would, in fact, call it a real 
convention, although it is not officially a convention. All 
current political and military questions, the current military 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be discussed there. The 
Chamber of Deputies is expected to make some very concrete 
decisions, outlining the direction for the Croatian people at 
this very important historic period, at this very difficult time 
for the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Croatian people are facing aggression, first by the 
Serbs 
and then also by the Muslims, in continuous fighting that has 
been going on for a long time. We must make a decision on the 
course of our further activities. We must decide which path to 
take in the search for peace because our lasting objective is 
peace, not peace at any cost, but peace within the limits of 
justice and what the Croatian people deserve. 
  [Correspondent] Let us get back to the gathering in Sarajevo 
on 6 February. You said it was a so-called Croatian convention. 
The fact is that nobody is entitled to prevent Croats who 
remain outside of the borders of Herceg-Bosna from trying to 
articulate their interests. They really are in a specific 
position, and it is a fact that a number of Croats remain 
outside of Herceg-Bosna, outside of the region that will 
probably be one of the three parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They 
do have the right to articulate their interests. What objections 
do you have to their gathering? Why are they [word indistinct]? 
  [Akmadzic] I said so-called convention because the word 
convention usually means a legislative body. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister by an </F>
unidentified annnouncer -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Our guest tonight is Mate Granic, the 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Croatia. Good 
evening to you. What should Croatia expect from tomorrow's 
meeting of EU [European Union] foreign ministers in Brussels, or 
to put it briefly, will sanctions [against Croatia] be imposed 
or not. 
  [Granic] I believe they will not be imposed. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was placed on the agenda earlier. We are 
aware that Denmark will put forward a proposal to impose 
sanctions but we believe that this will not take place. It is 
possible that they will discuss taking away some privileges. We 
believe that the meeting tomorrow will end with a declaration 
that will call on all three sides to do all they can to achieve 
a cease-fire and an agreement. Additional pressure on Croatia 
is also possible but I believe that sanctions are not probable. 
  [Announcer] Two days ago Croatia received a statement issued 
by the UN Security Council chairman. What is Croatia preparing 
as a reply. I noticed that the Council for National Defense and 
Security held a meeting yesterday. What now? 
  [Granic] The statement issued by the UN Security Council 
chairman represents additional pressure on all three sides, 
Croatia in particular. It followed a letter sent by Haris 
Silajdzic [on the regular Croatian Army's intervention in 
Bosnia] and was accompanied by pressure exerted by Islamic 
states. The statement is toned down in comparison to its first 
version. Its intention is of course to press the Croatian side 
in doing its best to reach a lasting cease-fire and an agreement 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia is prepared to do all it can 
because of its own interests, the interests of the whole region, 
and the international situation. We were urged to do so in all 
other contacts we had, by the Holy See, and all other important 
states. 
  Croatia will accept the supervision of the borders and it 
has 
proposed the supervision of all borders between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and all the other borders of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia has also proposed the supervision of 
all of its military units, and it will propose the same to the 
Croatian Defense Council, telling them to invite international 
inspections. We claim that 2,000 volunteers from Croatia are 
fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect their homes, but in 
any case, we will accept all the results of the inspections. It 
is known that regular Croatian Army units are deployed in the 
area north of Dubrovnik [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje 
municipality] in agreement with the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government. In any case, Croatia is prepared to do everything 
it can to continue negotiations on an unconditional cease-fire 
and to achieve a lasting solution as soon as possible. 
  [Announcer] You visited Rome and the Vatican this week. This 
was followed by a report from Rome that Italian Foreign Minister 
Andreatta was prepared to host a meeting between President 
Tudjman and President Izetbegovic. 
  [Granic] Yes, the Italian side is prepared to organize such 
a 
meeting and we have conveyed this to the Bosnian side. It was 
agreed that Prime Minister Silajdzic and I will hold a meeting 
in Geneva on Wednesday. If any progress is made a decision will 
be made on a meeting at the highest level and its venue. 
  [Announcer] A meeting of Bosnian Croats is taking place in 
Sarajevo today and another one will take place in Livno. You 
will go to Livno as President Tudjman's envoy. What do you 
think about the meeting in Sarajevo. 
  [Granic] We understand the delicate and specific position of 
the Croats in Sarajevo, and that is why the meeting in Livno is 
taking place as a meeting of all Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- those expelled, those in free 
territory, or those in Posavina -- are in different positions in 
comparison to the Croats in Sarajevo. I hope that these 
meetings will be meetings of unity of the Croatian nation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not harm Croatian state 
policy and the basic Croatian interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Announcer] After the next round of Geneva negotiations 
there 
is another meeting in store. The deputy prime minister of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is expected to visit Zagreb on 12 
February. 
  [Granic] Yes, this meeting will take place in Zagreb, and it 
is planned that an initial meeting of the joint commissions for 
finding missing persons, humanitarian issues, and refugees will 
take place. We will also discuss all details about the opening 
of [diplomatic] offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, and all other 
important political issues in connection with the normalization 
of Serb-Croat relations will be on the agenda. 
  Tomorrow we expect to sign seven agreements with the 
Slovenian Government, and as early as tomorrow we will also 
resume negotiations on all unresolved issues with the Slovenian 
Government.

60-90 meter radius, causing 70-80 percent mortal injuries. It 
can be fired from a distance of three to four kilometers. [end

  [Text] A delegation of the Slovene Government, headed by 
Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, has arrived on a one-day 
official visit to the Republic of Croatia. The Slovene 
delegation was welcomed and greeted by Croatian Prime Minister 
Nikica Valentic in front of Banski Dvori [offices of Croatian 
Government in Zagreb] with all state honors. The two prime 
ministers and their delegations have begun talks behind closed 
doors in Banski Dvori. 
  Prime Ministers Drnovsek and Valentic are expected to sign 
several agreements: on employment, on cooperation in education 
and culture, on reciprocal implementation of court decisions in 
criminal law, on legal aid in civic and criminal issues, on sea 
fishing, and on economic and trade relations and cooperation 
between Croatia and Slovenia. 
  Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek and Foreign Minister

  [Text] Knin, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- Croatian forces on Sunday 
resumed attacks on Serb defence lines in the north Dalmatian 
front, the Bosnian Serb command said on Sunday [6 February]. 
Intensive mortar, cannon and tank fire was opened on the region 
of Smiljcici, Kasici (west of Benkovac) and on the villages in 
the Novigrad hinterland. The attacks wounded one Serb soldier, 
and inflicted considerable material damage on civilian targets, 
thus forcing the Serb troops to respond. 
  The Croatian forces also staged provocative attacks on the 
Skradin hinterland, the Drnis front and the area of Plasko in 
Lika while, in the other parts of the front, the warring sides 
observed the ceasefire. The Croatians launched offensive 
actions despite the Christmas ceasefire, which was agreed late 
last year and extended on two occasions. It remains in force 
until February 28. The republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) was 
proclaimed a U.N. protected area (UNPA) and, under the Vance 
plan, 14,000 U.N. peacekeepers were sent there in early 1992. 
The plan called for an end to the fighting between Croatian 
army and the local Serbs. R.S.K. was proclaimed by the local 
Serbs in territories where they are in the majority in response 
to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav 
federation.

  [Text] [Announcer] We telephoned Mario Nobilo [in New York] 
this evening and asked him to explain his alleged statement 
regarding an attack on Serbs in the occupied Croatian 
territories in case sanctions are introduced [against Croatia]. 
May we just warn that this statement orbited the entire world 
via REUTERS and caused considerable concern among the 
international public. Here is the explanation of our UN 
ambassador: 
  [Begin Nobilo recording] The threat that Croatia will 
declare 
war against Krajina if sanctions are introduced was simplified 
and taken out of context. Journalists insisted on knowing what 
would happen if sanctions were to be introduced. My opinion is 
that sanctions would move Croatia and the entire region closer 
to war. Apart from this, they would create a new wave of 
refugees throughout Europe, and disturb the balance of forces 
because Serbs would then be in a more favorable position with 
all the unforeseeable consequences this would entail. Croatia, 
as the victim of aggression, would find it difficult to accept 
sanctions as far as its morale is concerned. 
  In any case, both the Bosnian ambassador and I are trying to 
place this whole new situation within the context of successful 
talks expected at the next round of Croatian-Muslim talks on the 
settlement of the remaining controversial matters. [end

  [Excerpts] We have just received the following statement 
from the Office of the President of the Republic: 
  The presidential Council of Defense and National Security 
held its 36th session last night [4 February] with Franjo 
Tudjman, the president of the Republic of Croatia, in the chair. 
The council examined the current foreign-political situation in 
connection with the resolution of the Croatian Assembly passed 
on 2 February 1994, and the presidential statement of the UNSC 
[UN Security Council] of 3 February this year. Having heard the 
report of Foreign Minister Mate Granic on his return from 
official visits to Italy and the Vatican and diplomatic contacts 
with other countries, the council adopted the following 
conclusions after a discussion on these and other matters: 
  1. The council thoroughly examined the UNSC presidential 
statement and decided to take all necessary steps in order that 
all controversial issues resulting from this statement be 
explained to the UNSC regarding the implementation of the demand 
concerning the Republic of Croatia. The aim is to enable the UN 
secretary general -- within the fixed deadline -- to submit to 
the UNSC an authoritative report based on facts. 
  2. The Council assessed that the UNSC presidential statement 
was adopted on the basis of an unjust and unsubstantiated 
request by Haris Silajdzic, and accusations of the involvement 
of 30,000 members of the Croatian Army in the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina supported by some Islamic countries, with the 
clear aim of exerting international pressure on the Republic of 
Croatia and on all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order 
that a political solution be found. 
  In connection with this the council said that Croatia -- in 
line with its constitutional provisions and the agreement on 
friendship and cooperation, signed by the president of the 
Republic of Croatia and the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency on 12 July 1992, has supported the defense efforts of 
the Croatian and Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the 
beginning of the Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
thus preventing Bosnia in its entirety from becoming part of 
greater Serbia. Croatia also accepted over half a million 
refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and is today caring for 282,000 
mostly Muslim refugees. 
  3. The presidential Defense and National Security Council 
was 
surprised to hear both the Sarajevo Government accusations and 
the UNSC presidential statement -- considering that Croatia, 
judging by the general recognition on behalf of international 
factors -- showed the highest level of cooperation in its 
efforts aimed at ending the war and finding a political solution 
to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Council maintains that Croatia should persevere in its 
peace-making policy. The aim of such a policy is to ensure the 
integrity of the Croatian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is 
threatened by both Serb and Muslim aggression, this being in the 
interest of both the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the security of the Croatian state. 
  In this connection the council draws attention to the need 
for the international community to take effective steps toward 
ending the war caused by the Serbian aggression, and toward 
ending the offensive of Muslim Armed Forces against Croatian 
areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in central Bosnia where 
tens of thousands of Croatian civilians are threatened in some 
enclaves. 
  4. Concerning the accusations that Croatian Army elements 
are 
involved in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The council stresses 
that the Croatian Army units are deployed only in the border 
area between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, above Dubrovnik 
toward Stolac and Neretva [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje 
municipality]. They are holding defense lines against the Serbs 
in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement on friendship 
and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The 
council reiterated that Croatia had allowed about 2,000 
volunteer soldiers of Bosnia-Herzegovina origin to go to help 
their [Croat] kin in Bosnia in order to protect them from 
aggression and ethnic cleansing. 
  The world is aware that the volunteers, deployed in HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] units, did not engage in any 
operations to capture territories that belong to somebody else, 
but only defended their centuries-old hearths. The Croatian 
public has supported them in this because they and their 
compatriots from those areas [Herzeg-Bosna] had joined Croatian 
Army ranks to defend Croatia from the Yugo-Communist and Serbian 
aggression. 
  In comparison to Croatian volunteers, three times more 
Mojahedin fundamentalists from foreign states are fighting on 
the Muslim side. Not only Croatia but Europe as well is worried 
by the growth and strengthening of fundamentalism. 
  5. Concerning the allegations that regular Croatian Army 
units are deployed in central and southern Bosnia. The Defense 
Ministry of the Republic of Croatia will propose necessary steps 
in line with the demands made in the UNSC presidential 
statement. Croatia once again expresses its preparedness and 
calls for the international community to establish the real 
situation and the validity of the allegations. Further 
conclusions of the UNSC should be based on this. 
  If the Muslim forces do not halt the offensive in central 
Bosnia, the Assembly's Chamber of Deputies believes that the 
government and the president of the Republic of Croatia should 
review and reconsider current diplomatic relations between the 
Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, 
in line with their assessment, take all adequate steps. 
  The council calls for an immediate and unconditional 
cease-fire and the resumption of talks in order to reach an 
agreement between Croats and Muslims in line with the proposal 
of the contractual agreement -- on establishing a lasting and 
permanent peace between the Croat and Bosnian Muslim nations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on the basis of further coexistence -- 
tabled by President Tudjman at a meeting with the Bosnian 
[Muslim] delegation in Bonn on 10 January 1994. 
  If these efforts yield no results, Croatia should reconsider 
all relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the 
government of the Republic of Croatia has been given the task of 
drawing up a list of all Bosnia-Herzegovina representative 
offices and organizations active in the Republic of Croatia. 
The council believes that it is untenable that the government 
in Sarajevo should use the territory of the Republic of Croatia 
to plan and organize logistical support for its military 
actions, which result in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of 
Croats [in Bosnia]. 
  The council demands of the international community to 
proclaim the threatened Croat areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
protected areas, and help secure the survival of the Croatian 
nation. 
  The council has accepted the proposal to join the NATO 
program Partnership for Peace, and lends its support to 
Croatia's intention to join the process. In connection with 
this, the Foreign Affairs Ministry has been charged with drawing 
up a final proposal on this and taking concrete steps. [passage 
omitted] 
  The council was informed about the steps taken to implement 
the declaration on the normalization of relations between 
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was noted 
that the declaration should be implemented immediately, without 
any speculation in that respect. The council put a special 
stress on the fact that the agreement in principle on the 
normalization of relations between Croats and Serbs is not 
directed against Muslims. On the contrary, the agreement should 
be seen as a contribution to the efforts to reach a speedier 
solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The council lends its full support to the efforts of the 
Croatian Government to solve all disputed issues with the 
neighboring Republic of Slovenia as soon as possible, and it 
points to the need to deal simultaneously with the problem of 
the Piran Bay and connecting Croatia with Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the </F>
Confederation for an Independent Poland, by correspondent Jerzy 
Palosz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Palosz] You are the author of the concept of the 
"Intersea bloc"--that is, an alliance of East European states 
that could constitute a counterbalance to Russia. Is that 
project still in the cards today, after the Russian election? 
  [Moczulski] Of course it is. I would not overestimate the 
outcome of the recent Russian election. We will probably react 
to the results of the forthcoming March elections in Ukraine 
with similarly mixed feelings. Another election is scheduled to 
take place in Hungary, and its outcome could also be worrying. 
Nevertheless, I would not overestimate the significance of these 
phenomena because they only represent peculiar paroxysms of the 
historical process. In our part of Europe, historical 
developments do not occur in a linear progression. To use an 
expression from the realm of meteorological science, you could 
say that they develop in a turbulent manner. In addition, 
accidental factors are often instrumental in bringing about 
significant effects. 
  However, all of that does not alter the fact that Russia is 
currently undergoing giant transformations. Immediately after 
Yeltsin's unfortunate solution of his quarrel with parliament, I 
voiced the opinion that that was the beginning of the end for 
Yeltsin. The results of the election seem to confirm this. The 
latest developments should not be seen as a solution but as an 
even graver complication of the existing problem. Together with 
the deteriorating economic situation and the increasingly 
difficult living conditions of the population, the election 
results suggest that the revolutionary processes in Russia will 
continue to intensify.... 
  [Palosz] But that does not apply to Russia alone.... 
  [Moczulski] The entire area of postcommunist East Europe and 
North Asia is currently the scene of great revolutionary 
ransformations which, fortunately, have not yet assumed 
particularly brutal forms, except in former Yugoslavia and parts 
of Transcaucasia. I trust that the brutalization of the 
revolution will not spread to the remaining postcommunist 
countries, but we must be prepared, also in Poland, for the 
possibility of a spread of popular mass movements that will be 
largely spontaneous and can lead to a brutalization of the 
chosen methods of action. Unfortunately, such are is the law of 
history. 
  There was a chance to carry out the inevitable changes in 
those countries in a calm and controlled manner. However, the 
elites that have seized power there are on the whole not mature 
enough to handle the tasks that face them, and they were unable 
to muster enough imagination to cope with the intricacies of the 
situation. Even Hungarians, who were arguably best at managing 
their situation, could still develop problems as a result of the 
unforeseen development provided by the death of Premier Antall. 
In Poland, four successive Solidarity governments lost the 
nation's support. Regardless of its intentions, the present 
left-wing government is not likely to be equal to the task, 
either, if only as a result of the disproportion between 
election promises and the realities of the situation. 
  [Palosz] From the very moment of the establishment of the 
Third Republic, our diplomats have consistently endeavored to 
tie Poland to NATO, have they not? 
  [Moczulski] That goal is set purely as a propaganda move, 
not as a realistic target. Poland's accession to NATO, if 
effected in a way guaranteeing us genuine security, would mean 
that our country would be included in the NATO military system. 
To date, NATO has not even managed to embrace the former GDR 
within that system. Even if the West was ultimately to prefer 
the concept that Russia must be opposed by the application of 
the strategy of shifting NATO eastward, we would have to wait at 
least 10 years before such a decision could be put into 
practice, and its realization would cost at least $100 billion, 
if not more. On the other hand, if NATO's military structure is 
not shifted to the east but Poland nevertheless receives 
political guarantees of security, we could face a truly macabre 
prospect. If we were indeed to encounter an aggressive attack 
from the east, we would then find ourselves in the foreground of 
NATO operations. These would entail the use of missiles and air 
force units because NATO would then probably apply the tactic of 
the notorious "200 small thermonuclear strikes." For us, such 
defense would be a worse calamity than an outright defeat. 
Today the question of NATO's political guarantees has only 
political and psychological significance. It can be seen as a 
test for the West and a test for Russia. On the other hand, 
viewed as a policy that should actually be capable of ensuring 
our genuine security, it is entirely devoid of any rationale and 
has been so from the beginning. 
  [Palosz] So is the threat from the east greater now, after 
the Russian election? 
  [Moczulski] I do not think so. That threat arises from the 
constant principle present in the Russian political thought: 
The interest of the Empire is more important than any domestic 
problems. Of course, Russia is not doomed to subscribe to that 
principle forever. However, its ruling elites must come to 
realize that the goal of creating a better life for the Russian 
people is more important than the ambition to expand Russia's 
borders to reach the warm seas. The whole problem is that 
Russia refuses to understand this, and that is why revolutions 
have been erupting there roughly every 60-70 years--sometimes 
initiated at the top of the social scale (Aleksandr II) and 
sometimes at the bottom (the Bolsheviks). Will Russia 
eventually move in the direction of resolving its internal 
problems? There are no reasons whatsoever to believe that it 
will. Let us remember the illusory hopes that arose after 1918, 
envisaging an end to Russia's imperial policies with the 
collapse of the system of czardom. All of that does not mean, 
however, that we are right now in danger of being invaded. It 
is true that there is a certain tendency to favor direct 
invasion, which can be observed in Russia's policy toward 
Estonia, in the Transcaucasia, and in the Crimea. Nevertheless, 
it still does not mean that we can expect the Kremlin to issue a 
decision for the Red Army to march westward. Instead, we should 
rather expect a tendency to "export" unrest. For example, the 
military formations in the region of Krolewiec [Kaliningrad], 
which today are still a regular, orderly army, tomorrow could 
well disintegrate into disorderly but still superbly armed gangs 
of brigands. However, there is an even graver danger facing us 
in the long run: that Russia will rebuild its military power 
and Russians will still harbor a sense of having been wronged. 
The sense of having been wronged is subjective; the Russian 
people will recall that, even in their own living memory, the 
frontiers of their empire extended as far as the Elbe, whereas 
now they stop somewhere near Smolensk. Thus, we will have the 
ground ready for the emergence of a phenomenon similar to the 
"Hitler syndrome," which could have disastrous consequences also 
for Russia itself. 
  [Palosz] So what course of action would you suggest? 
  [Moczulski] I suggest the idea of integrating the countries 
of the proposed "Intersea bloc" along the Warsaw-Kiev axis. 
This will provide the desirable geopolitical potential situated 
west of Russia, large enough to be capable of effective 
self-defense in economic, cultural, and military terms. The 
best protection against invasion is a defense wall or, to be 
precise, the awareness of the existence of such a wall. Having 
built their own Great Wall, the Chinese concluded: The wall is 
not there to protect us physically against invasion. It is 
there to remind the potential aggressors that invasion is out of 
the question.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Maja Narbutt in Vilnius: "The Devil Is in the </F>
Details"] 
  [Text] Poland and Lithuania have for a long time now been 
jointly declaring their desire to sign a treaty. For many 
months, in fact on the occasion of every official visit, it has 
been stressed that a treaty will be signed before long. Smiling 
politicians, posing for pictures together, claim that agreement 
has already been reached and that only a few details need to be 
discussed. However, as the wise French saying goes, the devil is 
in the details. Most probably it was this devil who is to blame 
for the fact that the treaty has not yet been signed. 
  Of course, during the talks in Vilnius between President 
Walesa's envoy and [Lithuanian President] Algirdas Brazauskas, 
details were not discussed because presidents or their envoys do 
not usually discuss such matters. Therefore, whether this 
treaty will really be signed will be decided in the fifth round 
of formal negotiations. 
  The laconic statements of politicians on Thursday [3 
February] seem to suggest, however, that a major step forward 
has been made. Both sides probably agreed on a compromise-- 
Poland because it agreed that the evaluation of the past will be 
included not in a separate declaration but in the treaty's 
preamble, and Lithuania because it probably worded this 
evaluation of the past in such a way as to make it acceptable 
for us. The final statements concerning the evaluation of 
history are very important, not only for moral but also for 
pragmatic reasons. The evaluation of Polish-Lithuanian 
relations during the 20 years after World War I affects the 
present regulations concerning ownership issues of Poles living 
in the Vilnius region. 
  It is still an open question whether a compromise reached by 
politicians will be generally accepted--first of all in 
Lithuania. Andrzej Zakrzewski is not entirely right when he 
speaks about "political folklore" in the context of Lithuanian 
accusations concerning the "Polish invasion of the Vilnius 
region." Such terms are used not only by Lithuanian informal 
groupings and organizations, such as the notoriously anti-Polish 
Vilnija, but also by political elites. No matter what, we 
cannot say that the parliamentary opposition headed by Vytautas 
Landsbergis is political folklore. Therefore, it will not be 
until another three weeks have passed that we will be able to 
say whether a breakthrough has been achieved in relations 
between Vilnius and Warsaw.

  [Text] Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister 
of finance, has tendered his resignation from the post he holds. 
This ensued after the prime minister did not accept the proposal 
of the deputy prime minister regarding, above all, a clear 
outline of the division of prerogatives within the government. 
  Marek Borowski, justifying his decision, said that the 
so-called Deputy Finance Stefan Kawalec affair ought to be seen 
in a wider context, which is made up of many statements by the 
prime minister. In the view of Marek Borowski, they undermine 
his activity as deputy prime minister. Marek Borowski viewed 
the statements of the prime minister as a particular vote of no 
confidence. 
  We still do not know if Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has 
accepted Marek Borowski's resignation.

  [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] We have a guest in our 
studio, Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. Has Prime Minister Pawlak accepted your resignation? 
  [Borowski] Good evening, madam, good evening ladies and 
gentlemen. Well, this I do not know. I formally handed in my 
resignation; whether he accepted it, I don't know. Judging from 
the announcements, probably not yet. 
  [Bukowska] Is it possible that you could withdraw this 
resignation, and, if so, on what conditions? To put it more 
simply: Does the list of conditions you have already set have to 
be met from beginning to end, or is there any room for 
compromise? 
  [Borowski] I would like to say that this list of conditions, 
if that is what one can call them, is more in the form of 
proposals for a clear division of remits within the government, 
proposals of a demarcation of responsibilities, and proposals 
that envisage the fact that it is ministers who are responsible 
for what happens in their ministries, that one cannot go over 
their heads and dismiss individual officials. These proposals 
were already a compromise, and I personally believe it would be 
difficult to cross anything off that list. Anyway, to my mind, 
they are not in any way insulting to the prime minister; they 
are quite acceptable. 
  [Bukowska] Is this a conflict between your and Prime 
Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, or is it a conflict on the SLD-PSL [Democratic 
Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] axis? 
  [Borowski] I would be the last to want to fan a large-scale 
conflict. I would very much not want this to happen. But I 
said at the conference, and it was even quoted here: This is not 
an isolated case; this is not a matter of the person of the 
dismissed deputy minister; this is a matter of principle, a 
matter of loyalty in our cooperation. As I have already said, 
one can hold various posts, but one can only save one's face. 
And, in this sense, one could say that this is a conflict 
between the prime minister and me. But, taking into account the 
matters of remits of which I spoke, the conlict is of a much 
broader nature. 
  [Bukowska] In your opinion, does the coalition have a chance 
of surviving this crisis? 
  [Borowski] I would like to believe so, if I am to be honest. 
Anyway, I have already said this at a news conference: There are 
no irreplaceable people. I think a different solution could be 
found. 
  [Bukowska] You also said during your news conference that 
you 
and the prime minister have different viewpoints regarding the 
economy. Was it really thus? How did this manifest itself? 
  [Borowski] I must say that this is not perhaps so very 
strange. It would be difficult for the SLD and the PSL to have 
identical viewpoints on the economy. It is well known that 
there are differences. There were also differences between the 
prime minister and me. But the way of agreeing stands was not 
good. That is, it just did not exist. In other words, the 
statements of various ministers, sometimes even unfortunately 
those of the prime minster himself, diverged from the agreed 
line. 
  [Bukowska] Were these differences so weighty, so 
significant, that it was impossible to come to any 
understanding? What were the most important ones? 
  [Borowski] Well, that is just it. We sought agreement and, 
with Chairman Kwasniewski, we found...[pauses] I must say that 
Chairman Kwasniewski showed great energy in this case and great 
initiative in order to bring about such agreement. 
  [Bukowska] I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, but you 
have not answered my question. I was asking about differences 
in matters of the economy. 
  [Borowski] Well you see, madam, this is the sort of question 
that, should I begin to give answers to, I could basically spoil 
what lies before us, and it is not my intention to raise the 
temperature in this situation. We have to discuss these 
differences calmly among ourselves. 
  [Bukowska] Finally, one more question. Are these really two 
parties that merely govern together, or is it really a coalition? 
  [Borowski] Well, certain problems do come about, as do 
various difficulties. This is one of them. Chairman 
Kwasniewski said, I think yesterday, that there is no real 
alternative to this coalition in the Sejm, and I think that, to 
a great extent, he is right. There is, after all, a certain 
closeness between the PSL and the SLD. I personally have a great 
deal of liking for the PSL deputies, and I believe that this 
coalition should find a way out of this situation. 
  [Bukowska] Thank you very much for the interview. The guest 
was Marek Borowski.

  [Text] [Announcer] After a meeting with ministers from the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], the Sejm speaker, Jozef Oleksy, 
declared that he did not exclude a breakup of the coalition. 
  Monika Olejnik has just returned from the Sejm: 
  [Olejnik] Certain ministers who took part in this discussion 
are also of the opinion that a breakup of the coalition is 
possible. The majority of them say that Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak will accept Marek Borowski's resignation. Some say that, 
despite everything, the coalition will survive. Aleksander 
Kwasniewski told journalists that there was already a new name, 
but he said this half in jest, half seriously. However, quite 
seriously, Marek Borowski said: 
  [Begin recording] [Borowski] I will certainly not gather up 
my belongings and will not go home because there are tasks to be 
fulfilled. 
  [Olejnik] Does the Parliamentary Floor Group bear you a 
grudge for resigning, or does it accept your arguments? 
  [Borowski] I think it accepts them. The group that debated 
[the situation] agreed that these were conditions that could be 
accepted. 
  [Olejnik] Mr. [Deputy] Prime Minister, do you not think it 
egoistic? You are resigning; this is a threat to the SLD 
coalition with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Do you not 
exclude the possibility that this could be a threat? 
  [Borowski] If certain trends are developing the wrong way, 
there remains only the question of when one should do it [as 
heard]--whether to wait until it becomes difficult to patch up 
anything or whether to do it earlier. I came to the conclusion 
that earlier is better. There may have been those who thought 
it would have been better to wait. [end recording] 
  [Olejnik] Marek Borowski told journalists that the 
conditions 
set by the SLD were the conditions of all of the ministers who 
belong to the SLD. The SLD was waiting all the time for a 
telephone call from Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. It is not 
known whether this will happen tomorrow, the day after, or the 
day after that.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "Aleksander Kwasniewski's </F>
Conference; This Is Not a Problem of Kawalec"] 
  [Text] The Thursday [3 February] meeting with Aleksander 
Kwasniewski has attracted the greatest number of journalists 
(and deputies) in many months. The leader of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD] said that the problem does not mainly 
concern all personnel issues, but the understanding of the 
government's activities, the method of administering the 
country, and discussion over the concept of the economy. "It is 
serious," admitted Kwasniewski and indirectly confirmed that 
Marek Borowski discussed the possibility of handing in his 
resignation ("he is an obstinate man"). However, he was of the 
opinion that he would be able to get everything cleared up 
during his "meeting of three" with Waldemar Pawlak and Marek 
Borowski, scheduled for Thursday [3 February] evening. 
  "The entire affair is unfortunate, and it was done in the 
wrong manner, but today conclusions must be drawn from it," said 
the SLD leader. "It is not a problem of resignation, which only 
expedited the difficult talks within the coalition, but a 
problem of the continuation of the economic policy, which is put 
under question by statements such as those made by Minister 
Podkanski on the agreement with General Motors." Kwasniewski 
refused to answer the question of what he would do if he did not 
manage to reach agreement. He merely added that Borowski is a 
very competent and valuable politician and that the main problem 
of the coalition should be the budget (which should take the 
economic realities into account) and not disputes over the 
cadres. Asked about the resignation of Under Secretary Miroslaw 
Stec from the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], he said 
that the SLD expects URM to submit a concept for the state 
administration and that this will also be discussed in the talks 
with the prime minister. 
  "It is a difficult coalition, and I have never concealed 
this; however, there is no alternative to it. Therefore, we 
must act in such a way as to allow the government to act 
efficiently," said Aleksander Kwasniewski. 
  Deputies of the Polish Peasant Party (such as Tadeusz Sytek 
and Piotr Chojnacki) believe that the prime minister did what he 
should have done and that he does not have to explain his 
decision to anyone. Jerzy Pistelok told us that this issue is 
not of very great importance; it had been discussed in the 
Presidium of the government before, and Minister Borowski should 
have demanded that resignation himself. Becaise he did not do 
this, the prime minister had the right to recall the deputy 
minister because he had made too many mistakes. "We are 
absolutely sure that the prime minister's decision was correct, 
and so are many colleagues in the SLD," said Pistelok. 
  Jozef Oleksy and Aleksander Kwasniewski denied that there 
were such discussions because this issue was not important 
enough to discuss in the coalition. 
  "I believe that Prime Minister Pawlak feels good when he 
makes cadre changes," we learned from former Prime Minister 
Hanna Suchocka, of the Democratic Union [UD]. "He probably 
thinks that this is how his power is expressed. The prime 
minister may recall a deputy minister without the consent of the 
minister, but only when he asks that the deputy minister be 
recalled and the minister does not want to do that. This 
coalition has the will to survive, and this is why it will not 
present the PSL with the bill." 
  "The SLD will not present the bill to the PSL for fear of 
the 
coalition's integrity; however, it will show that something 
important has happened," says UD's Grazyna Staniszewska. "The 
reason the prime minister has acted this way is that the PSL has 
an SLD complex; another reason was the pressure on Waldemar 
Pawlak, exerted at various levels, to prepare posts for people 
who are already waiting for them." 
  "This is a family quarrel, and we will not meddle in it," 
said Wojciech Borowik, of Union of Labor. "If a bill is 
presented, it will not be very large because both parties want 
the coalition to survive."

  [Text] Prime Minister [Waldemar] Pawlak is breaking the 
coalition agreement, said Aleksander Kwasniewski in his opening 
speech at the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] 
Main Council session. The Main Council is discussing the 
situation that has arisen in Poland after yesterday's 
resignation of Marek Borowski, the [deputy prime minister] and 
finance minister. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Kwasniewski added that the SdRP 
wanted to implement the joint economic program that was agreed 
upon with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. The Left is waiting 
for a similar declaration on behalf of the Peasant Party 
members. In Kwasniewski's opinion, some of the prime minister's 
actions and those of members from his entourage allow one to 
think that the desire to retain the coalition is uneven. 
  [Begin Kwasniewski recording] A lack of respect for 
coalition 
decisions, making decisions without the knowledge of the 
appropriate ministers, statements that are far from our jointly 
implemented economic and political concept, all these are 
pointers that make one want to ask out loud: What is going on? 
[end recording] 
  [Correspondent] In their speeches, members of the council 
complained that the government lacked a cadre policy: State 
officials are being replaced by party colleagues of the Peasant 
Party. Of the eight SLD governors who have recently taken up 
their posts, only one is a member of the SdRP; the remainder are 
specialists, said Kwasniewski.

<F P=106> [Article by E.K.: "Aleksander Kwasniewski on the Functioning </F>
of the Coalition; Pawlak Breaks the Agreement"] 
  [Text] For the first time, the Chief Council [RN] of the 
Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] closed its 
session to journalists. On Saturday, 5 February, its members 
discussed the political situation that developed as a result of 
the government crisis and the resignation submitted by Marek 
Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of finance. 
  Snatches of statements by Aleksander Kwasniewski, Marek 
Borowski, and council members, which we were able to overhear 
near the door, suggested that the participants expressed severe 
criticism of the cadre, information, economic, and financial 
policy of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]; they also seemed to be 
pointing to a lack of cooperation within the coalition. Talks 
between both coalition parties will probably be held on Monday 
[7 February]. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski officially confirmed that Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak is obviously breaching the provisions 
of the coalition agreement. Three of its four provisions are 
being implemented as the PSL partners wish. 
  "We will not tolerate this state of affairs any longer," 
said 
Kwasniewski. According to him, the governing coalition will not 
break up if the intentions of both sides are clear, if both 
sides are willing to communicate with each other and implement a 
jointly agreed economic program. 
  "We have expressed such an intention, and we maintain it; we 
would like a similar declaration on the part of the PSL so that 
we will know whether they want the coalition to remain as much 
as we do. Some activities lead us to believe that the 
determination to maintain it is different," said Kwasniewski, 
referring to the present conflict and to earlier disputes 
between the coalition partners. 
  Despite these accusations, the SdRP chairman conceded that 
the discussion is characterized by a desire to reach an 
agreement within the coalition. Kwasniewski described Marek 
Borowski as the best person for the role of the finance minister 
now and a man responsible for the economy. 
  When SdRP General Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski was 
presenting 
the conclusions of the almost five-hour discussion of the 
authorities of his party, he was much more cautious in choosing 
his words: "The SdRP decided that there is no need to escalate 
this conflict. The existing problems can be resolved among the 
members of the presidiums of both parties. It is desirable that 
both parties take a more precise joint stance on the issues of 
the economy, the budget, privatization, information policy, the 
government, and the method of conducting the cadre policy. 
  He also admitted that there is no need to sign a new 
coalition agreement; however, as a result of the fact that it 
has not been kept, it is necessary to review the coalition's 
activities after 100 days of governing and to explain all doubts. 
  He said that it was with sorrow that the RN of the SdRP 
received the resignation of Marek Borowski; he added, however, 
that the deputy prime minister is not the only candidate of the 
SdRP for this post. Nevertheless, each person who comes after 
him will be in a more difficult situation. 
  "We do not want to die for anyone. We want Marek Borowski to 
be used in the further activities of the coalition, of the 
government. Everything is still possible." 
  As they finished their session, the SdRP leaders expressed 
the hope that they would be able to meet with the prime minister 
as early as last weekend, all the more so because, during his 
morning talk with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, he is reported to 
have said that he wants to ease the conflict. However, he will 
first have a talk with the PSL leadership. 
  "These will be talks that will explain everything to us," 
said Szmajdzinski.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozef Belcak, economic and commercial </F>
counselor at the Slovak Embassy in Warsaw, by correspondent Jan 
Bereza; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Bereza] What changes took place in Polish-Slovak 
trade relations after the creation of an independent Slovak 
Republic? 
  [Belcak] In past years our cooperation was conducted within 
the framework of the CEMA bloc. The decline in foreign trade 
turnover during the period of transformation of a centrally 
steered economy into a free market system is a phenomenon that 
is not exclusive to our countries. It is found throughout 
Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of developments that 
extended far beyond the creation of two independent states: the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. The value of trade exchange 
between Poland and Slovakia fell from $397 million in 1991 to 
less than $228 million in 1992. In the first quarter of 1993 
the value of exports from Slovakia to Poland was $23 million, 
while that of imports from Poland to Slovakia was $15.4 million. 
The current state of affairs in this field was the subject of 
talks between our respective deputy premiers in July last year. 
During the current visit [to Poland by Slovak President Kovac] 
we aim to attach much importance to economic questions. This is 
evidenced, among other things, by the personal composition of 
the Slovak delegation, which includes the chairman of the Slovak 
Industry and Commerce Chamber, the Minister of the Economy, and 
representatives of 11 individual companies. The schedule of the 
visit includes a meeting between President Michal Kovac and 
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairperson of the Polish National 
Bank. President Kovac will also meet with Polish businessmen, 
while yet another meeting at the Ministry of Industry and 
Commerce will be attended by ministers-heads of the following 
departments: Foreign Economic Cooperation, Transport and 
Maritime Economy, and the Central Planning Office. 
  [Bereza] What are the reasons responsible for the poor 
condition of Polish-Slovak economic cooperation to date? 
  [Belcak] I believe that the main reason is the lack of 
efficient exchange of information concerning our respective 
cooperation potential. We often import goods from distant 
places which we could easily be buying from one another--and 
that would involve lower transportation costs. We should not 
forget, either, that in certain parts of both Poland and 
Slovakia it is much easier to transport goods from across the 
Carpathian mountains than to carry them in from the more distant 
parts of our own respective countries. We share a very long 
stretch of state border--altogether 520 km--but there are only 
three border crossings along its entire length that have been 
adapted to cargo transportation. We should be offered more 
favorable terms of mutual trade exchange within the framework of 
the Visegrad Group and the GATT agreement. The present terms of 
our mutual trade exchange cannot possibly be viewed as 
satisfactory by either side. I hope that the trade turnover 
between Poland and Slovakia will double its value within the 
next two to three years. 
  [Bereza] How does Slovakia encourage potential foreign 
investors to invest their capital within its borders? 
  [Belcak] We offer a variety of incentives and preferential 
terms to foreign investors because we need their capital to make 
good use of our existing industrial enterprises and our highly 
trained professional cadres. To give you an example, in the 
parish of Banska Bystrica a bank with an input of foreign 
capital is entitled to a longer tax holiday than banks in other 
regions of the country. These matters are regulated centrally 
by means of parliamentary acts. For the time being, according 
to data for the first half of 1993, the value of foreign capital 
invested in Slovakia came to $320.4 million. The highest share 
in that amount is represented by Austrian investors (25.8 
percent); these are followed by Germans (18.2 percent), 
Americans (14.5 percent), Czechs (12 percent), and French 
(upward of 9 percent). 
  [Bereza] What can be done to enable Poles to join that 
group of leading investors? Following the announcement that 
interest rates will be raised in Poland, some businessmen are 
beginning to consider moving their companies to your country. 
  [Belcak] There is extensive unused potential in many areas 
of our economy: not only in industry but also in agriculture 
and the food economy. Work is currently in progress on setting 
up a joint Polish-Slovak chamber of industry and commerce, to be 
situated in Krakow, a city close to the Slovak border and also 
easily reached from other regions of Poland. Dynamic 
involvement on the part of specific enterprises is essential if 
we are to develop effective cooperation between corresponding

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Arms Industry; Protest Getting More </F>
Radical"] 
  [Text] All factories of the defense industry took 
part in a protest organized by the Interunion Strike Committee 
on 3 February. The eight-hour strike took place in 19 factories; 
the remaining 12 only put up flags, organized rallies, or had 
two to four hours of strike. The committee has announced that, 
if the government does not change its position, it will make the 
protest more radical. The government's view is that it did all 
it could, taking into account the budget situation, and that the 
strike "is proof of a lack of responsibility." 
  Negotiations between the Interunion Strike Committee (which 
includes the National Section of the Arms Industry of the 
Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity," the Trade 
Union of the Electromachine Industry, and the "Metalworkers" 
Federation) and the government on 1 February did not result in 
an agreement. The trade unions are demanding, among other 
things, additional resources for restructurings, establishing 
the level of government orders to be such that it would 
guarantee maintaining the country's defense readiness (about 5.5 
trillion zlotys), compensation in return for sustaining 
production readiness in case of war in 1990-93, salary increases 
that would compensate for price increases, and also securing 
preretirement pension benefits. "We are a country of hunger and 
neglect"--this is the way Stanislaw Glowacki, chief of the arms 
industry branch of "Solidarity," commented on the situation in 
the sector. 
  The Industry and Trade Ministry said that, during the talks, 
the government "presented realistic budget and legal 
possibilities of implementing the postulates; it presented 
positive effects of the industry's restructuring. The 
government also showed that there are possibilities of 
increasing budget means for 1994 for the arms industry." The 
ministry also added that the trade unions "rejected an offer to 
sign a protocol of agreement and failed to come up with 
alternative possibilities of solving the problem, limiting 
themselves to revindication." The ministry said "forcing 
changes in the budget by means of strikes" is the kind of 
behavior that "indicates a lack of responsibility."

  [Text] Today's session of the State Chamber Commission for 
International Relations was also attended by Foreign Minister 
Peterle. Regarding some criticism and various interpretations 
of Slovenia's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan, 
Peterle said that they were a result of lack of understanding of 
the matter. He emphasized that this plan envisages several 
groups of countries and corresponding procedures for their 
incorporation. A special procedure is envisaged for the former 
Warsaw Pact members, while a different procedure is envisaged 
for some other countries, among which is also Slovenia. 
Minister Peterle said that Slovenia is still waiting for the 
official reply of the NATO consultation council regarding the 
request to be included in the Partnership for Peace plan. The 
headquarters in Brussels have indicated that Slovenia's 
membership in the consultation council will only be possible 
when our country will sign the agreement on associate membership 
in the European Union, Lojze Peterle said.

<F P=106> [By Igor Saranovic] </F>
  [Text] Ljubljana, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- The Slovenian 
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee reports that NATO's 
interest in Slovenia is waning and that pleas by the country's 
political leadership that the nation soon be placed under NATO's 
umbrella have not produced the desired effect. NATO has 
dispatched delegations to Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga, Tirana, Sofia, 
Bucharest and Prague, but not to Ljubljana, to finalise 
agreements on its Partnership for Peace project. NATO's 
decision to give Ljubljana a wide berth has been received in 
Slovenia as a blow which has shaken even the most optimistic 
advocates of an easy integration into Western Europe. 
  The most vehement critic of Slovenia's current foreign 
policy, former Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, admits bitterly 
that the picture of untroubled relations between Slovenia and 
NATO is paling around the edges. "We are wrong to believe that 
Slovenia is steadily getting closer to Western European 
integrations. The fact alone that our state is still under the 
arms sales embargo (which is in force against all of former 
Yugoslavia) puts us squarely in the context of former 
Yugoslavia," says Rupel. 
  The Slovenian leadership has expected that association with 
the world's strongest alliance would automatically usher the 
national economy into the convertible currency markets by the 
back door. The recent first official hint that this breakaway 
Yugoslav republic might be willing to normalise relations with 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) is not regarded here as a victory 
of reason over political daydreaming, but as a logical result of 
Slovenia's wobbly international political and economic position. 
  Last year, Slovenia spurned Yugoslavia's offer of mutual 
recognition. 
  Slovenia, once the most highly industrialised Yugoslav 
republic, is inescapably turning into an economic, commercial 
and political cul-de-sac of Europe. Its leaders have recognised 
this only after the slap in the face administered by NATO, and 
have suddenly turned to Yugoslavia, the country which Slovenian 
authorities are persistently and ruthlessly denegrating at every 
turn.

  [Excerpt] Croatia will have paid off 14 million German 
marks of its debt to the Krsko nuclear power station by 5 
February. The remainder of the debt will be settled by 1 
August. If the neighboring country keeps to this agreement, 
then the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the supply of 
electricity to Croatia should have ended by the end of this 
week. Economics Ministers Maks Tajnikar and Nada Vidosevic 
agreed this at a meeting this morning in Otocec. [passage

  [Text] It is the duty of the Czech Republic to insure the 
safety standards of the nuclear power industry on its territory, 
and Austria has neither the right nor the duty to intervene in 
this matter. This was the indirect reaction of Vladimir Dlouhy, 
minister of trade and industry, to claims made by Peter 
Rosenstingl, the Austrian Freedom Party spokesman, that the 
Czech nuclear power industry was becoming an ever-more-serious 
safety hazard for the whole of Europe. 
  According to Minister Dlouhy, the causes of the fire at the 
Dukovany nuclear power station were of a routine nature and 
therefore should not be interpreted as evidence of the Czech 
Republic's obsolete technology and its failure to insure nuclear 
safety. Such a breakdown could happen anywhere. The fact that 
it has happened just now is rather unpleasant, added Vladimir 
Dlouhy.

<F P=106> [Article by "ina": "Police Authorities Are Drafting a List </F>
of All Journalists Who Have Written About Them"] 
  [Text] Prague--In mid-January, the Police Presidium 
requested from the district police directorates lists of the 
journalists with whom they collaborate. The presidium asked not 
only for the names of reporters who deal with security issues 
but also for their pen names or the indentation symbols they 
use. According to police spokesman Ales Svoboda, the requests 
have only been made by telephone so far; there is no written 
evidence of them. The spokesman said yesterday that the Police 
Presidium only wanted to update the current list of journalists. 
He denied any claims that the collection of names and symbols of 
the reporters was to serve for their persecution. 
  "It is only so that we know whom to invite to news 
conferences, for instance," he said. According to Svoboda, it 
is becoming ever more frequent that people call the police 
claiming to be journalists.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The first national commercial 
television station in the postsocialist countries is Nova, a 
Czech independent television company. You may be interested in 
the fact that the name Nova was chosen by a lady living in 
Bratislava. 
  The license was awarded by the Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council of the Czech Republic on 30 January 1993, 
and the deadline for starting the broadcast was yesterday [4 
February]. Nova is ambitious: It will broadcast on average 19 
hours a day, using the former F1 [federal television] channel. 
It will broadcast newsreels and current affairs programs, some 
documentaries, and entertainment and musical programs. To begin 
with, it owns broadcasting rights for more than 400 foreign 
films, which will be broadcast dubbed. Nova will use the 
opportunity to insert advertisements during film screenings, but 
only with the approval of the films' authors. Also, much is 
expected from daily morning programs. 
  An interesting program feature is a vox populi, a sort of 
television Hyde Park. In the Krone department store [in 
Prague], there is a television cabin where, for a fee of 10 
[Czech] korunas, you can record any message you wish. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to Vladimir Zelezny, the Nova director general, 
the 
viewers are expected to be average Czech citizens. There are no 
unnecessarily high expectations about their viewers, but they 
are not being underestimated, either. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 7 (AFP) -- European Community 
mediator Lord Owen was evasive Monday on the possibility of 
launching air strikes to retaliate against the weekend mortar 
attack in Sarajevo saying that only "a fool" would want such 
action. "Nobody but a fool wants air strikes but on the other 
hand nobody but a fool can go on tolerating the situation in 
which as many people can lose their lives as it happened 
Saturday in Sarajevo," Owen said following a meeting with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The mortar attack 
Saturday occurred in a crowded Sarajevo market killing 68 people 
and injuring about 200. 
  Owen said his meeting with Milosevic centered on what could 
be done to avoid a similar tragedy in the future. He added that 
the meeting to be held Thursday in Geneva between Bosnia's three 
warring parties -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "is not a 
meeting to discuss global peace settlement but to discuss 
confidence building measures." He said these measures would 
include setting up a "hot line" between the Serbs and Moslems 
that would lead to a demilitarization of the Sarajevo region.

  [Text] Rome, Feb 4 (AFP) -- Turkey and seven countries 
neighboring ex-Yugoslavia have agreed to meet Wednesday [9 
February] in Geneva with mediators David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg to discuss ways of ending the Bosnian conflict, Owen 
said here Friday [4 February]. 
  "It will be a private consultation. No communiques, no 
decisions. An open discussion between the ministers about the 
problems of the former Yougoslavia, and how regional voice can 
be raised to influence the outcome, bring an end to the fighting 
in Bosnia," Owen told a news conference. "None of the parties 
from the former Yugoslavia will be invited at this stage," he 
said, adding that if the talks proved "useful," the mediators 
might hold discussions later on "with the presidents of possibly 
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia." 
  Foreign ministers of the following nations would attend 
Wednesday: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, 
Romania, and Turkey. Owen, the European Community's mediator, 
who with Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, came here on the last leg 
of a tour of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, said the mediators felt 
"the European Union initiative and the negotiations over Bosnia 
now need to be discussed within the region and also the wider 
issues that affect the conference: Serb-Croat relations, the 
minorities, the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo." 
  Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta meanwhile said 
Bosnian Croats and Moslems might hold talks Wednesday in Rome. 
The talks could take place between the meeting, Monday and 
Tuesday, of European Community foreign ministers and Brussels, 
and the meeting of ex-Yugoslavia's neighbors, he said. 
Andreatta put the proposal to Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic on Thursday when they met here, he added. 
  Earlier, in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, Owne said 
international sanctions against Belgrade over its role in the 
war in Bosnia could not continue indefinitely. "We can't go on 
indefinitely asking countries quite far away from fighting to 
make sacrifices, if there is no readiness of the parties to make 
peace," he said. Bulgaria is one of the central European 
countries whose trade and economy have been badly hit by the 
United Nations embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the rump 
Yugoslavia. 
  "I do not favour lifting sanctions," Owen added. "It would 
be 
premature. But I don't think the status quo can carry on 
indefinitely." 
  Albania has expressed concern about the war spreading to 
Kosovo, the restive northern province of Serbia which has a 90 
percent Albanian population, or Macedonia, another former member 
of the Yugoslav federation.

of Yugoslavia's neighbours.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 5 (TANJUG) -- German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl on Saturday accused Croatian President Franjo Tudjman of 
violating international law by sending regular army troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and threatened to suspend all economic aid 
to Croatia. "Whoever changes borders through the use of force 
cannot count on the support of Germany," Kohl said in the so far 
sharpest statement addressed to Croatia, according to foreign 
news agencies. Kohl spoke at a meeting of around 200 ranking 
Western officials and security experts in Munich. Kohl, whose 
country had wholeheartedly supported Croatia's forcible 
secession from the former Yugoslav Federation, said he would 
"not support anyone who oversteps the limits of normal, 
acceptable behaviour under international law." 
  Germany was the one to push the then European Community into 
recognizing Croatia in early January 1992. The U.N. Security 
Council on Thursday threatened to introduce sanctions against 
Croatia because of the presence of its regular army troops in 
the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to U.N. estimates, between 3,000 and 5,000 regular 
Croatian Army troops are fighting on the side of Bosnian Croats 
against the Muslims.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The Spanish and Danish 
foreign ministers indicated Thursday [3 February] that a 
decision on sanctions against Croatia was imminent, as Zagreb 
continued to deny the presence of its troops in Bosnia. 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana issued his warning 
after meeting here with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. 
  Solana said that if reports of regular Croatian troops being 
involved in fighting in Bosnia turned out to be true, "the 
international community will have to seriously examine the 
issue" of sanctions, the Croatian news agency HINA reported. 
  Valentic rejected the charges and said that "the 
international community's pressure for a peaceful settlement 
must be applied evenly on all warring parties," the agency added. 
  Zagreb has acknowledged that up to 2,000 "volunteers" -- 
mostly Croats of Bosnian origin -- were fighting alongside 
Bosnian Croat (HVO) forces in Bosnia, but said that no active 
regular army troops were involved. 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said in Rome Thursday 
that although some of the Bosnia "volunteers" were former 
soldiers and officers, there were no regular Croatian forces 
serving there. 
  Zagreb had no intention of intervening in the Bosnian 
conflict, he said after a meeting with his Italian counterpart 
Beniamino Andreatta, adding that the number of volunteer 
fighters on the Moslem side was much higher. 
  Andreatta earlier told Italy's parliamentary foreign affairs 
committee that, if reports of the presence of regular Croatian 
troops in Bosnia were correct, there were dangers of a 
"substantial change in the attitude of the international 
community towards Croatia." 
  He added: "The position of Italy and other European 
countries, who have until now forcefully rejected calls for a 
lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, would 
risk being weakened." 
  Meanwhile in Copenhagen Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen said that "the United Nations should impose sanctions 
against Croatia because of its military involvement in Bosnia." 
  He said Denmark would appeal for sanctions at the European 
Community's foreign minister-level meeting in Brussels Monday, 
and would also propose, as an alternative, the lifting of 
Croatia's preferential trade status with the EC. 
  Although he admitted that opinions are divided within the 
EC, 
he said Denmark felt that the presence of Croatian troops in 
Bosnia "should not go unnoticed." 
  After his meeting with Valentic Thursday, Solana was to meet 
with UN special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi before 
heading back to Madrid. 
  He had earlier visited the Spanish UN peacekeeping 
contingent 
in Medjugorje, in southern Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 6 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia Foreign Ministry on Sunday lodged a sharp protest 
with the charge d'affaires of the German embassy in Belgrade in 
connection with the vandalizing of the building of the Yugoslav 
consulate general in Hamburg in violent demonstrations staged by 
Bosnian Muslims. Militant Bosnian Muslims organized the 
demonstrations without permission from local authorities, and 
stoned the building, breaking windows and damaging doors on it. 
  Ambassador in the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Zivadin 
Jovanovic 
said that the unprovoked demonstrations were violent, and the 
German side was responsible for the damages caused on the 
consulate building, the property of Yugoslavia. Ambassador 
Jovanovic requested of German authorities to open a thorough 
investigation, take adequate measures against the perpetrators 
of the violence, and secure all necessary conditions for the 
normal work and full security of the Yugoslav diplomatic and 
consular missions and representatives in Germany. 
  Charge d'affaires of the German embassy in Belgrade Gerhard 
Schwemgens said he regretted the deplorable incident, and 
promised he would communicate the Yugoslav protest to his 
government so that similar incidents would be prevented in 
future.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG)--Yugoslav Prime Minister 
Radoje Kontic received a letter today from the Russian 
Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the [FRY] Federal 
Information Ministry says in a statement. The letter reads: 
  "We wish to thank you for the great appreciation of the 
efforts Russia is making to alleviate the humanitarian situation 
in the FRY. I understand the difficulties that the people of 
your country are experiencing. We believe that an urgent 
political solution and the reaching of an acceptable 
comprehensive agreement between the three sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will bring about the lifting of sanctions 
against Yugoslavia. 
  ``The Russian side made energetic efforts during 1993 to try 
to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY, primarily in terms 
of supplying it with energy. Unfortunately, our repeated 
appeals to the UN Security Council sanctions committee, 
including the latest one of 10 December 1993, have so far not 
met with the necessary understanding. However, Russia intends 
to continue to insist on obtaining permits that would enable it 
to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY. In so doing, the 
recommendations by the president of the UN Security Council 
sanctions committee, of which we have informed you through the 
Russian Embassy in Belgrade, will be taken into consideration. 
  "For our part, we confirm our readiness to begin 
humanitarian 
deliveries of gas once the necessary permit has been obtained."

  [Text] Belgrade, 6 Feb (TANJUG) -- I condemn the crimes in 
Sarajevo with the utmost bitterness, said Republic of Serbia 
President Slobodan Milosevic in a statement to TANJUG today. 
  "The dead and injured in Sarajevo are not the victims of war 
but the victims of war criminals. We all expect that these 
criminals to be found in the very near future and put on trial 
for the crime they have committed." 
  "The revulsion felt by the Yugoslav and international public 
is justified, and I sincerely hope that no political reasons 
will hamper the rapid discovery of the criminals and diminish 
their responsibility," said Slobodan Milosevic, president of the 
Republic of Serbia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- This morning President 
of the Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic received Thorvald 
Stoltenberg and David Owen, the cochairmen of the Geneva 
conference. As the Serbian president's office has announced, 
they discussed the creation of conditions for restoring peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and the stabilization of 
the overall situation in the Yugoslav area. It was noted that 
the negotiating process has no alternative as the path toward 
peace, and that it should not be allowed to suspend the 
negotiations before a final peace agreement is reached. 
  They stressed the close link between lifting the sanctions 
against Serbia, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 
finding a peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and pointed 
to the forces still opposed to this. They also discussed the 
efforts for an overall normalization of relations in the 
Yugoslav area, and decided that the normalization of relations 
between Serbs and Croats is of great importance in that context. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part 
in the talks.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (TANJUG) -- The chairman of the 
Party of Serb Unity (SSJ), Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan, and the 
deputy chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
Aleksey Ivanovich Videnkin, at a news conference today made 
public an agreement on cooperation the two sides signed on 2 
February. According to the agreement, the SSJ and the LDP will 
establish economic, cultural, sports and, it was stressed, 
military cooperation "in the event of the endangering of the 
Serbian, Russian, or other Orthodox nations." 
  Raznjatovic stressed that cooperation between the two 
parties 
began when there were seven LDP members -- who are now in 
prominent posts in this party -- with his volunteers in Krajina. 
  Videnkin told journalists that the LDP had given Arkan "a 
secret electronic weapon" which is activated by "the fusion 
[spajanje] of protons and neutrons at high temperature." He 
pointed out that this weapon would be used if towns in Bosnia 
and Serbia were bombed and added that "the world does not yet 
know what force this weapon has." The LDP deputy chairman 
specified that this weapon acts in such a way that "in a few 
hours it can kill a person, without him knowing why he is 
dying." According to him, this same lethal weapon could be 
"used in small quantities and have a beneficial effect on 
people." He explained that "the secret weapon" had not reached 
the Serbian side through state channels, because neither the LDP 
nor the SSJ are ruling parties. 
  A laboratory where experiments are carried out and the 
professor who created the weapon, which, Videnkin said, was 
tried out successfully near Brcko recently, were also made 
available to Arkan. Asked where this weapon was, Raznjatovic 
stressed that "neither the weapon, which arrived in the form of 
a model, nor the laboratory, nor the professor, are on the 
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" and that the 
Yugoslav authorities know nothing of this. Arkan stated that 
this was a matter of a "weapon of peace," because it repels 
attacks and that next time it would probably be tested in Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Interview with newly elected Serbian Assembly Chairman </F>
Dragan Tomic by Spomenka Jovic in Belgrade on 5 Feb -- live] 
  [Text] [Jovic] Esteemed viewers, as we have already 
announced in our headlines, tonight the guest of Dnevnik is 
Dragam Tomic, chairman of the Serbian Assembly. Good evening. 
  [Tomic] Good evening. 
  [Jovic] Everyone who has watched the Serbian Assembly 
broadcasts is aware of this, but we will nevertheless remind 
viewers that in your capacity as head of a deputy caucus, you 
addressed the deputies and very clearly explained the Socialist 
Party of Serbia's [SPS] platform. 
  [Tomic] And not only the SPS's platform, but primarily 
President Milosevic's request that Serbian political forces join 
forces in a policy of peace, economic prosperity, and 
crime-fighting. I think this is the backbone and essence of the 
whole thing, and the views expressed in the parliament have 
confirmed this. 
  [Jovic] What could be seen from the broadcasts is that you 
have been given a good reception as new Serbian Assembly 
chairman; what we still do not know, but are sure to learn on 
Tuesday when the Assembly meets again, concerns the 
negotiations. This request actually marked the end of the 
previous session. The negotiations with the head of deputy 
caucuses, how are they going? 
  [Tomic] Well, the negotiations and talks will continue 
during this break. On Tuesday [8 February] we will probably be 
completely ready to continue our work; we primarily need to 
elect a deputy assembly chairman, then working bodies, then we 
have the election of the secretary general, and finally, we 
should elect the deputies to the Chamber of Republics in the 
Federal Assembly. These tasks will mark an end to constituting 
the republican Assembly, which will be prepared in such a way 
that it will be capable of carrying on with the important part 
of the tasks in its domain, and with what the people of this 
republic, the people of Serbia, expect. 
  [Jovic] For the time being, are all the heads, all the 
deputy caucuses, participating in the negotiations? 
  [Tomic] Well, you know, the talks are collective, they are 
discussing things among themselves, in the opposition bloc, 
among the representatives of the SPS, and so forth. 
Consultations are underway. We expect that Monday [7 February] 
will be particularly busy, and that in the course of the day we 
will conclude most of these talks, negotiations, and 
preparations for the session that will then begin. 
  [Jovic] So everything can be reviewed at the session on 
Tuesday, while it is still hot, so to speak? 
  [Tomic] Yes. Of course, we still have a few things to do on 
Tuesday morning, but you know how these things are; these 
activities take time, they will probably continue through 
Tuesday, depending on the number and type of proposals, whether 
all these proposals are to be coordinated, agreed upon, whether 
all of them will be on the agenda, and so forth. 
  [Jovic] Thank you very much. It is important that we have 
started rolling. 
  [Tomic] Absolutely. 
  [Jovic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Ljubisa Stankovic report: "The Order Comes From </F>
777"] 
  [Text] VECER Editorial Staff yesterday received exclusive 
information about the charges made by the District Court in 
Skopje against the 10 accused with attempting to create an 
Albanian paramilitary army in Macedonia. Their names are as 
follows: Mithad Emini (born 1945), Hasan Agushi (1960), Resmi 
Ejupi (1948), Selam Elmazi (1948), Shinazi Redjepi (1954), 
Husein Haskaj (1951), Burim Murtezani (1964), Akif Demiri 
(1941), Abdiselam Arslani (1946), and Eugen Cami. 
  According to the charges, Emini, Agushi, Ejupi, Elmazi, and 
Redjepi created a hostile association in October and November 
1991 under the name "Headquarters for National Defense." 
Together with Haskaj, Arslani, Murtezani, Demiri, and Cami, 
they undertook a number of actions last November with the aim of 
using violence against the state order of the Republic of 
Macedonia. 
  The accusation stated that, in the course of October and 
November 1991, the accused Hasan, Ejupi, Elmazi, Cami, and 
Redjepi had meetings in the house of Elmazi in Gostivar, and 
also in the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] offices, where 
it was decided to create paramilitary formations on the 
initiative of Mithad Emini and Hasan Agushi. A body called 
"Headquarters for National Defense" was designated as in 
command. They also decided to provide technical equipment, and 
personal data of those who were meant to join those formations, 
as well as to determine the positions of the top leadership of 
the Headquarters. 
  Mithad Emini was elected commander of the Headquarters, 
Resmi 
Ejupi was his deputy, Selam Elmazi was in charge of military 
issues, Shinasi Redjepi of the police, and Hasan Agushi was 
appointed military counselor. During December 1991 and January 
the next year the accused Agushi and Redjepi contacted Emini, 
who informed them about financial assistance, and they decided 
to supply themselves with computers from Switzerland with the 
help of the accused Elmazi and Murtezani. The computers, as the 
charges said, were meant for the preparation of programs on 
paramilitary formations, which would be exclusively composed of 
Albanians living on the territory of Macedonia. After the group 
had provided the computers (PC 486/33 -- HD 200 color and PC 286 
-- HD 80 without a keyboard), they assembled them in Demiri's 
house in the village of Cegrane, where they created a computer 
center in which Agushi worked, while Murtezani was appointed the 
headquarters' courier. 
  In July 1992 the programs were thoroughly prepared in this 
center, and information gathered for the creation of the 
paramilitary army. "The Main Headquarters" was coded "777" and 
two battalions were formed for the Kumanovo district under the 
code "444455," three battalions for Skopje coded "333344" and 
"366," as well as two detachments coded "303" and "404." Three 
battalions for Tetovo district coded "222," "233," and "244" 
were created, as well as two detachments coded "102" and "202." 
There were also three battalions for Gostivar under the codes 
"122," "133," and "377," and two detachments coded "210" and 
"206," as well as a base coded "888." One battalion was planned 
for the Struga district under the code "111" and one battalion 
for Debar coded "555." Of course, commands were also appointed 
for these paramilitary formations. 
  Elmazi and Ejupi were appointed in the "Secretariat for 
National Defense and Territorial Autonomy -- ILIRIDA" in April 
1992. Later on, stamps for the Headquarters of National Defense 
in the Armed Forces of the Albanians and of the Main Headquarter 
"777" were prepared, as well as for the Cair district (in 
Skopje) under the code "333." Toward the end of 1992 they 
prepared the "Rule Book of the System of National Defense," 
which was meant only for the Albanians, including active 
officers in the Macedonian Army, who were supposed to form a 
government and other bodies of government and state institutions 
in conflict conditions. 
  In September 1991, at the initiative of Mithad Emini, as 
well 
as in December of the same year, this time in agreement with 
Agushi, Husein Haskaj, an administrator for operations and 
education in the District Headquarters of the Territorial Unit 
of Cair at the Macedonian Defense Ministry, was appointed 
commander of the battalion of the paramilitary army in Cair 
district, for which he got a code and received orders from 
Agushi. After that he started undertaking hostile activities 
against the Macedonian Army and Macedonian Interior Ministry, 
which he did not abandon after July 1993, when he was appointed 
to the Macedonian Defense Ministry. Haskaj started gathering 
information on 1,300 subjects to military conscription -- 
Albanians from "his own" battalion -- personal names, 
birthdates, addresses, ranks, and so on, and also couriers were 
appointed for contacts with the headquarters in Gostivar. 
  In January 1992 Haskaj received a blank application for the 
"mobilization plan" from his headquarters. 
  He prompted the plan the next month with information on 
persons who could take part in the mobilization, by determining 
the junctures, the links, and the mobilization areas, planned to 
be completed in a period of nine hours. That was meant to 
prevent mobilization and create conditions to break up the 14th 
Infantry Brigade, as well as other commands and units of the 
Macedonian Army. He delivered this document to the headquarters 
in Gostivar. Later on Haskaj made an analysis concerning the 
morale, the organization, and armament of the Macedonian Army 
and the Macedonian police, for which he prepared a written paper 
on 30 March 1993 entitled "Assessments on the Enemy" (number T 
08-3), which he sent to the headquarters. In this document 
Haskaj characterized the Macedonian Army, the Macedonian 
Interior Ministry, the police, and the Macedonian orthodox 
people, as an "enemy." 
  According to the accusation, he sent a written request on 6 
July 1993 -- he was then the commander of the Cair district 
battalion -- that he himself typed, with his signature (request 
n. SO 7-5), in which he asked for the formation of a 
paramilitary independent unit for the village of Ljuboten 
(Skopje). This unit was supposed to be active outside the 
framework of the Macedonian Army, and he requested technical 
resources from his headquarters. 
  The accusation further stated that in February 1992 they 
provided via Shinasi Redjepi and on the orders of Mithad Emini a 
large amount of hard currency, including 95,000 Swiss francs, 
and Arslani and Ejupi provided 200 automatic rifles of Chinese 
origin from Albania. Moreover, they had organized the transport 
of these goods together with Eugen Cami to Gostivar. The arms 
were distributed, and 85 rifles were given to Redjep Shinasi, 25 
of which were confiscated by the police in November. 
  The charges stated that Hasan Agushi created a "courier 
center" in December 1992 and January 1993, with the code "201." 
The accord was that each courier should deliver the mail to 
Gostivar, it was further delivered to Demiri's house in the 
village of Cegrane, and the whole course was reported 
periodically. At the same time, Agushi had begun in December 
1992 the appointment of the personnel for the courier center, 
among which, by order no. 012-15, prepared on 20 December, was 
the commander of the shooting squad and the Albanian military 
forces (code "210"), Arton Imeraj. 
  With a special order (4-07) of 11 January 1993 the new spot 
for courier link was appointed as the tea-shop "Besa" in 
Gostivar. Only two months later, on 20 and 21 March last year, 
all the commanders were informed with a special order about the 
"problem" of the Albanians and the "Slavs," which, according to 
them, had to be solved in an armed battle, and it suggested that 
the commanders of the military units should make a weekly (also 
more frequent) analysis of the Macedonian Army and the Interior 
Ministry. It was also suggested that the possible contacts with 
Headquarters (777) had to be made each Saturday, between 0900 
and 1800 at Akif Demiri's. 
  The reports on the needs of the Headquarters of the Albanian 
(para)military forces were prepared in June and July, in which 
there was information on the "enemy," that is, the technical 
means, the directions, and the numerical data of the Macedonian 
Army and Interior Ministry units. To that purpose they had 
prepared precise reports from 13 to 28 July, as well as a report 
under the code name of "Mehmedi 210." 
  The charges accuse the 10 persons of: associating with the 
aim of hostile activities according to Article 136, Paragraph 1, 
and Article 144 -- attacking the constitutional order of the 
Republic of Macedonia, by the Criminal Statute of the Republic 
of Macedonia. 
  Moreover, the accused have engaged the following as their 
defense counsels: Gjuran Dema, Savo Kocarev, Mahmut Jusufi, Naim 
Selmani, and Numan Limani, the last of which will defend four of 
the accused (Murtezani, Haskaj, Cami, and Arslani), and attorney 
Dusko Apostolski is also expected to join these next Monday.

  [Text] Podgorica, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Government of 
Montenegro has no official reports on or evidence of the 
mobilization of refugees, TANJUG was told today by Rade Perovic, 
deputy prime minister in the Montenegrin Government. The 
parliamentary Social-Democratic Party of Montenegro was the 
first to voice its opinion in reaction to reports on the alleged 
mobilization of refugees claiming that "with the blessing from 
the republic's bodies and the support of military authorities, 
refugees from the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina are issued 
call-ups to be mobilized into the army of the republic of 
Srpska." 
  The issue was also raised at a session of the Montenegrin 
parliament, held last week, when deputy Savo Jablan asked: "Who 
is behind the forced mobilization of refugees in Montenegro, and 
what is its aim?". Stressing that the government of Montenegro 
has no official reports on the alleged mobilization, Perovic, in 
charge of that ministry, claims that the UN convention on the 
status of refugees is honored in Montenegro. 
  "A decree on the care for refugees, passed in July 1992, 
regulates their position and status, and they are exempt from 
mobilization," Perovic stressed.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb. 5, IRNA -- The Montenegrin Interior 
Ministry has announced charges against eight more Muslims from 
the Sandzak region according to the Belgrade press Saturday. At 
least 150 prominent Muslims have been arrested by the Serbian 
and Montenegrin authorities over the past two weeks and many 
more since Spring 1993, according to Sandzak sources. 
  The accused, according to the Ministry statement, are 
"members of the extreme wing of the (Muslim) Party for 
Democratic Action (SDA), who were preparing to create a republic 
of the Sandzak". Of the four arrested so far, the first, Umer 
Hadzic, is accused of "participating in the constitution of the 
Sandzak Republic on the instructions of Muslim National Council 
(MNVS) chairman, Sulejman Ugljanin." 
  The authorities hold a warrant for Ugljanin's arrest. This 
was carried out, the statement said, "with the help of legal 
experts from Croatia, Bosnia and elders of the Islamic community 
in Zagreb." 
  The other three are accused of forming a parallel "ministry 
of security" for the Sandzak and with possession and 
distribution of arms in Pljevlja, a Montenegrin town notorious 
for its harrassment of the Muslim population. 
  The MNVS has reported mass arrests of prominent Muslims over 
the past ten days, including the leadership of the Montenegrin 
SDA. Muslims are subjected to house searches without warrant, 
the confiscation of valuables and general police terror, MNVS 
said. 
  For two years now, countless attacks on Muslim people and 
property have taken place in Pljevlja and other places in 
Sandzak, a mainly Muslim area which stretches over parts of 
serbia and Montenegro, bordering on Bosnia. 
  According to the fund for human rights in Belgrade, 
harrassment has not been confined to Serb and Montenegrin 
nationalists, but also to large forces of the police and army. 
This has led to the emptying of Sandzak villages of their 
Muslim population and to a mass exodus from the region. 
  Opposition weekly VREME in its latest edition refers to the 
trial of 25 Muslims which opened on January 31 in Novi Pazar. 
According to Belgrade TV's reporting of the event, says VREME, 
"all the accused are guilty already. All that has to be done is 
to pronounce sentence." 
  "Not a word that they were questioned without the presence 
of 
a lawyer, that there was no legal proceeding, that the security 
around the court was of an unprecedented degree, that lawyers 
were searched before they entered the court, that large numbers 
of investigators were scattered about the court and that the 
press had printed parts of the accusation before the trial, 
thus, raising the temperature," says VREME. Ultimately, the 
court was obliged to accept the defence's contention that the 
trial had been prejudiced by advance publicity and to adjourn it 
for ten days. 
  Leading the defence is Kosovo Albanian lawyer, Azem Vllasi, 
himself the victim of a rigged political trial during the surge 
of Serb nationalism which followed the coming to power of 
Slobodan Milosevic in 1988.

<F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by </F>
unnamed STANDART NEWS correspondent; place and date not given: 
"Stable Macedonia Can Be a Guarantor Against War Spreading in 
the Balkans"] 
  [Text] [STANDART NEWS] Mr. President, various sources, 
both newspapermen and political figures, claim that cases of 
violating the sanctions against Yugoslavia have occurred at the 
border with Bulgaria. Is it true? 
  [Gligorov] Bulgaria is a neighbor country with which we have 
an open border and free traffic. Both we and the Bulgarians are 
observing the sanctions, which does not mean that cases of 
busting the Yugo-embargo do not occasionally occur. 
Nevertheless, Macedonia, being an UN member, respects the 
sanctions. 
  [STANDART NEWS] After the recognition of the Republic of 
Macedonia, what will be the next steps on the international 
scene? 
  [Gligorov] Recognition is of great importance to us. After 
Macedonia was admitted to the UN, our country officially 
established its identity as an independent state recognized by 
the international organizations and participating legitimately 
in international life. We shall pursue our efforts to establish 
diplomatic relations with all countries. 
  We welcome the initiative of integrating the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe with the "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative. We sent a letter to the Brussels summit in which we 
declared our intention of participating in the relevant meeting. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Do you have a clear concept on solving the 
problem with Greece? 
  [Gligorov] As far as we are concerned, the problem could be 
easily resolved as long as we discuss it, as long as we take the 
peace and stability of the Balkans into consideration, and as 
long as we behave like sensible people who can settle all their 
controversial problems as good neighbors should. 
  Actually, we have no great controversies and territorial 
claims [regarding Greece]. The borders are determined and 
recognized by both sides. The other problems are rather based 
on emotional and historical motivations and should not even be 
on the agenda. 
  It is our wish to pursue our diplomatic negotiations with 
Greece. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Macedonia is not a member of the Council of 
Europe as yet. What is being done to speed up its admission? 
  [Gligorov] We have the status of a country specially invited 
by the European Council of Ministers, which, only a few days 
ago, decided to start the procedure of admitting Macedonia as a 
full member to the organization. 
  Macedonia is a member of the Central European Initiative, 
which includes Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, 
and Austria. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Do you think that there is any danger 
involved in connection with Serbia's claims toward Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] Serbia should prove whether it has any claims 
regarding Macedonia or not by recognizing our country. As long 
as this has not occurred, we should be cautious and take into 
account the fact that political forces insisting on Macedonia 
not being an independent state still exist in Serbia. Macedonia 
is in favor of cooperation with all former Yugoslav republics 
and with all Balkan countries, but it is not inclined to join 
any closer alliance with Serbia, under the form of a 
confederation or under any other form of integration. The war 
has been going on too long in that part, too much blood has been 
shed, and one can hardly expect any form of political 
integration with that state, after Macedonia waged such a long 
and hard struggle for its own independence. 
  We would like to build our country as an independent, 
sovereign, democratic, and rule-of-law state. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What about Albania? 
  [Gligorov] Basically, I do not see any danger stemming from 
that country. However, assuming that the armed conflict is 
likely to continue for some time, possible unrest in Kosovo 
cannot be excluded, since the problems of that area are still 
unresolved. Hence, we should be aware of what might happen in 
the future. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Is it possible that Serbia might stimulate a 
threat from the Albanian side in the purpose of forcing Skopje 
to apply for Serbia's "protection." 
  [Gligorov] I see no reason for Macedonia to seek an alliance 
with Serbia against Albania. 
  Albanians who live in our country are Macedonians by Law. We 
saw what the ideas of greater Serbia, greater Albania, and 
greater Croatia have produced. We should live like peaceful 
neighbors. Albanians live in Macedonia, but Macedonians exist in 
Albania as well. Let them all exist as they did before, while 
the borders should be open and people be able to move freely 
from one country to the other. 
  [STANDART NEWS] How do you accept the presence of U.S. 
soldiers in Macedonia? 
  [Gligorov] Our relations with the United States are 
friendly. They are interested in peaceful relations with the 
Balkans. I assess the fact that they chose to station their 
military units in Macedonia as a preventive peace action. A 
peaceful and stable Macedonia is an obstacle to the expansion of 
the military conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariya Tsankova] </F>
  [Text] Today's plenary session of the National Assembly 
was extended to allow the deputies to debate the motion for a no 
confidence vote in Lyuben Berov's cabinet proposed by the 
parliamentary group of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces]. 
The proposers of the motion argued that the government was to 
blame for failing to bring the crime rate under control and to 
act against the growth of organized crime. The Socialist 
deputies did not [word indistinct] their criticisms of the Berov 
cabinet, but called for the drafting of a national program to 
combat crime. The National Assembly deputies of the New 
Alliance for Democracy gave the government and the Interior 
Ministry leadership a one-month deadline to conduct a purge at 
all levels within the Interior Ministry to remove corrupt 
officials. 
  The actual vote on the no-confidence motion will be held by 
secret ballot next Wednesday [9 February]. On Tuesday [8 
February] the National Assembly will hold an extraordinary 
plenary session, at which the deputies are likely to debate the 
state budget bill, the excise bill, the draft law on aliens' 
residence in Bulgaria, and the draft law on the National 
Security Service.

<F P=106> ["DUMA PRESS" report] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov described as a 
complete fabrication the reports issued by the Balkan Agency on 
31 January alleging that foreign intelligence services were 
eavesdropping on closed sessions of the National Assembly and 
some of the parliamentary commissions. 
  Last night the agency disseminated a report that the 
Russians 
had warned our special services that this was happening. The 
Russians allegedly hinted that the Americans had eavesdropped on 
the secrets of the Bulgarian legislators. According to the 
report, a commission had already been formed to investigate the 
tip-off, with members from the NSO [National Protection 
Service], the VKR [Military Counterintelligence], the Higher 
Institute of the Interior Ministry, and other bodies. It was 
claimed that it was easy to wiretap the proceedings of 
parliament from a telephone cable junction box nearby. 
  Last night DUMA reporters were unable to find any junction 
box outside the National Assembly. Viktor Mikhaylov said that 
the Interior Ministry Institute cannot take part in such a 
commission because it has no consultative powers. 
  Specialists point out that the National Protection Service 
provides bodyguards, and does not perform operational functions. 
Even former spies, who had suffered bitter experiences when the 
former military counterintelligence was destroyed, discounted 
the possibility of Military Counterintelligence being involved 
in such matters.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "False Prophet"] </F>
  [Text] Another legend in our new political mythology 
collapsed with the rebellion of National Assembly members Mehmed 
Hodzha and Receb Cinar, and that is that Ahmed Dogan commands an 
"iron guard" in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. The 
disputed legitimacy of the DPS in Bulgarian political life and 
the fresh memories of the "revival process," ensured an internal 
unity and discipline within the DPS of which all other parties 
were envious. In addition the DPS succeeded in implementing all 
its demands regarding the Bulgarian Muslims' rights and 
freedoms. However, it is impossible to live only by acquiring 
the right to learn the mother language and the freedom to pray. 
It was precisely the DPS supporters, especially those in the 
southern parts of the country, who were most affected by the 
shock therapy and the economic crisis. Consequently the stream 
of tourists with a one-way ticket to Turkey has not stopped. 
  It was Ahmed Dogan himself who inflicted the heaviest blow 
on 
the DPS. The media created the aura of him as the best 
Bulgarian politician, while his supporters elevated him to the 
rank of a prophet. However, with his behavior, which resembles 
that of an eastern sultan, and with his unclear sources of 
income he provided his impoverished electorate with sufficient 
reasons for dissatisfaction. In addition, his authoritarian 
style of leadership and almost conspiratorial political contacts 
created a conflict within the DPS leadership. Thus Ahmed Dogan 
gradually became one of the numerous false prophets in Bulgarian 
political life. According to both the Bible and the Koran such 
prophets have an unenviable fate. However, perhaps the "Dogan 
case" really is a part of a greater game?

  [Text] The Partnership for Peace offered by NATO is 
acceptable for Hungary only if it leads to full membership in 
the military organization. 
  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said this when he met with 
Gebhardt von Moltke, NATO assistant secretary general. There was 
a discussion on what Hungary could offer in exchange for the 
peace partnership. The work schedule mapping out the details 
for joint military exercises and training and peacekeeping 
actions were also discussed and coordinated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the 
"This Week" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Following the 
transformation of the regime, we have turned the offensive 
Hungarian Army into a defensive one, Hungarian Defense Minister 
Lajos Fur told the `This Week' program. [passage omitted] 
  Is it true that there were nuclear warheads in Hungary at 
that time? 
  [Fur] Yes, it is true. For a long time a special situation 
prevailed that even we, after the formation of the new 
government, did not know about it until the Russians moved them 
[the nuclear warheads] from Hungary. Even now we do not know at 
exactly how many places these nuclear warheads were stored. We 
certainly know one or two places, but, it is assumed that there 
were nuclear warheads in several other places. [passage 
omitted] There were no such things [nuclear warheads] in the 
ownership or operation of the Hungarian Army. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What can be done regarding the 
reorganization 
[of the army] in four years? 
  [Fur] First and foremost, we have put an end to the Army's 
offensive structure and the entire operations planning system. 
The Army has to exclusively fulfill defensive functions. The 
total strength of the Hungarian Army has dropped from 152,000 to 
less than 100,000 within three years. The drop in the number of 
professional soldiers over the past three years is almost the 
same -- that is about 25 percent. 
  [Correspondent] Does the present state of the Army provide a 
certain level of defense capability? 
  [Fur] The Army, too, reflects very precisely the country's 
general social and economic state. That is to say, certain 
social problems, or even social tensions evolve within this 
army, as these pressing problems are present in society itself. 
We have tried, as much as it was possible, to raise wages every 
year. [passage omitted] 
  On the other hand, there were purchases in the seventies. 
However, there have been no more serious purchases in this Army 
from the beginning of the eighties. [passage omitted] 
  Let me say that we expect a lot from the setting up of a new 
humane service [human szolgalat], to consist of officers who are 
well-prepared and well-trained in social and psychological 
issues. 
  [Correspondent] Let me note that there have been comments 
that this is a kind of revival of the system of political 
officers. 
  [Fur] It is very wrong, the two have nothing to do with each 
other. That was a system of deputy commanders within the 
Hungarian Army, and this will be a fully subordinated, 
coordinated, special organization of the Hungarian Army, where 
the work will be carried out by trained experts. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Is the present state of the Army good enough 
to continue smooth operations in the event of a change of 
government, for we cannot know the election results in advance? 
Will it be able to operate without hitches, which may cause 
problems either in international relations or at home? 
  [Fur] Although this army is under political direction, I am 
certain that it is not committed to any party political program. 
This army is in fact subordinated to the national cause, and it 
is also now laid down in law that no one within the army can 
engage in politics. 
  [Correspondent] Is it not a kind of pressure that the 
minister of defense is one of the leaders of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], and may perhaps become its number one 
leader? 
  [Fur] By no means. I am the one who usually protests in the 
firmest manner against any move that perhaps the MDF would like 
to take in connection with the Army. 
  [Correspondent] Has the basic transformation been 
implemented, or can it only be regarded as implemented after 
joining NATO? 
  [Fur] It is not only when we have joined NATO, but also when 
internal tension has eased, which, in my view, requires at least 
5-10 years. Then we can say that a full transformation has 
indeed taken place. It will be a modernized army of national 
character regarding its' every detail, its' way of thinking, 
preparedness, organization, and battle order.

  [Text] A statement by Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, in 
connection with yesterday's attack in Sarajevo has been faxed to 
our editorial office. Here is the entire text of this statement: 
  I was shocked and indignant at the news of this new 
irresponsible attack against the city of Sarajevo, which claimed 
a great number of victims among the civilian population who lack 
the protection of the city. We deplore the loss of human lives 
and want to express our profound condolences to the mourning 
families. We very firmly condemn this new barbarian act of 
terrorism and express the hope that those who have committed it 
will be identified and receive the punishment they deserve. The 
attack in Sarajevo does nothing but emphasize, in a dramatic 
way, the fact that resorting to force of arms prolongs human 
suffering, without solving problems, and it emphasizes the 
urgency for the necessity of a peace settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an objective to which all diplomatic 
efforts should now be devoted, the statement by Romania's 
president concludes.

  [Excerpts] Romania's President Ion Iliescu has issued a 
statement in connection with yesterday's attack in Sarajevo. 
[passage omitted] 
  In press statements, other figures of Romania's political 
scene have also reacted to the attack in Sarajevo. Thus, the 
president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), 
[PD-FSN] Petre Roman, emphasized that, when it comes to human 
lives, no effort is too great to save them and nothing can be 
viewed as too insignificant when these human lives disappear. 
The time has definitely come for the international community 
and what is termed will for peace to finally adopt radical 
measures based on the law, on the right to life. 
  Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party, [PNTCD] emphasized in his statement 
that it is crazy to kill innocent people and that what happened 
in Sarajevo compels world powers to do all they can to halt this 
tragedy. 
  The president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania 
[PDAR], Victor Surdu, stressed that the long-standing tragedy 
that is taking place not far from Romania's borders concerns and 
worries us. The numerous victims in Sarajevo's history testify 
to the illogical and absurd nature of this conflict. The time 
has come for international organizations to manifest greater 
determination and urge the adoption of solutions, which will put 
a halt to this tragedy. 
  Mrs. Ana Blandiana, Civic Alliance president, pointed out in 
here statement that the tragedy in Sarajevo has the same roots 
and is linked to the tragedy in Tiraspol and Chisinau, and to 
all the suffering in the periphery of the former Soviet empire 
in which the conservative forces are striving to reestablish 
their domination, regardless of the costs. What is terrible, 
however, Mrs. Blandiana emphasized, is the fact that everything 
is also linked to a general indifference -- from the 
indifference of the great powers to that of individuals in 
general.

proposals. The new bylaws adopted by the majority stipulate 
that the party be led by a president elected by the congress and 
a National Council consisting of 41 members, 21 of whom must be 
elected by the congress, and the remaining 20 to be appointed by 
the party president from among the chiefs of departments and 
counselors and submitted to the Permanent Delegation for 
endorsement. The representatives of county organizations and 
Bucharest Municipality proposed a single candidate for the 
position of president, namely Radu Campeanu, who was elected 
with a majority of votes. At this time, the congress 
proceedings are continuing with the presentation and submitting 
of candidates for positions within the party's component bodies, 
our reporter Iulia Gherman informed us.

  [Text] The proceedings of the extraordinary congress of 
the National Liberal Party [PNL] ended this morning. It had 
been convened by the initiative committee for the organization 
of the congress. During the two-day proceedings, the congress 
established the new by-laws, elected the new party president and 
leadership members, and discussed and endorsed the Program and 
Political Declaration of the National Liberal Party. The 
Political Declaration presented by Petre Dragomir declares, 
quote: We are now able to address the country and we want to 
participate, through our work and the values that liberalism 
promotes in society, in the development and modernization of our 
society, unquote. 
  At the end of the congress proceedings, Radu Campeanu, 
elected by the congress as president of the PNL, said that 
following this congress, the members of the leadership bodies 
who recognize Mircea Ionescu-Quintus as president of the party 
became mere party members. We do not exclude anyone, we do not 
wage war with anyone, but we believe that we have to conduct 
talks, to invite everyone to participate in a dialogue, Radu 
Campeanu concluded. We recall that at the Brasov meeting, the 
Central Standing Bureau of the PNL termed the congress in 
Bucharest, quote: A meeting of Mr. Campeanu's supporters.

  [Text] A short while ago we received via fax a copy of the 
following open letter addressed today by the Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR] to the chairmen of the PNTCD [National 
Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], PD-FSN [Democratic 
Party-National Salvation Front], UDMR [Democratic Union of

that you also agree to that idea, we are expecting your 
suggestions regarding the date, agenda, and the representation 
level of the delegations that would engage in those discussions. 
Please accept my high esteem.

<F P=106> [Mediafax note: "Oliviu Gherman Persuaded Gheorghe Funar"] </F>
  [Text] Last Monday [31 January] the Standing Bureau of the 
Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] held a session which lasted 
late into the night, until 0300 hours. PUNR President Gheorghe 
Funar called for withdrawing the parliamentary support granted 
to the current government, while vice president Ioan Gavra 
pleaded for the maintenance of the current coalition and for 
further participation in the negotiations with the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], alongside of the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM], the Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the 
Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR]. Ioan Gavra's 
proposal did not obtain the vote of the PUNR leadership; 
consequently, the final decision was to withdraw the 
parliamentary support for the PDSR. During the proceedings, 
Gheorghe Funar received a message from the PDSR inviting him to 
a discussion with Oliviu Gherman, president of the ruling party, 
the following day [1 February]. Parliamentary sources told us 
that Oliviu Gherman managed to "persuade" Gheorghe Funar and the 
other members of the PUNR Standing Bureau to accept the 
continuation of the negotiations. The only condition raised by 
the PUNR was that the PDSR and the other parties of the majority 
coalition should accept the government protocol adopted at Cluj. 
In the end, it was decided that the protocol should be the 
subject of the PDSR-PUNR-PRM-PSM-PDAR talks that will conclude 
on 1 March.

Come to His Homeland for Easter or for 10 May"] 
  [Text] "His Majesty King Mihai I of Romania wishes to come 
to his native country for the Holy Easter celebrations or for 10 
May [the king's birthday and formerly Romania's national day], 
more probably for 10 May," Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of 
the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], the 
most important opposition party, exclusively told us last night. 
Mr. Coposu was received in audience by His Majesty King Mihai 
on 1 February, between 1000-1730 hours. Their meeting will 
continue today. 
  It is likely that his majesty the king will entrust Mr. 
Corneliu Coposu with a message for the Romanian leadership. The 
PNTCD president told us that he will not convey that message to 
President Ion Iliescu, but only to Messrs. Melescanu [Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu] and Danescu [Interior Minister George 
Ioan Danescu]. The reason why Mr. Coposu does not want to 
discuss the matter with Mr. Iliescu is that the latter has made 
false statements last December in connection with the king's 
envisaged visit. 
  The essence of the king's message, Mr. Coposu said, is that 
he comes as a simple citizen. "The king is not coming in order 
to organize strikes or revolutions. He will come as Romania's 
sovereign, when the majority of the Romanian people calls upon 
him," Mr. Corneliu Coposu told us.

<F P=106> [Report by Ana Maria Vintan: "The Home of Sandor </F>
Konya-Hamar, Secretary of the Chamber of Deputies, Has Been 
Ransacked"] 
  [Text] On Friday, 29 January, between 1200 and 1600, the 
Cluj apartment of the secretary of the chamber of deputies, [and 
Cluj deputy on behalf of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania -- UDMR, Sandor] Konya-Hamar was looted and ransacked in 
a rather unusual way. The way in which the thieves operated and 
the nature of the objects stolen made the UDMR deputy draw the 
conclusion that it was "a perfectly organized action of 
intimidation." From among the valuable things that would have 
sold well, the thieves selected only a few pieces of jewelry, 
although they could have also stolen a fur coat, a large golden 
watch, a number of other valuable things, as well as brand new 
audio and video equipment. However, they did bother to steal a 
great number of documents and audio and video tapes belonging to 
Mr. Konya-Hamar, the contents of which was related to events in 
his political and parliamentary life. For instance, they stole 
the parliamentary diary he wrote over 1992-93, as well as 
recordings of a number of discussions held by Mr. Konya Hamar 
with various personalities, among whom figure Vaclav Havel and 
[former Romanian minister for culture and opposition figure] 
Andrei Plesu. 
  The secretary of the chamber of deputies has been receiving 
threatening phone calls recently, and although he notified the 
telephone company requesting that they monitor the incoming 
calls, he has not received any concrete answers. 
  As the violation of the apartment has been reported to the 
police, the latter -- considering that Konya-Hamar is a member 
of parliament -- should notify the State Attorney's Office, the 
Ministry of Interior, and the Chamber of Deputies. However, no 
official report on the incident was sent to Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase by Monday [31 January] at 1600.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of a speech by Polish Prime Minister Waldemar </F>
Pawlak at a conference of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Brussels on 3 February] 
  [Text] Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  I accepted with pleasure an invitation by the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies to meet with such prominent 
personalities from U.S., European, and Polish business 
communities, as well as with political leaders of the European 
Union [EU], NATO, Poland, and the United States. 
  Such meetings provide good opportunities to conduct 
discussions, exchange views and conclusions, and debate any 
issue that is in our mutual interest. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to express my 
recognition of the activity of the U.S.-Poland Action 
Commission, which has done so much for the sake of developing 
Polish-American cooperation in the political, economic, and 
scientific areas. 
  My speech today will be devoted to Poland's policy toward 
Western political, military, and economic institutions. 
Establishing closer ties to these institutions--and membership 
in them in the near future, if possible--is a crucial issue for 
our security. That issue should be approached against the 
background of new challenges that Poland (and all of Central 
Europe) has been confronting in recent times. 
  Currently, we are going through a period of instability with 
regard to the European security situation. There are few stable 
elements in the situation, with positive phenomena and trends 
being continuously intertwined with negative ones. 
  The situation has led to another reshaping of the European 
"security map." A diversification of interests and positions 
taken by different countries soon became clear, depending on the 
economic and security standard enjoyed by each of them. It is 
particularly important to be aware of that fact because it is 
beyond doubt the most important change in European relations 
since a "new Europe" was declared in 1990. 
  That does not mean that "classic" dangers have emerged--for 
instance, with regard to the territorial integrity of Central 
European states. Our assessment is that there is no such 
danger--at least speaking of the short and medium term. Dangers 
that could occur today would rather take the form of political 
and economic pressure, a weakening of perceptions and of the 
"psychological" component of security. The likelihood of 
sustaining barriers in economic and civil development and of a 
deterioration in Poland's international position--this is 
another problem that causes concern. 
  We must counteract these challenges. It is a supreme 
obligation of any state to secure its independence and proper 
conditions for development. Generally speaking, we perceive a 
permanent anchoring of Poland in the system of connections 
created by the Western world as the most secure guarantee for 
protecting the country's interests. So our membership in West 
European and transatlantic institutions remains a strategic goal 
for us. But, at a time when the issue of that membership is 
made difficult--which, by the way, is not because of us--we must 
demonstrate innovative thinking in the process of looking for 
transitional solutions. Our own effort--a Polish, Central 
European effort--will be the determining factor. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  Transforming Central and East Europe into any kind of "gray 
area" would become a cause of instability in this strategic part 
of the continent. It would also be dangerous when it comes to 
peace and stability throughout Europe. 
  Our efforts to participate in Western structures are not 
targeted against any country. On the contrary, these efforts 
are supposed to serve to widen the area of stability and 
European cooperation, and also, as a result of that, they are to 
strengthen the entire continent's security. We are convinced 
that extending Western institutions to cover the East will 
constitute a center around which the framework of the future 
architecture of European security will be built. The future 
shape of that center will be determined by today's courage 
displayed by Western countries in making their decisions. 
Failure to use the historic opportunity being created by the 
possibility of gradual extension of a stabilizing influence of 
the Western democratic sphere, a sphere of peace and prosperity, 
could have a detrimental impact on the future development of 
European relations, particularly in the continent's eastern 
part. The first step toward stabilizing the situation, 
preventing a disadvantageous development of the situation, 
should be by way of an opening up of Western structures as soon 
as possible to those Central European countries that are ready 
to take the step, and with a simultaneous establishment of 
partnershiplike relations between the "widened" Western 
structures and the continent's remaining countries. 
  We perceive the "Partnership for Peace" initiative, proposed 
by the NATO "summit," as a first step, which makes the future 
prospect of Polish membership in NATO more and more realistic. 
The initiative also assures us of possibilities for wider 
cooperation with NATO member states than up to now, and it also 
improves the level of our security. 
  While declaring a readiness for close cooperation with 
Western countries in the area of security, we expect the West to 
come up with concrete cooperation in the technical and 
technological areas--the kind of cooperation that would allow us 
to rationally use our scientific and industrial potential. The 
prospect of a future, stable, and safe Europe requires 
supplementing the idea of "Partnership for Peace" with an 
economic aspect of cooperation--that is to say, a "partnership 
for development." 
  I do not mean here establishing new bureaucratic structures 
or introducing new and special mechanisms of cooperation. But 
what I would like to point out is a necessity of making 
permanent a set of indispensable principles in international 
economic cooperation. Such a specific code of behavior for 
countries and economic organizations could include the task of 
counteracting the trends of isolationism; it could also cover 
eliminating obstacles, shaping a cooperative approach, 
understanding the partner's needs and, in justified cases, it 
could also cover a readiness to provide aid. Such a "partnership 
for development," broadly speaking, will contribute to increased 
mutual confidence and will also constitute a permanent basis for 
cooperation in the area of security. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  Apart from NATO, the other institution of the Western world 
that plays an important role from the standpoint of Poland's 
security is the Western European Union [WEU]. We see our future 
membership in the WEU as a logical addition to our links to the 
European Union [EU]. Leading to a situation of the same legal 
status of Poland in both organizations is an urgent issue. We 
are prepared for serious dialogue within the framework of the 
WEU. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  A speeding up of Poland's integration into the EU is an 
important and urgent task for Poland. Apart from its economic 
and civil-related dimensions, the issue is important from the 
standpoint of my country's security. 
  That is because the most secure path toward permanent 
security is by way of the inclusion of Poland and other Central 
European states in the Western system of associations and 
institutions. The EU has a determinant role to play in that 
context. It constitutes the most dynamically developing area in 
our neighborhood. The shape of the EU as an organization with a 
political dimension, one with a common foreign policy with 
regard to security as well as sophisticated systems of 
cooperation within the area of domestic and justice-systems 
policies--all of these justify our efforts to join the EU for 
political reasons, as well. 
  We regard integration as an instrument of implementing 
Polish interests, particularly in the new era of relations 
initiated by Poland's association with the EC, which became 
effective yesterday. In our relations with the EU, we will 
defend our interests no less vigorously than the current EU 
members are defending theirs. Routine discrimination against our 
exports and an erosion of concessions that had been granted to 
us with regard to EU markets are cause for concern. 
  The civil dimension of our relations with the EU is about 
keeping Poland in the Western sphere of free exchange of 
thoughts, ideas, and information. It is natural behavior for a 
nation that derives from the same civilization roots and that 
constitutes an integral ingredient of European culture. Making 
contemporary scientific achievements, technical progress, and 
modern management popular in Poland is one of the aspects of 
this issue. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  To reduce the issue of Poland's security to mere efforts 
aimed at membership in Western institutions would be a major 
oversimplification. We perceive security issues in a wider 
context. 
  We are aware of a fundamental role played by Poland's 
internal stability: A persistence in building and strengthening 
democratic institutions, an effective market economy, and 
scientific and cultural achievements. 
  With regard to Poland, one can say that parliamentary 
democracy and a system based on rule of law not only established 
its firm roots, which go all the way back to the 3 May 
Constitution, which was close in spirit and in time to the U.S. 
Constitution, but also in the day-to-day political life of my 
country; the most recent parliamentary elections in Poland are 
proof of that. We observe human rights fully. In Poland there 
are no nationalistic or ethnic disputes. Poland's borders are 
not put into question by anybody, and they are defined by 
international treaties. All of the above makes us a factor for 
stability throughout the region. 
  Poland's economic situation makes it possible to be 
optimistic about the prospect of the growth rate; according to 
many forecasts, the growth rate may become one of the most 
dynamic in Europe. The Polish economy, while going through a 
process of deep transformations, is already based on its own, 
new, market logic, and one can count on permanent and positive 
results if one continues on the path. 
  An increase in industrial output has been holding for more 
than 10 months now. The private sector is already producing 
over 60 percent of the gross domestic product [GDP]. During the 
past three years, about 1.7 million new, private companies have 
been established. Over 80 percent of trade and automobile 
transportation is in private hands. Private companies are 
providing half of all new jobs. At the same time, inflation is 
under control. 
  We expect Polish GDP to increase by 4.5 percent and exports 
to increase by 6 percent in 1994; investments should increase by 
6 percent in the same period. The assumption is that inflation 
will continue to fall and that it will be about 25 percent. 
  The achievement of such a magnitude of economic 
transformations means a lot of sacrifices, but it is also a 
unique achievement in European terms. These results of ours are 
being perceived and appreciated by international financial 
institutions, among them the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  My government is continuing with the process of reforms 
based 
on a market economy, the principle of economic freedom, and a 
demonopolization of economic relations with foreign countries. 
  The government will also continue the process of ownership 
transformations, but we want privatization to be understandable 
to the people and to be approved of by society; we also want the 
state's interest to be efficiently protected. 
  In Poland, legal foundations for a market economic system 
were established. Institutions of fundamental importance for a 
market economy were created, even if some of them are still at 
the initial stages of development. The role of market 
mechanisms has increased, and also of such economic parameters 
as money, profit, demand, competition, capital market, and 
entrepreneurship. Along with that, Poland's economic system is 
already characterized by a majority of typical traits that 
developed market economies have, even if the process of 
transformations has not yet been finalized. 
  Opening up the Polish economy to the world is an integral 
part of our reforms. We are interested in establishing the 
right conditions for an unrestricted flow of goods, services, 
capital, and labor--naturally based on principles of mutuality. 
We see in that possibilities for further activation of the 
economy and a revival of competition. We see in that a chance 
for further strengthening the economy with foreign capital and 
new technologies and the organization of labor.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 5 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry on Saturday [5 February] condemned the massacre of 
innocent civilians in Sarajevo's crowded marketplace in a blast 
earlier in the day and called for immediate steps to be taken to 
establish the truth of the matter and punish those responsible 
for the atrocity. Foreign news agencies have reported at least 
66 dead and more than 160 injured in the explosion. 
  In a statement released on Saturday evening, the ministry 
said that "this criminal act, which follows an earlier 
established pattern, is a heavy blow to the peace process." 
"We appeal to all factors of the peace process not to permit 
any political or media manipulation of this tragic event and to 
invest firm and unbiased efforts to establish the truth, prevent 
any obstruction of the peace process and show determination in 
the effort to reach just and lasting peace in former Bosnia- 
Herzegovina," the statement said.

  [Excerpts] [STANDART NEWS] Now that the UN Security Council 
has granted permission for convoys of trucks to ship Bulgarian 
goods through the FRY, do you think it is possible that public 
organizations like "New Byzantium" and "White Rose" may appear 
and block the convoys? What does Serbian public opinion think 
about the shipment of Bulgarian goods? 
  [Smilkovic] I have no reports on anyone wanting to block the 
transit of Bulgarian goods. As far as the Serbian people are 
concerned, I can say that have nothing against anything that is 
to the benefit of the Bulgarians. We know that the 
transshipment of these goods is of vital importance for you. 
  However, it is difficult for me to say whether some 
organization may appear that wants to block the convoys. 
Nevertheless, public opinion in Yugoslavia is in favor of 
Bulgaria shipping its goods. [passage omitted] 
  [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia dies down, do you 
think that the FRY will undertake operations in Kosovo and 
Macedonia? 
  [Smilkovic] Kosovo is part of Serbia, and the problem is an 
internal one, of concern only to the FRY. It is being resolved 
according to the Constitution and the laws of Yugoslavia and the 
Republic of Serbia, while, of course, observing world standards 
regarding minority rights. 
  As for Macedonia, it is an independent state. In the SFRY it 
had the status of a republic, just like the other republics, and 
this was never disputed. We have never opposed the notion that 
the Macedonians are a nation and, most important, the Serbian 
people have never disputed this either. 
  Thus, the issue of the recognition of Macedonia as a 
separate 
state and of the Macedonians as a separate nation is not a 
matter of dispute for the Serbian public. 
  Regarding the actual act of recognition, this is an issue of 
practical politics that will be settled when it arises on the 
agenda. In general, the recognition of the former Yugoslav 
republics has been postponed until such a time as all the issues 
between them and the FRY are settled. [passage omitted] 
  [STANDART NEWS] Does this mean that you consider that there 
are no obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia, if we leave 
aside the war between Serbia and Bosnia, which is delaying this? 
  [Smilkovic] In the first place, the FRY has not been in a 
state of war with Bosnia. As regards Macedonia, I have even 
gone further than what I know as an official representative of 
my country, because I am well acquainted with the view of the 
Serbian people. 
  [STANDART NEWS] We are not sure whether we have understood 
you correctly. Are you asserting that in essence there are no 
obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia? 
  [Smilkovic] I have already given a straight answer to this 
question, and I repeat: Yugoslavia and the peoples of Serbia 
and Montenegro have no dispute concerning the Macedonians as a 
nation and Macedonia as a state. 
  The issue of recognition is a political one and will be 
decided when the time comes. At the moment, during these years, 
Yugoslavia has many other urgent issues that have to be decided. 
  Furthermore, during the whole of the period of transition 
since Yugoslavia began to split up, Belgrade has had the fewest 
problems of all with Macedonia. 
  In essence, no unresolved problems exist here. [passage 
omitted] 
  [STANDART NEWS] According to reports from Bulgarian 
correspondents in Yugoslavia, the newspaper of the Bulgarian 
minority in the Western Outlands [in Serbia], which resumed 
publication with such a fuss, produced only two issues before 
shutting down again. The appearance of the newspaper is 
interpreted as part of the election campaign waged by the 
official authorities. What is your comment on this? 
  [Smilkovic] Such an assessment is not based on facts and 
sounds rather ill-intentioned. The difficulties with the 
printing of the BRATSTVO ["Brotherhood"] newspaper, as in the 
case of other newspapers, are primarily a result of the economic 
situation. Unfortunately, the unjust UN sanctions are having a 
negative effect on the press as well. 
  Apart from this, recently some of the Bulgarian mass media 
have been politicizing the situation of the Bulgarian minority 
in Yugoslavia. A problem is being artificially created. I am 
surprised that this is happening at a moment when all the 
citizens of the FRY are fighting to survive, because the unjust 
UN sanctions that I mentioned are threatening the very basis of 
human existence. 
  Incidentally, I know much more about the situation of this 
minority than the others for the simple reason that I have many 
friends among its representatives. 
  A few days ago I was in Bosilegrad. I wanted to ask how many 
members of the Bulgarian minority hold positions in the leading 
structures. However, I found there was no reason to ask, 
because the membership of these leading structures was entirely 
composed of Bulgarians. For example, every third person in 
Dimitrovgrad has a post. 
  There are not many Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. They were not 
numerous even when they entered the country. Nevertheless, they 
have been preserved. Do you think that they would have remained 
if anyone had been oppressing them? 
  Incidentally, as we are talking about this issue, do you 
realize how bad the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia feel when someone 
comes from Bulgaria and hands out aid only to them? I, for 
example, would find it insulting to receive medicine or anything 
else, while my neighbor gets nothing merely because he belongs 
to another nationality. For this reason, individual efforts to 
donate aid on a purely ethnic basis are unacceptable, because 
such aid has no humanitarian purpose and can only cause harm.

  [Excerpts] Arpad Goncz, president of the Hungarian 
Republic, announced at a news briefing this morning the date of 
the first round of general elections: 
  [Begin Goncz recording] In accordance with my powers 
enshrined in Article D of Passage 1 of Paragraph 30-A of the 
Constitution, I declare that parliamentary elections will be 
held on Sunday, 8 May 1994. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to give the points of view that I considered 
when making this decision. First, the main requirement is that 
the elections should take place as soon as possible in order to 
have a stable administration as soon as possible--before the 
summer season, if possible--and that the second round could be 
held before the start of the spring work. The date of the 
second round will not be determined by me but by an election 
committee formed by the parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Second, my consideration was also that it should be as cheap 
as possible. A holiday day would have had to be declared if the 
election were to be held on a weekday. [passage omitted] 
  This would have made the elections incredibly more 
expensive. 
[passage omitted] 
  My third consideration was that as many as possible should 
vote. All parties have an interest in as many voters turning out 
as possible. My impression is that a large percent of the 
voters will participate in the ballot. In my view, the people 
of this country are clear in their mind that they have a stake 
in the elections. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding my being above party politics, I can only say that 
this date does not agree--as far as I know--with the wish of any 
party. So, if you like, take this as a sign of my being above 
party politics. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Prague Feb 4 (CTK) -- The signing of a closing 
declaration of the Central European Free Trade Agreement 
(CEFTA), which stipulates the efforts and convictions of the 
participants to ensure liberalisation of trade within five 
years, marked the end of a joint session of delegations from 
four Central European countries in Prague today. 
  The economics ministers of the CEFTA countries, Bela Kadar 
of 
Hungary, Leslaw Podkanski of Poland, Jan Ducky of Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic's Vladimir Dlouhy told journalists they 
attached great significance to the agreement. 
  They stressed especially the fact that the changeover to 
liberalising Central European trade was occurring at a time when 
important trade agreements worldwide were being concluded, 
examples including the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Liberalisation will not apply to certain problem groups, 
particularly agriculture, they said. It will also proceed more 
slowly with a number of "sensitive goods," such as automobiles, 
textile and metals.

  [Text] Tirana, February 5 (ATA) -- "I appreciate your 
great efforts to solve the crisis in Bosnia," President Berisha 
said to Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg in a meeting he had with 
them today. But these unsuccessful efforts prove that the option 
of dividing Bosnia will not help stop the war there, which is 
aggravating confrontation, the crisis in the Balkans, insecurity 
in the region, contradictions and opposition in the 
international community. Therefore, I think that this option 
should be replaced with another which will be in accord with all 
international laws and rules, on which the peace and security of 
each country is based and which does not compensate the 
aggressor. There is only one option which is based on this 
principle, which may prove to be successful and will put an end, 
in the international aspect, to the numerous approaches and 
practices which have so far been an obstacle. This option will 
impose agreement on belligerent factions and withdrawal on the 
aggressor. But, Mr. Berisha said, besides Bosnia, Kosova is 
still a major problem to be solved in the context of the Balkan 
crisis. To this end, a meeting of Belgrade authorities with the 
legitimate representative of Kosova, Mr. Rugova, in the presence 
of a third party, would be welcome and useful. It would also be 
of a special value if in the documents of the European Union, 
along with the resolution of the question of Bosnia, a "modus 
vivendi" be also found for Kosova. With regard to the lifting 
of the embargo against Serbia, it should be totally linked with 
the solution of this problem because any facilitation of the 
embargo may lead to a spillover of the Balkan conflict towards 
the south. 
  Further on, President Berisha underlined that the relations 
of Albania with Macedonia are strengthening continuously. We 
have been and are for a close cooperation with Macedonia. The 
question of arms trafficking is an old matter with which the 
Albanian democratic government has no connection at all and all 
necessary documents exist to prove it. In the mean time, we 
have welcome the decision of the Macedonian Government for the 
census in a near future. Signs of progress have also been 
noticed in our relations with Montenegro," Mr. Berisha said in 
conclusion. 
  In his address, Lord Owen presented a panorama of the 
efforts 
of negotiators to find an acceptable solution for all sides. He 
considered peace an indispensability for the region and for 
Albania. It is high time, he said, that the question of Kosova 
be treated in the talks as a part of this crisis. 
  In the context of the efforts to find out a solution, Lord 
Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg stressed the need of a regional 
conference with the participation of all countries which are 
slightly or largely affected by this crisis. 
  President Berisha supported the idea for the regional 
meeting 
in the framework of the Geneva Conference and emphasized that 
Albania will always be open to dialogue and interested to 
contribute to peace and stability in the region.

  [Text] Tirana, February 4 (ATA) -- "The Democratic Party 
considers 1994 as an important year for the development of the 
political and economic reform in Albania," said Mr. Selami, the 
chairman of the Democratic Party [DP], in a meeting in Shkoder 
with intellectuals, members and sympathizers of this party, on 
February 3. 
  The chairman of the presidency of the parliament, Pjeter 
Arbnori, the vice-premier, Bashkim Kopliku, the chairman of the 
DP parliamentary group, Ali Spahia, and the DP Secretary General 
Tritan Shehu took part in the meeting. 
  1994, underlined Mr. Selami, will be marked as the year of 
coalition of the left extreme forces directed by the Socialist 
Party. The Democratic Alliance Party is taking part openly into 
it unfortunately, he said. Shkoder became one of the arenas of 
the political tension which is a result of the coordination 
between left extremes. 
  Speaking abut the killing of Gjovalin Cekini, during an 
incident on January 14, he said that the Democratic Party has 
condemned the crime and holds that he was a victim of the 
unnecessary tensions. Regarding accusations against the DP for 
the killing are groundless, Mr. Selami said adding that the 
Democratic Party has no relations with the crime. "We will wait 
until the verdict is taken and then we shall give our opinion 
about these accusations." 
  "We will answer the unbridled antidemocratic propaganda, 
which has in its focus the Democratic Party at all its levels, 
with the promotion of the reform," Mr. Selami said. 
  Mr. Pjeter Arbnori spoke about the reorganization and 
consolidation of the commission of the constitution. He said 
that the constitution "belongs neither to the Democratic Party 
nor to the Socialist Party, it belongs to Albania, so we should 
compile it together through understanding." 
  Mr. Bashkim Kopliku spoke about the economic reform in 
Albania, the achievements and the difficulties which have been 
encountered as well as about the opinions of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund with regard to the reform in Albania.

  [Text] Tirana, February 4 (ATA) -- In a meeting held on 
February 3 by a group of representatives from the existing 
businessmen associations in Albania, the creation of the 
Albanian Businessmen Association, KOBIZ, was proclaimed. 
  The association will be independent from the state, 
political 
parties and religious communities. Its program stipulates that 
the confederation appears in the economic and social life of the 
country as an organization which will represent and support the 
interests of the industrialists, constructors, merchants, 
traders and all businessmen who will be organized in their 
federations. It will contribute to the strengthening of the 
democratic state and democracy in general as an worthy partner 
in the triangle state- trade-union-employer. 
  This confederation will be an active organization which will 
protect the financial position the Albanian businessmen in front 
of foreign capital competition. The confederation will have 
relations with its analoguous organizations in other countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- The security guarantees 
which all countries neighbouring on Yugoslavia need is a 
question crucial for Bulgaria, too, and it was raised at a 
meeting between President Zhelyu Zhelev and the two 
international mediators on the Yugoslav crisis, Lord David Owen 
and Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg, who arrived here today. Their 
session with the president lasted nearly an hour and a half. 
  According to the president's advisor on foreign political 
affairs, Dr. Zhelev set forth the principled Bulgarian position 
on the Yugo-crisis, stressing that right from the outset 
Bulgaria expressly stated its refusal to take advantage in any 
way whatsoever of the difficulties experienced by disintegrating 
Yugoslavia and to look for benefits other than guarantees of its 
own national security. "We are convinced that recognizing the 
four former Yugoslav republics was a move which strengthens the 
situation in the region. By its act of recognition, Bulgaria 
reaffirmed the right to independent and sovereign existence, as 
well as those countries' right to arrange and choose a form of 
government which suits them best," the presidential advisor 
said, briefing the press on Dr. Zhelev's meeting with the two 
mediators. 
  Dr. Zhelev called attention to the need of the European 
Union, once it failed to take vigorous action and adopt a 
categorical position and thus halt the escalation of the 
conflict into open warfare, should learn a lesson and apply it 
in its present actions and encourage all those factors which 
could contribute to the security guarantees of the neighbouring 
countries. 
  Earlier in the day, Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg had nearly 
an hour's long talk with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov, which Lord Owen described as "a very full discussion." 
"The European Union's plan of action has the full support of 
the government here, which is good to hear," Lord Owen noted. 
The chief Bulgarian diplomat described as "inaccurate" a REUTER 
report yesterday, which quoted a senior government official as 
saying that "Bulgaria would support a unified Bosnia" and "is 
against the model of ethnically clean formations which we see as 
unacceptable for the situation in the Balkans." 
  Answering reporters' questions after his session with Mr. 
Daskalov, Lord Owen said that "the experience of this country of 
being able to settle disputes between minorities and different 
religions and different ethnic communities must be the model," 
he said. "Muslims have been part of Europe's history all 
throughout history.... There is no objection in principle 
whatever from the European Union, if that is the wish of the 
people, for there to be a Muslim republic out of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. This has never been a problem to us," the mediator 
said. He also mentioned the danger of the Bosnian conflict 
spreading to Sandjak, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia. 
"Containment of the fighting has been an important part (of the 
crisis management effort)," Lord Owen said, stressing the 
importance of the support which can come from the countries in 
the region that neighbour on the former Yugoslavia. "I believe 
that the role of Bulgaria is part of the regional response," he 
went on to say. "You are paying a very heavy price for 
sanctions. Sadly, the rest of the world has not come up with 
adequate compensation for that (the embargo losses). It is 
making your task of moving towards a market economy and 
deepening your commitment to democracy much harder," Lord Owen 
said.

  [Text] Sofia, February 4 (BTA) -- International mediators 
Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg left Bulgaria en route 
to Tirana this morning. Yesterday they had talks with President 
Zhelyu Zhelev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. The 
mediators are seeking support from the countries in the region 
for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav conflict. 
  Invited to comment on Alija Izetbegovic's statement that the 
forthcoming talks in Geneva would be a waste of time, Lord Owen, 
admitting that negotiations had been going on for long, said 
that if any of the parties thought it a waste of time, there 
were lots of other things to do. Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg added 
that efforts would continue both before and after the meeting. 
  Asked what gives him hope about the peace process, Lord Owen 
said it was the general belief/human nature [as received] that 
some day human beings stop fighting and prefer to act and live 
together. People in Bulgaria are suffering because of sanctions, 
this is a fact: You have lost many dollars, as well as your 
neighbours, he went on to say. And the question which the 
region has to say is how much longer they all are going to go on 
making sacrifices to try and bring a settlement, Lord Owen said. 
He described Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Greece 
as severely affected by the sanctions against ex-Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 4 (BTA) -- A frontpage story in 
DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), 
reports that within days the National Investigative Service 
(NIS) will launch an inquiry into cases of busting the 
Yugo-embargo. The daily quotes NIS Director Ani Kruleva as 
confirming that her service had evidence of embargo violations. 
"We received records from the prosecutor's office and we will 
institute proceedings," Mrs. Kruleva is quoted as saying. 
According to DEMOKRATSIYA, "this terse statement implies 
questions, the answers to which would blast Lyuben Berov's 
government." A SDS MP told the daily that "Bulgaria has always 
stated that it observes the Yugo-embargo and does not violate it 
at the state level, but there is indisputable evidence of 
companies and mafia groups busting the embargo, smuggling not 
just fuel but weapons as well." "The government assumed 
responsibility for the blunders of the Interior Ministry, which 
is not employed to enforce law and order in the country but to 
help mafia groups. Now the cabinet will have to suffer the 
consequences," the MP is quoted as saying. 
  The Socialist daily DUMA gives prominence to an attempted 
export of 648 tonnes of ammonium nitrate to Serbia by the Sofia 
company Navamex. Quoting the chief of the Committee on 
Standardization and Metrology, the daily says that the 
fertilizer was loaded on 17 wagons in 50 kg sacks and was 
documented as washing powder. The train was stopped on January 
1 at the Dragoman Checkpoint (on the Serbian border) as the 
shipment did not have a certificate issued by the laboratory of 
the Committee on Standardization and Metrology. The daily points 
out that a new procedure effective February 1 was introduced for 
getting export permits for Serbia and Montenegro, according to 
which the UN Sanctions Committee will be the only authority 
competent to clear such exports. 
  In an interview for the trade union daily TRUD, Henning 
Stanislawski, deputy head of the UN Sanctions Assistance Mission 
(SAMCOM) in Bulgaria, tells about an incident in which UN 
monitors patrolling Bulgaria's border were chased when they 
wanted to check a petrol-carrying train bound for Yugoslavia in 
Dragoman. When they started checking the wagon numbers and 
documents, unknown persons chased the SAMCOM officials from the 
border back to Sofia. Still, Mr. Stanislawski points out that 
the mission is working well with the Bulgarian authorities.

  [Text] Bregovo Border Checkpoint, Vidin Region, February 4 
(BTA) -- Every day the Bregovo border checkpoint is jammed with 
long queues of motorcyclists. Over 400 motorcycles a day cross 
the border to Serbia. Their main business is fuel export. This 
trade is quite lucrative -- there are no restrictions regarding 
the number of motorcycles entering the former Yugoslavia. Some 
do this three times a day exporting an average of 50-60 litres 
of fuel. The more persevering -- those who cross the border 
three times a day, make a daily profit of about 2,000 leva. 
There are record holders -- some people from Bregovo make 17 
"trips" a day. 
  The lack of statutory documents restricting this type of 
trips has resulted in conflicts with the border officials 
working at Bregovo. On February 3 angry motorcyclists blocked 
the Bregovo checkpoint from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. The conflict was 
solved temporarily. According to customs officers, such 
conflicts are bound to become more and more frequent in the 
absence of a categorical stand of the Customs Chief Department 
on restricted exit of motorcycles and other Bulgarian motor 
vehicles to the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Sofia, February 7 (BTA) -- First Deputy Foreign 
Ministers Valentin Gatsinski of Bulgaria and Iwo Byczewski of 
Poland today signed a cooperation protocol between the two 
countries' Foreign Ministries. At consultations held before the 
signing, the sides found that political relations are making 
very good progress, especially after President Zhelyu Zhelev 
visited Warsaw last year to sign a bilateral treaty of 
friendship and cooperation. The Polish guest said that the 
Bulgarian minister of foreign affairs, Stanislav Daskalov is 
expected to meet in Warsaw shortly with his Polish counterpart 
Andrzej Olechowski. Mr. Byczewski described this as the second 
very important stage in bilateral relations. 
  During the consultations the sides expressed their 
dissatisfaction with the progress of economic contacts, agreeing 
that both governments can help an expansion of trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  Cultural relations were also on the agenda, as well as the 
premises of the Polish Cultural Centre in Sofia. Mr. Byczewski 
stressed that Mr. Daskalov had assured him that the Bulgarian 
Foreign Ministry will do everything within its powers to solve 
the problem. "I think this is particularly important because 
both the Bulgarian Cultural Centre in Warsaw and the Polish 
Cultural Centre in Sofia have fine relations and it would be 
wrong to break them," the Polish deputy foreign minister said. 
The building which now houses the Polish Cultural Institute in 
Sofia was recently restituted to its former owners. 
  Integration into Europe's economic and Euro-Atlantic 
structures, joining the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative 
and the situation in the Balkans were discussed at a meeting 
between Mr. Byczewski and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov. 
Mr. Byczewski said Bulgaria and Poland have no fundamental 
differences on these matters.

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 7 (BTA) -- On Thursday, February 
10, Slovakia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik will 
pay an official visit to Bulgaria at the invitation of Bulgarian 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. This is the first Slovak 
visit at the level of foreign minister to this country since the 
division of Czechoslovakia. 
  Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov 
paid 
a working visit to Bratislava in April last year, Slovak 
President Michal Kovac was on an informal visit to Bulgaria. 
Having come for a holiday at the Black Sea in the summer of 
1993, Mr. Kovac met President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. 
Some time before President Zhelev and President Kovac had talks 
in Brussels where they attended the funeral of King Baudouin. 
  The separation of Slovakia and the Czech Republic gave rise 
to certain problems of bilateral relations: The older 
Bulgarian-Czechoslovak agreement should be either updated or a 
new agreement should be signed, President Zhelev said after his 
meeting with President Kovac in Sofia. Dr. Zhelev stressed that 
"there are no political or any other obstacles to resolving the 
problem rapidly and in the best possible way." Slovakia sees a 
friend in Bulgaria and although we are not neighbours, we are 
bound together by the Danube, our historic contacts and Slavdom, 
now that the totalitarian regimes, we have a common goal: 
Integration with the European structures, Slovakia's President 
Michal Kovac told reporters at the time. "Slovakia believes 
that Bulgaria is an important stabilizing factor in the Balkan 
region," he stressed. We would like to have the status of 
observers in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, on the other 
hand Slovakia is ready to support Bulgaria's participation in 
different projects within the framework of the Central European 
Initiative, Mr. Kovac said. Both sides expressed their desire 
to create, at state level, prerequisites for the activation of 
Bulgarian-Slovak relations in the field of economy, tourism and 
culture, and to promote political cooperation at international 
level. Mr. Kovac invited the Bulgarian president to pay an 
official visit to Bratislava. 
  Bulgaria and Slovakia are planning to sign agreements on the 
avoidance of double taxation, on encouragement and reciprocal 
protection of investments, on culture and on trade. A Slovak 
Cultural Centre was opened in Sofia in October 1993. 
  In November Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
received Mr. Jozef Dravecky, charge d'affairs of Slovakia's 
embassy in Sofia. According to the official statement, it is 
the sides' shared opinion that there are very good prospects for 
the development of cooperation between Bulgaria and Slovakia. 
  "Slovakia has great interest in the region. We want to 
restore the level of our good contacts that existed before," 
Mrs. Vlasta Jonasieva of the Slovak Trade Ministry said in may 
last year. The Bulgarian and Slovak experts share the opinion 
that the volume of trade between Bulgaria and Slovakia in 1992, 
amounting to $28 million, is awfully small. "Slovakia has not 
lost its interest in Bulgaria," Mrs. Jonasivea said in an 
interview for the Bulgarian Press.

  [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation, 
led by Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov, attended a meeting 
in Vienna of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. The need of a transport and communications 
infrastructure skirting the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
was on the agenda. The Bulgarian delegation returned from Vienna 
today. 
  According to Mr. Churov the meeting was a success, at least 
in the short term. "In a longer-term prospect, things are a 
little bit more complicated because funding is involved," he 
said. 
  "Still, I think that the Bulgarian priorities were accepted 
at the meeting," the deputy foreign minister said. The 
Bulgarian projects concerning the overloaded border crossings, 
could be arranged in nine to twelve months time, as Mr. Churov 
put it. "As to our longer-term proposals, it all depends on what 
the EU members of the G-24 will decide, and specifically whether 
funding will be provided within a reasonable period of three to 
five years."

  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 4 (BTA) -- The National 
Assembly debated the motion made by the parliamentary group of 
the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) for a vote of no confidence 
in Prof. Lyuben Berov's government motivating by the cabinet's 
"incompetence to perform the duties it is assigned by the 
Constitution regarding the enforcement of law and order and 
guaranteeing people's safety" and by its "actions leading to 
crime escalation and to cases of law enforcement authorities 
blending with organized crime." So far the SDS has tabled four 
motions for no confidence in the cabinet formed under the 
mandate assigned to the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms and elected at the end of 1992 thanks to the support of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the New Union for Democracy 
(NSD, a parliamentary group set up by MP's who split or were 
expelled from the SDS), three of the no confidence motions were 
voted down. 
  Setting out the arguments for the no confidence vote, Ms. 
Ekaterina Mikhaylova, deputy floor leader of the parliamentary 
SDS, said that the government had not only allowed "crime to 
grow enormously, but let criminals form large organized groups 
of the mafia type, blend with state authorities and get 
important economic sectors under their control." She recalled 
the cases of what she described as escalating gangland fighting, 
accusing the cabinet and the Interior Ministry in particular of 
inaction. 
  The reasons for the helplessness of the executive branch and 
of the Interior Ministry in curbing crime can hardly be said to 
stem from the lack of laws, Mrs. Mikhaylova said. In her view, 
widespread corruption at the Interior Ministry makes it 
impossible for its members, called upon to protect the lives and 
security of Bulgaria's citizens, to fight crime in this country. 
The cabinet unanimously backed Interior Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov, thus shouldering the responsibility for the chaos at 
the Interior Ministry and growing crime, Ms. Mikhaylova 
stressed. [passage omitted] 
  Answering the accusations against the cabinet in parliament 
today, Prime Minister Berov said that "there is more to rising 
crime than the cases which the SDS lists in its arguments for 
the no confidence vote." "The attempts to represent crime as 
street clashes among criminals are actually aimed to conceal how 
deep the roots of crime go. This may be to the interest of 
those who made the no confidence motion, but it is definitely 
not to the interest of the nation," the prime minister said. He 
reminded that in 1990- 1992 (when the SDS was in power), 15,000 
Interior Ministry employees were either dismissed or left of 
their own will. "I would not describe this as an open attempt 
to politicize the Interior Ministry in 1992 again and make it 
serve certain narrow partisan interests," Prof. Berov said. 
  Recalling that the government programme as a whole and its 
section on crime control in particular were linked to the 
passage of much needed laws on establishing and maintaining a 
new rule of law, Prime Minister Berov accused parliament of 
inaction. "Parliament has not passed yet the most urgently 
needed amendments to the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, and the Sojourn of Aliens Act, though it emerged that 
some 65,000 foreigners reside in this country unregistered," he 
stressed. "The SDS has been doing its best to prevent the 
passage of a law on the organization of the judiciary," Prof. 
Berov said. Stressing that the government bears its share of 
responsibility for fighting crime, Prof. Berov said all 
incidents listed in the motives for the no-confidence vote are 
subject to investigation by the Interior Ministry. Most 
criminals have been detected but not tried yet, Prof. Berov said. 
  "The government will be uncompromising about everything 
within its powers. I assure you that the police are at their 
post, in full control of the situation in the country," Prof. 
Berov stressed, adding that the government would continue to 
prioritize fighting crime and view it with responsibility but 
would not allow crime problems to be politicized. "I can well 
understand certain claims for decisive action by the government, 
for more attention to social affairs, the structural adjustment 
of the economy and the land reform, but I strongly object to 
attempts at wasting parliament's time and blocking the 
government's work. This is an irresponsible tactic adopted by 
the present SDS leadership," the prime minister said. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the end of his speech in parliament today, the prime 
minister expressed his conviction that "There is a nationally 
responsible majority in parliament and if it believes the 
government can stick to the chosen path of reform, of ending the 
country's international financial isolation and economic crisis, 
this will mean support for future more decisive steps to control 
crime and strengthen the state in the name of the nation and 
Bulgaria." 
  The debates on the no-confidence vote went on for about five 
hours. Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov went to hospital 
yesterday and did not attend the sitting. Mainly MP's of the 
SDS and the BSP took the floor. In their statements MP's of the 
SDS repeatedly stressed the need for new parliamentary 
elections. After a regular meeting of the SDS top leadership, 
the National Coordinating Council, on Tuesday, it was announced 
that if the government survived the no-confidence vote or the 
1994 budget was approved, the SDS leadership and parliamentary 
group would discuss a boycott of parliament's sittings. MP's of 
the ASP repeatedly stated that no parliamentary force wants 
early parliamentary elections now and the motion for a 
no-confidence vote is intended to waste time. 
  According to parliament's rules of procedure, the motion can 
be put to the vote 24 hours after the end of debates at the 
earliest. In this case the vote will be taken on Wednesday [9 
February] at the earliest. The MP's decided to vote by secret 
ballot.

"What we know is that the trains carried 7,000 tonnes of cleared 
fuel for Serbia. UN monitors have issued official permits for 
this," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said today, answering a 
question of the parliamentary faction of the Union of the 
Democratic Forces related to a reported embargo-busting passage 
of four tank wagon trains across the border with Serbia. 
[passage omitted] 
  This evening Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met the leaders of 
the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR). Speaking on the 
behalf of the GOR, set up recently by defectors of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party, Aleksandur Tomov told the prime minister the 
group will support the cabinet at the no-confidence vote. The 
GOR representatives voiced their concern over the fact that the 
government is subject to political pressure aimed at personnel 
changes in the Interior Ministry before the investigation has 
concluded.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, February 5 (BTA) -- At a meeting held 
behind closed doors, the top leadership of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) considered the problems of training and 
recruiting personnel for the purpose of implementing its policy. 
According to data released by the Socialists, the BSP has over 
400,000 members and over 20,000 activists in its more than 
10,000 local organizations. The BSP Supreme Council passed a 
resolution prioritizing the personnel problem and describing it 
as a key one for the BSP efficient work and the implementation 
of its policy under the new conditions. This is an essential 
problem of the democratization of the party and its intraparty 
life, the resolution reads. It lists the immediate prospects 
for the BSP participation in the government and points out the 
necessity of building a consistent system for BSP organizational 
and personnel work under the new circumstances. 
  10 percent of the electorate will vote for the New Policy 
Centre (NPC), NPC leader Dimitur Ludzhev predicted at a news 
conference in Kurdzhali, southern Bulgaria, today. Once again 
he described the 1994 draft budget proposed by the cabinet as 
unrealistic. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- Parliament today passed 
on first reading amendments to the Act To Provide Financial 
Support for Autumn and Spring Farm Works in 1993-1994. 
According to the amendments, the act will be extended to apply 
to farming cooperatives and will no longer require cooperative 
members to have contributed land of proven title in order to 
qualify for tied soft loans. The Parliamentary Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) voted against the amendments, arguing 
that their passage legitimizes the cooperatives set up by the 
"nomenklatura" of the disbanded cooperative farms. 
  The National Assembly Committee on Agriculture today heard a 
report from Deputy Agriculture Minister Todor Markov on the 
performance of liquidation councils (which were set up under the 
Agricultural Land Tenure Act to wind up the cooperative farms 
and distribute their assets). According to Mr. Markov, of a 
total of 2,082 liquidation councils nationwide, only three have 
completed their work, and another 185 are ready to wrap up their 
business. The members of the parliamentary committee said that 
the Agriculture Ministry should prepare an accurate timetable 
for the completion of liquidation councils' work. 
  The National Assembly Budgetary and Finance Committee today 
approved in principle the 1994 national budget bill. The SDS 
MP's on the committee voted against the bill. 
  The Legislative Committee discussed a bill establishing 
terms 
and a procedure for the use of surveillance methods. 
  Parliament today passed by an overwhelming majority 
amendments to the Persons and Family Act, introducing a new 
procedure for non- profit corporations engaged in religious or 
religious education activities, which will now have to register 
at court after advance clearance from the government. During 
the debate, MP's of different parliamentary groups emphasized 
that the act has to be amended because of the invasion of a 
number of religious cults, some of which abuse civil rights by 
their activities. Under the amended version, any juristic 
person engaged in religious activities must reregister within 
three months or risk discontinuation of its activity.

  [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- Two bills concerning 
nuclear energy were approved by the cabinet at its regular 
meeting today. One bill will ratify the 1963 Vienna Convention 
on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 1988 Joint 
Protocol on Civil Law Liability and Compensation for 
Cross-Boundary Damage From Nuclear Accident, which established a 
link between the 1960 Paris Convention on Third Party Liability 
in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the Vienna Convention. The 
other bill will amend the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Act. 
  Bulgaria's accession to the Vienna Convention and the Joint 
Protocol will help assert this country's position in the 
international system of civil liability for nuclear damage, 
according to Mr. Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Committee for 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, who sponsored the bills. So far 
Bulgaria has not been involved in this system which at some 
times has hampered normal trade relations with other countries, 
Mr. Yanev observed. Provision of technical and financial 
assistance to enhance the nuclear safety of the Kozloduy nuclear 
power plant, in his view, is also contingent on accession to the 
convention. 
  The proposed amendments to the Peaceful Uses of Atomic 
Energy 
Act will limit the state monopoly to the extraction, processing, 
production and trade in nuclear material and operation of 
nuclear facilities. Other sources of ionizing radiation will be 
subject to licensing requirements. This means that upon payment 
of definite fees, both natural and juristic persons could use 
sources of ionizing radiation in hospitals, industrial and 
research laboratories and facilities. Liability for possible 
damage from nuclear accident will rest with the operators of the 
nuclear installations. Stiffer fines will be imposed for 
breaking nuclear and radiological safety rules. Besides this, 
the proposed changes will help penalize companies which do no 
meet nuclear safety requirements.

  [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- 1,718 of the 2,840 
lecturers and employees at the St. Kliment Okhridski University 
of Sofia are on strike, the strike committee chairman, Assoc. 
Prof. Petyo Petkov, said at a press conference today. Members 
of all trade union organizations at the university have joined 
the effective strike. The Sofia University students have been on 
strike since January 21. The Neofit Rilski Southwestern 
University in Blagoevgrad will join the strike tomorrow. 
  Academic work -- examinations, lectures, seminars, 
laboratory 
research and preparations for the admission of new students, at 
Bulgaria's largest university has stopped. Classes are 
conducted only with extramural students and persons doing 
postgraduate work. 
  The strikers' demand for the allocation of 2.3 percent of 
the 
gross domestic product to education and science (1.5 percent for 
university education and 0.8 for science) is realistic and 
necessary, reporters were reminded again. 
  Addressing all Bulgarians, the Strike Committee of the Sofia 
University Lecturers and Employees calls for support. The 
document makes it a point that "the university lecturers and 
students are not on strike for salaries and scholarships, meager 
as they may be." They are fighting for the very survival of 
education and science, so that Bulgaria can exist, it is 
stressed in the address. 
  At a working meeting in the University of Veliko Turnovo, 
central Bulgaria, representatives of the rector's offices of six 
provincial universities adopted a document expressing their 
stand on the acute problems of higher education in Bulgaria. 
The document says that the financial collapse of higher 
education institutions may have serious negative consequences, 
causing unforeseen damages over the next five or ten years. The 
Council of Rectors in Sofia will be familiarized with the 
document. 
  After the talks of Ministry of Science and Education 
officials and representatives of the striking students and the 
lecturers' strike committee, it became clear that except for the 
financial demands, all other ones were feasible and included in 
the Ministry's programme long ago.

<F P=106> ["Crime Control Is Impossible Without Consensus of Political </F>
Forces, President Zhelev Says" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, February 6 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev 
will support a temporary lifting of the moratorium on capital 
punishment. President Zhelev said this himself in today's 
50-minute interview on the national radio. Rising crime and the 
possibilities of fighting it were the main topics in the 
interview broadcast two days after the parliamentary debate on a 
motion for no-confidence in the government made by the Union of 
Democratic Forces, which claims that the cabinet is incompetent 
to enforce law and order and guarantee people's safety. In less 
than a month, the Bulgarian president pays particular attention 
to the problems of growing crime for the second time. Only two 
weeks ago he addressed the nation commenting on the same issue. 
  "In principle, I am a convinced opponent to capital 
punishment, but in view of soaring crime rates I am inclined to 
agree to temporary lift the moratorium on it until the issue is 
resolved commuting the death sentence to one of life 
imprisonment by law," President Zhelev said in the interview. 
  The president described the accusations made against him by 
some people that he had granted amnesty to 12,000 criminals as a 
gross and brazen lie. They were released by former President 
Petur Mladenov in 1990, Dr. Zhelev pointed out. So far I have 
pardoned just a few hundreds of people, mainly seriously ill 
women and old people who can no longer commit any crime, he said. 
  One can draw two basic conclusions from the parliamentary 
debate and the press publications on crime control: The need of 
purging the state machine of corruption and of the political 
forces reaching consensus, the president believes. 
  The crime control effort will not be serious without 
declaring a merciless war on corruption not only in the Ministry 
of the Interior but in the governing authorities as a whole and 
in all state institutions, President Zhelev emphasized. Any 
attempts to fight organized crime without eliminating corruption 
at the state institutions are doomed to failure, Dr. Zhelev said 
categorically. The Presidency has always been uncompromising on 
the issue of fighting corruption. Dr. Zhelev cited a number of 
cases when presidential advisers, suspected of servicing the 
interests of certain financial and industrial groups, had been 
dismissed. He named Zdravko Popov, his former adviser on 
foreign affairs, Piere Tabakov, former adviser on defence 
industry problems, former military adviser General Stoyan 
Andreev. 
  What has been done to curb crime so far is less than modest, 
the president said. He blamed mainly the two major political 
forces for the present condition of the society and for the 
inefficient crime control saying that they always placed their 
interests above the national ones. The president believes that 
they are obliged to reach consensus on the problem of curbing 
crime. The institutions whose duty is fighting crime cannot be 
stable without such consensus, the president stressed. 
  According to him, the presidential institution can play the 
role of an integrating factor concerting the efforts of the 
institutions directly involved in crime control. It can play 
this role through the Consultative National Security Council 
which has the right to ask the separate institutions for 
cooperation, the president believes. 
  Dr. Zhelev emphasized his view about the need of developing 
a 
national programme for crime control. The political forces must 
unite for the sake of resolving the problem. Without consensus, 
combating crime is doomed to failure, the president said in 
conclusion.

Sarajevo marketplace would provoke a tougher reaction from the 
international community. 
  "However, I hope the reaction will not only be from the 
international community," Klaus said in an interview for Czech 
Television this evening. He said the massacre should be the 
"last straw" which should force the enemy parties in the former 
Yugoslavia to sit down at the negotiating table and "stop 
shooting." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTK) -- "The Sarajevo mortar 
massacre is an outrageous scandal. The action again confirms 
that every war leads to escalating cruelty," Czech President 
Vaclav Havel said today reacting to the shelling of a Sarajevo 
marketplace that left over 60 people dead. 
  Havel told journalists before his departure on a visit to 
India and Thailand that "in his view, the international 
community should entervene much more energetically in Bosnia so 
that this fratricidal conflict be stopped."

  [Text] Prague, Feb 7 (CTK) -- Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys said Saturday's [5 February] shelling of innocent 
civilians at Sarajevo market was the height of cynicism and 
monstrosity, ministerial spokesman Zdenek Borkovec told CTK 
today. 
  Borkovec conveyed Baudys's view on military intervention, 
lifting the embargo on arms exports to Bosnia and the possible 
breaking of Sarajevo blockade: These are seemingly simple 
questions but "in fact, these are the most complicated 
situations, one can meet in the world." 
  According to Baudys, the fighting parties should first of 
all 
bear in mind that the solution depends on their good will. 
External intervention is the last and most extreme solution, 
Borkovec quoted him as saying.

  Medek was reacting to the shelling of a marketplace in the

  [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec put his signature on materials concerning the Czech 
Republic's membership in the Partnership for Peace project, he 
said at a press conference today. 
  The materials will be submitted to the government, which is 
to discuss them on Wednesday [9 February], Zieleniec said. 
  According to the Czech Constitution, parliamentary approval 
is not necessary for the Czech Republic to join the Partnership 
for Peace, Zieleniec said. After the government gives its 
approval, either Premier Vaclav Klaus or Zieleniec himself will 
sign the general declaration on joining the project. 
  The Partnership for Peace programme, which was approved by 
NATO member countries on January 10, 1994 in Brussels, envisages 
military cooperation with the countries of Eastern and Central 
Europe and their eventual admission to the Alliance. 
  Zieleniec said that after signing the document he would 
oversee the Czech Republic's special proposal for specific 
cooperation with the Alliance and that NATO would also draw up 
similar materials concerning this cooperation. These two 
documents will then form the basis of the agreement between the 
Czech Republic and NATO on the Partnership for Peace. 
  While under the Partnership for Peace, Czech soldiers could 
eventually be sent abroad, Zieleniec said that the Czech 
Constitution requires parliamentary approval of sending armed 
forces outside of Czech territory. Therefore, "some adjustments 
will be necessary" to the regulations, he said.

Defence and Security Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee 
said today during the meeting with visiting NATO officials. 
  Vladimir Suman, deputy of the government coalition Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA) and chairman of the Defence and

in this respect are being expected." The NATO mission was led 
by NATO Assistant Secretary General Gebhardt von Moltke. 
  Suman said that Moltke explained to the deputies the 
fundamental principles of Partnership and acquainted them with 
expected positions of individual participating countries 
(non-members of NATO) towards the project. 
  The Czech deputies informed the NATO officials on the course 
of action the parliament would take on Partnership. "We 
primarily stressed that we are prepared to exercise control over 
the army and to take in parliament all the measures necessary 
for the implementation of the project. We said we would strive 
to influence people's stand towards the army and NATO and 
contribute to the transformation of the Czech Army so that it 
would be capable of meeting the conditions set for the admission 
to NATO," Suman said.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 3 (CTK) -- Czech officials informed the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this afternoon about 
the fire that broke out at the Dukovany nuclear power plant this 
morning, IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said today. 
  Meyer said that the fire, which occurred in one of the 
transformers in the plant's third bloc, was completely 
extinguished in two hours and did not cause any leak of 
radioactive materials. The fire rated a zero on the INES 
International Nuclear Safety Scale. 
  The Austrian environmental organization Global 2000, 
however, 
announced that Czech environmentalists from the Duha (Rainbow) 
movement had informed them that the accident rated a three on 
the INES scale. The environmentalists said that a secondary 
cooling system had been damaged, causing a radioactive leak. 
Local residents were warned by siren and doses of iodine were 
distributed, the group said.

  [Text] Vienna Feb 4 (CTK) -- By making fuss about the 
completion of the nuclear power plant Temelin in south Bohemia, 
close to the Austrian border, Austria wants to distract 
attention from problems on its political scene, Czech Ambassador 
to Austria Pavel Jajtner said in an interview for the Austrian 
KURIER coming out tomorrow. 
  He said that in the "super-election year" of 1994 it was 
easier for Austrian politicians to capitalise on disputed Czech 
issues. 
  Jajtner recalled the words by Austrian President Thomas 
Klestil during his visit to the Czech Republic last December 
that "not even Temelin might violate our good relations." In 
the meantime, however, the two countries' relations have 
worsened, the ambassador admitted, and described a welcome in 
Linz during his recent visit as "very cool." 
  Jajtner said he understood the concern of Upper Austrians 
(who live close to the Czech border), but, as he said, there was 
no reason for panic. The Prague government had considered 
Austria's concern and would operate only half of the plant's 
envisaged capacity. Temelin's completion, however, is a 
significant step towards the improvement of environment in 
Bohemia, Jajtner said. "Children and trees in the most severely 
affected region of northern Bohemia must breathe," he said. 
After the completion of Temelin, two thermal power plants which 
harm the environment most will cease to operate, he concluded.

  [Text] New York Feb 4 (CTK) -- Despite former optimism, 
creating and keeping peace by the means of the UN is a question 
of the distant future, Czech Ambassador to the UN Karel Kovanda, 
who chaired the UN Security Council in January, told CTK today. 
  He said he saw success of his own and of Czech foreign 
policy 
in the Security Council mainly in the fact that now the other 
countries in the Council "view the Czech Republic in a different 
way than a month ago." Kovanda said he succeeded in 
intentionally reducing the Council's talks, but increasing their 
efficiency, though this was hampered by a slower pace of some 
Council's member countries. 
  "The Security Council proceeds ahead in line with the 
slowest 
of those essentially interested in the problem discussed," 
Kovanda explained, adding while in his post, he became aware of 
the extent of control exerted over the chairman by the Council's 
other members: "Some topics I originally believed to be 
partially settled during the month of the Czech chairmanship, 
have not been taken up at all, or only marginally," he stated. 
  Things were similar with the talks on specific world 
problems: "When we adopted the chairman's statement on Bosnia, 
journalists asked me what good another statement would be -- the 
Serbians would laugh at it and it would be of no help to 
Bosnians. And I could only agree with them. But if a group of 
the Council's members submits a proposal or request that the 
chairman issue a statement, how can this be prevented?," Kovanda 
said. 
  It is a "tough reality" of present world that the Security 
Council's possibilities are limited, and can be further 
restricted with the decline in countries' willingness to support 
the council, including by offering their soldiers. "If member 
countries do not offer their soldiers, it is impossible for the 
Security Council to send anybody anywhere," Kovanda stated. As 
an example he gave the case of Somalia. After many countries 
announced their intention to withdraw soldiers from there, the 
UN Secretary General asked all 42 countries to offer their 
soldiers. All of them refused to do so. 
  On the other hand, in the past there was insufficient link 
between the Council's political resolutions and the rules 
enabling soldiers in the field to fulfill these resolutions with 
less or more success. "I think that the link between the 
Council's activities and the views and troubles of the countries 
offering soldiers is one of the ways to lessen the differences 
between what the Council would like and what is feasible," 
Kovanda said. 
  He himself presented such a diplomatic initiative in the 
form 
of a coordination meeting between the Council and the countries 
with soldiers stationed in Somalia.

  [Text] Prague February 3 (CTK) -- Diplomatic relations 
between the Czech Republic and Macedonia are to be established 
within the next few days, in the form of an exchange of 
diplomatic notes, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said at 
a press conference today. 
  A representative office will not be opened in Skopje for the 
time being, but Macedonia will be diplomatically served by the 
Czech Republic from Belgrade, Zieleniec said. 
  He said the Czech Republic was recognising the state with 
its 
present borders, and as the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, the title it uses for UN membership. The changes 
which had taken place concerning the international recognition 
of Macedonia at the end of last year and the beginning of 1994 
were also a favourable sign for relations between Greece and 
Macedonia, Zieleniec added. 
  Macedonia declared its independence in November 1991, but 
for 
two years broad international recognition of the state was 
prevented by Greece. Greece objected to the name of Macedonia 
because it saw its use as amounting to a territorial claim on 
the northern Greek province of the same name. Last April, 
Macedonia was accepted into the UN with the compromise name of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  On Wednesday [2 February] the Czech Government approved the 
recognition of Macedonia, which has been recognised by 20 
countries so far.

  [Text] Prague Feb 2 [date as received] (CTK) -- The 
government coalition Christian and Democratic Union-Czechoslovak 
People's Party (KDU-CSL) is surprised and disappointed by the 
Republican Party's invitation for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit 
the Czech Republic, KDU-CSL Deputy Chairman Tomas Rubacek told 
CTK today. He said it would be fatal to allow Zhirinovskiy to 
enter the republic at all. 
  Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra nationalist and chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which emerged victorious in the 
recent parliamentary elections in Russia, told REUTER this week 
that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague 
and a few breweries in which the beer will turn sour will be 
left of it." 
  The leadership of the far right Assembly for the Republic- 
Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) announced this week its 
decision to invite Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic "in 
order to obtain information about the programme and goal of his 
party." 
  "If some irresponsible person were to invite Zhirinovskiy to 
the Czech Republic, then the invitation should be solely to a 
mental hospital," Rudolf Opatril, spokesman for the 
Czech-Moravian Centre Party (CMS) parliamentary group, told 
journalists today. 
  He said that "Zhirinovskiy's babble, be it about Moravia or 
anything else, is not a matter to be dealt with by politicians 
or journalists, but by psychiatrists." 
  Zhirinovskiy is a person dangerous for the whole world, 
Opatril said, adding that "it was impossible to react to his 
statements by jokes" but it is necessary to resolutely condemn 
him. "If someone invites Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic, we 
will consider this an act of high treason," he said. 
  The government coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS) 
considered Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech Republic 
undesirable, given his extreme views, the KDS said in a 
statement given to CTK today. 
  "The KDS believes that the statements and behaviour of 
Zhirinovskiy during his visit to other countries serve as a 
sufficient reason for declaring him a persona non grata and for 
not allowing him to enter the Czech Republic," the statement 
says.

  [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec, commenting on the Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party's (SPR-RSC) invitation to 
Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to visit the 
Czech Republic, said today it was not urgent to take any 
measures or decisions on the issue. 
  It is rather difficult to understand how someone could 
invite 
Zhirinovskiy, who a week ago spoke in an inappropriate manner 
about the Czech Republic and its political life, Zieleniec said. 
  Miroslav Sladek's SPR-RSC today invited Zhirinovskiy to 
visit 
the Czech Republic with the goal of "obtaining objective 
information about the programme and objectives of Zhirinovskiy's 
party." Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), which emerged victorious in the recent Russian 
parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the Czech Republic 
will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in 
which the beer will turn sour will be left of it." 
  Zieleniec voiced the view that what is important in the 
world 
from the international point of view is also important for the 
Czech Republic. He said he firmly believed that the 
developments in Russia were important not only for the Czech 
Republic but for Europe and the whole world. "It is a matter of 
dire significance for all of us whether or not democracy will be 
installed in Russia and whether or not a market economy will be 
stabilised there," Zieleniec said.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 7 (CTK) -- In today's independent Czech 
daily LIDOVE NOVINY, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus returns 
to issues discussed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
Switzerland, at the close of January. 
  "Europe -- its present, its so-called `expansion' and its 
future -- were high on the agenda of the forum," says Klaus. "I 
must admit that I had to oppose a bit the ideas regarding the 
expansion since I am convinced that no one can ever extend (or 
narrow) it (Europe)." 
  "Our experience says that Europe's success (or failure) does 
not depend so much on the existence, extent and activities of 
multilateral European institutions, but to a much greater degree 
on the type and structure of the political, social, and economic 
systems that exist in European countries," Klaus says. 
  He notes that "we know very well that the reason we lag 
behind (Western Europe) and for our not quite happy life in the 
past four decades was not the existence of the (now defunct) 
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), but the 
communist regime (toppled in Czechoslovakia in November 1989). 
Symmetrically, this is true also in the opposite direction: 
Western Europe's success did not depend on institutions of the 
European Community but on a free society, private ownership, and 
a free market," Klaus says. He adds that "this was true in the 
past, is true now, and will be true in the future, too." 
  "These days, it is being decided whether or not Eastern 
Europe will preserve this system and will not let it degenerate 
into a new form of collectivism.... The success of Europe is 
dependent on the degree of freedom of the individual, free 
market and trade, on the ability to get rid of the state's 
useless interference in the lives of people and their economic 
activities, on the elimination of bureaucratic manipulation with 
all of us, on our resolve and courage to suppress the strength 
of the powerful ... lobbying groups and on our ability to put 
in order fundamental economic attributes, especially our work 
with awards which we get for it," Klaus says. 
  "In these attributes it is necessary to carefully specify 
the 
conditions of a potential favorable impact of multilateral 
European institutions on our future," Klaus says. However, he 
fears that "the careful formulating of these conditions is being 
forgotten due to the simplified and a priori accepted argument 
that without Europe's unity we shall be 'small' and 'weak' and 
'unable to compete' with other regions in the world." 
  "The Czech Republic claims that Czech lands have always been 
part of Europe and therefore they do not want to be deprived of 
various advantages ensuing from partnership in European 
institutions. We wish to be an 'equal partner' who does not 
only seek to obtain something, but we are also ready to give," 
Klaus says.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel 
said in his regular radio broadcast "Talks From Lany" today that 
his current official visit to India and Thailand had several key 
goals. 
  The Czech Republic, which successfully sought to become a 
non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 
ought to prove that it is assuming its share of responsibility 
for the state of affairs in the world and that it is not 
ignoring any continent, Havel said. 
  At the same time it is important to develop the widest 
possible friendly relations with India and Thailand, especially 
in the economic area in which many interesting prospect are 
coming into view, Havel said. He added that the foreign and 
finance ministers who would accompany him on his visit would 
also hold their "various talks." 
  Havel mentioned his intent to stop over in Kuwait to meet 
the 
Kuwaiti Emir. 
  Austria is known for its dislike of nuclear power but 
nuclear 
power is a world phenomenon and not a specific question of 
Temelin, Havel said, asked whether the Czech Republic has a 
moral right to complete the Temelin nuclear power plant in south 
Bohemia notwithstanding growing protests from Austria near whose 
border the plant is located. 
  Havel said that he understood these protests. "Nonetheless 
they can hardly expect that the Czech Republic will stop 
completing Temelin given the current advanced state of 
construction," Havel said. He said that two things were 
important in this question -- first that the plant have the 
highest possible level of security and the second that a promise 
be fulfilled that after the station is put into operation the 
mining of brown coal in north Bohemia and the activity of 
thermal power stations, which have a devastating impact on the 
environment, are radically reduced. 
  Regarding the assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak 
Republican Party's invitation to Russian ultra nationalist and 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic Havel said: "It is 
interesting that a party which presents itself as a very 
patriotic one is inviting a man who questions the Czech 
Republic's future existence." 
  "Mr. Zhirinovskiy holds a diplomatic passport and he 
therefore can come to the Czech Republic anyway. Then it will 
be up to him what he will say here and whether or not our 
authorities will consider it appropriate to expel him 
eventually," Havel said. 
  He said that the Foreign Ministry, having considered the 
situation, came to the conclusion: "If Zhirinovskiy comes let 
him come." 
  Havel also directed his attention to the situation of 
non-profit organizations in democratic states. "There are very 
many non-profit organizations in democratic countries which are 
not and should not be fully state-owned but which are at the 
same time not of a commercial nature. And in the Czech Republic 
all this sphere has yet to be "covered with some umbrella law." 
  He said that on Friday, when his broadcast was recorded he 
had an opportunity to touch on the topic in an informal talk 
with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. 
  Havel said that organizations called partly-subsidized 
public 
organizations such as schools, hospitals, Czech Television, 
Czech Radio and others serve some public interest and the state 
thus is interested that they function and serve it. That is why 
the state is subsidizing them to a certain extent. "But these 
organizations should be separated from the state to a certain 
extent. They should have their own regulations of management 
and should not be bound with rigid ordinances," Havel said. 
  However these organizations should not only comply with 
valid 
laws but also respect "the general will of the state." 
  "Then there are other organizations -- cultural ones, such 
as 
theaters, museums, galleries... And also typically non-profit 
organizations such as various funds and foundations which are 
important because they ensure plurality in supporting public 
interests," Havel said, adding that tax relief is very 
important for the activity of these institutions. 
  Havel said that according to the information he possessed 
two 
laws would probably be needed in this sphere. One would set 
down regulations for the activity of non-profit organizations 
and the other would define possibilities under which the current 
state-owned budget and subsidized organizations could be 
transferred into non-profit ones.

  [Text] Prague February 2 (CTK) -- The functioning of the 
new constitution and the creation of the Constitutional Court 
were among the things Czech President Vaclav Havel listed as 
most important today in a review of his first year as president 
of the independent Czech Republic. 
  The strengthening of the Czech Republic's international 
position was also something to be assessed positively, Havel 
said, pointing to the visits of U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Prague. 
  Also important were the building of a civic society, of the 
non-profit sector and public institutions, Havel said. Although 
it was the business of parliament and the government to decide 
such things, the president's voice ought also to be heard, he 
said, and the president ought to look to the long-term, which 
was also true in foreign policy. 
  Relations with neighbouring states had to be redefined and 
clarified, Havel said. He added that he had many foreign visits 
awaiting him, including ones to India, Thailand and the Vatican. 
In addition, he said, he was to make a speech to the European 
Parliament and perhaps open the plenary meeting of the UN 
General Assembly. He would also be representing the Czech 
Republic at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
summit. 
  Asked if during his second year as president he would avoid 
conflict with the premier, foreign minister and parliament, or 
whether he saw such conflicts as a normal part of Czech 
political life, Havel said that "it is a feature of democracy 
for there to be a certain tension between individual 
constitutional institutions." He did not have the feeling that 
he had serious conflicts with anyone, he said, adding that he 
identified with the basic line of the Czech Republic's policy 
and supported it. 
  "Of course, we are all a little different, we have different 
characters and different tendencies, and here and there might be 
hitches, but I really do not think this is a subject that the 
public need worry about. They are our problems," Havel said, 
adding that what was important for the public was the results, 
and these were good. 
  Reform of local government will definitely strengthen 
democracy, but it depends what sort of reform it will be, Havel 
said. A relatively wide consensus was beginning to appear, and 
reform had to take note of the real state of things, he said. 
The electoral system to the authorities of the higher 
administrative units would be very important, Havel said, adding 
that "a strictly proportional system, like the one used for 
parliamentary elections, would not be good." 
  "Instead of one parliament we would have thirteen or 
fourteen. All the little parliaments would play at being the big 
one," he said, adding that the regions would only suffer. 
  The Czech Republic ought to gain membership in the European 
Union and NATO, and to perfect privatisation, he said. "I would 
be glad if we became a country to which people no longer 
attached the label of post-communist," he said in conclusion.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTk) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel 
today left for an eight-day tour of India and Thailand, 
accompanied by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, Finance 
Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Deputy Industry and Trade Minister 
Radomir Sabela. 
  In Delhi Havel will meet Indian President Shankar Dayal 
Sharma, at whose invitation the visit takes place and Indian 
Premier Narasimh P. V. Rao. He will also travel to Varanasi and 
Calcutta, where he will visit Mother Theresa's mission. 
  On February 11 Havel will visit Thailand at the invitation 
of 
the king of Thailand, Phumiphon Adunyadet. Besides meeting the 
king, Havel will meet Thai Premier Chuan Likphai and Chairman of 
Parliament Marut Benneg. 
  This is Havel's second trip to Asia which he visited in 
April 
1992 in his capacity as Czechoslovak president. He went then to 
Japan and South Korea and on his way back home he made a short 
stop-over in India. 
  "One of the goals of my current visit to Asia is to 
emphasize 
the Czech Republic's membership in the United Nations Security 
Council and our share of responsibility for world developments 
ensuing from this membership. We also want to point out that 
also far distant countries are very important for the Czech 
Republic," Havel said before his departure.

  [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Petr Cermak, deputy chairman 
of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), said that in 1991 he met 
with employees of the Czechoslovak counterintelligence service 
about setting up an ODS intelligence service, but that he 
declined their services, MLADA FRONTA DNES writes today. 
  Stanislav Devaty, director of the Czech Security and 
Information Service (BIS), told CTK today that he knew nothing 
about such an offer by counterintelligence service members to 
the ODS. 
  Last summer, Cermak called reports that the ODS had tried to 
create its own intelligence service "absolute nonsense." "The 
ODS has no intelligence service," he said at that time, adding 
that the party had never made any effort to create one. 
  Miroslav Macek, former ODS deputy chairman, told Czech 
Television last year that employees of the FBIS, the BIS' 
federal counterpart, proposed setting up a "mini-network" to 
protect the party from information leaks and to gather 
information on other political parties. Macek said he had 
rejected the offer. 
  According to today's MLADA FRONTA DNES, FBIS employees had a 
similar project prepared for the Civic Democratic Alliance. All 
those who offered the services to the ODS left the FBIS in 1991 
and 1992, the paper writes.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 3 (CTK) -- The Parliamentary Foreign 
Committee has asked its Chairman Jiri Payne to reconsider 
remarks made during his present trip to the United States, 
committee member Marie Stiborova, an opposition Left Bloc (LB) 
deputy, told CTK today. 
  During his American visit, Payne, a member of the ruling 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS), praised the fact that the 
right-wing NECENZUROVANE NOVINY published a list of alleged 
secret police agents and collaborators in 1992. 
  Speaking to local Czech-Americans, Payne said on Tuesday [1 
February] that publication of the truth was essential for 
purifying society and that the only problem with the list was 
that some people were not on it who should have been. No one 
was on it who should not have been, he added. 
  The committee's resolution was initiated by Jan Krycer and 
Josef Jezek, Stiborova said. 
  Payne said that some personal identification numbers 
appearing in the list may have been mistyped, adding, "but 
basically, when I need to do screening for my personal use, it 
is sufficient." 
  "The committee has agreed that Payne makes speeches and 
remarks unknown to the committee," Stiborova said, adding, "thus 
what he says are his private views." Payne can only be 
dismissed by parliament, Jezek said, adding, "I and most of my 
colleagues, believe that Payne can no longer remain committee 
chairman." 
  Payne has made a grave mistake, Jezek said, adding that 
Payne 
blundered once before in making controversial remarks regarding 
relations with Czechs abroad. 
  "By behaving as they did, the committee gave Payne a chance 
for the incident to be forgotten. Just as it was about to be 
forgotten, a similar thing happened, and something, I would say, 
much more striking." 
  The committee had no choice but to react so as to "avoid 
implicating the whole of parliament and the whole of the Foreign 
Committee," Jezek said, adding that both parliament and the 
committee must distance themselves from the whole incident as 
soon as possible.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 7 (CTK) -- Czechs travelling to the 
Yugoslav Federal Republic (Serbia and Montenegro) will be 
required to have visas as of Tuesday, February 8, the Yugoslav

  [Text] Prague, February 5 (CTK) -- Protests by Czech and 
foreign -- especially Austrian -- environmental movements 
against the completion of nuclear power stations have been 
gaining strength since the board of the U.S. Export and Import 
(EXIM) Bank guaranteed a loan of $317 million for the completion 
of the Temelin nuclear power station in south Bohemia and the 
modernization of its security systems. 
  The Czech Government approved the completion of Temelin, one 
of the two Czech nuclear power stations, in March last year. 
Two blocks with a total output of 2,000 megawatts are to be 
added, and the power station is to start operating in 1996 or 
1997, in order to obtain permission to operate in accordance 
with Western European and U.S. norms. 
  Former Czech Premier Petr Pithart wrote to American 
congressman Barney Frank in January saying that the government 
had not taken into account the opinions of the inhabitants of 
the area around Temelin and had not put the question of the 
completion of Temelin for discussion in parliament. The present 
government had also ignored the fact that no report had been 
drawn up looking at the potential influence of Temelin on the 
environment, Pithart added. 
  The first reactor of the other Czech nuclear power station 
in 
Dukovany, whose construction cost 25 billion Czech korunas Kc, 
started operating in 1985. On the basis of the results of a 
Czech and international technical audit, the operation of 
Dukovany will probably be extended from the originally planned 
20 years to 35 or 40, the usual period abroad. The Czech Energy 
Works (CEZ) has a long-term investment programme costing Kc20 
billion ($600,000,000) for the modernization of Dukovany and 
further necessary additions. 
  One of the arguments of environmental initiatives against 
nuclear power stations is the threat of accidents. Weight is 
lent to the fears of environmentalists by the fact that there 
have been three fires at Dukovany between 1991 and 1994. 
  The last of these incidents occurred on Thursday, when 
trouble in the BT-02 branch transformer in the third block 
caused a fire in the transformer shortly after seven in the 
morning. By 9 o' clock [0800 GMT] the fire had been completely 
put out. About 20 cubic meters of oil escaped from the 
transformer, but did not manage to get outside the power 
station. Preliminary estimates put the direct damages at Kc15 
million ($500,000). 
  Another problem for nuclear power stations is the storage of 
nuclear waste. By 1993 there will be 288 tonnes of spent 
radioactive fuel stored in the Czech Republic, in the reactor 
rooms of the Dukovany nuclear power station. 
  From when the first block of Dukovany went into operation in 
1985 until the end of 1993 369 tonnes of highly radioactive 
waste were produced. Of this, 141 tonnes are stored at the 
Jaslovske Bohunice power station in Slovakia, but in 1995 it has 
to start being brought back to the Czech Republic. The 
remainder was in the past taken to the former Soviet Union. 
  The capacity of the tanks in Dukovany is 335 tonnes, and at 
the end of 1995 they will be full. Therefore by the end of the 
year the construction of intermediate storage facilities has to 
be finished, to which spent fuel can be transferred from the 
tanks. 
  Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy says that when 
deciding on the location of the intermediate storage facilities, 
it is important to provide both the public and the local 
authorities with exhaustive information and technical details, 
which is one way from emotions to an objective solution of this 
sensitive problem. 
  The inhabitants of villages such as Horni Cerekev near 
Pelhrimov in south Moravia, which lie in the vicinity of places 
tipped for the possible construction of intermediate storage 
facilities have, however, signed a petition expressing their 
disagreement with the construction. The mayors and local 
counselors of Pelhrimov, Jihlava, Zdar nad Sazavou, Kostelec u 
Jihlavy, Kamenice nad Lipou and other communities have also 
publicly disagreed with the construction.

  [Text] Prague, February 5 (CTK) -- Liberalizing 
agricultural policy in a world or European context is the only 
way of preventing the barricades from being put up, Agriculture 
Minister Josef Lux said at a press conference today on his 
return from a visit to the Unites States. 
  During his meeting with his American counterpart Mike Espy 
they had agreed that it was impossible for these steps to be 
unilateral, but had to have some response from the European 
Union. 
  On developments in agriculture after 1990 Lux said that 
there 
was a rather naive opening up to the world, followed by the 
realization that the world had not opened up to us so much. 
  We must attempt to reduce protectionist policies, but it has 
to be in the context of European Union policy, he said. 
  Given the size of land areas and the concentration of 
production, and assuming that the redressal [as received] of 
property relations would be an important motivating factor, 
Czech Agriculture could be competitive in two or three years' 
time, Lux said. 
  Espy and he had talked about their common view of 
negotiations with the EC, and about how they had a common 
interest -- to aim at reducing the high level of protectionism 
in the EC, Lux said. 
  He told Espy he welcomed the support of American exports to 
the Czech Republic, and asked that they be aimed at those 
commodities of which the Czech Republic had insufficient 
supplies. 
  Lux also told World Bank representatives about the state of 
Czech agriculture. As the World Bank lacked information about 
the state of Czech agricultural transformation, it was agreed 
that an information system would be quickly established so 
enough information could be provided. 
  He said he had met with Californian entrepreneurs, who 
expressed concrete interest in "agrobusiness" contacts. "I 
realized there that our export policy has to be strengthened by 
the physical presence of our people in particular places, such 
as the United States. One and a half business attaches working 
in the United States is not really enough," he said.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 February (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
national dailies on Monday [7 February] carry detailed coverage 
of Saturday's [5 February) mortar attack against the Sarajevo 
market- place, its victims, and the international reaction to 
the drama. The articles sharply condemn the terrorist attack. 
  The commentary of MAGYAR NEMZET notes: 
  "Nothing can justify this brutal action against defenseless 
and innocent people. For the time being, one can only guess 
what steps will follow in the wake of the attack against the 
Bosnian capital, (and also against the civilized world). It is 
obvious that the chances for resolving the crisis through 
negotiations are diminishing. 
  "The Muslims demand that the West use air strikes to deter 
the Bosnian Serbs from the continued siege of Sarajevo and the 
ongoing violent territorial conquests, or that the West make it 
possible, for the Bosnians to protect themselves by lifting the 
arms embargo. 
  "Meanwhile, there are more and more calls in the western 
capitals, as well as in the Brussels NATO command, for military 
intervention. Islamic countries may decide to provide 
assistance to Bosnia, seeing the continued helplessness of the 
western states and international organizations. 
  "It became clear after the Sarajevo market-place drama that 
the international community must take steps, either through 
military actions or by introducing stricter sanctions. It must 
force an end to the war as soon as possible, and achieve a final 
settlement through negotiations. Otherwise, the leading world 
politicians and the international organizations, be it the 
United Nations or NATO, could once and for all lose their 
credibility, and will always have to bear responsibility for 
this," writes the article in MAGYAR NEMZET.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 February (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky held talks with NATO Deputy 
Secretary-General Gebhardt von Moltke in Budapest today [4 
February]. 
  Von Moltke later told reporters he had come to Budapest to 
discuss implementation of the peace-partnership plan and help 
draw up a document in which Hungary would outline its 
cooperation concepts to Brussels. 
  His talks with Jeszenszky concerned the delegation of a 
Hungarian liaison officer to NATO's Brussels headquarters, and 
military-planning cooperation between NATO and Hungary. 
  Von Moltke described the peace-partnership plan as a process 
permitting cooperation on an extensive scale. He said 
preparations would soon begin for the first joint military 
exercise, to be held before the year is out.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 February (MTI) -- "To Hungary, European 
integration is a top foreign policy priority," President Arpad 
Goncz asserted at a meeting with European Union (EU) countries' 
ambassadors to Hungary today, as the Hungary-EU Association 
Agreement came into force. 
  He stressed that European integration, which also guarantees 
the country's stability, will remain a cornerstone of Hungarian 
policy even after spring elections, as it is based on the 
complete consensus of all parliamentary parties and the whole of 
society. 
  EU association means modernization and protection for 
Hungary, and a market to the western half of Europe, Goncz said. 
The agreement is seen as an opportunity for beginning 
substantive political dialogue and boosting economic cooperation. 
  "Cooperation with our neighbours, mainly the Visegrad group, 
is indispensable during the process of integration as well as at 
membership stage. Unification sets an example of cooperation 
for all countries in the region," the president said. 
  The meeting and the subsequent gala dinner were attended by 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky and International Economic 
Relations Minister Bela Kadar.

  [Text] Budapest, 5 Feb (MTI) -- "Elections in Hungary this 
May will be different from what they were in 1990 insofar as 
electors then definitely said no to the former regime, while now 
they have to vote for the future," President Arpad Goncz said on 
radio today. Goncz announced on Friday [4 February] that the 
first round of elections will be held on May 8. 
  In the interview, the president said that the past four 
years 
were a period of looking into the past in many respects -- good 
and bad alike -- but the next elections will already focus on 
perspective aims. He noted that no extremist forces had ever 
come to power in Hungary through elections. 
  According to Goncz, the most important change in the last 
four years was that society has become aware of its strength and 
realized that its fate is in its own hands. 
  MPs should mainly pass major economic laws in the remainder 
of the parliamentary cycle, and abstain from adopting 
legislation that another parliament of different composition 
would refuse to accept, he said. 
  Speaking about international issues, the president mentioned 
his Davos meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
leader Yassir 'Arafat, where he expressed Hungary's readiness to 
participate in reconstruction work in the Gaza Strip and 
Transjordan. Arafat welcomed the proposal and said experts' 
talks would follow. 
  Regarding his Prague consultation with the U.S. President 
and 
NATO's peace-partnership plan, Goncz said that security and 
stability have more aspects than just the military, as they also 
include human-rights, minority, social-welfare and environmental 
questions. 
  He said Hungary had definitely come closer to NATO, adding 
that the country's security can be guaranteed through 
integration into all-European organizations, among them NATO and 
the Western European Union.

  Speaking to journalists in Parliament at a press conference 
broadcast by Hungarian Radio, the president said the second free 
elections would, perhaps, be even more important than the first, 
as they will prove the continuity of democracy. 
  Inasmuch as the second election in the switch to a civil 
democratic order will be clean and moderate, it will also 
provide a good report card on Hungarian democracy, Goncz said. 
  The president called on the country's population to ensure a 
significant turnout at the elections.

  [Text] Budapest, 4 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian Parliament will 
elect the secretary and four members of the National Election 
Committee (NEC) within the next ten days. 
  Under Hungarian electoral law, the minister of the Interior 
proposes candidates for the positions, and Parliament then votes 
on whether to approve the nominees. Every party with candidates 
on the national list will then appoint one member each to 
membership in the NEC, which must have at least nine members. 
  Sometime in March, the parties will be able to collect their 
candidate nomination slips. (The exact date is to be determined 
later.) Recommendations from at least 750 people must be 
collected to enter a candidate in the elections. 
  Candidates in the individual constituencies and those on the 
national and territorial lists of the parties should be 
registered at least 30 days ahead of the election date, which 
today was set for Sunday, May 8, by the president of the 
republic. 
  Under the terms of the electoral law, the country's 11,000 
constituencies should be created within ten days after February 
4. Each constituency must have at least 600, but no more than 
1,200 voters. 
  The law stipulates that there must be at least one voting 
station in every town and village. The election campaign will 
last until midnight, May 6. A campaign ban will be in force 
from then until the end of the voting. The last day when public 
opinion poll results related to the elections are permitted to 
be published is 8 days prior to the elections.

  On Thursday [3 February] the government drew up a list of 
major bills likely to pass in the remainder of the parliamentary 
cycle. The list includes legislation on economic chambers, 
electricity and gas supply, argricultural land, the police, the 
Public Attorney's Office, environmental protection, radio and 
television, the control of persons fulfilling certain important 
functions, the legal standing of soldiers, and prevention of 
money-laundering. 
  Kajdi noted that the list does not include international 
contracts and parliamentary resolutions.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 February (MTI) -- About 80 members of 
the "56-ers Federation," comprising veterans of the 1956 
revolution, staged a demonstration in front of the parliament 
building today, protesting against the fact that both the 
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP), successor to the 
former state party, and the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), a 
parliamentary party set up by reform communists, are allowed to 
operate legally in Hungary and run in the 1994 elections. 
  The demonstrators argued that the operation of both parties 
involves the danger of a communist rollback. 
  In a petition to be sent to Speaker of Parliament Gyorgy 
Szabad, the 56-ers demand that parliament should dissolve both 
parties, freeze their assets, and transfer them to the heroes of 
1956 and their relatives. 
  In the 56-ers' view, as many descendants of the 1956 victims 
as possible should be elected members of parliament and the 
government, so that the danger of a rollback will diminish. 
  The petition presses for a coalition with Christian morals 
to 
be formed after the 1994 elections. 
  Recent polls show that the socialists have strong voter 
support in the country, and the governing coalition sees them as 
its strongest rival. 
  In a simultaneous development, those who suffered a loss in 
biohumus production demonstrated on the other side of the square. 
  Biohumus producers took up loans some years ago. Afterwards, 
despite their valid contracts, they failed to sell biohumus and 
many of them went bankrupt. The 150 or so demonstrators 
gathered in front of parliament to support independent 
smallholder deputy Vilmos Bereczky's proposal of writing off 
their debts.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 February (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
Government will present its media bill to parliament by next 
Monday [7 February], Deputy State Secretary of Justice Janos 
Weber told reporters during an interval in today's government 
session. 
  The bill determines general rules for broadcasting and 
specific provisions for public service media and commercial 
media. 
  Under the bill, parliament will set up public foundations to 
provide guarantees for the operation of Hungarian Radio and 
Hungarian Television as public service media. The assets of the 
foundations will be handled by boards of trustees. 
  The presidents of both media will be appointed by the 
president of the republic, at the prime minister's proposal. 
  Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television will be controlled 
by large supervisory committees, representing all strata of 
Hungarian society. The boards will operate independently from 
the public foundations. 
  The bill specifies a general framework for the operation of 
local public service broadcasters, guarantees their independence 
from the local authorities, and creates the necessary social 
controls. 
  Parliament held a vote on a former version of the media bill 
in late December 1992, at which time it was rejected.

  [Text] Budapest, 1 Feb (MTI) -- The director of the 
Criminal Justice Department of the National Police, Brigadier 
General Antal Kacziba, called for more precise legal definitions 
to protect society more effectively from extremist phenomena, at 
a news conference in Budapest today. He proposed punishing 
extremist conspiracy as well. 
  Kacziba said that criminal proceedings had been launched 
against two members of the World National Popular Rule Party 
(WNPRP), suspected of having committed the crime of incitement 
against a community. The suspects are Albert Szabo, 29, a dual 
Hungarian-Australian citizen who heads the party, and Akos B., a 
juvenile activist. They made a confession, but did not plead 
guilty. 
  As previously reported, the complaint lodged by the National 
Security Office against the two had some connection with the 
WNPRP meeting in Budapest in mid-January, where they denied that 
the Holocaust had ever taken place and defined themselves as 
successors to the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its 
leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes 
against humanity. 
  The police investigated 16 skinhead attacks involving 88 
suspects, 22 of whom were taken into custody, Kacziba said. 
  In the same period, the Budapest court tried three cases on 
charges of serious bodily or mental harm caused to people for 
their affiliation to an ethnic, racial or religious minority. 
The court could not establish proof of this criminal motivation 
in any of the cases, but imposed a penalty for grevious bodily 
harm with base motives, and hooliganism. Appeals may be filed. 
  Seven lawsuits involved the use of extremist symbols. Most 
recently, the police received a complaint against the Budapest 
organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, for 
displaying a coat-of-arms with a five-pointed red star at their 
televised meeting on November 7. 
  Kacziba stressed that the criminal code uses no terms like 
"left wing" and "right wing," and the police are not supposed to 
qualify the political views of offenders. It is the duty of the 
National Security Office to detect extremist groupings. The 
police only conduct criminal proceedings.

  [Text] Budapest, 3 February (MTI) -- The presidium of the 
Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ), one of the most popular 
opposition parties according to polls, has declared its support 
for plans by the four liberal parties -- the FIDESZ, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, the Entrepreneurs' Party, and the 
Agrarian Federation -- to conclude a cooperation pact for the 
spring parliamentary elections. The FIDESZ would like to see 
the document signed as soon as possible, FIDESZ Deputy Chairman 
Tamas Deutsch told the press in Budapest today. 
  Deutsch feels that such an accord is worth concluding on the 
basis of the principal agreement from Monday's [31 January] 
meeting of liberal parties, even if party leaders fail to come 
to an understanding about backing each other. 
  The four-party agreement would concern cooperation during 
the 
two election rounds. 
  By the FIDESZ's interpretation, mutual support between party 
chairmen would mean that in constituencies where the leader of 
one of the four parties runs for election, the other three 
parties would enter no candidate. 
  Deutsch announced that, contrary to earlier plans, FIDESZ 
deputy Imre Frajna will not run for election in the individual 
constituency where Chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
Ivan Peto will compete for the mandate.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 Feb (MTI) -- The Hungarian Army and the 
Ministry of the Interior's Fire and Civil Defence National 
Command have set up an Accident Information Centre in Budapest, 
in order to avert nuclear accidents and catastrophes. 
  The centre, to work as part of the operation staff of the 
nuclear accident prevention government committee, is to 
coordinate the national radiation monitoring, signalling and 
control systems of the two organizations. 
  The network is to provide continuous information from 60 
points throughout the country on the radioactive radiation 
level. The measuring stations are to measure the gamma doses in 
the air, which is termed harmful to health if measuring 500 
nanosievert per hour. (measurements between 1000 and 5000 nsv 
were registered in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear 
accident.) 
  With the decline in the danger of nuclear explosions and 
nuclear attacks, the accident information centre will mainly 
focus on nuclear power plant accidents, the delivery of nuclear 
materials, and possible meteorite impacts. 
  The majority of the measuring stations will be operated near 
barracks, as they are affiliated to the army, however, the 
Central Physics Research Institute of Budapest and the Paks 
Nuclear Power Plant (southern Hungary) will also carry out 
measurements. Data will be continuously evaluated and stored in 
the centre, and if higher than average figures are reported, 
immediate measures can be taken by involving the civil defence 
and army units.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 3 -- Visiting President of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Miguel Angel 
Martinez met on Thursday with representatives of the Polish 
parliament and government to review the issues of Poland's role 
in the Council of Europe and European integration. 
  One of the aims of my visit is to persuade the Polish 
parliamentarians to engage themselves more closely in the 
formulation of the future Europe, said Martinez after meeting 
Sejm and Senate Speakers Jozef Oleksy and Adam Struzik 
respectively. 
  Speaking after his meeting with Jozef Oleksy, Martinez said 
that Poland is playing an important role in the Council of 
Europe which will help facilitate and speed up Poland's 
integration with the European structures. 
  Jozef Oleksy said that Poland no longer needed to fight to 
justify its place in Europe, and said that he and Martinez were 
agreed that Poland should be a driving force for initiatives in 
the Council of Europe. Oleksy proposed that the Council of 
Europe should open a representative office in Warsaw along with 
the lines of the office of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  Adam Struzik said after meeting Martinez that their talks 
covered Poland's role in creating a bridge between Western 
Europe and eastern neighbours of Poland. 
  The situation in Poland following the September 1993 
parliamentary elections was also touched upon during the 
meeting. The visiting president of the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe met Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
to discuss Poland's participation in the Council of Europe's 
efforts aimed at European integration and stabilization of 
democratic institutions on the continent. The two politicians 
reviewed European security issues and the situation in Russia 
and Ukraine. 
  Martinez also met with leader of the parliamentary caucus of 
the Democratic Union (UD) Bronislaw Geremek and discussed with 
him the question of a possible admission of Russia and Ukraine 
to the Council of Europe. 
  Despite expectations, the talks did not touch upon the 
subject of UD's resignation from participation in the Polish 
delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. The UD's decision came in protest over the election of 
Tadeusz Iwinski, an SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) mp, as deputy 
president of the assembly. 
  The principle that decisions on the composition of the 
Polish 
delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe are taken in parliament and not outside of it, is the 
condition of the presence of Confederation for an independent 
Poland (KPN) in the delegation, party leader Leszek Moczulski 
said after meeting Martinez. 
  Moczulski claimed that such decisions should be made by all 
parties represented in the Sejm on a consensus basis. He added, 
however, that "from the point of view of a political rivalry in 
Poland, the KPN's condition is impossible to be met." 
  KPN has been assigned one place in the 12-member delegation 
but the party decided not to appoint a party candidate and said 
it wants an equal number of delegation members. They are 
elected or appointed by the Sejm from among its members and 
political parties in the delegation follow the proportion of 
their strength in the Sejm.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 4 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak met 
at the Sejm on Friday with President of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe Miguel Angel Martinez. The 
talk focused on issues that were already discussed in Brussels, 
namely, Poland's full participation in the European structures. 
  The meeting was attended by Spanish Ambassador to Poland M. 
Jose Antonio Lopez Zaton and Chairman of the Polish Delegation 
to the Council of Europe Tadeusz Iwinski, the government press 
office reported. Martinez said that negotiations aiming at 
peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina were now the most significant 
issue for the Council of Europe. In this context he spoke about 
the necessity to work out legal solutions concerning national 
minorities. Next, Martinez stressed that in his opinion 
mechanisms of authority in Poland have been stabilised and thus 
Poland was a reliable and valuable partner for the Council of 
Europe. 
  Waldemar Pawlak and Miguel Angel Martinez shared the view 
that participation in the Council of Europe was a chance of a 
better future for such countries as Poland and Spain, the 
communique issued by the government press office said.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb. 3 -- We want to do business with 
Western European countries which will benefit both sides, Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak told his audience here Thursday 
addressing an international conference devoted to Poland. 
  The conference, organized by the Washington-based Centre for 
International and Strategic Studies, was attended by the German 
Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Member of the European 
Commission Sir Leon Brittan, representatives of Polish political 
and economic circles, including Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Hanna 
Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Janusz Lewandowski, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, and 
many other Polish and West European politicians and businessmen. 
  Pawlak said that trade concessions offered Poland by Western 
European nations were fine in theory but that in practice 
enormous administrative and bureaucratic obstacles remained. He 
declared a staunch defence of the Polish interests and 
reiterated the firm will of Poland to fully integrate with the 
European Union. 
  The Prime Minister spoke in high terms of the Polish 
economic 
situation, mentioning this year's targets of 4.5 percent growth 
in the GDP and an inflation rate of ca. 25 per cent. But he 
said the days of easy profits from investments in Poland were 
over and that his government was now looking "to do business 
which is good for both sides."

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 5 -- The post-communist Social Democracy 
of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), the leading element in the 
Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), on Saturday called for urgent 
consultations with its government coalition partner the Polish 
Peasant Party (PSL), in a move aimed to defuse the crisis caused 
by the resignation of Finance Minister Marek Borowski. 
  Commenting on Saturday's extraordinary session of the SDRP 
Supreme Council, SLD parliamentary spokesman Jerzy Szmajdzinski 
said that the party saw no reason to allow an escalation of the 
conflict, and that the SLD-PSL coalition, which took power to 
resolve the most pressing problems facing poland, could resolve 
the present dispute. He reported that sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy 
(SLD) had held a meeting with prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak on 
Saturday morning, and that the prime minister had stressed his 
wish to avoid further tensions. 
  Szmajdzinski said that the SDRP Supreme Council accepted 
with 
regret the resignation of Marek Borowski, but hoped his 
competence and qualifications would be used to full advantage in 
the future. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the SDRP and also of the 
SLD, said that he hoped a coalition meeting could be arranged 
within hours, and said that it would be very bad if the 
existence of the coalition were threatened. He stressed that 
the SDRP council was firmly convinced borowski was the 
best-qualified person to hold the post of finance minister. 
  Despite the SDRP calls for an urgent coalition meeting, it 
seemed unlikely on Saturday evening that a meeting would be held 
over the weekend. At PSL headquarters in Warsaw city centre, 
there was no- one present on Saturday evening to comment on the 
SDRP request. 
  Kwasniewski also stressed the need for transparency in the 
regulation of relations within the coalition, which would not 
disintegrate so long as the guide-lines were clear, and as long 
as both parties wished for agreement. For our part, that was 
our clear intention, he said, adding that the Saturday session 
of the SDRP Supreme Council repeated this once again, and that 
it was hoped that the PSL would make the same declaration. 
  However, the SDRP leadership was at pains to stress that, 
were the coalition to fall, the result would be political 
instability. "We trust that Mr Pawlak and the leadership of the 
PSL are aware of all the consequences of a failure to agree," 
commented Szmajdzinski. He recalled once again the need on both 
sides to honour the coalition agreement, and noted that most of 
the demands which Marek Borowski had put forward as his terms 
for remaining as finance minister formed part of that agreement. 
  Late on Saturday, PAP received a statement from the SDRP 
Supreme Council, which appealed to the leadership and the 
parliamentary group of the PSL for "a meeting as soon as 
possible between the leading elements in the coalition to 
examine the clauses of the coalition agreement, and to make such 
changes so that it would not be possible to breach its letter or 
its spirit." 
  The SDRP statement concluded: "We unanimously expect the 
Government of the Republic of Poland to adopt a document 
defining precisely the competences of persons in high office, 
the range of their responsibilities, and their obligations 
towards their coalition partner."

  [Text] Warsaw, 3 Feb -- In the course of the two-day visit 
to Brussels by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, the most 
satisfying aspect was the opening-up of our partners' to our 
initiatives. The head of the government told journalists of 
this upon his return to Warsaw's Okecie airport. 
  Referring to the inauguration of the Association Treaty with 
the European Communities, the prime minister said that real 
association will be decided not by declaration but by 
cooperation, especially economic. On that side, there is the 
will to seek practical solutions that will allow for the 
overcoming of negative tendencies in trade exchange, Pawlak 
assured. 
  Journalists questioned the prime minister, above all, about 
the case of Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski. Pawlak stated 
that he will meet on Thursday [3 February] with Democratic Left 
Alliance leader Aleksander Kwasniewski and a number of other 
people. He announced that in the course of the meeting he will 
see if press rumors about Borowski's planned resignation are 
certain. 
  He reported that he had spoken with the deputy prime 
minister 
so often that he did not see any cause for misunderstanding. 
"If I had problems with cooperation with Mr. Borowski, then the 
explanation would surely be between myself and Mr. Borowski," he 
stated, adding that the dismissed Deputy Minister of Finance 
Stefan Kawalec "would certainly not take part in this."

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 3 -- The leader of the Democratic Left 
alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski told a press conference 
here Thursday he would meet Prime Minister Pawlak Thursday night 
to discuss not just the dismissal of vice-minister of finance 
but also more fundamental problems of governing the country. 
  Kwasniewski said that "there are serious problems which 
should not be underrated," but declined to give a clear cut 
answer to reporters' questions about the possible resignation of 
Vice-Premier and Finance Minister Marek Borowski. 
  The leader of SLD declared that "it would certainly be the 
worst way out if we provoked a major rift within the ruling 
coalition or a political conflict on a national scale" and added 
that there were numerous possibilities of avoiding such a 
scenario. 
  According to Kwasniewski, neither his alliance nor the 
Polish 
Peasant Party (PSL) of Prime Minister pawlak had at the present 
time any alternative to the current coalition arrangment. What 
was needed was a better coordination of their activities. 
  Referring to the expected topics of his Thursday night 
meeting with Pawlak, Kwasniewski said he wanted to discuss not 
only the style and manners of making politics but a few 
fundamental questions as well. They were the mode of operation 
of the government and economic concepts. 
  In this connection Kwasniewski spoke critically about 
opinions on economic issues voiced recently by PSL politicians 
such as the minister for foreign economic cooperation, the 
chairman of the Sejm Privatization Committee and the prime 
minister.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 3 -- Deputy Labour Minister Andrzej 
Baczkowski on Thursday voiced his surprise at the Feb. 2 
decision of Solidarity not to join the negotiations on social 
guarantees. He added that his offer stands but the talks will 
start as scheduled on Feb. 4 regardless of the union's decision. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Warsaw, Baczkowski said 
that 
the trade unions were invited to take part in "major structural 
negotiations on issues which are fundamental to the living 
standards of the society and aimed at working out social 
guarantees for the coming years." The deputy labour minister 
said it is "sad and incomprehensible" that the talks will have 
to be held without Solidarity. 
  Responding to one of the demands of Solidarity to start 
enterprise pact-guaranteed negotiations between the government, 
trade unions and employers, Baczkowski said that the talks could 
begin only when the labour code has been amended as farmers' 
trade unions and local governments are not named as partners in 
the negotiations. 
  Member of the Presidium of the Solidarity National 
Commission 
Jerzy Ostrouch said that in the light of Baczkowski's 
statements, the union's decision not to join the talks was right. 
  He claimed that "one has to do something with the budget 
first" and then talk about social guarantees for future.

  [Text] Bialystok, 3 Feb -- In the opinion of Donald Tusk, 
the leader of the Liberal Democratic Congress [KLD], the merger 
with the Democratic Union [UD] is "a commonsense marriage," and 
the process of merging, which had already been started, is 
irreversible. On the 3d of this month, Tusk said in Bialystok 
that the new party will also be counting on the so-called 
absentee electorate. He added that the UD-KLD unification 
congress will take place in April this year. 
  "The unification itself of the two parties does not give any 
positive effect, and it can cause withdrawal of small, marginal 
groups from the new party. While maintaining everything that is 
good in the KLD and the UD, the most important task for the new 
party will be to create such an image of the party that would be 
attractive to the "absentee electorate," Tusk stated. 
  "As far as the leadership of the two parties is concerned, 
the determination [to merge] is mutual. Amid the party 
grass-roots there is skepticism, as such a merger for the 
middle-rank people in the union and the congress will mean lost 
opportunities for promotion because the internal competition 
will increase," the leader of the KLD said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 7 -- A new grouping, the Conservative 
Coalition, was established on Monday by some members of the 
Conservative Party (PK), including Michal Ujazdowski, Lech 
Mazewski, Andrzej Raj and Pawel Zalewski. 
  Ujazdowski told a press conference on Monday, that a dispute 
has been going on since the time the PK was established as to 
whether Polish conservatism is to be a fragment of the Polish 
right-wing. he maintained that the faction within the PK, headed 
by the party's leader Aleksander Hall, teetered between the 
right-wing and the Democratic Union which he described as 
inconsistent with the target of the PK. 
  Ujazdowski added that a peaceful split was a better solution 
than an exhausting fight. "In our opinion there is no 
conservatism beyond the right-wing. The split was a condition 
for the integration of the right-wing," he said. 
  The Conservative Coalition supports a fast integration of 
the 
Polish right-wing parties into one coalition. He declared that 
his grouping would cooperate with the coalition made up of the 
Centre Alliance, the Christian National Union, the Peasant 
Agreement and the Movement for the Republic of Poland and would 
seek the cooperation of the Christian Democrats party and the 
Real Politics Union. 
  The right wing needs to be integrated as fast as possible 
and 
to create an attractive alternative for the leftist rule. We 
hope that our efforts will lead to the formation of one grand 
right-wing coalition, Ujazdowski said. 
  He added that the diversification of the right-wing parties 
was not an obstacle to their integration. He also reported that 
the Conservative Coalition is being supported by a half of the 
Conservative Party local structures, that is some 1,000 people.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 3/2/1994 -- Lord David Owen, in 
Bucharest now together with Thorvald Stoltenberg, thanked 
President Iliescu for the opportunity offered to them to 
exchange views on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Romania 
has an important contribution to make, you have good relations 
with the countries from the area. I think now is the proper 
moment for Romania's influence on this conflict to be felt, " 
mentioned the co-president for the European Community of the 
International Conference on Former Yugoslavia. He added that 
the true dimension of the losses suffered in consequence of the 
enforcement of the embargo are known, and so are the disbalances 
that have appeared among compensations for the neighbors of 
former Yugoslavia. The European Union is in charge of giving 
compensations to Romania, but it has not done enough in this 
respect, said Owen who gave assurances that the efforts of the 
Romanian Government would be given due response. 
  As for the continuation of the peace process, the mediator 
said that the plan of action drafted by the European Union was 
being examined by the three parties in conflict. 
  As for the intention of a number of Muslim leaders, that is 
of troops to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the aegis of 
the United Nations, Lord Owen mentioned that the Muslim 
countries had had access from the very start and Egypt had even 
sent troops to Sarajevo. Malaysia and Pakistan announced their 
readiness to participate in the UN actions in that area. What 
will follow, that will be decided by the UN Secretariat-General. 
The strategy used as a rule is not to involve the countries in 
the proximity of the conflict, and in this case the strategy 
also refers to the non-involvement of Muslim countries in the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 3/2/1994 -- Adrian Nastase, 
speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, had an interview, Thursday, 
February 3, with Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, 
co-presidents of the International Conference on Former 
Yugoslavia, currently in Bucharest. The guests spoke about the 
stage of the negotiations conducted in search of a solution to 
the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Adrian Nastase reiterated 
Romania's viewpoints on this issue. The speaker of the Chamber 
of Deputies underlined that Romania had scrupulously observed 
the UN embargo on Yugoslavia, and mentioned the direct and 
indirect losses the embargo had caused to the Romanian economy, 
totalling seven million U.S. dollars. The very huge negative 
effects of such a situation may make Romania and other countries 
find it impossible to observe such international measures in the 
future, added he. In reply, Lord Owen said that he was sure 
that a mechanism had to be put in place by which losses caused 
by the enforcement of international sanctions automatically 
trigger compensations. The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies 
said that Romania was appreciative of the efforts made by the 
negotiators in search of a viable, peaceful solution to the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia. He added that Romania was ready to 
be host to a number of activities related to the negotiations. 
  The meeting at the Chamber of Deputies had the aspect of 
consultations on Romania's stance regarding the solutions 
proposed for the crisis in its proximity.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 4/2/1994 -- "We have managed to 
keep offenses at a steady level in January and even obtain a 
decline of most serious ones, like murder, death-inflicting 
assault, rape and burglary", told a news conference on February 
3 Major-General Ion Pitulescu, chief of the General Police 
Inspectorate. "However, there has been a worrying mounting of 
the number of thefts from the commercial companies (from 456 in 
January 1993 to 1015 in January 1994, especially because of the 
companies' failure to secure their own guard and protection), as 
well as with corruption, as 218 persons were accused of bribery 
and 69 of peddling influence. In terms of social category, 51 
offenders are public servants, 19 are company managers and 
general managers, 17 bank functionaries and 20 private economic 
agents." 
  Interior Minister Lieutenant-General Ioan George Danescu 
outlined to the journalists a program of measures meant to 
increase the efficiency of the police actions of controlling and 
averting the infringement of the law. The minister said pride 
of place would be given in future to the fight against 
corruption, that has taken on worrying proportions. He said 
anti-corruption squads were set up, that increased the 
efficiency of actions in this domain. 
  The news conference was also attended by American Historian 
Larry Watts, a consultant of the project for ethnic relations 
that pursues, both in Romania and in the Eastern European 
countries, the development of a model of relations that should 
ease the tensions especially between Gypsy ethnics and the 
majority population.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- It is distorting to speak 
about an ethnically pure Hungarian population in southern 
Slovakia, as the population of all the concerned regions is 
mixed, in some places with a considerable Hungarian majority, 
the Slovak Government daily REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  The daily denies the statistics which inspired 
representatives of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians to call for 
establishing their own regions, which REPUBLIKA calls 
"Bantustans," at their meeting in Komarno, South Slovakia, on 
January 8. 
  The daily challenges the Komarno meeting's statement that 
600,000 people with Hungarian as their mother tongue are living 
in Slovakia. "only 556,447 citizens (10.5 percent of the 
country's inhabitants) claimed Hungarian as their mother tongue 
during the last census in 1991," REPUBLIKA states. 
  It also casts doubt on the statement that the 522 Slovakia's 
towns and villages where Hungarians form a majority are located 
in a belt along Slovakia's southern border, and that this 
territory is inhabited by 98 percent of all the country's ethnic 
Hungarians, who make up a 70-percent majority here. There are 
such towns on the territory as Levice, Lucenec, Sala, Roznava 
and others, where only 10 to 31 percent are ethnic Hungarians, 
the daily stresses. The figure of 98 percent is controversial 
as well because in Bratislava and Kosice alone, which are not 
lying in the mentioned belt, there live 5.48 percent of all 
Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians, it adds. 
  It criticises the "demagogic distortion of facts" the 
arrogance and chauvinist feelings of superiority of the 
protagonists of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement, which, 
however, cannot be blamed on all Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians. 
"But the "Henleinisation" of the situation of Slovakia's 
Hungarian ethnic minority cannot be ignored," REPUBLIKA says. 
  Hungarian politicians are "calling for democracy but 
continue 
in perceiving, thinking and acting like their Greater Hungarian 
predecessors, members of the `dominating' nation, the 
`dominating moral' of which allows the chauvinist supra-people 
to do everything, including establishing Bantustans in the 
centre of Europe," the daily states.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia (CTK) -- Deputy Premier Roman 
Kovac and leaders of the Associative Council of Romanies of the 
Slovak Republic today met to discuss ways of integrating 
Romanies into society and their specific suggestions for dealing 
with Romany issues. 
  The main subjects of discussion were Romany education, the 
development of Romany culture and social issues. Kovac said the 
Romany leaders' suggestions would be worked into a new 
government Romany policy program, which will be discussed by the 
Slovak Government this March. 
  Kovac praised the shift in the approach of the Romanies, who 
had managed to unite in the Associative Council and to defend 
their interests together. This allowed government policy to be 
formulated in the spirit of Romany needs, he said. 
  He also expressed "certain fears" of the possible 
immigration 
of Romanies from the Czech to the Slovak Republic connected with 
a tougher policy on Romanies in the Czech Republic. The latest 
report on human rights in the world by the U.S. State Department 
had drawn attention to this, Kovac said, adding that the Slovak 
Republic would never manage to deal with such immigration 
without foreign aid.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- The most recent talks 
within the Council of Europe [CE] Parliamentary Assembly 
revealed a general member distaste for granting national 
minorities more rights than current documents already give them, 
a Foreign Ministry press spokeswoman, Daniela Rozgonova, said 
Wednesday [3 February]. 
  The first round of expert talks on minorities took place in 
Strasbourg on January 24-28. In accordance with the autumn 1993 
CE summit in Vienna, these talks are supposed to produce by the 
end of this year a series of international documents codifying 
minority rights. 
  "The most active delegation was the Hungarian, whose 
position 
could be described as extreme," Rozgonova said, adding that 
Slovakia had pointed out it preferred to stress individual 
rights for members of minorities, since protecting individual 
rights represented the greatest guarantee of a democracy's 
functioning.

politician (25 percent). Next came Vladimir Meciar with 21 
percent and third SDL Chairman Peter Weiss with 14 percent. 
  The poll was conducted between January 26 and February 1, 
and 
therefore its results were not influenced by the present

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament 
today refused to include an amendment bill to the Penal Code in 
the agenda of its current session. The amendment recommends 
that Articles 102 and 103 on defamation of the republic and the 
head of state be abolished. Sixty-four deputies from the total 
of 140 present voted for inclusion of the bill. Seventy 
deputies were against and six abstained. 
  On Wednesday [2 February], the Slovak Government approved 
the 
deputy-drafted amendment bill, in light of recommendations by 
two organisations for the protection of human rights -- Amnesty 
International and the Helsinki Committee. 
  The parliamentary opposition says the draft amendment has 
not 
been completed. It considers the government's striving for 
quick passage of the amendment to be an effort to acquit an 
active member of the government Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS), the state secretary of the Privatisation 
Ministry, Ivan Lexa, who is being prosecuted for defamation of 
the head of state, President Michal Kovac.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 2 (CTK) -- Beginning next week, the 
Slovak market is to be protected from imports, including those 
from the Czech Republic, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar said at 
a meeting of his Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) today 
in connection with Slovakia's clearing accounts deficit. 
  Meciar did not give any details about the planned protective 
measures, saying only that he would discuss the matter with 
economics ministers on Saturday [5 February]. 
  Meciar said that the Czech Government had lowered the 
value-added tax (VAT) on some goods in order to erase the 
difference between the values of the Czech and Slovak crowns, 
which was hurting Czech exports. 
  On another topic, Meciar said that the holding of Slovak 
gold 
by the Czech Republic was a violation of international 
agreements. Slovakia is taking the necessary steps to protect 
its interests, he said. He also expressed the suspicion that 
the Czech Republic intends to return the ten tonnes of gold in 
the form of gold bars, and not, for instance, objects of art 
with a higher value. "Bars have one value and gold statuary has 
another," he stated. 
  At the meeting, Meciar also said that the HZDS would submit 
to parliament a bill on taking away mandates from deputies who 
leave the party they were elected to represent while still 
serving their term. If parliament does not pass the bill, he 
said, the HZDS is determined to put it to referendum.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 3 (CTK) -- Slovakia considers the 
Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) as a test before 
joining the European Union market. Together with the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia advocates shortening the term for removal of 
customs and non-tariff barriers from eight to five years. 
  Economic ministers of the four CEFTA countries -- the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- are expected to 
approve speeding up the liberalisation of mutual trade on 
February 4. 
  "We do not want to slide back to the times of COMECON 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], but want to revive 
trade among Central European countries," Miroslav Adamis, 
director of the Multilateral Cooperation Section at the Slovak 
Ministry of Economy, told CTK today. 
  He said CEFTA's importance resides in liberalising trade, 
even though it does not free financial flows, capital and 
labour. It will thus enable its member countries to see what is 
in store for them when they join the free market of the 
12-member European Union. 
  The use of European Union rules on the origin of goods at 
the 
same time supports cooperation of enterprises from CEFTA 
countries in penetrating Western markets. 
  "The CEFTA countries have not yet coped with the decline of 
trade after the transition to accounting in freely convertible 
currencies in 1991, when it turned out that our goods could not 
compete with Western offerings," Adamis said. 
  "CEFTA's reviving influence did not manifest itself more 
even 
when further decline stopped. Last year's trade turnovers with 
Poland and Hungary remained on the level of 1992. But this year 
CEFTA can be expected to bring results," he added. 
  Around one-half of the trade turnover is fully liberalised, 
according to Adamis, and the next stage of removal customs 
duties will begin in July. Most industrial products will be 
freed from customs duties before 1998. But even shortening the 
original term for removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers from 
eight to five years will not free all goods from the "protective 
umbrella." 
  Adamis said he believed there was no political will to 
accept 
other countries to CEFTA, but that cooperation could be expanded 
through bilateral agreements on free trade, especially with 
Slovenia, Romania and possibly also with Turkey and Israel. The 
Czech Republic remains Slovakia's main trade partner.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, Feb 3 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
Slovakia overdrew the credit in the clearing with the Czech 
Republic by $50 million, Vice-Governor of the Slovak National 
Bank (NBS) Marian Jusko tells the opposition SME. The balance 
is exceptional and it should be reduced substantially in next 
months, he adds. 
  Half of the January amount resulted from paying installment 
for credit drawn sooner, the balance will presumably be lower 
later on, Jusko says. 
  The foreign reserves of the NBS, excluding gold, reached 
$384.7 million as of January 31, Jusko reports. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the basis of its verdict pronounced on 8 
February, a five-member panel of the Supreme Court, chaired by 
Court Deputy Chairman Melkon Melkonyan, has suspended the 
resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Republic 
of Bulgaria on 16 and 20 December 1993 on dismissing the 
following members of the Privatization Agency Supervisory Board: 
Nikola Katsarski, Yonko Kalpazanov, Dimitur Saraivanov, Todor 
Borilkov, and Lazar Buchvarov. 
  The Supreme Court established that the Council of Ministers 
has once more acted illegally by committing a breach of the 
Constitution and of legal acts. The Council of Ministers has 
abused its power, which is an inadmissible offense in a 
rule-of-law state, especially if committed by an organ that is 
responsible for the comprehensive administration of the country, 
the Supreme Court's announcement reads.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the </F>
Bulgarian Army General Staff, by Major Krasen Buchkov; place and 
date not given: "Champagne for Bill Is Being Chilled"] 
  [Text] [Buchkov] Mr. Army General, how do you explain the 
Armed Forces and Defense Bill being adopted at the first reading? 
  [Petrov] The adoption of the Armed Forces and Defense Bill 
with a substantial majority is absolutely normal when one takes 
into consideration the fact that it guarantees the country's 
security structures -- the Bulgarian Army, the Border Troops, 
the Troops of the Ministry of Transportation, the Construction 
Troops.... 
  The adoption of the bill was anticipated by all soldiers and 
our entire public. This is not a secret, narrow departmental 
bill, but a document of national importance that unites the 
ideas and visions of the Armed Forces' future. 
  I was not surprised by the fact that the bill was adopted in 
an ostensibly rapid manner after constructive debate and 
discussion. This actually means that the people's 
representatives have deeply grasped the problems of our national 
security, skillfully dealt with the specific subject, and 
precisely and clearly expressed their positions. 
  [Buchkov] What does the Army gain from the adoption of the 
Armed Forces and Defense Bill by parliament? 
  [Petrov] First of all, the bill determines the Armed Forces' 
place and role as a stabilizing factor in the period of 
transition and in our democratic civil society. It also 
guarantees Bulgaria's territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
Second, the bill ensures the Armed Forces' functional 
character, structure, and development. It regulates legally the 
relations between the various organs of the Armed Forces' 
leadership and improves, to a large degree, the status of the 
military. 
  Naturally, the mere act of adopting the bill will not ensure 
the high social status of the military. However, it is the 
legal guarantee of the military personnel's security. The 
military deserve their bill, because they, and indeed, all 
Bulgarian society, endured a lot until the bill was adopted. 
  [Buchkov] How do you expect events to develop at the 
National Assembly during the second reading? 
  [Petrov] Against the background of the deputies' statements 
during the first reading, I expect that some of the bill's 
postulates will significantly improve during the second reading. 
  [Buchkov] Where do you see the "hazards" of the bill that 
was adopted at the first reading? 
  [Petrov] This is a basic bill that determines the general 
tenets of the Armed Forces' construction. Additional bills will 
be adopted later on; for example, bills on alternative service, 
the military personnel's status, the Bulgarian Army, the 
economic foundations of defense, and so on. At present, the 
bill has no postulates about the status of military education 
establishments. This aspect must be clarified. In other words, 
more bills that spring from the Armed Forces and Defense Bill 
will be adopted. 
  [Buchkov] Mr. Army General, is it time to open the champagne 
bottles? 
  [Petrov] Not yet. Let it chill. If all goes well, we will 
soon clink glasses.

<F P=106> [Emil Mildov report: "One Third of Air Force Aircraft Are </F>
Faulty, In 1994 Bulgaria Could Find Itself Without Combat Air 
Force"] 
  [Text] The Air Force could stop all flights in 1994 
because it does not have enough money to maintain its combat 
readiness, Lieutenant General Mikho Mikhov, Air Force commander, 
said on 3 February. He also said that there is a real danger 
that the accident rate will go up. 
  By a miracle an accident with the most modern MiG-29 
aircraft 
was avoided last night at Ravnets Airport. The reasons for the 
near miss -- the lack of pilot training and the shortage of 
spare parts, fuel, and lubricants, Mikho Mikhov said. 
  The ratio of aviation resources vis-a-vis our neighbors is 1 
to 1.6 and even 2.6 to Bulgaria's disadvantage. The combat 
readiness aircraft are of the second, third, and fourth 
generations. Only 8 percent of the total number of aircraft are 
modern aircraft. In neighboring countries the corresponding 
percentage is 45-50 percent, Gen. Mikhov said. Scheduled 
repairs were not carried out at the end of 1993 because of a 
shortage of spare parts. Some 31 percent of the airplanes and 
46 percent of the helicopters are faulty. 
  If the envisaged budget does not provide the Air Force with 
funds for technical supples, by the end of 1994 some 80 percent 
of the aircraft will be defective. The Air Force needs a 
minimum of 4 billion leva. More than 1 billion leva are needed 
to maintain the missile and antiaircraft troops.

<F P=106> [Stefan Kostov report: "Kenan Unmasks DPS in Talks With </F>
Turkish Politicians"] 
  [Text] The main goal of my visit to Ankara and Istanbul 
was to disperse the Turkish political circles' illusions about 
the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] and its leader Ahmed 
Dogan, Adem Kenan, leader of the unregistered Turkish Democratic 
Party, said to STANDART NEWS. 
  With many clips of Dogan's statements, Mr. Kenan proved his 
claim that the DPS works against the interests of the Turkish 
minority in Bulgaria. His strongest argument was that the 
current DPS charter differs significantly from the documents 
presented to the Turkish and world public when the movement 
registered. 
  Adem Kenan visited National Assembly Chairman Necmettin 
Cindoruk for 18 days, and, he says, succeeded in convincing him 
not only of Dogan's double game, but also of the fact that the 
DPS serves only the interests of the former "revivers," and 
their present day servants -- Dogan's circle. 
  In an open letter, attached to excerpts of his book "Last 
Strike," and personal talks with leaders of parliamentarian and 
extraparliamentarian parties, Kenan revealed the grave 
socioeconomic situation of the Turks in Bulgaria and the 
continuing ethnocultural obliteration. In statements carried by 
ORTA DOU, noted politicians supported the mission of Mr. Kenan 
and his party in saving the Turkish ethnic minority in Bulgaria. 
  Mr. Kenan expressed his regret that he could not meet Tansu 
Ciller, however, he was assured that, by 15 May, he will receive 
an official invitation from the Turkish prime minister. 
  Mr. Kenan reached an agreement with major business clubs on 
the allocation of 50 stipends for Bulgarian students interested 
in studying at Turkish higher education establishments. The 
sole condition is that they should not be children of 
participants in the revival process. He added that 55 of the 75 
students sent to Turkey by Dogan are children of such parents. 
  The DPS does not have two charters and Mr. Kenan is 
manipulating the mass media, Mrs. Sherife Mustafa told STANDART 
NEWS. According to her, the movement's charter was amended and 
supplemented at the last national conference. The charter 
merely specifies the functions of the separate structures and 
their leaders.

  [Text] [Announcer] We begin our reports with developments 
in the Yugoslav crisis at home and abroad. [Hungarian Foreign 
Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, who visited Serbia a few days ago, 
talked about the Yugoslav situation this afternoon at a news 
conference. Miklos Lengyel reports: 
  [Lengyel] Hungary supports the lifting of sanctions against 
the rump Yugoslavia only if Belgrade meets international 
expectations, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized at his press briefing 
today. The Hungarian foreign minister said that pressure on the 
Hungarian minority in Serbia had eased. Hungary was striving 
for balanced relations with all successor states to Yugoslavia. 
  The Hungarian foreign minister also plans to visit Zagreb 
and 
Sarajevo soon. Geza Jeszenszky thinks there is still a chance 
of finding some sort of peace solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  However, Geza Jeszenszky considered it regrettable that 
Istvan Szentivanyi, an Alliance of Free Democrats deputy, had 
criticized the foreign minister's Belgrade talks. He was 
surprised that THE WASHINGTON POST had only belatedly commented 
on his visit to Belgrade. He denied that the Hungarian 
Government had only now mentioned the detrimental effects of the 
sanctions on Hungary. If the sanctions did not work properly, 
it was not Hungary's fault, Geza Jeszenszky said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F>
by Peter G. Feher; place and date not given: "In Spite of All 
This, We Would Like Good Relations With Slovakia -- Reply to the 
Accusations"] 
  [Text] On 2 February in the Bratislava Parliament, Slovak 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik made a speech. He summed up his 
country's 1993 diplomatic results and spoke about Slovakia's 
foreign relations. In the course of this, he blamed Hungary a 
number of times for the tensions between the two countries, and 
for the open issues that hinder the establishment of good 
relations. We asked Geza Jeszenszky to reply to the accusations 
of his Slovak colleague. 
  [Feher] Moravcik accused Hungary of being responsible for 
the atmosphere of mistrust between the two states. Does this 
indicate some kind of negative change in Slovak foreign policy, 
or is it part of the already existing process? 
  [Jeszenszky] The Slovak foreign minister made propagandistic 
statements. We could term his words as some kind of 
self-deceit. I am convinced that history will clearly prove 
that his accusations had no basis. 
  However, we do not have time to wait for the historians to 
make their appropriate judgment over Moravcik's statements 
because, in the interest of adequately informing the populations 
of the two countries and the international community, this kind 
of approach has to be calmly, but firmly refused. It is the 
facts that fundamentally disprove the Slovak foreign minister's 
views. Since the time it became clear that the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia would separate, Hungary has made many gestures 
toward both countries. We have paid special attention to the 
newly established Slovak state. Our historic coexistence, the 
600,000 Hungarians living in Slovakia, the longest section of 
our border, regional politics, and economic viewpoints all 
dictate good bilateral relations. I would like to remind people 
that I held a lecture on Slovak-Hungarian conciliation on 3 
September 1992, which was received positively. Prime Minister 
Meciar's invitation to Hungary and his visit took place after 
this. During the Budapest talks, [former Prime Minister] Jozsef 
Antall brought it to Meciar's attention that Hungary has cordial 
intentions with its northern neighbor, however, in two issues 
the Hungarian stance cannot be changed: We cannot accept the 
unlawful diversion of the Danube, and we have to insist on 
settling the situation of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia in 
the spirit of the international norms and recommendations. We 
suggested further talks on both issues. We wanted joint 
committees to be set up, and raised the possibility of an 
agreement on the protection of national minorities. (This would 
have been an agreement similar to the one we had made with 
Slovenia). Slovakia was not prepared for cooperation on these 
issues. As we know, the Danube was diverted, and Moravcik's 
latest statement on this issue is not accurate, because he said 
that, due to the European Union's mediation, the political 
antagonism between the two countries ceased to exist and it has 
been turned into a legal dispute. Only after defeating the 
Slovak Government's long resistance did Hungary manage to 
achieve that the European Union's mediation and The Hague 
Court's jurisdiction would be used. Therefore, it can be seen 
that, even in the case of a serious violation of the law, 
Hungary strived to settle the issue through negotiations, within 
a legal framework. 
  [Feher] In his aforementioned parliamentary speech, the 
Slovak foreign minister accused Hungary, among other things, of 
damaging Slovakia's situation by over-emphasizing the Hungarian 
national minority problems at international forums. Slovakia, 
as a member of many international organizations, accepted as 
obligations the recommendations regarding national minorities. 
In this case, what is the basis for Moravcik's accusations? 
  [Jeszenszky] Hungary could have hampered Slovakia's 
acceptance into the various international organizations. The 
best known example is probably Slovakia's membership in the 
Council of Europe. As is known, Hungary deliberately did not 
hinder its admittance, because we did not want to lay more 
burdens on bilateral relations. When Slovakia was established 
and when it was to be admitted to various international 
institutions, we did indicate our concerns regarding its policy 
on national minorities. In Slovakia, there is a language law 
that is not at all favorable to the national minorities, and the 
national minorities have serious reservations regarding the 
Slovak Constitution. Even the European Community stated at the 
time that the full observation of national minority rights is 
one of the preconditions for recognizing new states. Therefore, 
Hungary did not initiate this issue on its own, rather, this is 
an international system of requirements. Hungary was not just 
imagining things when Slovakia's Council of Europe membership 
came up: It became obvious that two new measures were 
threatening the Hungarian minority. These are the 
transformation of the schooling system and the reform of public 
administration, which would put the Hungarian minorities in a 
very disadvantageous position. 
  [Feher] In his parliamentary speech, Moravcik claimed that 
the drafting of the bilateral basic agreement was in process 
and, on the Slovak side, nothing was standing in the way of 
signing this document as soon as possible. Is the drafting of 
the bilateral basic agreement indeed so far forward? 
  [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, I cannot confirm this, and the 
obstacles are not posed by the Hungarian side; the real problem 
is that the settlement of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is 
indeed a prerequisite for signing such an agreement -- in the 
spirit, let us say, of the often mentioned Recommendation No. 
1201 of the Council of Europe. If this was implemented in 
Slovakia and the measures that are to the detriment of the 
Hungarian minority are not introduced, then Slovakia's practice 
would be suitable for all affected sides. The agreement could 
refer to the desired principles and practices in an adequate 
form. Therefore, if the situation of the Hungarian minority is 
settled in the spirit of the recommendations accepted by the 
international community, then a bilateral agreement can be 
signed as soon as the following day.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the National </F>
Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ, by Anita 
Elo; place and date not given: "According to Szajer, the 
Agreement With the Alliance of Free Democrats Is Not in Danger 
-- The FIDESZ's Goal Is To Replace the Coalition and To Defeat 
the Socialists"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Elo] Four years ago, you 
firmly opposed the government's policies. Has the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] or the Federation of Young Democrats 
[FIDESZ] changed since then? 
  [Szajer] If we compare [FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban's 
budget speeches, we can see that the 1993 speech was a much 
tougher criticism of the government than the 1990 one. 
Presumably, in 1990, the press more markedly emphasized that it 
was a speech in opposition to the government. 
  [Elo] We can hear the FIDESZ mentioned together with the MDF 
increasingly frequently. Does this mean that you are starting 
to befriend the party in power? Is it a gradual withdrawal from 
the opposition role? 
  [Szajer] Anyone who, three months before the elections, 
expects to get into power through the MDF is making a 
miscalculation. Hungarian citizens will have this government 
coalition replaced at the next elections. It can only harm us 
if we are seen to be on the same platform as the MDF. What 
would be the point in befriending a party in power that will 
only last a few weeks or months? 
  [Elo] Then what is the reason for the change? I do not 
suppose you want to attribute this to the media's 
manipulations.... 
  [Szajer] No, I do not, but somehow it has become a public 
view, although there is no basis for it. 
  [Elo] Let me remind you of Orban's mental experiment when he 
drew the picture of a coalition to be formed with the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the MDF. 
  [Szajer] In Hungary, it is accepted that a so-called social- 
liberal coalition will have to be formed after the elections. 
All Orban said was that at least another five other versions 
are also possible and the coalition possibilities should not be 
predetermined. 
  [Elo] Nevertheless, this means that you would also enter 
into a coalition with the most criticized government parties. 
Do you not feel this as a significant shift in the FIDESZ's 
policies? 
  [Szajer] The FIDESZ's goal continues to be to replace the 
current government coalition and to end up in front of the 
socialists. This was our goal in 1990, but we did not manage to 
achieve it. We are criticizing the MDF government just as 
firmly and severely as in 1990. In 1993, a new element was 
added with the increase of the socialists' chances to get into 
government. We are very strongly criticizing several elements 
of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] policies because, in 
the future, they can be detrimental to the country, and we 
cannot forget about past experiences, either. At the same time, 
I can perceive a shift to the left in public opinion; therefore, 
someone who remains in the same place appears to be moving to 
the right. [passage omitted] 
  [Elo] The liberal bloc has not even made its election 
agreement and conflicts have already surfaced. In fact, some 
people even think that the FIDESZ's agreement with the Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is in danger. 
  [Szajer] We initiated this agreement a year ago. We have 
always had some friction between the two parties and will always 
have them since we are two independent organizations. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Elo] What can the FIDESZ expect from cooperation with the 
Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party? 
  [Szajer] Through this, the liberal bloc almost covers the 
whole society. The FIDESZ has a disposition of a people's party 
and it can talk to the country's citizens regardless of which 
strata of society they belong to. The SZDSZ mainly has a basis 
among the intelligentsia. The Entrepreneurs' Party represents a 
very important group in the economic change of the regime, and 
the fourth is an agrarian party. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Letter sent by Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, </F>
Minister of National Defense of Romania, to the presidents of 
the legal bodies of the Romanian Parliament -- Lieutenant 
General Niculae Spiroiu Calls for a Meeting of the Commissions 
in Charge of Defense, Public Order, and National Security of the 
Parliament To Discuss C.V. Tudor's Slander"] 
  [Text] Messrs. Presidents, I feel most uncomfortable that 
I have to draw your attention again to a fact that is absolutely 
unqualifiable, but, given its profound implications on the 
stability, functioning, and cohesion of the military institution 
of our country, I am compelled to choose this way of notifying 
you of it and finding a potential solution to this embarrassing 
conflict. 
  As you know, for more than two months, I have become the 
target of malicious attacks, expressed in an uncivilized 
language. As you most probably have realized, I am talking 
about the press campaign launched by Senator Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor [Greater Romania Party president], in two publications 
that he is sponsoring, the ROMANIA MARE [Greater Romania] and 
the POLITICA. 
  The goal of these actions is obviously to distort the image 
made about my person and to destroy the public credibility of 
the minister of national defense. For this goal the entire 
arsenal of disinformation technology has been made use of, 
starting with lies and misinterpretations, and ending with 
hilarious denigratory associations of ideas. In fact, it is no 
secret that this was the major weapon that the sponsor of the 
two publications -- who nowadays is not embarrassed to sign his 
works with the title of SENATOR OF BUCHAREST [preceding three 
words in capitals] -- used relentlessly for his own political 
ascent. 
  As far as I am concerned, as a constant supporter of the 
idea 
of the political equidistance of the army, I should be 
completely indifferent to the way in which he chooses to build 
his own career. However, I cannot remain indifferent when these 
perfidious attacks are directed against the person of the 
minister of national defense because the implications are much 
more serious. These types of actions are aimed at destroying 
the element of TRUST IN OUR LEADERS, which is vital for the 
military institution. 
  Therefore, Messrs. Presidents, I feel compelled to ask you 
to 
agree and be kind enough to convene the meeting of the 
Commissions in charge of defense, public order, and national 
security of the two chambers of the parliament, because I wish 
to present these commissions with the necessary explanations for 
the insinuations and slander directed against me. 
  I am requesting this because the core of the problem is the 
fact that, respecting the provisions of the country's laws and 
the military rules, I am "guilty" of not having satisfied an 
absolutely unjustified claim or pressure of the senator; 
however, such an act would have meant a serious violation of 
certain rules stipulated in the Statute of Military Cadres and 
the procedure of granting promotions to certain functions and 
ranks in the Army. 
  With all the explanations I gave to Mr. Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor, 
in his capacity as senator -- although for two months I have 
kept confidential that personal request, in order to avoid a 
public scandal -- he continued the attack against my person, the 
goal of his actions being to discredit me and to destroy the 
image that our society, and not only that, has made about me 
ever since I became the head of the Ministry of National Defense. 
  Taking into consideration that one of the first denigratory 
articles that was published after 1 January 1994, was signed as 
Senator of Bucharest, I addressed to the president of the Senate 
an open letter requesting that the Legal Commission in charge of 
appointments, discipline, immunity, and validations should be 
notified about the attitude of Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. 
  Given all the aforementioned considerations, including those 
regarding the importance of the position of the ministry whose 
head I am, I express my hope and my complete confidence that my 
request will be adequately dealt with. 
  As far as my person is concerned, I am at the disposal of 
the 
commissions at any time their meeting is convened. I must also 
mention that I also informed the president of Romania, the 
Romanian Government, and the Supreme Military Council of the 
Army about Vadim Tudor's actions. 
  Messrs. Presidents, please accept my profound respect for 
the 
constitutional institutions over which you preside and for you 
personally. 
  Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National 
Defense

  [Text] Tudor Postelnicu, 63, former interior minister in 
the government headed by Constantin Dascalescu [during the 
Ceausescu regime], has been released from jail for six months in 
order to receive medical treatment. Postelnicu left the Jilava 
penitentiary yesterday. He is suffering from several urological 
and cardiovascular ailments. Just one day before Postelnicu 
left the penitentiary, his wife underwent surgery following an 
accident in which she fractured her thighbone. If we are not 
mistaken, the only remaining member of the CPEx [Executive 
Political Committee of the former Romanian Communist Party] in 
jail at Jilava after the release of Postelnicu would be Ion 
Dinca [former first deputy prime minister].

<F P=106> [Statement by the Civic Alliance; place and date not given: </F>
"Recent Amendments"] 
  [Text] The Civic Alliance and the Association for Free and 
Correct Information via Radio and Television draw attention to 
the executive power's attempt to legally place the public 
audiovisual media under its jurisdiction. 
  The introduction, at the last moment, of a set of amendments 
by the parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR], after the draft bill had been worked on for a 
long time by the specialized commission of the Chamber of 
Deputies, testifies to an attempt to either delay the 
legislation process or (if the amendments would be accepted by 
the plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies) to the desire to 
totally and effectively acquire these two public services -- 
radio and television. 
  Not only because of certain provisions that limit the 
independence of the radio and television and their staff but 
also through procedures proposed for the appointment of the 
Consultative Council, the Management Boards and their chairmen 
(by the government and the presidency respectively), the PDSR 
amendments violate the principles stipulated by any democratic 
audio-visual law, including the recommendations made to our 
country by the Council of Europe.

  [Text] In connection with the proposal of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] to conduct a dialogue with the 
opposition parties, the Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party 
[PD(FSN)] reiterates its readiness to participate in a dialogue 
-- a communique received from the PD(FSN) reads. In the first 
stage of the discussions, the PD(FSN) will be represented at the 
talks by the Internal Political Relations Department. 
  Another communique of the same political grouping refers to 
the statements made on 5 February by Mr. Mircea Snegur, 
president of the Republic of Moldova, and Mr. Dimitru Motpan, 
leader of the Agrarian Democratic Party [PDAM] of the Republic 
of Moldova. The PD(FSN) Executive Bureau considers that they 
are uncultured allegations with an electoral tinge, running 
counter to the historic truth and to the interests of the 
Romanians living between the Prut and Dniester Rivers. 
Regarding the proposal that the parties advocating the 
unification with Romania should be excluded from the political 
life, the PD(FSN) considers it as an antidemocratic gesture, at 
variance with the course toward democracy and pluralism assumed 
by the Chisinau authorities before their own people and the 
European democratic institutions. The PD(FSN), the communique 
points out, is deeply involved and committed to achieving closer 
ties between Romania and the Republic of Moldova.

  [Text] [Announcer] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, gave a statement to Sarajevo 
Radio and TV reporters following [UN Secretary General Butrus] 
Butrus-Ghali's request to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
on the authorization of air attacks against the Serb aggressor's 
positions. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe that this is a 
request to prepare for such an action, to authorize the command 
of NATO's Sector South to carry out the attacks, but -- and this 
is important -- at the UN request. This means that Butrus-Ghali 
will have to order it once again. This is typical of 
Butrus-Ghali's manner. 
  But, I hear that this is obviously being seriously 
discussed. 
It is becoming a serious issue. As you know, we held talks 
with [UN envoy] Akashi yesterday. He then held talks with the 
Serb side. We demanded -- to avoid the air attacks but achieve 
the goal at the same time -- that the Serbs, of their own free 
will, withdraw their artillery and place it under UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] control. This was our latest demand. They 
issued some counterproposal or other -- for the artillery to be 
just monitored -- that we obviously rejected. 
  We increased the pressure today by sending another letter to 
the [European] Twelve, who have just begun a session, and to the 
NATO secretary general -- they are holding a session tomorrow. 
  Something seems to be moving in the European Union. I heard 
that the European Union has made a decision to break the siege 
of the city, if necessary with the use of force. So, obviously, 
things are moving in some direction. There is at least a 50-50 
chance that NATO attacks against those positions will 
materialize. 
  I believe that the Serbs will take the risk. They will try 
to test Europe, to see if it will do it or not, for their 
experience with Europe so far has shown that Europe is 
indecisive. I think they will play that card. I would not say 
that they will withdraw of their own [free] will. Something has 
changed, but we have paid for it. The price was those 70 lives 
and 200 wounded, for people to realize that such absurdity and 
evil cannot be tolerated any more. Or they understood that this 
is not only the question of Bosnia- Herzegovina, that this is -- 
as our esteemed visitor from Pakistan [Benazir Bhutto] said -- 
that this is a moral issue, which concerns every man. Can crime 
be tolerated and is it not encouragement for crime and fascism, 
opening the doors wide for them in the world? You see, there 
are some new, sad phenomena in Russia, which really pose a 
threat to the world, to the survival of the world. If we look 
back perhaps we could trace it to the lax attitude and tolerance 
in Europe toward an evil that appeared in the Balkans some four 
or five years ago. [end recording]

  [Text] President Alija Izetbegovic of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency has sent a letter to EC Chairman 
Karolos Papoulias and NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. 
  Esteemed gentlemen, in my letter of 5 February, I informed 
you about the massacre of civilians that took place that day at 
the Sarajevo market. Unfortunately, the statement by the 
responsible officials in the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
indicates that the revulsion felt by the world and the readiness 
for action will again be amortized by a prolonged investigation 
as to the origin of the shell [words indistinct], offers for yet 
another futile cease-fire, and statements about the necessity of 
establishing peace acceptable to both sides, and so on. 
  I am afraid that the debate will focus on one shell, and 
thus 
divert the world's attention from the more than 300,000 shells 
that have been fired on this city during the 22 months of the 
siege. It is not true that over 400 artillery pieces on the 
hills around Sarajevo are to serve as the Serb defense against 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are there for blackmail 
purposes and to inflict suffering on the civilian population, to 
halt the life in the city, and to force us into making 
unacceptable concessions to the aggressor. 
  Of the 9,872 people killed in the shelling of the city, only 
164 have been soldiers. Some 1,563 children have been killed 
and 278 pregnant women. Some 57,897 civilians have been 
wounded, and over 19,000 of those are maimed for live. 
Approximately 10,000 apartments and 30,000 places of work have 
been destroyed or damaged. The city maternity hospital was set 
ablaze with precise and persistent fire, as were the National 
Library, the Institute for Oriental Studies, the depot and all 
the tramways and city buses. The city hospital has been hit 267 
times, and nine doctors and 16 patients have been killed. All 
the churches, mosques, and synagogues in the city have suffered 
hits and damage. All the Olympic sports facilities have been 
destroyed, as have the Assembly and government buildings. There 
is not a single building, school, or university building in the 
city that has not been hit. Schooling is being conducted in 
improvised schoolrooms. All the hotels have been destroyed, and 
the Holiday Inn is the only one open, even though it has been 
damaged. The UN Protection Force building is a frequent target 
for artillery attacks. 
  Gentlemen, this city has been in hell for over 700 days. It 
is time the Serb machine for killing people and destroying 
shrines, schools, and hospitals is stopped and removed. I 
appeal to you to inform the members of your organizations of the 
contents of this letter. 
  This is said in the letter that President Alija Izetbegovic 
sent to Karolos Papoulias and Manfred Woerner.
