  [Excerpts] Knin, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- The ministry of foreign 
affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] called on all 
Serbs and Serb associations in the world today to do everything 
they can against the planned NATO air strikes on Serb military 
targets and the population of the Srpska republic, ISKRA 
reported. 
  "The casualty toll will be huge, whole families will perish, 
including infants. It will be a real genocide -- a crime which 
began in World War II when the Muslims and Croats, sponsored by 
Adolf Hitler, killed 1.5 million Serbs," the statement says. 
[passage omitted] 
  For their part, the Serbs have already done a great deal for 
establishing peace: They surrendered Sarajevo airport to 
UNPROFOR, they surrendered territories to the Muslims in 
exchange for peace on two occasions, and they saved 80,000 
Croats from being massacred by the Muslims. The Serbs have 
never besieged the city of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is a city divided 
into Serb and Muslim parts, ISKRA reports. 
  The ministry of foreign affairs calls on all Serbs in the 
world to present these details to politicians, parties, members 
of parliaments, journalists and other respected personalities, 
also calling for organization of protests because Serbs 
currently have no other weapons, the statement says.

  [Text] Zagreb, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Any decision on possible 
air strikes on the Serbs, if they do not withdraw weapons from 
their positions around Sarajevo, must be taken by the UN 
Security Council so international consensus can be reached, 
Russian President Yeltsin's special envoy Vitaliy Churkin said 
today at the end of his visit to Zagreb. 
  "However," Churkin noted, "it is not our intention to bring 
about a crisis over this issue in the relations between Russia 
and the international community." Churkin added that "Russia has 
good communications with the Serbian side just as Germany 
communicates well with Croatia and the United States does with 
the Muslims." 
  Churkin expressed dissatisfaction with "some aspects of 
NATO's decision" to give an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs 
since, in his words, this has created "duality regarding the 
situation in Sarajevo." 
  "These decisions go beyond the framework set by UN 
resolutions. If this standpoint had been adopted at a session of 
the UN Security Council, we would have full unanimity in the 
stands of the international community," Churkin said. 
  In his view, air strikes "are the last resort in the event 
of 
direct attacks on UNPROFOR or in a difficult humanitarian 
situation." 
  Reflecting upon his visit to Sarajevo, Churkin said that 
"his 
impressions were encouraging" following talks with commander of 
the UN peace force General Jean Cot, Serb General Ratko Mladic, 
Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic. 
  "My impression in the wake of all these talks is that all 
the 
sides to the conflict are now thinking about peace rather than 
further fighting," Churkin said and added that General Mladic 
"convinced him that he would meet UNPROFOR's demand with maximum 
flexibility."

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 16 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic, in his letter of 
protest to French President Francois Mitterrand, warns him that 
his government is to be blamed for the possible fresh genocide 
of Serbs because of a partial policy of Paris towards the 
Serbian people and their states which emerged from the collapse 
of ex-Yugoslavia. 
  France has waged a strong campaign for the NATO forces to 
air 
raid positions of the Serbs in the ex-Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  On February 9, NATO 'succumbed' to France's pressure but, to 
the disappointment of Paris, it threatened with air strikes 
equally against the Bosnian Muslims as well as the Bosnian Serbs 
unless they withdraw by February 20 their heavy weapons in and 
around Sarajevo, or regroup them and place them under UNPROFOR 
(U.N. Protection Force) control. 
  In his letter to Mitterrand, monitored by the RSK news 
agency 
ISKRA, Martic is confident that the current French policy will 
lose the battle because it contradicts the spirit of France's 
freedom, not because it is unjust towards the Serbs. 
  Martic said that back in 1876 the celebrated French poet 
Victor Hugo accused Europe of helping to annihilate Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and that he sought protection for Serbs while 
European civilization would save its face. 
  Martic also recalled the notable French politicians and 
generals in the past who were enthusiastic about the way the 
Serbs were fighting on their side in World War One. 
  "May I remind you that the Serbian people have built a 
monument to the French state, perhaps the only such monument in 
the world. It represents France as the state of victory and 
democracy, with which the Serbian people were allied in the two 
world wars," Martic writes. 
  Last January, Martic was elected president of the RSK, the 
state proclaimed in predominantly Serb-populated parts of the 
former Croatia in response to its violent secession and its 
attempt to reduce their civil and national rights.

  [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic of Croatia 
Franjo Tudjman today ended his three-day state visit to Romania. 
Following his arrival at Zagreb airport President Tudjman made a 
brief public statement. Branko Merlin reports. 
  [Merlin] After the ceremonial welcome and meeting 
high-ranking Croatian officials who welcomed the president and 
the members of our delegation at the airport, President Tudjman 
described his visit to Romania as follows: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] It was a very interesting. Above 
all, we have become familiar with friendly Romania. We have 
established personal contacts with the highest-ranking 
representatives of Romania's state and political life. It is 
crucial, however, that we made advances in our bilateral 
relations. It seems to me that it is of equal importance, if not 
of greater importance, that we agreed on some joint initiatives 
in paving the way for resolving the international crisis in this 
part of Europe, in the course of which Romania can play an 
important role, given its relations with Belgrade. This was a 
very fruitful visit. [end recording] 
  [Merlin] Prompted by the press, President Tudjman also 
reflected on his meeting with representatives of a small 
Croatian community in Romania. He is particularly satisfied 
with the fact that 12 young Croatians from Romania are already 
going to school in Zagreb. [passage omitted] 
  [Presenter] Assessing the results of his visit, the Croatian 
president said that the two state delegations have agreed on the 
most important problems. In this context he singled out a 
solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and restoring 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the continuation of 
forging friendly relations and cooperation between Croatia and 
Romania in all spheres -- political, economic and cultural -- 
something that was initiated as early as the time of President 
Iliescu's visit to Croatia, President Tudjman said. He also 
pointed out that Romania, as the most important country in south 
east Europe, could secure an important role in resolving the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia on the strength of its good 
relations with Belgrade as well as its own interest in peace and 
stability in the region. 
  In reply to a question asking under what circumstances 
Croatia would accept the lifting of sanctions against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, President Tudjman said that the 
precondition for lifting the sanctions is the restoration of 
peace in Bosnia- Herzegovina and the return of Croatia's 
UNPROFOR-protected occupied territories under Croatian 
sovereignty. 
  President Tudjman expressed support for NATO's ultimatum to 
the Bosnian Serbs, regarding it as the resolute stand of Europe 
and the U.S. regarding the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope 
that air strikes will not take place and that this ultimatum 
will be an incentive for all three sides to restore peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina through negotiations, he added. 
  Speaking about Croatia's relations with Serbia, while 
replying to a correspondent of POLITIKA of Belgrade, the 
Croatian president stressed that Croatia was striving to improve 
mutual relations, something that is also borne out by a recently 
signed declaration on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian 
relations. The precondition for true normalization is an end to 
Belgrade's aid to the rebel Serbs in Croatia's occupied 
territories. 
  As far as Croatia is concerned, President Tudjman said, 
Croatia is ready to guarantee its Serbs local self-government in 
the counties where Serbs are in the majority in Croatia and 
cultural autonomy in whole Croatia. He stressed that it was 
high time for the Croatians and Serbians to normalize their 
relations. In this respect he also stressed that this ought to 
be done on the basis of mutual recognition between the two 
states. This would result in some sort of Scandinavization of 
the Balkans and peace and stability in the region, he said. 
  Romanian President Iliescu regarded the Croatian President's 
visit as very important for better bilateral relations between 
the two countries. Good relations between Croatia and Romania 
are an important element of stability in the entire region, he 
added. President Iliescu lent support to the declaration on the 
normalization of Serbian-Croatian relations as an important step 
towards resolving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia and as a 
precondition for an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Pacification of Sarajevo on the basis of action by the 
international community is an important contribution to the 
establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Iliescu 
went on to say. To secure peace at last in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
he added -- since it can only be secured through negotiations -- 
it is necessary that there is a political will on all three 
sides.

  Having been to Sarajevo yesterday, yes, I am satisfied. The 
situation on the ground is much better. There is peace in the

everything that we can to make it a firmer and more lasting 
peace, not only in Sarajevo, but throughout Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Kostunica, 
chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS], said at a news 
conference today that NATO's threat to the Bosnian Serbs was 
aimed at demonstrating NATO's unity and resolve. 
  Kostunica recalled that everyone had succumbed to Germany's 
ultimatum in 1992 and had wished to preserve the unity of the 
European Community and the spirit of Maastricht, which resulted 
in the dismemberment of the sovereign Yugoslav state. 
  According to him, the fact is being overlooked that the 
absence of resolve sometimes does not have to be such a bad 
thing in politics. Apart from resolve for war, he added, people 
should display resolve for peace, and this was lacking. 
  The DSS leader believes that NATO's threat was based on the 
naive assumption that air strikes could be carried out without a 
response. 
  Kostunica pointed to the dilemma faced by the Bosnian Serb 
leadership. On the one hand, he said, the Serbs are determined 
to do everything to avoid the attacks, but on the other they 
cannot leave their own people unprotected. 
  In his opinion, the NATO decision was linked with the 
Sarajevo market place event, no matter how much this was being 
covered up. This, Kostunica said, is a familiar three-act 
performance, where it all starts with a provocation -- coming 
mostly from the Muslim side -- followed by threats to the Serbs, 
and in the final act the Bosnian Serbs are expected to make 
further concessions. 
  Answering a reporter's question, the DSS leader stressed 
there was nothing that could justify Serbia's and Yugoslavia's 
silence over the ultimatum. Commenting on the frequent visits 
by foreign diplomats to Belgrade, Kostunica said that according 
to the [federal] Constitution, decisions on war and peace were 
within the jurisdiction of the assembly, that the Serbian 
president was not authorized to conduct such talks and that he 
ought to explain to the people what he was doing. Speaking 
about certain inconsistencies in statements by [Bosnian Serb 
commander] General Ratko Mladic and [Bosnian Serb president] 
Radovan Karadzic on the withdrawal of the artillery and its 
placing under UN supervision, Kostunica said he could not judge 
this from here [Belgrade], that he was certain there was more 
unanimity than discord, and stressed that politicians and 
soldiers spoke different languages.

  [Text] If Montenegro secedes from Serbia, the Convention of 
Boka is determined to start the process of unification with the 
other Serbian lands. This would be done first with Herzegovina 
and therefore with Serbia, and would provide Serbia with access 
to the sea. This would in fact represent the reassessment of 
the decision on the unification of Boka with Montenegro. 
  These are the first words of the Declaration of the Boka 
Convention, which was distributed to the media yesterday, 
bearing the signature of Convention chairman Slobodan Panovic. 
The Convention demands that the ruling party, the Democratic 
Party of Socialists, put a stop to separatist forces -- as the 
declaration says -- first in their own ranks. 
  Serbian Boka will follow and cooperate with the conventions 
of Vasojevici, Zeta, old [Stara] Herzegovina, and the Raska 
region [Sandzak] on the achievement of the Serbian national 
program. We demand that the Montenegrin bodies inaugurate 26 
November 1918 as a public holiday, the date of the unification 
of Serbia and Montenegro. The Boka Convention demands a change 
in the attitude of the Republic of Montenegro toward this region.

  [Text] The preparations for a merger congress of the 
parties of the political center are going according to schedule. 
On Wednesday Presidents of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Greens-Ecological 
Social Party, will sign a charter on their proposals and 
intentions to link up. The merger congress is to take place in 
Bled on 12 March. 
  A coordinating group of the parties compiled a draft statute 
of the new party last Friday. A group for program documents is 
to complete its work this week. The so-called coordinating group 
of party presidents has already harmonized the majority of views 
regarding the forthcoming merger. A meeting of the Liberal 
Democratic Party Council is scheduled for next Monday. At that 
meeting the highest party authority will adopt a stance on the 
proposed statute and pass concrete decisions about future 
linkage. 
  According to the scenario of the merger, all the parties are 
to hold their congresses on the morning of 12 March. After 
passing a decision to merge into a new party, the congress of 
the new party is scheduled to be held in Bled the same day. The 
new party does not have a name yet. It has been agreed that 
Janez Drnovsek will be its president. The party will have three 
or four vice presidents. 
  As the leaderships of the Democratic Party and the Greens- 
Ecological Social Party explained to STA news agency this 
morning, the Democrats, the Socialists, the Greens-Ecological 
Social Party, and the Slovene Craftsmen-Entrepreneurial Party 
will form a new joint party even if they do not find a common 
language with the Liberal Democrats.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Vodusek: "SOVA Abandoning Political </F>
Role, Police Taking Its Place"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana, 6 February -- In a special statement for 
DELO, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek denied the existence of a 
secret agreement on the division of interest spheres between the 
Slovene intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. According to our sources, intensive preparations and 
talks on a new organization of the Slovene Intelligence-Security 
Agency SOVA and the Security Organ of the Defense Ministry VOMO 
are underway. 
  A working draft of the Law on SOVA, which will appear as 
strictly confidential on the agenda of a close session of 
Bucar's commission for the supervision of intelligence agencies 
this month, has stirred sentiments in the secret services. At 
one of many meetings of acting directors of intelligence 
services Drago Fers and Dusan Mikus, and Defense and Interior 
Ministers Janez Jansa and Ivan Bizjak, they have supposedly 
agreed on a new division of interest and working spheres. 
According to this information, the Interior Ministry will take 
over entirely the counterintelligence activities in March this 
year, while SOVA will primarily retain the intelligence work 
abroad. Dr. Drago Fers, who, following the resignation of 
Silvan Jakin, is acting director until the appointment of a SOVA 
director, has confirmed the expert meetings at the "highest 
level," but adamantly denied any sort of tripartite agreement, 
that is to say, any division according to which one service 
would cede some or all activity to another service. It is all 
about covering gray areas, Fers assures and stresses the 
functional division, according to which SOVA will deal with 
intelligence activities exclusively, that is to say, gathering 
information abroad, while the protection, that it so say, 
counterintelligence activities will be taken over by the 
criminal department of the Interior Ministry, which has already 
performed these activities since the change of the regime. 
Namely, SOVA is not authorized for possible court investigation 
in proving criminal activities aimed against the state, that is 
to say, undermining the constitutional order at home, but can 
merely confirm the connection of the accused with foreign 
intelligence services. As Fers assures, they have been 
coordinating spheres of action at these meetings and exchanged 
views on the formation of the entire security-intelligence 
system. According to Drago Fers, SOVA has completely broken off 
with the former political police, which chiefly used to monitor 
and prove enemy activities, that is to say, the existence of the 
internal enemy, as over two-thirds of the information in the 
past was counterintelligence information. It will, of course, 
not completely abandon its protective role. It is supposed to 
share with VOMO some intelligence tasks abroad for which there 
is, understandably, no legal basis. Namely, both services are 
active abroad and could resolve certain tasks more efficiently 
together, Fers says. 
  Hints about the final dismantling of SOVA have also trickled 
into the public because of fear that, due to the specialization 
of SOVA's work, more old agents, who were supposedly linked to 
the old generation of politicians, would lose their jobs. The 
fact that the methods of ruling are actually the same and that 
intelligence services are at their core on the basis of events 
in the secret services spurred numerous speculations and 
criticism of possible political misuse, that is to say, a 
political background to the above-mentioned reorganization 
within these services. SOVA, which has gone through numerous 
reorganizations already, was allegedly not reliable enough for 
the political right wing, and for this reason the police, that 
is to say, Interior Minister Bizjak would take over the 
counterintelligence segment, which is, of course, the most 
interesting for the politicians. Jansa's service, which 
concentrates primarily on military problems, will stay divided 
into intelligence and counterintelligence sections. As Drago 
Fers assures, SOVA and VOMO would primarily divide duties in the 
realm of intelligence work, which amounts to approximately 
one-third of all data. The skeptics believe that the entire 
debate is all about political games and less about concern for 
national security, because it allegedly involves a controlled 
disintegration of the Slovene intelligence system, that is to 
say, the dismantling of the former State Security Service. 
  Leaving aside the rumors that a restructuring of the 
political scene is in the background, our sources claim that a 
positive scenario of the reconstruction of the security system, 
which will primarily have to assume the responsibility for 
protection of the Slovene strategic economic interests abroad, 
is nevertheless underway. 
  Despite the formal position of the intelligence service, 
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek has supposedly remained without 
strategic information and analyses. As we have learned, the 
experts from the United States, that is to say, Clinton's state 
security adviser personally, have also been drawn into expert 
assistance in the organization of the Slovene intelligence 
system. Regarding all this, it would be worth mentioning the 
announcement of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek that he will 
activate a special service within his cabinet on 15 February. 
This service will, despite a rather unambitious task of 
overcoming bureaucratic obstacles and helping the citizens, that 
is to say, dealing with the problems of a little man, not be 
able to completely avoid a sort of intelligence activities, 
primarily because of the avalanche of anonymous letters that 
supposedly report cases of unlawful privatization, theft, 
illicit activities in the economic domain, and, above all, 
corruption and other matters in the pasts of several ministers, 
for which they should say goodbye to public life. 
  According to some information, changes in the leaderships of 
both intelligence services should also take place in March, 
which would conclude the experimental phase in the appointment 
of directors of the intelligence services. State security 
systems all over the world consist of intelligence and 
counterintelligence segments, while the services protecting the 
constitutional order are, naturally, also a part of the 
repertoire, regardless of how conservative this sounds. The 
division of SOVA into intelligence and counterintelligence parts 
can only be confirmation of the normalization in the Slovene 
secret services. The most dangerous thing is a concentration of 
great power within the intelligence system.

  [Text] In reaction to the decision by Greece to close its 
consulate in Macedonia and close the port of Thessaloniki to 
Macedonian goods, Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski 
made the following statement: 
  [Begin Crvenkovski recording] The Republic of Macedonia 
deems 
that the latest decision by the Greek Government on the 
suspension of work of the consulate general of the Republic of 
Greece in Skopje and the interruption of transport of goods 
between the port of Thessaloniki and Skopje, which in fact 
represents an embargo against our country, is an act 
contravening the UN charter, CSCE documents and international 
law. By this act the Greek side has violated a conclusion of 
the EC council of ministers reached at the Edinburgh summit on 
12 December 1992, according to which our country must be 
provided with regular oil supplies. 
  Such unilateral and unacceptable measures taken by the Greek 
Government are particularly worrying since they are also in 
contravention of the UN Security Council resolution in which 
both Macedonia and Greece are called on to overcome differences 
through UN-mediated negotiations and thus contribute to the 
strengthening of peace and security in the region. 
  The Republic of Macedonia has always pursued a peace-loving 
policy regarding all developments on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia, has avoided war and managed to build a democratic 
society and a free market economy and regulate interethnic 
relations on the basis of dialogue and tolerance. 
  With regard to the dispute with Greece, Macedonia has shown 
the maximum flexibility and readiness to display goodwill in the 
resolution of open issues. This Macedonian policy also applies 
to the rest of the world. 
  Macedonia has managed to preserve peace and security on its 
territory and by this has become a factor of peace and stability 
in the region. Therefore, it is surprising that at the time 
when the international community is investing enormous efforts 
for the peaceful and negotiated resolution of the most complex 
problems, including halting the war in Bosnia, the Republic of 
Greece, a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the European 
Council, and the current president of the European Union, should 
be taking such measures against our independent and peace-loving 
country; these measures violate international law. By this the 
Greek Government wishes to exert economic, political, and other 
kinds of pressure on our country, taking advantage of the fact 
that Macedonia is a land-locked country. 
  The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to stress 
that this inflicts huge damage on the permanent interests of 
both countries and nations, and also on future mutual relations 
and cooperation for which the Greek side bears responsibility. 
  Despite this, Macedonia firmly abides by its resolve to 
build 
good relations with all its neighbors, including its southern 
neighbor, and is ready to continue the Greek-Macedonian 
dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will 
collect evidence of all possible consequences caused by the 
Greek blockade -- which was not caused by the Macedonian side -- 
and in this connection it will take the necessary measures and 
activities in the international arena. [end recording]

  [Text] Skopje, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The Macedonian government 
met in emergency session Wednesday [16 February] following 
Greece's decision to close its northern port of Salonika to 
Macedonian goods and close its consulate general in Skopje. 
Macedonian commentators warned that the Greek move would cause 
regional destabilisation. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said Wednesday he 
was 
"forced" to take these steps because of what he called 
landlocked Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing 
irredentist intransigence." 
  Greece accuses the former Yugoslav republic of trying to 
usurp a name Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and of 
harboring expansionist aims over the Greek province of the same 
name.

  [Text] Skopje, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The Macedonian Government 
has asked to join NATO's Partnership for Peace, an official said 
Wednesday [16 February], as NATO member Greece clamped a partial 
economic embargo on the former Yugoslav republic. 
  The official said Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski had informed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
secretary-general Manfred Woerner by letter of Skopje's 
intention to join the partnership and participate in it actively. 
  The partnership, announced by NATO last month, provides for 
military cooperation and aid especially for former communist 
countries in eastern Europe, with the possibility of full 
membership later. 
  Observers here said the partnership could lead to Macedonia 
providing U.S. and NATO bases on its soil.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Legislative Commission: Intelligence </F>
Under Control"] 
  [Text] The defining of the responsibility of the director 
of the Intelligence Agency was the most controversial issue at 
yesterday's session of the parliament's Legislative Commission. 
At the end, the Commission adopted the proposal for a law for 
the forming of an Intelligence Agency. 
  The representatives of the Interior Ministry pointed out 
that 
the law defines the control at three levels: "The president of 
the state appoints and dismisses the director, the government 
can demand responsibility from the director for the activities 
of the Agency, and there will also be parliamentary supervision." 
  A couple of members of the commission emphasized the 
conceptual inconsistency that the director answers to organs 
which did not elect him. To this, the Interior Ministry 
representatives replied that the strengthened control is 
introduced in order to prevent the autonomous activities of the 
agency, but also not to allow involvement in the daily political 
interests. 
  In relation to this law, also two amendments were submitted. 
The first one specifies that the employees in the agency cannot 
carry out other activities and functions, and the second, that 
both the employees in the agency and the Interior Ministry have 
the right a 30 percent increase.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of National Defense Piotr </F>
Kolodziejczyk by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and date not given: 
"Poland's Security Is In Our Hands"] 
  [Text] [Grochowski] Poland has accepted the "Partnership 
for Peace" [PFP] program at last. Why? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Because there is no alternative to it and 
because clear criteria for participating in this program--in 
other words, democracy, the market economy, democratic control 
over the Army, and clear budget provisions--were finally spelled 
out. I am sure these basic features will convince our 
neighbors, particularly those in the East, that Poland has 
finally entered the road to democracy and is making fast 
progress along it. 
  [Grochowski] These criteria are obvious, and they were 
probably not the reason the U.S. delegation left the Belweder 
Palace in a worried state. Did you not seek a clarification of 
these criteria in Berlin? Did Foreign Minister Olechowski not 
do so in Washington? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] There is one thing I would like to explain. 
Neither the president nor the foreign minister displayed any 
nervousness. However, we believed that, as Europeans, we have 
the right to say what we think of the PFP and security in 
general. The original version of the PFP program was very 
vague, and clear provisions were only incorporated at the very 
last moment, following sharp criticism from Warsaw. 
  I hope we will shortly be acquainted with other PFP criteria 
as well, mainly the technical ones, and, of course, we will do 
our best to fulfill them, provided our Western partners are 
willing to indulge in scientific cooperation with us. 
  But more important for me are Clinton's words uttered in 
Prague whereby, in the event of a clear threat, the NATO border 
will extend to the Bug River. That is a very tangible outcome 
of the offensive we waged before the Brussels summit. 
  [Grochowski] Let us be frank. The NATO heads of state left 
Brussels in a satisfied state, but they left empty-handed. The 
Polish press said that a "Partnership for Tranquillity" had been 
achieved. Tranquillity for whom? Not for us! Perhaps the only 
purpose was to calm the consciences of Western politicians? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Our press reacted nervously, which is 
understandable, but it looks like there is a genuine desire to 
implement the PFP, and quickly. I am beginning to fear that we 
will not be able to make use of all of the offers that have 
already come in and are still doing so. 
  [Grochowski] The PFP calls for a cooperation accord with 
NATO. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] There is a race going on here, which I 
disagree with. The world's media are wondering whether 
Lithuania or Romania will be the first to conclude this accord. 
  [Grochowski] Lithuania has won! 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Poland's approach toward this matter is very 
serious, so we are giving ourselves several weeks' time in order 
to hold talks and prepare an offer of cooperation that suits our 
possibilities and is serious enough to be considered and 
implemented by the other side. 
  [Grochowski] What are the actual advantages to be gained 
from the PFP? Not much is being said about them. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] But the objective of the PFP has been 
mentioned, and that is Poland's incorporation into the European 
security system. 
  [Grochowski] But what happens before then? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] We must realize that we have a certain road 
to follow, involving many changes, starting with such prosaic 
ones as changing map symbols and ending with complicated 
technical changes. The key problem is to standardize our 
communications, command, firepower control, and reconnaissance 
systems with those in NATO. 
  At the same time, we have to alter the Polish mentality 
because it is we who are entering NATO structures, and we have 
to adapt to the customs prevalent there. I do not think this 
will be difficult. We have an Army of good specialists, prepared 
to think on their own. But there is no doubt that it will be 
useful to have staff command exercises, as suggested by NATO, 
carried out on the basis of computer systems. All of this takes 
time, but the Polish Army is intellectually prepared for it, and 
this road is not going to be excessively long. 
  [Grochowski] Talking about the need to adapt to NATO 
requirements, we often think of the Warsaw Pact, where weapons 
were standardized to a very large degree, and even Army 
organizational structures were the same. In the West, 
compatibility does not mean that there is only one type of 
weapon in all of the armies. One reason for this is that each 
country has its own weapons industry, whose products it would 
like to sell. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Of course. The point is not to standardize 
our weapons with NATO. Weapons are not even standardized inside 
NATO. The point is to bring our technological standards in line 
with NATO's. 
  [Grochowski] Do you expect Poland to have broader access to 
technology that is still on Western secret lists? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I hope so. We have been very vociferous in 
this matter. It turns out that Minister Olechowski succeeded in 
starting concrete talks, and a technical team from the United 
States is arriving next week. I think it would be inconsistent 
if this team merely told us what NATO standards are and then 
left us to our own devices. We expect help, and I hope we will 
get it. 
  [Grochowski] Is this NATO business not a little like a 
cat-and-mouse game? Everyone knows that integration with NATO 
requires huge funds. Yet the Polish Army simply does not have 
any money and is fighting for survival. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Indeed, the present budget does not even let 
us maintain present standards. We are sinking even lower, 
though there is really nowhere to sink to. I hope the budget is 
amended. 
  [Grochowski] The National Defense Commission demanded an 
800-billion zloty [Z] increase in the defense budget. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I appreciate the Commission's understanding 
of the needs of the Army, but, in fact, its needs are far 
greater if we are supposed to be a military partner for NATO. 
What is more, in subsequent budgets, defense expenditure must 
exceed 3 percent of the GNP or our Army will cease to exist. 
  However, the problem possesses a broader dimension. I asked 
the Council of Ministers whether greater emphasis should be 
applied to integration with NATO political structures. There is 
such a possibility--after all, Spain and Portugal belong to NATO 
political structures but not to its military ones. That alone 
guarantees that NATO will endow these countries with its 
attention should a conflict occur. Therefore, this is a way of 
improving the Poles' sense of security and of gaining enough 
time to modernize our Army at a pace permitted by our finances. 
But such modernization is impossible if defense expenditure is 
less than 3 percent of the GNP, and there is proof of that. 
  [Grochowski] What proof, Minister? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] According to General Staff data, reduced 
military spending makes our Army's low technical standards even 
lower, whereas higher expenditure allows us to modernize our 
equipment and catch up with Western armies. 
  [Grochowski] None of the politicians with whom I have spoken 
agree with the 3 percent you mention. They insist that the Army 
should get whatever it really needs. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I agree with them, and I hold them to their 
word. The Army needs three times the amount of money it is now 
getting in order to achieve by the end of the century a 
technical standard that prevails in Western armies. 
  [Grochowski] I have the impression that the defense budget 
is viewed not in ternm of the Army's real needs, but in terms of 
the need to rescue the Polish defense industry. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] It seems to me that our defense industry has 
gotten in the habit of staging strikes to force the Army to buy 
equipment it does not need. This practice leads nowhere. All 
it does is demoralize enterprise managers and make their 
products unattractive to the Polish Army and to foreign clients. 
  Why is the Czech aviation industry functioning so well? The 
Vodohady plant, which I visited last week, has orders worth $300 
million. The Czechs are selling fighter-trainer aircraft to 
various countries and displaying a flexibility and zest that are 
completely absent in the whole of our industry, not just the 
aviation industry. I asked them how they did it. They told me 
something to the effect that, if one does not help oneself, the 
government certainly will not do so. One can strike, they said, 
but at what cost? 
  This therapy did the trick. Their contracts for this year 
involve the production of at least 50 aircraft for the Czech 
Army and for export. These aircraft can compete with our own 
"Irida" any day. They are fitted with optical-electronic 
equipment and suspension locks [zamki powieszenia] in accordance 
with NATO standards. 
  In the meantime, there is a misunderstanding about the offer 
from our own Mielec aviation plant. Instead of a 
fighter-trainer, we are being offered a simple trainer. That is 
why I think it was a mistake to waste money on prolonging the 
life of plants that are unwilling to help themselves, and I will 
make sure I do not repeat the same mistake. That sounds brutal, 
but, with the Army's present condition, I see no other way. We 
must not waste money. 
  [Grochowski] The Polish armaments industry has been thrown 
into deep water without being taught to swim beforehand. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The Czech Government did not help Czech 
aviation plants until it saw that these plants were helping 
themselves. 
  [Grochowski] I fear that our armed forces will also come 
under pressure to manage on their own and make the best possible 
use of whatever funds they receive because there is no secret 
about the fact that the Army has a lot of property that is 
little used and very costly to maintain. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The idea of appointing a Military Property 
Agency was twice shelved by previous governments. We will make 
a fresh attempt to appoint this Agency, taking into account 
various proposals that have been presented in the meantime. If 
this government refuses to create this agency for whatever 
reason, we will insist on an alternative solution to relieve the 
military budget of the Z2 trillion that are currently spent 
every year on maintaining superfluous military property. 
  [Grochowski] General Wilecki said that, right now, the Army 
is guarding what he delicately describes as sleepy garrisons. 
Are there many of them? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] About 14. The description is very 
appropriate to the situation. Some garrisons will be not so 
much put to sleep as eliminated altogether, especially in the 
west of the country. But, at the same time, one would like to 
see an influx of funds to restore the infrastructure in those 
regions where this is necessary, especially in the eastern zone 
and the Krakow military district. 
  [Grochowski] You have said in no uncertain terms that the 
Army cannot afford to act as a charity any longer. If 
necessary, the Army will vacate barracks that are not in use. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I am close to reaching such a decision, 
which 
is a very difficult one because it is Polish property we are 
talking about. I consider myself responsible for national 
defense. Other matters are in the hands of the members of the 
government, and they should at least try to cooperate with the 
Army on the issues for which they are responsible. 
  [Grochowski] Another problem is that of the apartments 
that belong to the Defense Ministry but are occupied by people 
no longer connected to the Defense Ministry. How will that 
problem be solved? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The law on accommodation for members of the 
armed forces is almost ready, and, in early February, we will 
discuss it with other ministries, especially with the ministry 
of spatial economy, the Ministry of Construction, And the 
Ministry of Finance. After that, we will table it before 
parliament, with the request that it be passed quickly because 
the use of military accommodation by nonmilitary people 
represents a waste of Z1.87 trillion for the Army budget. 
  Of course, we will never regain all of this money, but if 
the 
apartments in question are utilized in accordance with the law, 
we will at least have funds to build more accommodation. We 
need 13,000 apartments. 
  [Grochowski] Is there a danger that the restructuring of the 
Defense Ministry and armed forces will be stopped because of a 
shortage of money? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] That is a complicated issue. The armed 
forces and command systems must be reorganized, but, 
fortunately, that is not as expensive as it seems. The real 
problem is with relocating personnel. This cannot be done 
without money, and of course there is no money. 
  The modest funds we have at our disposal must be spent on 
improving the technical condition and mobility of the armed 
forces. That also solves the problem of providing equal security 
for all borders because today we are in no danger of any 
unexpected conflict. Therefore, there is time to prepare a 
defense system, and there is no need to establish military 
garrisons of equal strength at every single border. 
  [Grochowski] At the end of 1994, there was supposed to have 
been a review of the changes inside the Ministry. What were the 
results? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The review has not been finished. The 
results are still being assessed. Right now, those spheres that 
have been placed under Jerzy Milewski's responsibility are being 
reorganized. This has nothing to do with shifting the burden of 
responsibility or transferring tasks from the civilian to the 
military spheres, which would be contrary to the principle of 
democratic control over the armed forces. 
  [Grochowski] Some politicians claim you are losing control 
over what is happening in your ministry. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] To this very day, I do not accept outside 
interference. Everything going on in the ministry for which I 
am constitutionally responsible is under my complete control. 
These are completely unfounded rumors. If I really had no 
control over the Ministry, there would be no point in my staying 
in Warsaw and being a puppet. I will never agree to that. 
  [Grochowski] I do not mean pressure from outside. I have in 
mind the transfer of too many powers from the civilian to the 
military sphere. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] That is fiction. Nothing like that has 
happened. 
  [Grochowski] Well, let us discuss the question of defense 
vice ministers. Why do you think there are enough vice 
ministers today? In the past, there have been as many as seven 
defense vice ministers, and every single one of them had his 
hands full. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] There are enough vice ministers for present 
needs. If needs increase, we will make personnel changes. 
After all, we experiment all the time. But one thing is sure; 
we are going to create several posts of director general, a post 
that exists in the defense ministries of many countries. I am 
not joking when I say this, but we also need one under secretary 
of state to make sure that the government benches are full 
during Sejm debates. Such an under secretary would be 
responsible for contacts with the Sejm committees. That is 
something that takes up a lot of time, and the rules forbid the 
director of the Parliamentary Bureau to deal with it. 
  [Grochowski] Politicians insist that all they want is to 
make sure that the Army remains under civilian control, as is 
the rule in democratic countries. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] They are right. I agree with them. But our 
democracy is not yet stable, and there is still a temptation to 
use the Army for political purposes. All of the parties would 
like to influence the Army, which is a very bad thing in a 
transitional period such as ours. The Army must have time to 
reestablish itself in new forms. 
  But once these new forms have solidified ,just as the 
state's 
democratic structures have done, and the responsibility of 
politicians has increased, I see no reason that any victorious 
coalition should not have increased control over the Army. This 
is not just a question of possibility but of responsibility for 
one's deeds, and our experience in this regard is not the best, 
unfortunately. 
  [Grochowski] Right now, only a handful of politicians 
understand the functioning of an army. No wonder, for where 
could they have learned it? Is it not worth bringing them to 
the ministry for a little instruction, although I fear their 
price might be high? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Any politician wishing to be responsible for 
defense matters should first of all be taken to the National 
Defense Academy in order to acquire a little theoretical 
knowledge. Only then could he perform good practical work in 
the ministry. 
  [Grochowski] You are implementing reforms that require 
legislative changes. Do you not fear that the Sejm might block 
the reforms? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes. If the Sejm presents rational reasons 
why the reforms should not go through, I will accept them. But 
if the Sejm blocks the reform for the sole purpose of playing a 
political game, as was the case in the past, we might reach a 
point where I have no further possibility of action, in which 
case... But, knowing how most of the members of the Sejm 
National Defense Committee think, I do not expect major 
difficulties. I do not think this Committee will play political 
games and set itself at a distance from defense matters. 
  [Grochowski] You have already issued two warnings about 
resigning. How serious are you about it? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] As long as there is a chance to do 
something, I will do it. But, if my hands are tied, I will not 
pretend I am still a minister. That would be alien to my 
mentality and character. But there is no danger of that for the 
time being.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Forowicz: "The Sejm on Partnership for </F>
Peace"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski have held talks with the Sejm 
Committee for National Defense and the Sejm Committee for 
Foreign Affairs in order to discuss tasks stemming from Poland's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program and the 
significance of this program for Polish security. Needless to 
say, one conlusion from this meeting is that it is "too early to 
turn our swords into ploughshares," as Minister Olechowski put 
it. 
  The meeting was chaired by Bronislaw Geremek, who said that 
the country was now entering the stage of actually implementing 
the PFP program that was signed by Prime Minister Pawlak. That, 
he explained, was the purpose of inviting both ministers to the 
meeting, so that they could report on preparations to implement 
it. Minister Olechowski briefly described the benefits of the 
PFP program and reported that a special Foreign Ministry-Defense 
Ministry team had prepared a plan of technical military 
cooperation with other PFP partners, and that a plenipotentiary 
has been chosen to coordinate undertakings and negotiate 
preliminary agreements with PFP partners. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, since Poland's acceptance 
of the PFP, NATO countries have made Poland numerous offers of 
cooperation. He also noted that this cooperation would 
inevitably involve costs. If the West cooperates with us, will 
we have enough funds? he asked. After all, changing the 
parameters of communications, command, and reconnaissance 
systems to NATO standards costs money. 
  Eleven deputies asked questions. Deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz 
[Democratic Union) wanted to know what Russia's attitude toward 
the PFP was and what difference it would make to Polish politics 
if Russia joins or fails to join the PFP. He expressed the fear 
that the emergent rivalry among the Visegrad Group countries to 
be the first to join the PFP might upset our own PFP objective. 
Deputy J. Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance) asked whether 
this Defense-Interior Ministry team contained room for 
representatives of the Industry Ministry interested in producing 
suitable weapons. Tomasz Nalecz (Union of Labor) feared that 
the cost of joining the PFP this year would be too high, while 
Bronislaw Komorowski (Democratic Union) asked how much other 
Visegrad countries would be spending. Aleksandra Malachowska 
(Polish Peasant Party) suspected that the Polish Government was 
overtly optimistic and had exaggerated the meaning of the 
gestures made by various Western partners following Poland's 
acceptance of the PFP. 
  The ministers tried to dispel fears as calmly as they could, 
without underplaying various complications and without 
attempting to conceal various uncertainties concerning the 
implementation of the the PFP with Poland's participation. They 
expressed a cautious hope that Russia would ultimately join the 
PFP, naturally in a role that suits its power status. 
  They also spoke about the indivisibility of European 
security 
and the parallel nature of various measures intended to increase 
security guarantees. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the 
Polish aim to join NATO is expressed in many other undertakings, 
some of which have already been completed, such as the 
conclusion of treaties with neighboring countries. Minister 
Kolodziejczyk recalled that our emergent links to the Western 
European Union are seen not as an alternative to the PFP, but as 
a complement and addition to it. Joint military exercises that 
have been suggested recently, such as a possible 
German-Polish-Dutch one or a joint Visegrad Group exercise in 
Ustka in June, already suggested a long time ago, could play a 
similar role. 
  The defense minister also indicated a reform of NATO. It is 
necessary for Poland to present opinions on this subject because 
this would help establish a path to this reform. He added that 
Poland should have representations at NATO facilities in 
Brussels. Some 100 officers should be employed there, capable 
of maintaining contacts with approximately 300 NATO institutions 
and agencies. Over a dozen such people should leave for 
Brussels in 1994. Kolodziejczyk once again mentioned the issue 
of unexpected budget expenditure. The government, he said, had 
not decided on a budget amendment that would permit a more 
convenient financing of Polish representations to NATO.

<F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Ready For a `Strike Until Victory'"] </F>
  [Text] The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] of 
"Solidarity" ["S"] stated that "the success of the 9 February 
demonstration, the social support that was achieved, must not be 
wasted." Today the KK will make a decision concerning further 
action of the trade union. "Marian Krzaklewski stated that a 
strategic strike would be possible; such a strike would force 
the authorities to make decisions favorable to employees. 
Nothing seems to show that this demonstration has made any 
impression on the government, which we expected: There are no 
preparations for talks or any serious corrections of the 
budget," we learned from KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak after the 
Tuesday [15 February] session of the Presidium. 
  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak replied to 
Krzaklewski (who proposed negotiations in order to "avoid the 
escalation of social tension") that "a bad tradition, inherited 
from the former years, is the transferring of each conflict to 
the central level." This is why their meeting "should be 
preceded by a debate on the scope of the problems that may be 
discussed in a different mode and that call for an official 
meeting." He added that difficult problems should be resolved 
"in a working mode" and that such talks are already being held 
by the Labor Ministry. 
  For "S," Pawlak's letter is no answer, as it were. He 
already proposed that they resume negotiations on social 
guarantees, but, in this matter, "they presented their opinion 
and submitted conditions that have so far been impossible to 
implement." 
  What can a "strategic strike" be like? "We realize that it 
is no longer the time or not yet the time for us to be able to 
"galvanize to action" the entire country. However, we are a 
well-organized and strong union and we are able to continue a 
strike until we win. One can imagine, for example, the strike 
of several branches or several regions of great importance to 
the country, or a progressive strike in all the regions of "S." 
Or merging all these three strike forms and demonstrations," 
says Zak.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Adamowicz: "Offended `Solidarity' </F>
Threatens"] 
  [Text] If in the immediate future the government does not 
implement the demands of Solidarity, the trade union will 
organize strikes. The National Committee [KK], which held a 
session on Wednesday [16 February] in Gdansk, negatively 
evaluated the prime minister's reply to the proposal to meet 
with Chairman Marian Krzaklewski. 
  "It seems that the prime minister does not want to hold this 
meeting at all," said KK Spokesman Piotr Zak regarding Pawlak's 
letter. In reply to the proposal submitted by Krzaklewski, the 
prime minister stated that "it is a bad tradition to transfer 
any conflict to the central level," and he pointed to the 
negotiations that are going on in the Labor Ministry. He 
suggested that, during those talks, Solidarity should try to 
discuss its tasks. The meeting between the prime minister and 
the chairman should be held at a later date. Krzaklewski did 
not conceal his disappointment over the contents of Pawlak's 
letter. It was unofficially recalled that last fall the 
Solidarity chairman was favorably impressed by Pawlak, and he 
counted on his help. Observers recall at the same time that, in 
the past, Krzaklewski relied very heavily on the help of Prime 
Minister Suchocka; the disappointment turned into enmity that 
ended up in conflict. 
  According to Krzklewski and the KK, only strong and 
permanent 
pressure on the government will force it to implement the trade 
union's demands. By the middle of March, the government should 
submit credible guarantees of performing the following tasks: 
limiting energy price increases, giving property to the people, 
passing a law on collective agreements, respecting the principle 
of representation for employee and employer organizations, 
changing fiscal policy, and departing from the principle of 
centrally regulated wages. Solidarity also demands that the 
"Pact on Enterprise" be implemented; it wants corrections to the 
budget that would make it possible to perform the 
above-mentioned tasks. A strike headquarters has been set up 
that will decide the time and form of strikes in the regions and 
branches. Solidarity authorities will rely, among others 
things, on the secretariats of the Steel Works Industry, 
Transport, Mining and Energy, as well as Communications. The 
union is setting up a strike fund; the Solidarity authorities 
propose that each member pay half of his day's earning, which 
would yield as much as 112 billion zlotys [Z]. 
  The resignation of KK Deputy Chairman Leszek Szewc, who was 
the head of the election staff, was not accepted. The union did 
not receive financial compensation for the introduction of nine 
legislators to the Senate. It is a sum of Z1.3 billion. The 
Solidarity election committee did not publish its financial 
report on the campaign in time. The union's authorities 
appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court over the decision 
of the Finance Ministry. However, they unofficially admit that 
they do not expect a verdict favorable to Solidarity.

  [Text] [Presenter] Leszek Miller and Mykhaylo Kaskevych, 
ministers of labor of Poland and Ukraine, have signed an 
agreement on mutual employment. 
  [Correspondent Magdalena Winiarczyk] The agreement, which 
has 
been signed for a three-year period, sets the conditions for 
legal employment. Any form of employment that does not comply 
with the principles of the agreement is illegal. The period of 
individual employment may not be longer than 12 months and, in 
exceptional circumstances, can be extended to 18 months. The 
pay and working conditions for foreign employees may not be 
worse than the conditions enjoyed by the citizens of each 
country. This is to prevent dumping practices. Social 
security, health care and legal protection are to be guaranteed 
by the employing country and are to be included in consular 
conventions. 
  Work permits are to be issued by employment offices for 
specific employers and specific jobs. This principle also 
concerns applications for long-stay visas, which include work 
permits as well. 
  Ministers Leszek Miller and Mykhaylo Kaskevych have also 
signed an agreement on cooperation in the area of labor and 
social policy between the two countries. 
  [Announcer] Magdalena Winiarczyk was speaking from the 
Ministry of Labor for the Midday Magazine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Marcin Swiecicki by Krzysztof </F>
Grzegrzolka; place and date not given: "Not This Way"] 
  [Text] [Grzegrzolka] Poland's finances are in a bad 
state. Will the government-proposed budget improve them? 
  [Swiecicki] Not only will the government draft budget fail 
to improve Poland's financial condition, it will also make it 
even worse. The increase in spending will be so large that in 
order to pay for it, the government, apart from increasing tax 
rates, wants to increase the budget deficit from 44 trillion 
zlotys [Z], the 1993 level, to Z83 trillion this year. The Sejm 
will probably approve an even greater increase. The government 
is not going to fulfill its preelection promises in any case, 
and an increase in the budget deficit could ensnare Poland in 
new debts. This will make it impossible to fulfill any promises 
whatsoever in the future and will lead to a further increase in 
taxes and dramatic cuts in social spending. The government 
seems to forget that we have still not repaid the horrendous 
debts that Gierek [former communist party first secretary] 
incurred. Poland's foreign debts amount to over Z1,000 
trillion--i.e. almost $50 billion. This year we will spend 
almost Z30 trillion on servicing these debts. This is only 
possible because we are not yet repaying the London Club, and 
the agreement with the Paris Club contains exceptionally 
favorable conditions. To this, one must add the servicing of 
our domestic debts. In 1994, we have to spend over Z80 trillion 
on servicing these debts. Already this year, 18 percent of 
budget revenues will be spent on repaying old debts instead of 
financing the health service, education, the Army, or the 
police. An increase in the budget deficit and the acquisition 
of new credits to finance this deficit could bring about a 
collapse of state finances in subsequent years. 
  [Grzegrzolka] Perhaps the deficit will revive the economy? 
  [Swiecicki] That is rather impossible in our situation 
because there is no spare production capacity to produce quality 
products that could boost demand. Many enterprises have lost 
their markets. Apart from that, we have too many people engaged 
in agriculture and a new population boom. As you can see, new 
jobs and investments are necessary in order to cause a revival. 
Yet the banks are compelled to finance the budget deficit, and 
they do not have much money left to give to investors. The 
budget deficit makes loans more expensive. 
  [Grzegrzolka] What types of spending do you consider 
unnecessary? 
  [Swiecicki] In a market economy, is it really necessary to 
subsidize the State Railways by Z7 trillion and provide 
agriculture and industry with several dozen trillion zlotys? 
Instead of spending budget funds on social objectives, it would 
be better to give money to the rural districts, which are bound 
to manage this money better. 
  [Grzegrzolka] Is a spending cut the only solution? 
  [Swiecicki] Great structural reforms to the social security 
system, health service, and education are required. 
Unfortunately, the government has still not presented any ideas 
of its own about these spheres, and it has abandoned the ideas 
of previous governments. 
  [Grzegrzolka] But the present ruling coalition is considered 
very prosocial. 
  [Swiecicki] The indiscriminate granting of costly social 
security benefits in a poor country means that there is not 
enough money for those who are really dependent on social 
security. For instance, too many working people have gained the 
right to early pensions. Many people are retiring early but are 
still working at their jobs. This is the so-called gray zone. 
Instead of contributing to insurance funds, these people are 
drawing from them. For instance, in Poland there are more men 
who are drawing pensions and have not yet reached retirement age 
than men who who have passed retirement age. Despite the very 
high social security contributions, 30 percent of the workers' 
contribution and 94 percent of the farmers' contribution are 
paid out of the budget. We pay high contributions, but not even 
such basic benefits as family income supplements for low-income 
or multichildren families are available. It is similar with 
unemployment benefits. The coalition has evaded the difficult 
subject of reforming the social security and pension systems, as 
well as the health and education systems. In Poland, 90 percent 
of the funds to combat unemployment are spent on benefits. Only 
10 percent is spent on creating new jobs, public works, 
retraining programs, and loans for people setting up their own 
businesses. 
  [Grzegrzolka] Democratic Union politicians are very fond of 
discussing this issue, but not even the Democratic Union 
government managed to resolve it. 
  [Swiecicki] But the program to combat unemployment initiated 
by the Democratic Union government remains valid. The present 
government is allocating more money for this program but has 
failed to indicate necessary cutbacks in other spheres. The 
rural lobby in the Sejm will demand subsidies for fuel and 
preferential loans for farmers. Large farms will profit by 
this, but it will not save the small farmers or the workers make 
redundant by the closure of state farms. 
  [Grzegrzolka] Do you see a better solution? 
  [Swiecicki] This money should be spent on developing the 
rural service infrastructure, expanding small-scale production, 
establishing more schools in rural areas, and creating 
nonagricultural jobs there. That will reap greater benefits 
than pumping money into rural production, which has only 25 
percent of the per capita productivity of urban production. 
People should leave small and inefficient farms and transfer to 
other areas of the economy, and they ought to receive help for 
this transfer. In economically developed countries, less than 
20 percent of the population lives off agriculture; in Poland, 
50 percent of the population does. Instead of restructuring 
this percentage and making rural areas dependent on market 
forces, the government is making them dependent on state 
subsidies. 
  [Grzegrzolka] What do you think of the idea of a 
protectionist customs duty? 
  [Swiecicki] Poland has the conditions to produce more food 
than for just its own needs. Therefore, it is quite natural to 
compete for foreign markets, especially in West Europe. But 
cutting ourselves off from foreign competition is a bad 
solution. The government's proposed equalizing payments will 
preserve the high production costs in Poland and cause high food 
prices. All this will affect the consumer. The Mazowiecki 
government was criticized for opening up Poland to a mass influx 
of Western food on the Polish market, but these critics forget 
that it is thanks to this opening up that we can now buy fancy 
foodstuffs that used to appear only at Christmas or never at 
all. The quality of Polish dairy produce has also improved 
thanks to foreign competition. In 1990, our food exports went 
up by 20 percent against the previous year, and we had a 
$1-billion trade surplus in food, and without any equalizing 
payments. I wish the present government similar success. I 
think that opening foreign markets to Polish agricultural 
produce should be one of the government's strategic tasks.

  [Excerpts] The visit paid to Romania by Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman concluded today. [passage omitted] A joint news 
conference was held by the two chiefs of state after the signing 
of the official Romanian-Croatian documents. The news 
conference was opened with a statement by President Ion Iliescu, 
who said that the bilateral relations have already experienced a 
positive evolution, despite the tensions prevailing in the 
former Yugoslav space, and that the current talks in Bucharest 
have shown that there is a real interest in developing these 
relations, as proven by the agreements and the Romanian-Croatian 
treaty signed on this occasion. President Ion Iliescu also 
hailed the agreement on normalizing the Serbian-Croatian 
relations and the latest developments in Bosnia. He said that a 
military solution to the conflict has no chance of success. 
  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said in his statement that 
his visit to Romania will give an impetus to the economic, 
political, cultural, and sports cooperation between the two 
countries and that the treaty signed in Bucharest will lead to a 
very good development of the Romanian-Croatian relations. 
Pointing out that Romania is the largest country in the region, 
the Croatian president said that it can play a major role in 
solving the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans in 
general. The guest said that if NATO resorts to air attacks, 
this might lead to an extension of the conflict. Consequently, 
negotiations to solve the situation in Bosnia are to be 
preferred. 
  Both in his introductory statement and in the answers to the 
questions of the journalists, President Tudjman referred to the 
Yugoslav crisis, which he characterized as extremely 
complicated. He described NATO's ultimatum as having a possible 
positive aspect, but he also expressed doubts over its 
implementation. The Croatian head of state recalled his 
country's initial desire to maintain the unity of former 
Yugoslavia in a federation that can ensure the equal rights of 
the nations. That wish could not materialize, Mr. Tudjman said, 
because the proclamation of the independence of Slovenia, 
Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina was followed by the 
Serbian aggression against Croatia and Bosnia, with ended in the 
occupation of a third of Croatia's territory. In this respect, 
Mr. Franjo Tudjman emphasized the contribution that Romania can 
make, as element of stability in the area, to resolving the 
Yugoslav crisis.

<F P=106> [Interview in two installments with Slovak Prime Minister </F>
Vladimir Meciar by Jan Smolec, chief editor of REPUBLIKA; place 
and date not given] 
<H5>  [7 Feb pp 1, 4] </H5>
<H3>  A Misunderstanding With the President Is the Last Thing We 
Need </H3>
  [Text] Since the end of last year, every day brings 
new, often very dramatic and tangled, situations on our 
political scene. Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has been 
and remains the principal actor in all these episodes. Many 
politicians, deputies, and, of course, journalists decided since 
the beginning of the year to deal very "harshly" with him. They 
do anything in their power to remove him from the political 
scene. Therefore, REPUBLIKA tried for a topical interview with 
the prime minister. 
  [Smolec] As a journalist, I would like to ask you about the 
dominant topical events that are shaking our political scene. 
The REPUBLIKA readers are, among other things, however, also 
interested in whether you managed to rest on the brief vacation 
you took at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, 
and recharge the battery of your personal energy and vitality. 
  [Meciar] If I do not take into account meetings with Cabinet 
members and talks with several other officials, I have really 
had a little rest. I have even managed to get on my skis once 
and to fall. There was no reporter around, but it would have 
been a fantastic shot with a caption "Meciar's Fall." I met a 
man there whom I very much respect--Mr. Kulang, a porter in the 
High Tatras mountain range. In 1992, he celebrated our election 
victory in the Tatras by carrying a record 207-kg load. I was 
rambling through the streets. I met young people. One of them 
recognized me. He called to his friends, "Hey, that's Meciar." 
His friends turned and replied: "You are silly, Meciar is 
twice as tall." 
  [Smolec] The independent Slovakia is also your achievement 
as a statesman. In the struggle for a place in the sun, you 
stand out among the many of your "fellow travelers." Those who 
did not want Slovak independence are "plotting" against you now. 
They predicted that the first attack against you would begin in 
January. It did. When do you expect the next one? 
  [Meciar] The whirlwind around me never stops. 
Unfortunately, there are also people who are, as you say, 
"plotting" against me. I have a message for these people: "I 
still have enough strength to face them." 
  [Smolec] Our readers are very disappointed that even the 
Slovak president, who holds his post also because of you, has 
stood up against you. In the New Year's address, he appealed to 
the leading representatives of the parliamentary parties to 
search for personalities suitable for the government. The 
president is calling for a stable government that will be 
trusted abroad. It is an obvious casting of doubts on the prime 
minister, the government.... The readers are convinced that it 
is the people close to the president who are responsible for the 
conflict between the Castle and Freedom Square [seats of the 
president and the prime minister (government), respectively]. 
After all, it is surprising, to say the least, if a Christian 
Democratic Movement politician who had voted in the former 
Federal Assembly against Slovak independence is responsible for 
security policy at the Castle. The following postulate is 
gaining in popularity among the people: The Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] won the elections, but the Castle was 
won by the VPN [the former Public Against Violence movement] 
members, obnoxious people, Czechoslovakists.... 
  [Meciar] I refuse the thesis of good kings and bad advisers. 
In a democracy, the chief is responsible for his advisers. It 
is never the other way around--the advisers are not responsible 
for the chief. There are differences between the government and 
the Castle. The president pointed them out clearly on 1 
January. Neither do I want to go into details, nor do we have 
the time. This misunderstanding is the last thing we need. I 
must, however, comment on certain aspects of this problem. 
Political parties and movements are independent of the state. 
A state representative has no right to interfere in the 
internal affairs of these parties, even if he is the president. 
The government is subject to parliamentary control but not to 
the president. The president entrusts the prime minister with 
the composition of a new government, but he cannot create a 
situation that would lead to a change of this government. There 
are also the political aspects. Not even the president can cast 
doubts on the government in the international political arena 
and, at the same time, interfere in its powers. There is a lot 
that one can criticize in these relations, and a lot more of 
what Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic, has disclosed so far. 
  [Smolec] You must certainly have analyzed your approach to 
date. Which steps in your decisionmaking do you consider 
erroneous, which do you intend to correct? To pass on the 
critical comments of our readers, they do not like the fact 
that, now and then, you react very impulsively. Your vigor is 
well known, but you can be also very benevolent, as you were, 
for instance, to the most recent visitors from Hungary (Sandor 
Lezsak of the Hungarian Democratic Forum). If, by his 
impertinent comments, a visitor interferes in the internal 
affairs of Slovakia, he should be taken by the collar, shown the 
border, and ordered never to come back. We must speak more 
about the demands and rights of the Slovaks in southern Slovakia. 
  [Meciar] We have not made any substantial changes in the 
strategy. We could have harmonized the steps in certain 
critical issues differently. One example is the economic 
sphere. Another question is what disposable resources we had to 
make such corrections. We have made some mistakes in personnel 
work, and it should be openly admitted what these mistakes 
were--Knazko, Filkus, Cernak. I react only in certain specific 
situations beyond the limit of endurance or the limits of 
objective truth. Some people might not like the form but, for 
God's sake, they cannot demand that I should be liked by 
everyone. 
  Regarding the questions of relations between the Slovaks and 
the Hungarians, I do not believe that we made a mistake. The 
opposite. The government has a concept and is implementing it. 
The government submitted bills to the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic and kept all of its promises. If these bills 
were not passed in parliament, it is not the government's 
business. Proposals different from the government ones came to 
parliament from the president's roundtable. That was, in 
essence, the beginning of the split in the parliament. It was 
forgotten that the legislative initiative belongs to the 
government or a deputy, but not a roundtable. 
  Regarding the southern region of Slovakia, we must 
corroborate that Slovakia is our common home. We are building 
good relations and mutual respect among the citizens. No 
assimilation of Hungarians is taking place in Slovakia, and 
nothing like that is planned. The Slovaks in nationally mixed 
regions must be supported just as much as the Hungarians. They 
must not be worse off. 
  [Smolec] In his book The History of the 20th 
Century, Paul Johnson considers the economic miracle of the 
West the most important event of the century. Approximately 300 
million people attained tremendous wealth over just 35 years. 
The credit for this belongs, above all, to politicians with 
authoritarian tendencies: Adenauer, de Gasperi, de Gaulle. At a 
time of transition, such politicians are literally 
indispensable. You indicate, by answering in all seriousness 
the questions of a journalistic ignoramus with hooligan 
tendencies, for instance, that you reject all authoritarian 
forms of government. You even let yourself be insulted. Will 
that not lead to your adversaries taking ever greater liberties? 
  [Meciar] In a democracy, power can be given to a single 
person, but never so much that it could no longer be taken away 
from that person. There have been instances of this in history. 
Is there such a situation in Slovakia today? I do not think so. 
  Regarding communication, everyone defends himself to his 
limit of jeopardy. This limit of jeopardy, then, is perceived 
differently by each person, and he or she chooses the means of 
protection accordingly. I do not feel threatened. Therefore, I 
even talk to a journalistic ignoramus. I refuse to use violent 
coercive methods to deal with political problems. It is you 
journalists who should be dealing with infractions of 
journalistic ethics. 
  [Smolec] A politician occasionally finds himself in a 
situation in which he must take on what is called historic 
responsibility. When have you been in such a situation? 
  [Meciar] I remember the situation in December 1992, when all 
of the political parties, with the exception of the Slovak 
National Party, refused to support us. We needed to get three 
votes in the Federal Assembly in the final ballot on the demise 
of the federation. They asked, "Who will take the 
responsibility?" I got up then and said, "I take this 
responsibility upon myself." There are times when it must be 
done. I remember how the responsibility frightened even some 
members of the HZDS delegation to Jihlava. In effect, they left 
me all alone. I had more work with our own delegation than with 
the Czech party. Under psychological pressure and with the 
Czech ultimatum they retreated too far. It was necessary, then, 
to take personal responsibility. 
  Following the emergence of the state, there was no state 
structure. It was necessary to build it, and, of course, bear 
the responsibility. We have now reached the stage at which this 
structure is being implemented. Every state, every community, 
every interest group should choose personalities capable of 
representing and defending their interests. If the 
personalities are removed, only the mediocre will remain. If an 
authoritative decision is to be made, and if the situation 
requires it, again, I will not hesitate. It is always necessary 
to consider the time and the means. For a long time now, it has 
not been valid that sordid means are justified by holy ends. 
<H5>  [8 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H5>  We Need Democracy Rather Than "Democratizers" </H5>
  [Smolec] For how much longer will the enterprises depend 
solely on the government and not on their own management? 
Jefferson said that the best government is the one that governs 
least. 
  [Meciar] The people themselves are feeling the direct 
effects of the extent of the changes. Everyone feels that a 
fundamental change is taking place. A gradual improvement was 
assumed in 1989, and the systemic change was not expected. Let 
us not forget that the change is taking place at a time of an 
economic crisis, the collapse and creation of new markets, and 
the collapse and creation of a new system of economic 
cooperation. These are the external factors. Within society, 
it is not just the emergence of the state but also the change of 
economic conditions. We have inherited 89 billion [korunas] of 
enterprise insolvency, a government budget deficit, inefficient 
state administration, and a shortage of various operations that 
are necessary for a functioning economic process. Therefore, it 
is only logical that many enterprises are waiting for the state 
to implement its policy. On the other hand, any policy or 
change in the macrostructure is predestined to fail if it is not 
accompanied by changes in the microstructure--i.e., by changes 
in the community or enterprise. After all, each enterprise has 
its own changes. There are changes in the management structure, 
behavioral changes, and adjustments to become a competitive 
enterprise of the market type, which is something completely 
different from the enterprises in a centrally planned economy. 
We do not have people trained for this. They are learning on 
the job. That is very costly for us. The relationship between 
the enterprise sphere and the economic sphere of the state must 
be a balanced one. 
  [Smolec] History has confirmed that every society that wants 
to expand its freedom must make certain that it is not done at 
the expense of duties and responsibility. In our country, 
unfortunately, freedom has often been confused with anarchy. 
  [Meciar] The freedom of action, the freedom of cognition is 
always limited by the limits of the freedom of another person. 
Under the pretext of freedom, numerous mistakes have been made 
in showing lack of respect for other people and violating their 
rights, and by increasing violence. That is not good. We need 
democracy rather than "democratizers." Freedom and discipline 
are natural sisters of the same mother. The respect for one's 
own freedom means to respect the freedom of others. 
Self-discipline is the ability to respect certain socially 
accepted rules. The expressions of anarchism of the type 
"Everything is allowed" and "You can do anything" are an 
expression of a lower standard of political culture, ignorance 
of social processes, and deformation of democracy. These 
"democratizers" exist. Just see how they gloat. Their ego is 
always above anyone else, and the value of their interests is 
higher than the value of interests of other people. 
  [Smolec] With the Western style of life, unaccustomed crime, 
corruption, and fear came to Slovakia. The streets are 
controlled by criminals, Mafia. It is rumored that the ranks of 
the incorruptible (politicians and policemen) are thinning fast. 
What does the government intend to do in this respect? 
  [Meciar] I have appealed to the citizens with the "clean 
hands" initiative. It is not a single action but rather an 
entire set of measures. The institutions that are founded must 
be capable of such cleanliness. It is true that precisely 
because politocracy is being replaced by the financial oligarchy 
and power of money that many people began to gauge the values of 
life by the value of money. The koruna expresses an economic 
relation, however, and not a human value. Human values should 
be the dominant ones. Corruption is a serious social ailment. 
It is necessary to fight it by creating a suitable social 
atmosphere and legislative rules. To be frank, I must admit 
that, from the vantage point of the atmosphere, we have not been 
successful. You can see that I am mostly attacked precisely 
from these "get-rich-quick" circles. Trying to hide it would be 
useless. The extent of contacts, links of numerous politicians 
to these interest spheres, is so large that I am not even 
certain whether they always act of their own will. 
  Regarding the issue of measures, the government submitted to 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic a draft of 
principles of the law on conflict of interests. We will see 
what the stand of the parliament will be. A new law on the 
police was adopted. The financial police was established. We 
are building customs offices, taxation offices, and other 
institutions. The taxation offices have already begun to 
actively seek and prosecute dishonest methods of getting rich. 
This struggle probably cannot ever be completely won, but it is 
necessary to reduce the extent of it. 
  [Smolec] You are not only the Slovak prime minister but 
also the HZDS chairman. Certain circles in Slovakia have been 
reckoning recently, both under cover and openly, that a road to 
the formation of a "broad coalition government" could be opened 
by splitting the HZDS, by dividing its Deputies' Club, and 
subsequently selecting a "suitable" person from this movement 
for the post of prime minister. Is it only wishful thinking, or 
do you admit at least some basis for such speculation? 
  [Meciar] The attack that is currently led against me has a 
somewhat different background from before. It is guided by the 
idea that the HZDS without Meciar would be a less dangerous 
partner in the event of elections, or, rather, it would not be 
dangerous at all. It is also reckoned that the conceivable 
removal of the HZDS chairman will lead to the emergence of 
several factions. By its disintegration, the movement that 
today represents a genuine great political power would actually 
clear space for the Party of the Democratic Left, or it would 
facilitate an improvement in the status of the Christian 
Democrats. The notions of cooperation, when the opposition 
calls "Broad coalition yes, but without Meciar" could cause a 
reaction of "Broad coalition yes, but without Weiss, without 
Carnogursky." Is that in order? It is sick! We cannot demand 
that one movement give up its representatives in favor of 
representatives of another movement. 
  The formation of factions in the Deputies' Club or a 
division of the Deputies' Club is one of frequent topics. It is 
obvious that it cannot be done from without. I am sorry that 
the president is conducting great consultations in this respect 
with some National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies and 
recommending specific alternatives. The HZDS has remained a 
viable and democratic institution. It must decide for itself 
what it will do. True, the speculation is continuing. 
  [Smolec] In conclusion, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to 
present to you a proposal or, rather, a plea of the REPUBLIKA 
readers. They suggest that you and also other members of the 
Cabinet regularly answer their questions. Will you comply with 
this plea? 
  [Meciar] REPUBLIKA literally fills a great gap in our 
newspaper market and its offerings. After all, there were 
hardly any papers that would seek objectivity. REPUBLIKA has 
reached, in this respect, not only awareness but also the 
journalistic culture. Therefore, I will be glad to take the 
opportunity and be the first to answer the readers' questions. 
Moreover, I am convinced that other members of the Cabinet will 
be glad to accept the offer of cooperation with REPUBLIKA. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  EDITOR IN CHIEF's NOTE: As you see, dear readers, while we 
were copying the interview and preparing it for publication, new 
and even more dramatic events accumulated. Take the opportunity 
provided by the prime minister's promise and send your questions 
on current topical issues to the address of the REPUBLIKA 
editorial office as soon as possible.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 16 (AFP) -- UNPROFOR's leadership 
stressed Wednesday [16 February] that Serb and Moslem forces 
must put heavy arms under UN control before Monday and said if 
they took the weapons back, air strikes would be launched 
against them. 
  General Jean Cot of France, commander-in-chief of the UN 
Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia, said the weapons must be put 
under armed control "within 10 days", meaning before the Sunday 
midnight ultimatum laid down by NATO expires. 
  "I expect all the heavy weapons from both sides to be placed 
under our control before February 20," he added, speaking at a 
joint news conference at Sarajevo airport. 
  Ten mortars from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army are already 
under guard of armed UN peacekeepers, held in a barracks used by 
the Ukrainian UNPROFOR contingent in Sarajevo. 
  However 36 heavy weapons that the Serbs agreed to place 
under 
UN control are at present only being guarded by unarmed UN 
military observers. 
  A senior UNPROFOR officer revealed to AFP Tuesday that the 
UNPROFOR military leadership had asked several times to put 
armed guards outside the two hangars where the arms are held but 
that the Serbs refused. 
  General Andre Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo, 
said 
"three additional areas for storing heavy weapons are being 
sought and a certain amount of weapons are being taken under 
control." 
  General Sir Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection 
Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for his part said: "We're not here 
to fight a war. If they, by force of arms or superior force of 
arms get their weapons back, we will use air [power] against 
them. We'll use force if they take their weapons back from the 
designated positions." 
  Cot said that at meetings Wednesday with the 
commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Army, General Rasim Delic, and 
Tuesday with the Serb forces' chief General Ratko Mladic, "they 
made a solemn commitment to respect the process undertaken here 
by General Rose." 
  He reiterated there were no conflicting aims between 
UNPROFOR 
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that any decision 
to carry out air strikes would be taken "here, on the ground, by 
General Rose and myself." 
  Earlier in Brussels, NATO reiterated warnings that the 
deadline for the demilitarization of Sarajevo would be enforced 
by air strikes if necessary and denied any differences with UN 
peacekeepers over the meaning of "control" of Serb heavy weapons 
around the city. 
  Earlier in Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said NATO and the United 
Nations saw eye-to-eye on how to control heavy weapons of 
Bosnian Serbs in the Sarajevo area. 
  "Coordination meetings between NATO and the UN have sorted 
out all points," Peter MacFarlane, a spokesman for the United 
Nations Protection Force, told a press conference here. 
  His comments contrasted with reports from Brussels that NATO 
was becoming increasingly critical of apparently inadequate UN 
plans to monitor the Serb artillery around the city.

<F P=106> [Article by "km": "An Investigator From the United States </F>
Came To Study Information on Clinton"] 
  [Text] Prague--According to the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON 
POST, Josephine diGenova, an independent U.S. investigator, has 
visited the Czech Republic to learn details of the alleged 
involvement of the former Czechoslovak secret service in the 
1992 U.S. presidential election campaign. 
  According to this source, diGenova is to verify reports 
claiming that the Czechoslovak secret service provided the 
election staff of former President George Bush with information 
discrediting his then election rival, Bill Clinton. 
  The U.S. investigator is mostly interested in the illegal 
search for information in President Bill Clinton's travel 
documents. Clinton came for a visit as a student in the 1970's. 
The former Czechoslovak authorities allegedly provided Bush's 
election team with, among other things, the report that Bill 
Clinton's sojourn in Prague has not been registered with the 
police. This information has then been correlated to the 
never-confirmed link between Clinton and the Soviet secret 
service KGB. Marek Skolil, director of the Press Department of 
the Foreign Ministry has so far refused to comment on the visit 
of the U.S. investigator.

  [Text] We have already reported that a NATO F-16 military 
aircraft has carried out crash landing at Secovlje Airport 
today. This has also been confirmed by the Defense Ministry, 
while Defense Minister Janez Jansa has already appointed a 
special commission that will carry out an investigation. The 
commission has allowed the experts of the country that owns the 
aircraft to carry out some security measures on the aircraft's 
armaments. Robert Rakar from Radio Koper has more details: 
  [Begin Rakar recording] Secovlje Airport has been virtually 
closed since 1022 when a U.S. F-16 aircraft carried out a crash 
landing there. The pilot chose Secovlje for the crash landing 
because of an engine fault. Witnesses to this incident have 
told us that the aircraft first touched the runway at its 
beginning, whereupon it bounced into the air and its engine 
died. It then tried to land again, and during this last attempt 
its undercarriage collapsed. The aircraft then crashed into a 
verge at the end of the runway. The pilot was not injured and 
two hours after the accident he was transferred to Aviano by 
special U.S. Army helicopter where he will undergo all the 
necessary medical checkups. 
  A special Defense Ministry commission, lead by Brigadier 
Iztok Podbregar, took over the matter from the border police. 
We can expect the arrival of a special U.S. military commission 
to carry out the necessary investigation together with the 
Slovene commission at any moment. It is very difficult to 
obtain any information, but unofficially six miles out of 
Secovlje the pilot disarmed two rockets and dumped them into the 
sea. We will be able to confirm this information once the 
commission has completed its work. Brigadier Podbregar promised 
that the investigation will be carried out as swiftly as 
possible. [end recording]

  [Text] The purpose of THE WASHINGTON POST article was to 
discredit us in the eyes of the Russians, who are our number-one 
partner in special equipment trade, Cenzin [arms trading 
company] Chairman Tadeusz Bednarek has told Panorama. On Monday 
THE WASHINGTON POST reported that 10 years ago Poland used to 
sell high-class Soviet military equipment to the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Rajmund Szwonder, Democratic Left 
Alliance 
senator] This case concerns a story that is about 10 years old, 
isn't it? In my home town of Laskarzew, they say that reheated 
pancakes are indigestible even when eaten with Russian caviar. 
  [Tadeusz Bednarek, Cenzin chairman] Cenzin sold weapons to 
the United States, but they were museum pieces and weapons items 
for collectors. 
  [Correspondent] What about reexports from what was then the 
Soviet Union? 
  [Bednarek] There were instances of this kind, but these 
exports, these shipments from Poland, went to credible, verified 
end users in the recipient country. 
  [Correspondent] So what happened after that was up to the 
recipient? 
  [Bednarek] Well, the supplier cannot check on this for a 
long 
time. A credible end user is necessary for the issue of an 
export permit. Then you check whether the goods have reached 
their destination. But we are unable to check what some 
countries went on to do with the purchased weapons. 
  I would also like to emphasise that these were not 
components, as the WASHINGTON POST suggests, of strategic 
weapons, nor were they the latest technologies. 
  [Szwonder] The gun scandal [Polish officials found not 
guilty 
of alleged arms trade offenses by a U.S. court], of which to a 
degree I was a hero, the Burmese scandal [U.S. ban on sale of 
Polish helicopters to Burma], and the current scandal amazingly 
coincide with our export successes, even if only minor ones. 
  [Bednarek] I believe that the publication in the WASHINGTON 
POST and the whole press campaign around this subject is 
unambiguously aimed at discrediting us in the eyes of our 
Russian partner, who is Poland's number-one partner in special 
equipment trade. [end recording]

  [Text] Tirana, February 15 (ATA) -- On February 14, the 
Albanian Foreign Ministry delegation held official talks with 
the Presidency of the European Union, represented by Greece. In 
the meeting Mr. Benavides, the EU representative, was also 
present. 
  "We welcome you in Athens with a sincere friendship," 
Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, said at the beginning of 
the meeting which lasted two hours. Mr. Papoulias briefly 
mentioned the main points of the EU Presidency for the first six 
months of the 1994, emphasizing the special attention paid to 
the eastern and central European countries which are now in the 
transition period. The EU intends to strengthen the political 
and economical relations with those countries, and also the EU 
especially regards as important the security in the region and 
promoting a political solution of the crises in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Taking the floor, Mr. Benevedis said the fact that 74 per 
cent of the total assistance for Albania comes from the EU and 
its member countries shows the level of our relations. "We will 
consider the Albania's request for improving the mechanisms and 
the ways of the implementing the PHARE [Economic and 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, Mr. 
Benevedis said. 
  Mr. Papoulias said the EU has seen the political 
developments 
in Albania. "We regard as very positive the fast achievements 
of the economic reform and the constitutional Law for Human 
Rights. I am informed that the law on education will pass very 
soon in parliament. We welcome this step. During my visit in 
Albania, you (addressing to Minister Serreqi) and the President 
Berisha assured me that the Greek minority in Albania will be 
treated according to the international norms. I want to add 
that any reference to the "minority zones" in the law will not 
be in conformity with the norms. 
  Minister Serreqi said we regret that for the second time the 
Greek parliamentary members has disinformed the European 
Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. They have prejudiced a normal penal case giving to it a 
political aspect. 
  In regard with the economic relations with the EU, Mr. 
Serreqi mentioned the main fields of cooperation. Our desire, 
Mr. Serreqi said, is that the EU extend the cooperation with the 
three seas, the Adriatic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Aegean Sea 
which are very important for all the countries. 
  Speaking of the political reforms in Albania, Minister 
Serreqi said the democratic forces have made important steps 
toward the establishing and consolidating a pluralist democracy, 
a legal state and a full respect for the human rights. 
  As important parts of the reforms in Albania Mr. Serreqi 
mentioned the new orientation of the Albanian foreign policy 
which broke the fatal isolation, the establishing and developing 
the market economy, the wide privatization process, the army 
restructuring and taking it under the civilian control and the 
deep reform in the state administration. Regarding the law on 
education, Mr. Serreqi said it will soon pass to the parliament 
and the Greek minority will be treated in conformity with the 
international norms. 
  Concerning the Yugoslav crises, the both sides repeated 
their 
known approaches expressed recently in the Vienna consultations. 
The Greek side said that the NATO decision for air strikes will 
bring about nothing positive for stopping the war and even it 
will cause another conflict in Kosova or in another state. 
  The Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi presented a wide 
expose 
of the Albanian approach toward the crises in region, stressing 
the special position of Albania not only for the fact that 
Albania is a bordering country with the country of the crises 
but also because the Albanians in Kosova, who make up the half 
of the Albanian nation, are cruelly being maltreated. Mr. 
Serreqi said Albania is in favour of the NATO ultimatum which 
not only would establish the authority of the international 
community but also because the Yugoslav crises has created a 
dangerous situation which should be avoided. 
  "We are suffering because of the sanctions but we insist 
that 
the sanctions should continue until the situation in Kosova will 
be improved. Kosova should be under the international presence 
to make possible the starting of the dialogue whose basis must 
be the charter of the 1974 Constitution. The present tragic 
situation showed that the dividing of Bosnia was not a proper 
option to stopping the war. The option doesn't offer peace not 
for Bosnian nor for the countries in the region. The 
international community should find a proper and acceptable 
solution for all the sides. 
  After the meeting, the Albanian and Greek foreign ministers 
held a press conference.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- "NATO Aircraft Refuel 
at Sofia," runs a front-page headline in the KONTINENT daily. 
Citing a well-informed source, the paper says that "in the dead 
period between 0200 and 0400 hours, NATO cargo planes refuel at 
Sofia Airport." A Hercules plane was reportedly seen too. 
According to the publication, people living in the 
neighbourhoods around the airport have confirmed they have been 
disturbed by "the unbearable noise of turbo-prop engines" for 
two weeks now. An anonymous air traffic control expert 
monitoring military and civil aircraft is cited as saying that 
refuelling at Sofia Airport does not run counter to any 
international agreement. He added that NATO found it less 
expensive to refuel planes in Sofia, rather than at other 
airports in the Balkans. There is no information about defence 
supplies being loaded on NATO planes, Captain Tsvyatko Donchev, 
head of the Defence Ministry Press Centre, told the paper. 
According to KONTINENT, he neither denied nor confirmed the 
reports about refueling NATO aircraft. Sofia Airport Director 
General Khristo Donchev pointed out that no military or civil 
airplane could land without permission by the Transport 
Ministry's Civil Aviation Department. Kerosene tanks are 
allowed entry only if accompanied by documents permitting it, he 
is cited as saying. Mr. Donchev has no information about such 
documents having been issued. "The silence of the Foreign 
Ministry and the institutions concerned with the refueling of 
NATO aircraft could be explained by Bulgaria's joining the 
Partnership for Peace Plan, the framework document of which was 
signed by President Zhelyu Zhelev the day before yesterday at 
NATO Headquarters in Brussels," the paper writes in conclusion.

unbearable," thus confirming the information of an unnamed

  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- This morning Prof. Dr. 
Rita Suessmuth, president of the German Bundestag, had a meeting 
with President Zhelyu Zhelev. She arrived here yesterday [15 
February] to receive the doctor honoris causa degree of the St. 
St. Cyril and Methodius University of Veliko Turnovo 
(northcentral Bulgaria). 
  We considered the problem of former Yugoslavia sharing the 
opinion that NATO's ultimatum is absolutely necessary because 
the bloodshed there must be stopped and because it is high time 
that the international community prove it can really do 
something to save the civil population, Prof. Suessmuth told 
reporters at the Sofia Airport before her departure. 
  Prof. Suessmuth and Dr. Zhelev discussed Bulgarian-German 
relations. After the meeting President Zhelev told reporters 
that Germany's economic presence in Bulgaria should be felt 
stronger. Germany can do this using the potential of its large 
companies, Dr. Zhelev said. Bulgaria's hope was expressed at 
the meeting that Germany would show understanding for its wish 
to conclude a debt settlement agreement with the London Club the 
soonest possible. 
  Meeting yesterday, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and 
National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov considered the 
situation in ex-Yugoslavia and the possibilities of expanding 
German investments in Bulgaria.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] 
The NATO decision in Brussels for air strikes in Bosnia exceeds 
the mandate the Security Council has granted the North Atlantic 
Organization. This is Russia's stand set forth by Russian 
Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev at a meeting with National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. Mr. Avdeyev told journalists that 
he raised the issue of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Russia's stand on NATO's ultimatum to the warring sides. The UN 
Security Council has authorized NATO to use force only if UN 
troops are attacked, Mr. Avdeyev said. The tragedy in Sarajevo 
did not affect NATO troops but nevertheless the NATO Council 
issued an ultimatum to the warring sides and threatened with air 
strikes. If air strikes are to be used then it is necessary for 
the UN Security Council to extend a new mandate to NATO. 
Russia's stand is that in principle the possibility of air 
strikes should not be excluded. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, February 15 (BTA) -- Today the two main 
political forces in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Socialist (formerly 
Communist) Party (BSP) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) 
announced their stand on the possible airstrikes in Bosnia five 
days before the expiry of NATO's ultimatum. Both the BSP and 
the SDS are for a policy of non-involvement of the Balkan states 
in the conflict. 
  BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva told BTA that the NATO 
ultimatum is rather a preventive measure and it will hardly come 
to actual air strikes. "We do hope that it will work... I 
think that in reality it won't come to air strikes," she said. 
When asked about the BSP's position in case it comes to air 
strikes after all, Ms. Ananieva answered that she hoped "the 
military had considered all possibilities." Today Ms. Ananieva 
met with Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov to discuss the 
Yugocrisis and other issues. She emphasized the unchanged stand 
of the BSP against any sort of involvement, be it direct or 
indirect, of the Balkan states in the conflict. 
  "SDS believes that the Balkan problems should be regarded as 
European problems and it should not be left to the Balkan states 
alone to find the way for their settlement, as they could be of 
great international and geopolitical significance," Filip 
Dimitrov told the press today. SDS is positive that the 
international institutions, military ones included, need to 
commit themselves to the settlement of Balkan problems. "We all 
hope the problems will be solved in a peaceful way but if it 
proves impossible, they are the ones to determine the most 
effective means to put an end to the bloodshed and the expansion 
of the conflict," he added. "In a situation like this Bulgaria 
cannot dodge responsibility," he said, pointing out the SDS's 
conviction that the Balkan states' direct involvement might have 
grave consequences. "This is precisely the reason why we insist 
on international institutions' intervention," said the leader of 
the Union of Democratic Forces. He also criticized the 
Bulgarian Government for lacking a clear stand on the impending 
strikes in Bosnia.

  [Text] Sofia, February 15 (BTA) -- The Ministry of 
Transport is going to adopt stern measures against embargo 
busting, Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov told a news 
conference today. There have been embargo busting attempts 
involving railway employees and border guard members, Minister 
Ermenkov said, adding that the cases were reported by anonymous 
informers. "It is our ambition to guarantee the prevention of 
any attempts to violate the embargo," the minister said. 
  The measures which the Transport Ministry is planning to 
implement are specified in a special report which will be 
presented to the Sanctions Committee. 
  An organization is set up by special order to exercise 
control at the border checkpoints, it comprises representatives 
of the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Finance and the 
Ministry of the Interior. Besides, it is planned to handle 
cargoes only in daytime, the cargo handling will be monitored by 
operative groups. 
  Bulgaria is ready for transit shipments across the territory 
of ex-Yugoslavia, Minister Ermenkov said. However, having in 
mind the complicated situation in Bosnia, such shipments will be 
effected in the last resort.

  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- Goods, vehicles and 
foreign currency assets worth 50,882,919 leva were detained at 
Kalotina Border Checkpoint in 1993 in compliance with the UN 
Security Council resolutions on sanctions against the former 
Yugoslavia. Some 361,235 litres of diesel oil, 171,712 l of 
petrol, and 6,863 l of industrial oil were detained. 
  These figures were released at a meeting of the Government 
Commission on UN Sanctions Against Serbia and Montenegro last 
night. The Government Press Office told BTA that the Customs 
Chief Department referred to the Prosecutor's Office 13 attempts 
at sanctions violation. Seventy-two criminal-administrative 
proceedings were initiated. 
  Reports on sanctions enforcement were made by Deputy Finance 
Minister Khristo Kulishev, head of the Customs Chief Department, 
Deputy Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov, and the secretary 
of the Interior Ministry Petko Angelov. They said investigators 
and the Prosecutor's Office had studied material on attempted 
violations provided by the Interior Ministry. 
  The Commission on Sanctions heard a joint order of the 
ministers of the interior, finance and transport, dated February 
2, introducing additional measures for strict sanctions 
enforcement. All wagons bound for Serbia and Montenegro must 
stop at Dragoman Station and the shipping documents must be 
submitted for inspection in the daytime, says the statement of 
the Government Press Office. 
  The commission assigned the competent authorities to 
establish the culprits in all cases of embargo busting. 
  The commission discussed a draft decree amending Council of 
Ministers Decree No. 90 of 1993 on Bulgaria's implementation of 
Resolution 820 of the UN Security Council. The amendment 
regulates a package of control measures in transit shipments 
across the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro). 
  Land transit shipments across the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia can take place only in the presence of a special 
permit issued by the UN Sanctions Committee. Such shipments 
will take place along the route Kalotina-Nis-Belgrade-Novi 
Sad-Subotica-Tompa Roeske and back in convoys of 10 to 15 
vehicles. Following customs inspections, the vehicles shall be 
sealed and those with constructions inappropriate for sealing 
shall not be allowed to leave the customs territory of the 
Republic of Bulgaria, after which the vehicles are weighed, 
their documents are stamped showing their exit gross weight and 
on the basis of the transit permit the customs authorities shall 
issue a one-time validity sticker handed to the person in charge 
of the transit shipment. The monitors approved by the Sanctions 
Committee shall report to the Sanctions Assistance Mission upon 
the completion of the shipment. 
  Mr. Kiril Velev, deputy minister of trade and head of the 
Working Group for Measures Alleviating the Negative Consequences 
of the Yugo-Sanctions, reported on the participation of 
Bulgarian companies in humanitarian deliveries to the FRY. A 
total of 4,416 applications for humanitarian export have been 
filed by Bulgarian companies since the UN resolution came into 
force (May 1993), of which 2,260 applications by 558 Bulgarian 
companies were approved. The humanitarian deliveries by 
Bulgarian companies amount to U.S.$7.193 million. Goods 
estimated at U.S.$21 million were exported till the beginning of 
December.

<F P=106> [Andrey Sharkov report: "New Program for Military </F>
Cooperation Between Bulgaria and Greece"] 
  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- Bulgaria and Greece 
hold identical positions on the conflict in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian 
General Staff, and his Greek counterpart, Admiral Khristos 
Limberis, told the press today after signing a Programme for 
Bilateral Military Cooperation in 1994. Admiral Limberis is the 
head of a Greek military delegation which is on an official 
visit here at the invitation of General Petrov. 
  A diplomatic settlement of the Yugocrisis is the most 
effective one, Admiral Limberis said. The two countries share 
the view that all Balkan countries should refrain from military 
intervention in the conflict, such intervention would be against 
the interests of the region, he said. 
  The signing of the programme comes as proof of the excellent 
state of Bulgarian-Greek relations in the military area, Admiral 
Limberis said after the ceremony. The document opens up new 
prospects for broader cooperation, which would be to the mutual 
benefit, he added. Now that Bulgaria has signed the Partnership 
for Peace plan, there is one more challenge and reason for 
cooperation, he said. The programme envisages that joint 
exercises will have a new content, including purely peacetime 
and rescue operations, the guest said. The expansion of 
cooperation will serve the cause of peace, Admiral Limberis 
stressed. From this corner of Europe, Bulgaria and Greece are 
sending a message for peace dialogue, if the climate created by 
them spreads to the other Balkan countries, it would be very 
much for the good of the Balkan nations, Admiral Limberis said. 
  The 1994 joint action plan is fully consistent with previous 
documents on friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and 
Greece, as well as with the military agreement signed by the two 
Defence Ministers, General Lyuben Petrov said after the signing 
of the programme. Military contacts between Bulgaria and Greece 
after the fall of the totalitarian regime in this country in 
1989 have been regulated by a cooperation agreement between the 
two Defence Ministries signed in Athens in 1991. Greece was the 
first NATO member with which Bulgaria signed a document on 
military cooperation. The new programme is also consistent with 
the documents of 1992 and 1993 adding new confidence and 
security-building measures to those envisaged in the Vienna 
Document of 1992, it is also consistent with NATO's Partnership 
for Peace plan, General Petrov said. The programme will 
undoubtedly be implemented and will promote security along the 
Bulgarian-Greek border, as well as stability in the region as a 
whole, General Petrov said. 
  Work on programmes for cooperation between the Defence 
Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece began in 1992, the press 
learned from Lieutenant-Colonel Stefanov, head of the 
Information and Military Contacts Department of the Office of 
the Chief of the Bulgarian General Staff. This is the third 
document, it is of a practice-oriented nature. The training of 
Bulgarian Air Force pilots in Greece for rescue operations at 
sea, which started three years ago, is a priority for Bulgaria. 
Contacts in different areas have developed. Military units 
have exchanged visits. There is steady cooperation in military 
training. Bulgarian experts have been training Greek military 
officers and noncommissioned officers to operate the Osa missile 
system and BMP-1 armoured personnel carriers handed over by the 
army of what was formerly East Germany, said Lieutenant-General 
Stefanov.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec said today he believed that in view of the NATO 
Council's decision about possible air strikes in Bosnia the 
Czech Republic should at least symbolically stand by its allies. 
  It is impossible to speak about NATO countries as of 
potential partners and allies and in a situation when they have 
to take a complicated decision to distance itself from them, 
Zieleniec told the Czech Television station NOVA. 
  He said not only air strikes were concerned but an ultimatum 
that should lead to separation of the warring sides. "Sarajevo 
is a town experiencing awful sufferings, the town which is being 
strangled. I believe this action could lead to Sarajevo being 
relieved and that is why I support it," Zieleniec said. 
  On February 10, the NATO Council approved a communique 
giving 
a ten-day ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs and Muslims to withdraw 
their heavy weapons and put them under UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Force] control, otherwise they would be subject to 
air strikes.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- Czech dailies today 
highlight Czech political leaders' differences of opinion on the 
NATO ultimatum issued to Bosnian Serbs and on possible aerial 
attacks against them. 
  President Vaclav Havel has supported the possible attacks, 
while Premier Vaclav Klaus was opposed to them and said on 
Monday [14 February] that he was "fully" convinced that NATO 
would not launch any attacks in Bosnia. 
  In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Jiri Leschtina writes 
under the title "The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy" that 
the ultimatum has once again laid bare "the insufficient 
coordination of stances pronounced by the president, premier, 
and head of diplomacy (Josef Zieleniec)." 
  "At the moment when NATO made the decision the president and 
foreign minister were thousands of kilometers away on a state 
visit (to India). But this was by no means a reason for the 
premier to speak in Prague about the Czech Republic's fear of 
outside intervention in Bosnia, followed by the president in 
Bangkok expressing his satisfaction with the North Atlantic 
Alliance's "baring its teeth." 
  "Given the present level of technology, what prevented 
Vaclav 
Havel, Vaclav Klaus, and Josef Zieleniec from coordinating their 
vocabulary?," Leschtina asks. 
  He says that this was probably the "old well-known grating" 
between the president, premier, and foreign minister, "which has 
already produced the premier's and foreign minister's different 
stances on the creation of a commission to negotiate with the 
Sudeten Germans, and on the shoot-out between Vaclav Klaus and 
Vaclav Havel over Rushdie's visit." 
  Leschtina says that these were only matters concerning the 
Czech Republic and its neighborhood, but warns that "the Czech 
state cannot afford differences of opinion between its president 
and premier on the possible bombardment of a not remote European 
country." 
  "There exists a mechanism (for leaders) to use the same 
vocabulary: the Council for Foreign Policy Coordination, whose 
existence was advocated by Zieleniec and which comprises the 
president, the premier, the foreign minister, the heads of the 
coalition parties, and other officials. But it has met only 
once since November. Now, during one of Europe's most fatal 
moments, it has a good opportunity to prove its viability," 
Leschtina stresses. 
  In the left-orientated RUDE PRAVO Robert Dengler writes that 
"however much Klaus may now be repeating that his and the 
president's stances differ only in emphasis, the premier's 
attitude last week was unequivocal: Not to bombard, because it 
would be unfair to the people, producing only further massacres 
and disasters. In fact there was no difference in emphasis, but 
the two attitudes are entirely different." 
  "The ensuing confusion around clarification of the real 
official stand (on such a serious matter as the war in the 
Balkans), can eventually threaten the credibility of figures 
(?individual) and create the impression that not even statements 
by constitutional officials are reliable," Dengler stresses. 
  In the right-oriented daily TELEGRAF Martin Danes writes: 
"The fact that keeping a certain distance from the conflict does 
not improve, to say the least, the Czech Republic's fame abroad, 
has probably been comprehended even by Foreign Minister 
Zieleniec, who had rather espoused the premier's stance at the 
beginning. Zieleniec's silence during the president's (Asian) 
trip, on which he accompanied him, amounts to agreement with his 
views." 
  The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY asked Jiri Payne, 
chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, to comment on 
the differences. Payne, a member of the Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS), of which Klaus is the chairman, said: "If Vaclav Klaus' 
view on such a serious matter differs from that of another 
important constitutional official, he must have his own reasons 
for this. But the difference need not be essential. Each of 
them has different information.... It does not mean that he who 
resolutely supports a solution by force has more morals than he 
who hesitates. It is simply a question of weighing the pros and 
cons. I personally do not feel that I have enough information 
to take a clear-cut stance." 
  The chief of staff of the Czech Army, Jiri Nekvasil, told 
LIDOVE NOVINY that "to advise NATO whether or not to launch 
aerial intervention in Bosnia would not be correct, the more so 
because the Czech Air Force would not take part in the attack. 
I can only confirm that the armies of the alliance have 
equipment which can precisely hit selected targets... But the 
question must be asked what would follow."

  [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliamentary 
Agricultural Committee sent a letter to its Slovak counterpart 
body today requesting that it push for the cancellation of the 
requirement that food products imported into Slovakia carry a 
Slovak quality certificate. 
  Slovakia introduced the requirement unilaterally and with 
only one day's notice on February 11. 
  In the letter chairman of the Czech Parliamentary 
Agricultural Committee Jan Cerny told Pavel Koncos that the new 
measure "quite clearly discriminates against Czech exporters of 
food products." 
  The move also seriously interfered with the functioning of 
the customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, he 
said, because the quality norms of both countries were the same 
and because the basis of any customs union was mutual 
recognition of the other state's laboratory analysis and 
certification. 
  Cerny stated that he hoped the Slovak Parliamentary 
Agricultural Committee would contribute to the requirement being 
revoked or to the drawing up of an agreement in the interests of 
preserving the customs union.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- Slovak Finance Minister 
Julius Toth will make a statement in the near future confirming 
that the Slovak customs authorities recognize quality 
certificates issued in the Czech Republic as they did before 
February 11, when the Slovak measure under which all food 
exporters, including Czechs, were required to produce a quality 
certificate at the Slovak border, came into effect. 
  This was announced at a news conference of Slovak Economics 
Minister Jan Ducky and chairman of the Council of the 
Czech-Slovak Customs Union following its extraordinary session 
today. The conference was attended by six Czech and Slovak 
ministers. 
  Both sides will meet before March 31 to iron out an 
agreement 
of the individual criteria which Slovak quality certificates 
must meet in the Czech Republic, and vice versa. 
  The ministers said only one percent of their countries' 
mutual trade still needed to be coordinated at the future 
meeting, because for the other 99 percent of goods the 
certificate question had already been resolved. 
  The Czech representatives at the meeting had requested the 
Slovak Customs Administration reconsider its decision to require 
the certification of all imported goods by domestic inspectors. 
Czech Agriculture Minister Josef Lux informed reporters of the 
Czech contingents' intentions before the meeting.

  [Text] Prague, February 15 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliament 
today approved a government bill whereby the Czech Republic 
accedes to the Vienna Agreement of 1963 on civic and legal 
responsibility for nuclear damage, and to the joint protocol on 
the validity of the Vienna and Paris Agreements. 
  The agreements contain the legal regulation of 
responsibility 
for nuclear damage in countries which already have the relevant 
legislation. Their aim is the creation of an international 
system of responsibility and harmonization of nuclear 
legislation, and a system offering the public protection and 
ensuring fast and effective compensation to those damaged. 
  Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy (ODA) said that 
acceding to the agreement would, among other things, eliminate 
the possibility of international conflicts. 
  The Vienna Agreement, concluded on May 21, 1963 is open to 
all UN states, and has 19 members. The Paris Agreement, valid 
as of April 1, 1968, associates 16 states. The two agreements 
have fundamentally the same principles, but differ in their 
wording in some places. They also differ as to the amount 
payable for damages.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian Parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday [16 February] held a 
closed session and discussed the use of Hungarian airspace by 
NATO's AWACS aircraft. 
  Members of the committee, which included Foreign Affairs 
State Secretary Andras Kelemen, made it clear that the issue at 
hand is not that the Hungarian Government had decided to exclude 
the AWACS from Hungarian airspace, but rather that it calls the 
attention of Brussels to the original mandate of the air 
missions, in accordance with the Constitution. If NATO wants 
the mandate to be expanded, that would require approval by the 
Hungarian Parliament. 
  Earlier, Hungarian Parliament gave its consent to the use of 
the country's airspace by NATO's AWACS aircraft, to fulfill 
their mission of monitoring the no-fly zone in Bosnia. 
  A new situation has now come about. In the wake of the 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, the AWACS aircraft may also 
serve military missions. In view of this, Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross recently told a group of foreign 
journalists that the AWACS mission would have to leave Hungarian 
airspace during NATO air strikes against Serbian positions at 
Sarajevo. 
  There is consensus among the Hungarian parliamentary parties 
that Hungary should refrain from participating in military 
actions.

  [Text] Budapest, 15 Feb (MTI) -- At the foreign affairs 
spokesman's news conference today, questions were asked 
regarding Hungary's policy toward Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister 
Peter Boross's recent statement that NATO's AWACS planes were 
authorized to use Hungarian airspace only for the purpose of 
peacekeeping. Spokesman Janos Herman was asked if this implied a 
change in Hungarian foreign policy and if Brussels had reacted 
to Boross's statement. 
  "The prime minister's statement was not a novelty," the 
spokesman said. "Hungary previously informed its NATO partners 
that the AWACS are only allowed to operate in Hungarian airspace 
under the Hungarian Parliament's mandate." 
  The spokesman said that NATO had not made any formal 
reaction 
to Boross's statement. "Brussels seems to be aware that in the 
interest of both this region and NATO, Hungary should not play 
even an indirect role in any offensive manoeuvre. The Hungarian 
Government's position is identical to that of parliament," 
Herman said. 
  The spokesman said that a hypothetical situation was at 
issue 
and expressed the hope that the action would not take place at 
all and the Bosnian serbs would fulfil NATO's demands. 
  Herman added that Hungary and NATO were in constant touch 
with one another, also for reasons other than the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  Herman confirmed that Hungary would continue to take part in 
international efforts aimed at settling the Yugoslav crisis, and 
observe the decisions of the international community, including 
the U.N. Security Council embargo on Serbia and Montenegro. 
  "Since Hungary is a neighbour of Yugoslavia and a Hungarian 
minority exists in Vojvodina, its situation differs from that of 
the countries located further from this region. As a 
consequence, Hungarian diplomacy faces a twofold task. First, 
it should make it clear that it has invariably made every effort 
to settle the situation. Second, it should enforce Hungarian 
interests within appropriate frameworks. The two goals do not 
contradict each other. Its basic stance is unchanged but the 
reactions may differ pending the changing situation," the 
spokesman said. 
  "Budapest will not initiate any easing, suspending or 
lifting 
of sanctions. All the more so because others have already made 
that initiative and set concrete terms which Hungary backs," 
Herman said. 
  "Hungary wants to see a solution found, and peace restored 
in 
Yugoslavia," Herman said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 15 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk called WASHINGTON POST's report that Poland had 
sold arms to U.S. in the 1980s a provocation. 
  Commenting on the WASHINGTON POST's article in the TV 
evening news bulletin "Panorama" on Tuesday, Kolodziejczyk said: 
"I have reasons to believe that this is merely a big provocation 
against the Polish Army and, perhaps, not only that." 
  The U.S. paper wrote on Monday that Poland had sold Soviet 
arms, radars, tanks, torpedoes, and parts of anti-aircraft 
systems to the United States for about 150-200 million dollars 
during the 1980s.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 15 -- Poland, which is in the period of 
transition, needs a more efficient executive power, a more 
efficient rule, President Lech Walesa said Tuesday commenting on 
the differences within the government coalition. 
  "The period of transition calls for a greater efficiency of 
executive power and simultaneously, for a greater efficiency of 
legislative power. However, the latter should deal with laws 
and not with efforts to create a majority. The president 
proposes a prime minister and a government but this does not 
necessarily has [as received] to be a majority government or a 
government representing some party. The president proposes 
concrete persons," Walesa told PAP reporters. 
  When asked whether the system he proposes would not lead to 
excessive concentration of power, the president replied that 
"one can always criticize and have elections every six months 
instead of doing work." He upheld his opinion expressed after 
the September 1993 elections that the present parliament will 
not function long. 
  Walesa rejected the possibility of running in the future 
presidential elections as a candidate of the Polish right wing. 
He announced that he will decide during the next three or four 
months whether he will take part in the elections as a leader of 
a presidential bloc.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 16 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
met on Wednesday with coalition deputies and members of the Sejm 
budget committee to appeal to them to have a pragmatic stance on 
the cabinet amendments to the draft budget law and not to 
increase expenditure. Later on Wednesday the committee is 
expected to vote on the amendments. 
  Head of the Finance Ministry Henryk Chmielak told newsmen 
the 
cabinet was ready to present amendments to the budget law in the 
first half of the year, but the time would show the direction of 
changes. 
  "We are open to deputies' suggestions. We declared readiness 
to come to the parliament with corrections of the budget law in 
mid- 1994 if the premise on which deputies base a growth of 
incomes would be more justified and specified. It would be too 
early today to have any increases," Chmielak said. 
  Chmielak said that the deputies accepted the prime 
minister's 
explanation with understanding and added that the coalition 
would vote for the cabinet version of the budget. 
  Next, Chmielak said possible talks concerning his 
appointment 
as finance minister would be held after the return of leader of 
the Social Democratic Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski from 
Lillehammer.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 16 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
denied during a press conference on Wednesday that he was was 
planning to appoint a government press spokesman in the near 
future. Pawlak said the appointment of a finance minister would 
be discussed by the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance 
(SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL). 
  The prime minister said he was not planning to make any 
personnel changes in the Ministry of Privatization as recently 
"it considerably changed its style of work" and "the changes in 
its leadership were very profound." 
  Asked about appointments of coalition deputy ministers in 
the 
so-called presidential ministries, Pawlak said: "We are not 
priding ourselves on certain matters but there are some 
achievements." He also suggested that newsmen should 
concentrate on the functioning of these institutions and not on 
symbols. 
  Pawlak said that in case of possible amendments to the 
budget 
law in mid-1994, if incomes were bigger than planned, he would 
spend the money to animate the economy and on significant social 
goals, namely, social assistance and combatting unemployment. 
  When told that the decisions of the Sejm Budget Committee 
adopted on Wednesday were contradictory to his announcements of 
the "pro-social budget," Pawlak stressed that press reports on 
the cabinet amendments were incomplete. He also recalled that 
education, science and culture were planned to receive the 
biggest possible means. The prime minister also added that if 
it were not for the internal indebtedness, the state budget 
would be balanced. 
  While speaking about a Polish visit by the mission of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pawlak stressed that Poland 
fulfilled the conditions included in the agreement. He also 
added that the success did not depend on such agreements but "on 
the way we control social and economic processes in Poland."

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 15 -- Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski and his Moldovan counterpart Ion Botnaru, now on an 
official visit to this country, initialled on Tuesday a treaty 
on friendship and cooperation between Poland and Moldova. The 
two ministers also signed a protocol on mutual consultations 
between their ministries. Olechowski said that the treaty would 
be signed in the first half of this year during a Polish visit 
by Moldovan President Mircea Snegur. 
  The Polish foreign minister stressed that relations with 
Moldova -- like the ones with the neighbouring countries and 
kazakhstan -- were considered by Poland as top priority of the 
Polish foreign policy towards the states established after the 
break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  Olechowski added Poland wanted to help Moldova consolidate 
its presence on the international arena as it was security of 
"such states as Moldova" in which Poland saw a significant 
condition of its own security and favourable development of 
European relations. 
  The Polish foreign minister said Poland would open its 
embassy in Chisinau still this year. 
  Next, Olechowski said that during the Polish-Moldovan talks 
the two sides discussed the necessity to improve living 
conditions of the Polish minority in Moldova, to provide 
possibilities of learning the Polish language and to ensure 
Poles access to national culture. 
  The two sides also spoke about prospects of economic 
cooperation, especially between small and medium-sized 
enterprises. Botnaru said he hoped Moldova could make use of 
the Polish experience in introducing market reforms.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 16--Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski discussed the current 
priorities of the Polish foreign policy and the present 
situation in Poland during a meeting held Wednesday with 
ambassadors to the countries of NATO, the European Union and the 
European Free Trade Association (EFTA). 
  Pawlak stressed the need for Poland's increased effort to 
join western structures, and above all for intensified strivings 
for NATO and the EU membership. He also discussed the question 
of Poland's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme. 
  The prime minister confirmed in the presence of the 
ambassadors the Polish Government's guarantees for western 
investors and assured that the government would respect any 
agreements that were or will be concluded with them. 
  Foreign Minister Olechowski told newsmen that the two-day 
session of Polish diplomats will centre on the question of 
Poland's security and her closer contacts with the European 
Union which are crucial elements of the Polish foreign policy 
which the ambassadors attending the meeting will frequently have 
to deal with. 
  According to Olechowski, the meeting should help the 
ambassadors learn about the approach of the "state's top 
figures" to the problems of foreign policy. The foreign 
minister also said he expected information from the ambassadors 
on the existing possibilities in Poland's contacts with western 
countries.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/2/1994 -- The 24 unions 
composing the "Lignitul" Mining Unions Federation continued the 
general strike Wednesday, February 16. Vasile Chirculescu, 
deputy director-general of the Targu-Jiu Autonomous Public 
corporation told a ROMPRES coresspondent that in each of the 
three days of strike 100,000 tonnes of lignite and brown coal 
were extracted in each of the three coal field whose miners are 
on strike. The quantities sent to power stations during the 
strike stood at more than 90 percent of those supplied before 
the strike started. "The strike is not legal," said Chirculescu, 
"that's why we filed a lawsuit against the strikers' leaders and 
asked that the case be considered an emergency. The public 
corporation does not have enough money to solve the strikers' 
claims." 
  Coal power stations had around 2.4 million tonnes of coal in 
store Wednesday, February 16. The situation was critical at the 
stations Oradea 1 and 2, Suceava, Iasi and Arad, to which 
additional amounts of coal were sent.

the invitation of Romanian President Ion Iliescu. The 
delegation Tudjman was head of was seen at the Otopeni Airport

Melescanu. 
  The head of the Romanian diplomacy said that "to his mind, 
the visit was an extremely important moment in the relations 
between the two countries, an opportunity to show Romania's 
preoccupation to transfer the good relations it had with former 
Yugoslavia to all the republics created following the breaking 
of Yugoslavia. We are very satisfied with the discussions 
conducted here, we signed the first treaty with a country from 
former Yugoslavia and the exchange of views we had on the 
prospects of finding a solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia has 
been very interesting for us. We are very satisfied and we hope 
that will be a moment marking a speeding up of our ties with 
Croatia and with all the republics of former Yugoslavia."

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- "I consider my 
withdrawal from the government and the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) to be a mere technical problem," Slovak Foreign 
Minister Jozef Moravcik told journalists today. 
  He said he did not intend to leave the political life since 
he felt he shared responsibility for the appearance of the 
independent Slovakia. "I wanted Slovakia to become independent 
and contributed to this goal. I therefore cannot leave the 
political scene until a political structure capable of 
guaranteeing stability and prosperity for Slovakia is created," 
Moravcik said. 
  He said he expected new groupings to appear on the Slovak 
political scene in the near future and mainly a strong bloc of 
center-oriented parties. Moravcik said the HZDS had deflected 
from the central line and has been lately oriented towards 
radicalism. He said he was for central policy but declined to 
say which political party he would prefer. 
  Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar did not specify at any of 
government meetings his allegations that "the opposition is 
connected with financial circles," which were raised by him in 
the media, Moravcik said. On the contrary, a quick decision by 
the government on Tuesday [15 February] to put fifteen 
state-owned enterprises to direct sale testifies to Meciar's 
"genuine intention" to proceed with privatization in a honest 
way, Moravcik added ironically. 
  Commenting on his "voluntary walk-out" from a government 
session on Tuesday, Moravcik said that he and Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac were called upon by Meciar to leave the second part 
of the meeting, "if they are honest people," since it was 
dedicated to internal political situation.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament 
today rejected a government proposal that parliamentary 
elections in Slovakia be held in June. 
  69 deputies voted for the government proposal which 
reflected 
the will of a group surrounding Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar 
that elections are called as soon as possible. 49 deputies 
voted against the bill and 30 deputies abstained from voting. 
90 votes of the 150-member parliament were needed for the bill 
to be approved. 
  A deputies' proposal for calling early elections in November 
which reflects the stand of the opposition will be voted on 
tomorrow. 
  The Slovak opposition did not have enough strength today to 
push through a proposal to call early elections in November. 
However, further voting on the date for early elections is 
expected tomorrow. 
  The opposition proposal was not supported by deputies from 
the Hungarian minority parties which make their support 
conditional on providing to them guarantees that Hungarian 
ethnic minority demands will be met. 
  Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), 
the 
strongest opposition party in Slovakia, told journalists after 
voting that the date for parliamentary elections should be 
decided and an amended privatization law should be passed prior 
to speculation about a new government which would act until 
elections. 
  Parliament will continue its work tomorrow with a debate on 
an amended law on large privatization.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- If a government bill on 
calling early elections this June is not passed the collection 
of signatures for calling a referendum on early elections will 
start as of Monday, February 21, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar 
told parliament today. 
  350,000 signatures are required to call a referendum to 
decide whether or not early elections are held. After 
signatures are collected, the date of a referendum will be set. 
  "The government coalition of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) and part of the Slovak National Party (SNS) 
agree on the need for calling early elections given the unstable 
political situation in Slovakia," Meciar said. He said he did 
not understand why the opposition does not want to first hold 
parliamentary elections in June and only after them local 
elections in November, adding that this is the case when 
subjective party interests are being placed over the objective 
needs of the state. 
  Meciar said that it should be considered whether a 
proportional or a majoritarian system of election is introduced 
and whether to preserve the current one-chamber parliament or to 
create a two-chamber one. 
  Meciar said he supported the new election law which allowed 
ethnic minorities to be represented in parliament and believed 
that a paragraph about the so-called imperative mandates is 
included in the law to terminate the mandates of "turncoat" 
deputies. 
  Meciar called on deputies to vote in the "interests of the 
state" for the government bill on early elections and the 
shortening of the electoral term.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The basic difference 
between the government and deputies' bills on early elections 
lies in the date of the elections. While the government 
proposes to hold early elections in June, the deputies' bill 
envisages them on November 11-12. Both proposals will be 
discussed today. 
  The government bill proposes that parliament electoral term 
and the mandates of deputies elected to the now-defunct 
Czechoslovak Federal Parliament two years ago terminate by June 
30. It justifies shortening the electoral term and calling 
early elections by the fact that the current distribution of 
forces in parliament does not allow laws to be passed, as both 
the government coalition and the opposition have about 75 
mandates in the 150-member parliament. 
  According to the bill, early elections would cost about 150 
million crowns ($5 million). If parliamentary elections are 
held simultaneously with local elections the total expenditure 
would amount to 180 million crowns (some $6 million). About 100 
million crowns would be saved if parliamentary and local 
elections were prepared together, according to the government 
bill. 
  If the two strongest parliamentary parties -- the governing 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) -- failed to agree on the date for early elections 
and if the deputies' proposal was supported by the opposition 
and the government bill by representatives of the coalition 
(HZDS and part of the Slovak National Party, SNS) then nine 
votes of the "fresh dissidents" from the ranks of the HZDS could 
prove decisive. 
  Speculation has also appeared that deputies from the 
Hungarian minority parties -- the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles (Coexistence) movement -- 
could support the government proposal since they are sure of 
support from their voters irrespective of the current political 
situation in the country.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The constitutional bill 
of the Slovak opposition to hold early elections in November did 
not get the necessary three-fifths (90) of the votes in 
parliament today. 
  As a result, the date will be decided by referendum. A 
petition with at least 350,000 signatures is necessary to call a 
referendum. Premier Vladimir Meciar said he was ready to start 
collecting the signatures starting Monday [21 February]. 
  83 of 147 present deputies voted for the bill, while 49 were 
against and 15 abstained.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Though the present Slovak 
cabinet is "far from being recalled," Slovak President Michal 
Kovac already has a partial list of members of the broad 
coalition government expected to be appointed after the 
dismissal of Meciar's cabinet, the Czech independent daily MLADA 
FRONTA DNES quotes "a trustworthy source from Slovak opposition 
circles" as saying last night. 
  The new cabinet is to be headed by present Deputy Premier 
Roman Kovac, who is along with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik 
the main protagonist of the Alternative of Political Realism, a 
faction that recently emerged within the Meciar-led government 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the daily reports. 
  Michal Kovac is regularly informed of all agreements reached 
between the opposition parties (aimed at settling the current 
parliamentary crisis in Slovakia), the paper quotes the source 
as saying. 
  The Slovak opposition is convinced that Meciar's cabinet can 
be removed only after parliament approves the term of early 
parliamentary elections. 
  The paper quotes Slovak Ambassador to Prague Ivan Mjartan as 
saying at a meeting with businessmen in Brno, south Moravia, 
that he favored the creation of a broad coalition government in 
which top political leaders would be replaced by experts (as 
proposed by the Alternative). 
  Mjartan said he expected Slovak Parliament to pass no 
confidence motion on the government. However, if parliament 
admits the shortening of the electoral term, it would be no 
solution, since the HZDS would win the early elections again, 
MLADA FRONTA DNES quotes Mjartan as saying.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- In an article entitled "The 
Crisis of the Voter," Stefan Hrib comments in today's issue of 
the Czech independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY on the current 
situation in Slovakia, saying that the crisis is first of all 
the crisis of the Slovak voter. 
  The current crisis in Slovakia broke out last week when the 
balance of forces between the government and opposition parties 
reached the ratio of 75-75 votes. 
  "Since the summer 1992 election catastrophe (victory of 
Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), the 
Slovak parliament has been neither a decisive part of Slovak 
politics, nor even a relatively respected part," Hrib writes. 
  At present "the government has no support in the parliament, 
but the parliament is not capable of dismissing it." 
  "In this situation only two existing projects can solve `the 
crisis'. The project of the Slovak premier and the project of 
the political remainder of Slovakia," Hrib says. 
  If Meciar succeeds in calling a referendum to strip all 
deputies who have "betrayed" his movement of their mandates, 
Slovakia would be faced with one prospect -- "quick adoption of 
a law protecting the republic, repressive measures against 
Hungarian fellow-citizens, and the settling of accounts with 
`anti-Slovak' critics in court," Hrib writes. 
  The deputies whom Meciar would like to dismiss from 
parliament are one-time Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and seven 
of his followers who left the HZDS last march, and six deputies 
from the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) who have refused 
to obey Meciar. 
  "The opposition project... offers three alternatives -- 
first, to call early elections, second, to create a broader 
coalition without Meciar (this is almost within reach since the 
Alternative of Political Realism faction was created within the 
HZDS), and third, to form a union with Meciar (but according to 
the latest information the (post-communist) Democratic Left 
Party has refused to cooperate with Meciar)," Hrib says. 
  "Early elections would probably change practically nothing 
because according to polls, the present deputies would fill the 
parliament again. Meciar would again be the strongest, though 
less than now, and Weiss would again be decisive, maybe more 
than now. Generally speaking, post-election politics would 
duplicate the present exactly," Hrib stresses. 
  "An SDL coalition with Meciar would civilize the expressions 
of the new government, but would further deform economic policy 
towards leftist solutions: budgetary deficit, "controlled" 
inflation, and subsidies to state enterprises. In a certain way 
the Weiss-Meciar union would be the worst alternative for 
Slovakia. It would be a union of vulgar amateurism with the 
still living socialist illusion." 
  "The broader coalition without Meciar, which is almost 
certain (since Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy 
Premier Roman Kovac created the Alternative of Political 
Realism), will be a coalition between the right and the left, 
between nationalists and ex-communists, and their ideological 
opponents. The result will be a shapeless, internally chaotic 
coalition. Its discords and incapacity will necessarily result 
in early elections (the future coalition partners themselves do 
not deny this at all). The likely result of the elections is 
described above," Hrib points out. 
  "What Slovakia needs is neither a broader coalition without 
Meciar, nor a Meciar-Weiss union. Slovakia cannot be salvaged 
by new elections either. The only road towards healing Slovak 
politics leads paradoxically outside it -- it rests in the 
appearance of a new voter. Indeed, if there is a crisis in 
Slovakia, it is neither a crisis of the HZDS nor of the 
parliament or parties, but a long-lasting crisis of the Slovak 
voter," Hrib concludes.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government has 
recently annulled the agreement on non-visa contact signed by 
Czechoslovakia and the former Yugoslavia, CTK learnt today from 
a diplomatic source in Belgrade who did not wish to be named. 
  The source was not able to say whether the agreement, signed 
by two now defunct states, had been rescinded in order to make 
way for a replacement document or whether the move represented 
the introduction of visa requirement for certain republics of 
ex-Yugoslavia, as the Czech Republic has already done. The 
usually well-informed source believes the latter possibility 
more likely. 
  It is not clear which republics are concerned or when the 
new 
visa requirements will come into effect. 
  The Czech Republic introduced visa requirement for citizens 
of the new Yugoslav Republic (Serbia and Montenegro), and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on June 23 last year.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The requirement that 
food products imported into Slovakia have a quality certificate, 
introduced unilaterally last week, has been interpreted wrongly, 
director of the Customs Union Council (RCU) Secretariat Rudolf 
Besik told CTK today. 
  The measure is nothing new and not in conflict with 
legislation, Besik said. The problems that have resulted are 
due only to insufficient preparation. He said the measure could 
not influence Slovakia's trade balance. 
  Food products make up only 8 or 9 percent of total 
Slovak-Czech trade. The share food products have in the Czech 
Republic's trade surplus in the mutual balance of payments only 
amounts to 2.5 billion Slovak crowns, Besik reported. 
  An exceptional RCU meeting could, he said, decide on the 
recognition of the quality certificate which the Czech 
Agricultural and Food Inspectorate (CZPI) has been issuing. 
This could mean that Slovakia would drop its certificate 
requirement with regard to the Czech Republic, he said. 
  Besik said he did not know the location or date of the RCU 
extraordinary meeting, when asked to confirm Government 
Spokesman Ondrej Hanka's statement that the economics minister 
had been requested to convene the meeting for February 16. 
  Quality certification for the import of food products into 
Slovakia came into effect on February 11.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- If we do not want to 
endanger the state budget and thus the functioning of the Slovak 
economy and state finances, a connection between state bodies 
and the National Property Fund (FNM) must exist, Premier 
Vladimir Meciar told Slovak Television on Tuesday [15 February] 
evening. 
  The large privatization amendment which is to be dealt with 
by the parliament on Wednesday is neither the governmental nor 
opposition draft, he said. The two parties are in accord on 
everything except the personal union of a government member with 
the FNM. We are willing to make concessions, such as the 
finance minister not needing to be director of the FNM Board of 
Supervisors, he added. 
  If the government is to implement an economic policy, it 
must 
have money, and this is in the Fund, Meciar stated. The 
government provides companies with guarantees, and as more than 
half of the budget is based on these guarantees, the personal 
union between the government and the FNM is indispensable, he 
said. 
  The companies managed by the FNM owe some 2 billion Slovak 
crowns ($60.6 million) for taxes, Meciar said. 
  The struggle for personal union is no power struggle, it is 
a 
struggle for the efficient linkage and workability of the 
system, he added. 
  Wednesday's voting on the large privatization amendment will 
not be connected with a no confidence vote in the government, 
Meciar said. If the parliament passes a law which does not suit 
the government, the latter will return it in accordance with the 
Constitution through President Michal Kovac to the parliament, 
he concluded.

Prishtina with Dr. Michael Venincer, the charge d'affaires of 
the Embassy in Belgrade, and Mr. Hejsek Joseph, the charge

the diplomats about the present situation in Kosova, which is 
aggravated as a result of the everyday repression. Mr. Rugova 
spoke also on the harsh economical and social situation there. 
  Mr. Rugova presented to the Austrian and diplomats the 
political project for an independent and neutral Kosova as a 
more optimal solution. He stressed the necessity of an 
international protectorate for Kosova as a transitory phase 
which will make possible the normalization of life and will 
create the necessary conditions for negotiations.

  Many personalities of the state, politics, and science who

human rights of the Helsinki Federation, the Kosova Information 
Centre reported. 
  The delegation intended to observe what has happened to the 
Albanians returned from Austria, Scandinavian countries and 
Germany. 
  Concerning the refusal of the Serbian authorities to go to 
Kosova, Ms. Christine von Kohl told BBC: "This time we received 
no answer." She explained how she had personally talked with 
the official in charge of so-called Yugoslav Embassy in Vienna. 
  Ms. von Kohl said one of the reasons for refusing the visas 
might be the fact that the Belgrade's authorities want to show 
they do not observe the CSCE norms as it recently happened with 
the Amnesty International.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "How Long Will We Ignore the </F>
War in Bosnia?"] 
  [Text] The recent events in Sarajevo and the attitude of 
the international community have yet again caught Bulgaria 
unprepared for a proper reaction. 
  The situation is reminiscent of the well-known farce that 
happens every year, when the first snowfall takes the Sofia City 
Council by surprise. However, the difference is that the snow 
sooner or later melts, whereas the risk of war is drawing ever 
closer to our border. 
  The possibility of NATO launching air strikes in Bosnia 
perhaps represents the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national 
security in the last 50 years. It is claimed that National 
Intelligence Service Chief Brigo Asparukhov spoke these very 
words at the session of the National Security Commission the 
other day. It is alleged that he even admitted that President 
Zhelev's stance on the question of NATO attacks in Bosnia has 
undergone a 180-degree change. 
  One could read this claim in yesterday's issue of DUMA. 
However, the president, the prime minister, and the chairman of 
the National Assembly maintain an official silence. U.S., West 
European, and East European politicians vie with each other in 
making statements and giving interviews, while the omnipresent 
CNN turns the tragedy in Sarajevo into a live television show. 
In Bulgaria, there is silence, except for two statements made 
by the president on the Bulgarian media on Sunday evening [13 
February], in which he described the Sarajevo tragedy merely as 
an "incident." 
  Zhelev found himself in a spot when he received Demirel's 
personal letter. It is thought that the Turkish president 
wanted nothing less that support for the NATO air strikes. They 
might at least publish this letter, to let us know what is 
expected of us. Alas, such a policy of openness on issues on 
which a consensus is well-known to exist is a practice that has 
been alien for our statesmen since time immemorial. 
  Instead of this, Ms. Yuliya Gurkovska is now concocting Dr. 
Zhelev's reply to his Turkish counterpart. We will probably 
learn the contents of this letter from the next laconic 
statement that emanates from the Presidential Press Center. 
Once again, rumors and guesses are rife. Once again, the 
members of parliament will wonder whether they are being 
sidelined when issues of national security are decided. 
  We have reached the point where Nikolay Slatinski, chairman 
of the Parliamentary National Security Commission, also had to 
sit down and write a letter to the president to remind him of 
what our position on the Bosnian conflict has been so far and to 
raise the alarm that a wave of militarism is developing that may 
engulf Bulgaria as well. 
  Please excuse me, gentlemen politicians and statesmen, but 
against the background of a possible NATO intervention close to 
our borders, everything else should be secondary, no matter how 
important it may seem. The various ballots, disputes, gang 
wars, cabinet shuffles, and so on are nothing in comparison with 
the trial to which we are subjected by the decision of a 
military-political bloc that some people want us to join as soon 
as possible, although it is far from clear whether they want us. 
  We should now learn a lesson from the other Europeans who 
are 
still not members of NATO and openly declare our official 
position, and at the highest level, instead of letting various 
deputy defense minister hint that limited air strikes will not 
directly threaten our national security. Does Defense Minister 
Valentin Aleksandrov think so, too? 
  We must put an end to the lack of coordination in our 
foreign 
policy. A good opportunity for this is presented by President 
Zhelev's forthcoming visit to Brussels, where he is to sign the 
document by which Bulgaria will join the Partnership for Peace 
initiative. 
  We hope that when in Brussels, he will express the country's 
unanimous view that partnership means cooperation in the name of 
peace, not war, and that Bulgaria will preserve its neutrality 
as regards what is happening on the territory of our western 
neighbor. 
  Otherwise, it may turn out that the snow has again caught us 
by surprise, with the difference that the prospects of the 
spring coming will be indefinitely postponed.

  [Text] In connection with certain articles carried by 
today's dailies, which he described as putsch interpretations, 
Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] 
National Coordinating Council, issued a declaration that was 
disseminated by the SDS Press Center. 
  The adoption of a law according to which high-ranking 
judiciary posts -- from chairmen of Okrug Court and okrug 
prosecutors upward -- become a unique monopoly of the former 
Communist Party is not a mere act of recommunization or a normal 
loss of the opposition in a normal parliament, but an overt 
communist counterrevolution. 
  It is true that there is still a long time until the law 
comes into force, thus the opinion of the leadership of the SDS 
parliamentary faction that there is a sufficient reason for the 
faction to remain in the parliament is acceptable. 
  On the other hand, when we declare that we will not accept 
this law it must be clear that we are serious. 
  The SDS chairman's walkout of the parliament, with the total 
support of the parliamentary faction, could be a clear signal of 
our categorical readiness to react in a sufficiently sharp 
manner if the law comes into effect. Until then the 
parliamentary faction must continue its struggle, notes Filip 
Dimitrov. 
  Such an experience does not divide our faction but rather 
consolidates it. It does not split the SDS but rather shows 
that in our movement everyone accepts his responsibilities in an 
organized and consistent manner in accordance with the functions 
with which he has been entrusted. 
  I hope that in any event, after the Communists' dangerous 
move in the parliament, the SDS will exhibit a sufficiently 
mature and convincing reaction, states Filip Dimitrov, chairman 
of the SDS National Coordinating Council.

<F P=106> [Albena Shkodrova article: "Temporarily in Charge of the </F>
Macedonian Drama"] 
  [Text] It is one of the greatest pleasures to stick out 
your tongue at someone who has only to reach out in order to hit 
you, but is absolutely not in a position to do so. 
  Yesterday, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] had the opportunity of experiencing such a 
pleasure. 
  Macedonia kept its cool while the most irreconcilable 
opponents against its international recognition, namely the 
Socialists, won the elections in Greece. The Macedonians still 
remained calm when the Greeks withdrew from the UN negotiations 
about Macedonia because of the country's new name and flag. 
  When political circles in Athens threatened to close their 
country's borders with Macedonia, the ruling forces in Skopje 
briefly commented that this could not be serious. 
  When the EU member-countries, one after the other, 
established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, the Greek 
Minister of European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos started 
behaving like a drunken third class actor, getting on the 
Western powers' nerves. On that occasion Macedonia experienced 
a certain satisfaction which was hardly noticeable, nevertheless. 
  The confession of certain Greek diplomats who admitted that 
the dispute with Skopje is a lost cause for Greece was also 
accepted without any comment on the part of Macedonia. 
  The official recognition of Macedonia's sovereignty by the 
White House was the latest confirmation of the fact that 
Macedonian politicians are betting on the right card. 
  Since the very first day of its separation from former 
Yugoslavia Macedonia has been conducting a consistent policy 
aimed at winning the good will of the United States. This 
applies to all Macedonian political actions starting from a 
courageous minority policy, such as none of the Balkan countries 
dares to promote (as a matter of fact, the results followed in 
due time, and the police just managed to prevent an Albanian 
separatist conspiracy) to the Macedonian government's persistent 
and heroic struggle which was finally crowned by the stationing 
of a U.S. "blue helmets" contingent in the republic. 
  According to some political observers, certain actions of 
other Balkan countries, such as Bulgaria's refusal to allow U.S. 
nuclear arms to be deployed on its territory, and last but not 
least, the stubborn behavior of Greece, are positively 
contributing to Macedonia's good relations with the West. 
  Until yesterday Washington was the last hope for Athens. 
Since yesterday the U.S. is the strongest shield for the 
protection of Macedonia's independence. There is even more -- 
by the act of establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia 
the White House assumed the role of chief actor -- temporarily 
in charge of the Macedonian drama and reversed the positions. 
  Athens, which relied on its international contacts, on its 
traditional presence in West European affairs, and on its 
membership in the European international organizations, suddenly 
appears to be in a situation very similar to that described as 
international isolation. 
  Macedonia, whose government, until recently, used to 
complain 
about the Western countries' lack of interest and about the 
inconsistency of their behavior toward Macedonia, finally 
awaited the moment of sticking its tongue without any risk. As 
a matter of fact Macedonia did so yesterday by proposing to 
resume negotiations with Athens, with a somewhat offensive 
magnanimity.

  [Text] On 17 February President Zhelyu Zhelev received 
representatives of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion, who 
conveyed to him alarming details related to the financial 
situation of the Armed Forces. They demanded transparency and 
openness in reporting the budgets of the Army and the Ministry 
of Interior and insisted on decreasing the apparatus of the 
General Staff and the Ministry of Defense. The issue of 
restricting certain civil rights of the military in the Defense 
and Armed Forces Bill, which was adopted at the first reading, 
was addressed. 
  Those issues, President Zhelev said, will be placed on the 
agenda of the first meeting of the Consultative Council on 
National Security.

paper in Budapest writes. A BUDAPEST SUN reporter quotes the 
former American representative of the NATO military committee, 
who talked about this at a Washington conference. According to 
a NEPSZAVA article, Rudolf Joo, state secretary at the Defense 
Ministry, and Ivan Baba, deputy state secretary in the Foreign 
Ministry, also participated in the consultations, and they 
confirmed that Hungary asked for American antiaircraft missiles 
and radar equipment, as it is feared that the Yugoslav war might 
spread.

American antiaircraft missile system because of the growing

measures have been taken in connection with the UN ultimatum, 
which is to expire soon, and a possible NATO air strike in

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Deak, Hungarian Army chief of staff </F>
and nominee to the position of army commander, by Attila 
Zsoldos; place and date not given: "Damaged NATO Aircraft in 
Hungary?"] 
  [Text] The Defense Committee of the Hungarian parliament 
held a hearing for Lieutenant General Janos Deak and unanimously 
supported his nomination to the position of commander of the 
Hungarian Army. In the course of this hearing, among other 
things, Janos Deak declared that the leadership of the Hungarian 
Army should consider the situation in Bosnia and prepare for any 
possible consequences. 
  [Deak] If NATO intervention takes place in Bosnia, we will 
have to prepare to deal with a possible influx of refugees. It 
is also possible that allied combat aircraft might get damaged 
in the course of their action and will be unable to return to 
their base in Aviano in Italy, and it could happen that they 
land in Hungary. I am not thinking of the development of an 
armed incident along our southern border; this is in the 
interest of neither the Croats nor the Serbs, so there is no 
such danger. However, in the event of intervention, anything 
can happen and we must prepare for this. 
  [Zsoldos] From a military point of view, in your opinion, is 
intervention in Bosnia inevitable? 
  [Deak] Several versions are possible. It is possible that 
there will be no need for intervention, because the sides 
involved in the conflict fulfill the UN demands. If they only 
partially fulfill the demands, the armed conflict could still be 
called off. However, there is a chance of military intervention 
too. 
  [Zsoldos] If such intervention takes place, what measures 
should be taken along our southern border? 
  [Deak] In such a case, it is the task of the border police 
to "handle" the expected influx of refugees. The army should 
increase its radio surveillance so as to have a clear picture of 
the situation. 
  [Zsoldos] Have you worked out any special crisis management 
plan? 
  [Deak] No. The Hungarian Army would act in accordance with 
crisis management plan adopted by the late prime minister and 
the president of the republic two years ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz by Xavier </F>
Batalla in Budapest; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Batalla] Mr. President, 
four years ago, after the fall of the Communist regime, the 
Hungarians were enthusiastic about the West. Now, the Hungarian 
prime minister has referred to a five- or six-year period for 
joining the European Union (EU), but Community sources continue 
to speak of a longer delay. Could this stance create a critical 
attitude to the EU in Hungary? 
  [Goncz] I believe that the criticism must be placed in the 
background; first comes necessity. I agree with the prime 
minister -- namely, with the five- or six-year period for 
joining the EU -- but no one could say that what we have 
received is little. We never expected subsidies; rather, 
assistance to modernize our economy, and, in return, we offer 
the West a market. Unfortunately, because of the economic 
recession, this process is slower than expected. 
  [Batalla] Do you trust in the Spanish Government's support 
to join the EU? 
  [Goncz] It is absolutely essential. I am going to raise the 
matter (on the visit to Spain), but I am aware that I am 
knocking at an open door, because over the past two years there 
have been Spanish statements in favor of our stance. The 
reservations which may exist in Spain stem from agricultural 
issues, but the apprehensions seem to have diminished. 
  [Batalla] But while Hungary is seeking to open the EU's 
doors, those of NATO have been closed to it. How do you 
interpret the Partnership for Peace? Do you believe that it is 
a new Yalta, another division of Europe? 
  [Goncz] To put it in those terms is rather exaggerated. I 
do not believe that they wish to exclude us from NATO. There is 
a certain feeling of anxiety in NATO because it has not yet 
defined its role in the new European system, and I believe that 
it has become somewhat alarmed at the responsibility of coping 
with the security of so vast an area. Therefore the Partnership 
for Peace is a very important step to guarantee European 
security. 
  [Batalla] But do you believe that the aim announced by 
President Clinton of preventing another wall from being erected 
in Europe will be achieved in this way? 
  [Goncz] I hope so. 
  [Batalla] That is, you do not interpret the Partnership for 
Peace as a concession to Russia. 
  [Goncz] Obviously there are signs that, following the change 
which has occurred in Russia, the Western powers are trying not 
to provoke Moscow, and so the Russian attitude also influences 
NATO's decisons. It must not be forgotten that this part of 
Europe is an intermediate area between Germany and Russia, and 
if I say that Russia is neither Asia nor Europe but Russia, we 
have the responsibility of trying to attract Russia as close as 
possible to Europe, but in view of the internal situation in 
Russia, the central European countries' entry (into NATO) could 
be necessary at any time. 
  [Batalla] So do you fear Russian nationalism? 
  [Goncz] I do not fear nationalism, but I observe it with 
concern. However, I do not believe that it could stimulate 
Hungarian nationalism either on the right or on the left. I 
trust that the Russian process of change will continue. 
  [Batalla] But in Budapest there are those who believe that 
the Partnership for Peace is -- like 1938 (Munich), 1956 
(Budapest), and 1968 (Prague) -- further proof that the West is 
not prepared to die for central Europe. Do you agree with this 
opinion? 
  [Goncz] Thank God, now it (the West) does not have to die 
for these countries. And let me say that this criticism is made 
more frequently in the Western press than in the Hungarian press. 
  [Batalla] Then how do you explain Hungary's change of 
attitude to Serbia? Why has Budapest softened its attitude to 
Belgrade, as is clear from a visit by the Hungarian foreign 
minister, in return for guarantees concerning the Hungarian 
community of Voivodina? 
  [Goncz] The economic embargo against Serbia is costing 
Hungary a very great deal, and we have strictly observed the 
international sanctions. So far we have received over 70,000 
refugees -- many of them of Hungarian origin -- from Bosnia and 
Serbia. And from the practical viewpoint, we would not be 
opposed to easing sanctions, if the UN demands are accepted, 
because what they are doing is to increase the misery -- not 
resolving the military conflict. Nor must it be forgotten that 
around 400,000 Hungarians and around 200,000 Serbian refugees 
live in Voivodina (an autonomous region of Serbia). I believe 
that it could be of great assistance to Europe that the 
representative of the Hungarian minority in Voivodina negotiated 
with Serbian President Milosevic two weeks ago. And so I would 
not say that we are being softer but that we are in favor of 
talking. We will not act unilaterally as far as reviewing 
sanctions is concerned, but -- I emphasize -- this atttitude is 
a sign of change not only on Hungary's part but also on Serbia's 
part. 
  [Batalla] How could the Yugoslav conflict affect the issue 
of the Hungarian minorities outside Hungary? Do you deem 
possible a conflict with the neighboring countries in which 
Hungarian minorities live? 
  [Goncz] If by conflict you mean war, I do not believe so, 
but if you are asking whether we are concerned about the fate of 
these Hungarian minorities, we will indeed be concerned until an 
international agreement laying down each side's responsibilities 
is reached. 
  [Batalla] Does Budapest have any territorial claim to the 
regions with Hungarian minorities? 
  [Goncz] The history of Transylvania (Romania) or Slovakia 
cannot be understood without the Hungarians, who have lived 
there for 900 years. We do not wish to change the borders, but 
we want these minorities to be able to preserve their 
identities. Any minority is always a part of two systems -- the 
motherland and the country in which it lives. If we decide that 
Catalonia is a constituent element of Spain, Catalonia is 
obliged to have two kinds of loyalty -- to Spain and to 
Catalonia. As far as irredentism is concerned, 6 million 
Romanians and 2.5 million Hungarians live in Transylvania. 
Nobody can believe that we would want to have 6 million 
Romanians within our borders. 
  [Batalla] Hungary has experienced a major transformation 
since 1990. But, with a view to the elections on 8 May, polls 
indicate a strong advance by the Socialist Party (formerly 
communist). Do you believe that the social discontent of part 
of the electorate with the pace of change could benefit the 
former communists, as has happened in Lithuania and Poland? 
  [Goncz] We are talking about the Socialist Party, which was 
originally created by ex-communists who support reform, which 
currently identifies itself with social democracy, and which has 
for the last four years been working in parliament as a 
democratic party. But in any case, I believe that two 
possibilities could arise from the elections: either a 
conservative-liberal coalition or a socialist-liberal coalition. 
One thing is clear, and I can guarantee it: Hungary's 
positions on the economy and on foreign policy are not going to 
change in either case.

<F P=106> ["S.I."-signed report: "SZDSZ Criticism to Boross"] </F>
  [Text] The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] is 
thinking in terms of a new government, as opposed to the general 
view according to which Fidesz is ready, as an ally, to help the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] remain in government. Talking 
about the party's foreign policy ideas at a consultation on 15 
February, Jozsef Szajer, an Fidesz leader and the party's main 
foreign policy expert, used the term "in case of a government 
change." In addition to Szajer, the Foreign Affairs Association 
on 15 February also heard Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign affairs 
spokesman of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. 
  According to Szent-Ivanyi, Prime Minister Peter Boross went 
too far when he announced that NATO's AWACS flying radar 
stations will not be able to use Hungarian airspace during 
NATO's aerial attacks on Bosnia. Szent-Ivanyi approved of the 
prime minister's efforts to prevent Hungary from getting 
involved in the issue but, in his view, it would have been more 
appropriate to simply remind NATO of the Hungarian permit given 
to the AWACS planes (according to which they cannot be used for 
military activities) and he claimed that the possible withdrawal 
of the mandate of the AWACS places would have required 
parliamentary consent. 
  In connection with the Balkan crisis, Szajer said that 
Hungary's scope for maneuver is small, and an open debate on 
Hungarian policy has not developed. Szajer supported Budapest's 
restrained policy, "maintaining that we formerly supported more 
radical solutions," but he did not explain what kind of radical 
solutions he meant. Szajer said that Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky's January visit to Belgrade -- which has previously 
been criticized by Szent-Ivanyi and again in the Foreign Affairs 
Association on 15 February -- "was a step in the right direction 
but at the worst possible time," and he objected that no 
coordination had taken place before the visit. 
  The Foreign Affairs Association wanted to learn about the 
foreign policy concept of the two parties. It emerged from 
Szent-Ivanyi's and Szajer's report that Fidesz considers 
European integration as the main goal, while the SZDSZ's main 
goal is to improve relations with the neighboring countries. 
Szajer did not appear to be as unequivocal as Szent-Ivanyi in 
the issue that Hungary does not have territorial demands from 
its neighbors. Szajer revealed that if the situation had not 
been so acute at the time, then Fidesz possibly would not have 
voted in favor of the Hungarian-Ukrainian basic agreement (which 
states that the two countries will not have territorial demands 
against each other in the future either), because Fidesz was not 
fully satisfied with the passages on the protection of national 
minorities. 
  Talking about the foreign policy consensus, Szajer said that 
Fidesz does not intend to form a consensus with the extreme 
parties, and he mentioned the Hungarian Justice and Life Party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, leader of the Alliance </F>
of Free Democrats, SZDSZ, by correspondent Jozsef Barat in 
Budapest; date not given; from the "Foreign Political Observer" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Barat] [passage omitted] Where is consensus in 
Hungarian foreign policy, and where is there not consensus? How 
does the SZDSZ think we should represent our often-mentioned 
national interests in a different, more effective way? 
  [Szent-Ivanyi] [passage omitted] There are a few important 
areas where consensus among political parties has fractured -- 
primarily between the government and the opposition and the 
government and the SZDSZ. The most important is Hungary's 
foreign policy with its neighbors. In this field, we think that 
the Hungarian Government's policy has not achieved its aim. It 
could not effectively contribute to the improvement of the 
situation of Hungarians beyond the borders, while our relations 
with several neighbors have significantly deteriorated--which 
has served neither Hungary's interests nor the interests of 
Hungarians who live there. 
  Therefore, we have been proposing for more than a year to 
put 
this policy with our neighbors on a new basis, to reestablish 
balance between the protection of minority rights, the support 
of minorities, and bilateral ties. This is a point where 
revival is needed by all means. 
  We could not entirely agree with the government's security 
policy endeavors either. Fundamentally, of course, we agree 
that Hungary needs security, and it has to be found somewhere 
within the existing European structures. It has not been 
debated. However, the government has strongly concentrated on 
the acquisition of external guarantees. It would not have been 
wrong on its own, if they had managed to acquire these external 
guarantees--for example, NATO membership or a guarantee 
undertaken by NATO. It would have really contributed to 
Hungary's security. 
  Unfortunately, it was clear that NATO, the leading European 
countries, and the United States are not ready to give these 
guarantees. So it follows that we have to reconsider our 
security policy and lay emphasis on new elements--for example, 
in Hungary's foreign policy conduct, in our relations with 
neighboring countries, in Hungary's economic integration with 
European institutions and with European countries. 
  A rather strange debate has evolved about NATO membership. 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that all those who want 
Hungary to be a NATO member should vote for the MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum]. Gyula Horn, chairman of the socialists wants 
a referendum on the matter. In the meantime, it has became 
quite clear the NATO does not want to admit us at all. 
  [Szent-Ivanyi] As regards Jeszenszky's remark, I cannot 
consider it anything else but a campaign trick. [passage omitted] 
  Horn's opinion could be worth considering, but we are very 
far from a referendum for the time being. It would be 
ridiculous to hold a referendum about Hungary's joining NATO 
when NATO has no willingness to accept us. [passage omitted] 
  [Barat] In your view, what sort of policy should be followed 
in connection with NATO's role in Bosnia? 
  [Szent-Ivanyi] The truth is that Hungarian foreign policy 
has 
no clear line in this issue, and this confuses our partners. 
Earlier on, the Hungarian Government very resolutely took the 
position of urging strong intervention and tough sanctions. I 
think that this was a slightly stronger position than we should 
have adopted considering our special situation. [passage omitted] 
  Now, it seems as if Hungarian foreign policy has taken a 
different direction, thereby endangering the image of being 
reliable. Jeszenszky's visit to Belgrade and his statements 
there in connection with sanctions caused doubt regarding 
Hungary's political reliability. 
  The statements of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross about the 
AWACS planes are also similar. Boross wanted to formulate 
correct objectives but put it in a way that can be very easily 
misinterpreted. We have to bear in mind three objectives: 
First, we have to reassure the Hungarian public that Hungary 
will not get involved in a crisis. This is correct. 
  Second, it is worth making a gesture toward Belgrade, for 
the 
interests of the Hungarians living there require this. However, 
there is also a third objective, which has been ignored by both 
Jeszenszky and Boross. We wish to cooperate with the European 
organizations and the United Nations, and it is not expedient to 
confuse the image formed about us. [passage omitted] 
  If NATO wants to extend the original mandate it does indeed 
have to turn to us, to the Hungarian parliament and not to the 
prime minister, and the parliament has to make a decision. 
[passage omitted] 
  Let us not forget that the AWACS planes mean the first and 
only concrete military cooperation between Hungary and NATO. 
Since Hungary wanted the Partnership for Peace and expressed 
willingness for cooperation, it is a confusing signal that she 
wants to cancel the only existing cooperation, in fact, without 
any particular reason. 
  [Barat] Well, yes, but Partnership for Peace is not a war 
partnership, either in name or in content. 
  [Szent-Ivanyi] I agree. If NATO wants to transform this 
assignment to a warlike partnership, then NATO cannot oblige us 
to agree, and we must not accept it either.

  [Text] Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu 
held his weekly news conference at Cotroceni Palace today. 
Referring to the recent initiative of the Russian Federation, 
which, in the opinion of one of the journalists, has eased the 
situation in Sarajevo, Chebeleu said that our country salutes 
any action that leads to the calming down of the situation in 
that area and that supports the peace process. 
  Our correspondent, Sorin Croitorescu, reports that in the 
beginning of the news conference Mr. Chebeleu read out a 
statement referring to the arrest of a Craiova journalist, 
Nicolae Andrei [for having published two items allegedly 
offending President Ion Iliescu]. The statement says that the 
presidency has made no complaints incriminating that journalist, 
after which it notes that this is not a singular case in the 
Romanian press, despite the fact that one of the fundamental 
principles of democracy is the respect that ought to be shown to 
state authorities.

  [Text] At his office this afternoon Gorj County Prefect 
Gheorghe Marculescu met with mining trade union leaders Miron 
Cosma and Ilie Ciortan. He conveyed a message addressed by the 
Ministry of Industry to the Confederation of Mining Trade 
Unions, in which Industry Minister Dumitru Popescu agreed to 
receive a five-man delegation representing the Lignitul Mining 
Trade Union Federation at 1600 tomorrow. The two union leaders 
acknowledged the message and said that future labor action would 
depend on the outcome of these talks. 
  The Gorj County prefect told our correspondent that he 
expects the majority of the miners currently present in Targu 
Jiu to go home and await the results of the talks at the 
Ministry of Industry headquarters. 
  The strike organized in Targu Jiu by the Lignitul Mining 
Trade Union Federations proceeded today in a tense atmosphere, 
as the participants were expecting some message to come from the 
government or the Ministry of Industry, our correspondent Titus 
Stoichitoiu reports. The several thousand miners that went 
there from various mining units affiliated to this trade union 
federation alternated between the headquarters of the Brown Coal 
Mining Public Corporation and that of the Gorj County Prefect's 
Office, accompanying Miron Cosma, who by noon was joined by a 
group of mining union leaders from the Jiu Valley. 
  In the evening they told the miners that it had been agreed 
that tomorrow a four-man delegation of the Lignitul Mining Trade 
Union Federation, together with Ilie Ciortan, the chairman of 
the Jiu Valley Miners' Trade Union League, should go for 
negotiations to the headquarters of the Ministry of Industry. 
  The miners were disappointed by the news and requested that 
all of them go to Bucharest. However, they were calmed down by 
Miron Cosma, who said that it would be better to wait for the 
results of the negotiations. Thus, they agreed to return 
tomorrow -- if possible, in greater numbers -- to the same place 
next to the Targu Jiu Mining Public Corporation, and if by 1600 
the demands are not solved, they should leave for the capital. 
  The chairman of Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation, 
Miron Cosma, also said, quote, we will not give in under any 
circumstances. This is the last chance that we will give those 
who are responsible for the solution of our demands, unquote, 
after which he appealed to the miners to go home.

  [Text] The Romanian Government issued a communique today 
in connection with the strike of the brown coal miners belonging 
to the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation. The communique 
points out the fact that at the beginning of February the 
confederation of mining trade unions, which is coordinated by 
Miron Cosma, presented a number of claims principally referring 
to the elimination of the financial blockage, the correction of 
certain stipulations of the collective labor contract [words 
indistinct], the improvement of labor conditions at certain 
brown coal mining units, and the replacement of certain leaders 
of the Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation. All those issues 
have been examined by the government together with the Ministry 
of Industry and representatives of the trade union 
confederation, and deadlines and responsibilities were also 
established. 
  Despite all this, the communique stresses, beginning 14 
February, the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation, which is 
affiliated to the union confederation coordinated by Miron 
Cosma, triggered a conflict situation, invoking further demands: 
A bonus amounting to 100,000 for each person -- besides the 
bonus of 50-55,000 lei for each person promised for the 
Christmas holidays -- as well as the replacement of the Gorj 
County prefect. Regarding these further demands, the communique 
says, the government considers that the main point in it, namely 
the 100,000-lei additional bonus, represents a wish suggested by 
Miron Cosma to the trade union in question, with the intent of 
extending his personal sphere of influence over Gorj County. 
That demand does not comply with the stipulations of the 
collective labor contract and cannot be endorsed owing to the 
current financial situation. The demand requesting the ousting 
of the Brown Coal Mining Public Corporation's leadership and 
that of the county prefect do not belong among the attributions 
of trade union bodies. 
  The way in which the members of the Lignitul Mining Trade 
Union Federations manifested themselves over the past period has 
nothing in common with the way union members claim their rights. 
Their moves, which culminated in assaulting the representatives 
of the [public corporation] administration and public order 
bodies, as well as their breaking into the headquarters of the 
public corporation and the illegal occupation of that building, 
has generated and is still generating disorder that causes 
economic losses worth many millions of lei. 
  On 15 February the whole personnel of the operative 
leadership of the public corporation had to be moved to the 
headquarters of the Rovinari branch. 
  From among the 75,000 employees of the public corporation 
over 70,000 are working normally, delivering 80-85,000 tonnes of 
brown coal daily to the thermal power plants and the population, 
thus fully satisfying current demands. 
  The government is compelled to take appropriate measures to 
recover all material losses and to punish the persons who caused 
them. The maintenance of the current state of disorder, the 
continuation of assaults, and the violation of the laws of the 
country will aggravate the deeds for which the persons in 
question will be held responsible. 
  Under such circumstances, the government will take the 
necessary steps to take to account, according to law, Miron 
Cosma, the leader of the Mining Trade Union Confederation, for 
having instigated to public disorder and having led the 
destabilizing actions over the past days in the municipality of 
Targu Jiu and in the entire region. The population, as well as 
the real representatives of the mining trade unions, have 
disapproved and condemned the situation thus created. 
  We address an appeal to the miners who have participated in 
the aforementioned actions which violate current laws, to stop 
letting themselves dragged by Miron Cosma into such acts, which 
are provoked by him for personal purposes, while ignoring their 
economic and social consequences. 
  The government considers that there are proper conditions 
and 
a proper atmosphere for work to be resumed in all mining units 
and for the examining of the claims under civilized 
circumstances and not under the pressure of street disorder that 
contradicts norms law and order, concludes the communique 
released by the press office of the executive.

  [Text] The Salvamin Union of the Motru miners trade 
unions, reuniting all mining trade unions of the Motru basin, 
issued a communique protesting the way in which the personnel of 
the Ministry of the Interior are carrying out their duties. It 
is not tolerable, the communique stresses, that industrial or 
public units should be attacked by gangs of so-called miners who 
are led by Miron Cosma, while those units are left unprotected 
by personnel belonging to the Ministry of the Interior. 
  In that sense we are addressing an appeal to the ministry in 
question calling for it to carry out its duty with respect to 
those who are violating the laws of the country. If no such 
steps are taken within the next 10 hours, the miners belonging 
to the Salvamin Union will take over the task of restore order 
to Targu Jiu, regardless of the labor conflict currently taking 
place there, concludes the communique signed by the chairman of 
the Salvamin Union, Viorel Teleleteu.

  [Text] At Cotroceni Palace this evening Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received a delegation of the National Trade Union 
Block [BNS], led by its leader Dumitru Costin. 
  During the meeting, the BNS leaders discussed the six issues 
they announced from the very beginning of the talks. 
  The talks concluded half an hour ago and the BNS leader 
stated the following to our reporter Sorin Croitorescu: 
  [Begin Costin recording] In our talks with President Iliescu 
this evening we advanced six points. As we affirmed at the 
beginning of the discussions, we had the advantage of being the 
third confederation that met with the president, so the joint 
claims of the major trade unions have already been discussed and 
over discussed. Thus, during our talks this evening we had the 
opportunity to also approach other subjects that we consider of 
maximum importance. 
  First of all, we provided arguments and reasons that led to 
the current relation between our confederation and Romania's 
government. The reason is the lack of a relation of partnership 
that President Iliescu believes to be the basis for any 
relations in any society, especially in a society with problems 
such as the current Romanian society. 
  The second point of our discussion referred to the issue of 
joint claims, that is the claims of CNSRL [National 
Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Cartel Alfa-BNS, a 
point on which we did not linger too long because our 
viewpoints, namely the viewpoints of the two confederations, do 
not differ. 
  The third point of our discussions was the draft social 
accord that our confederation submitted at the end of January, 
and we were surprised to see that there was no reaction 
whatsoever from the government, presidency, political parties, 
or even trade unions. Very few people praised or criticized this 
material and we still believe that only through a 
social-economic accord can this moment of crisis be overcome. 
  The fourth issue discussed was the memorandum with the IMF. 
Before the start of talks in the Romanian Parliament, we gave 
the press an analysis that we allowed ourselves to make. We 
believe that it is absolutely necessary to present a viewpoint 
on this memorandum, because even on a superficial reading of the 
text, one can notice that the memorandum lacks the social 
component. And as far as all current major transformations that 
Romania's government wishes to carry out are concerned, if these 
are not supported by a program of retraining and by the creation 
of new jobs, then the idea of reform will be destroyed from the 
very beginning. The reason for this, as I have already 
mentioned, the social costs will be very high and if we, as 
partners -- on the one hand we, the trade union confederations 
and on the other hand the executive power -- will not know how 
to find a moment of balance in which the costs of the transition 
should be at the lower possible level, at an acceptable level, 
we will discredit from the beginning the idea of reform. 
  This evening, it was suggested to us that we should continue 
the discussions that started yesterday with the executive and as 
soon as we almost reach the final stage of the talks -- 
regardless of whether or not all issues will have been solved -- 
we will certainly have the mediation of the presidential 
institution in the conflict that exists between trade union 
groups, that is trade union confederations and the Romanian 
Government. [end recording]

  [Text] The AFP news agency carries an item transmitted 
from Bucharest reporting that on 14 February in Craiova the 
police arrested Nicolae Andrei, a Romanian journalist, the 
author of certain news articles published in December 1993 which 
are offensive to President Ion Iliescu. AFP names the police 
press office as its source. 
  In connection with that case, AFP also cites the statement 
of 
Petre Mihai Bacanu, the chairman of the Romanian Journalists' 
Association, in which Bacanu says, quote, it is an unprecedented 
case after the 1989 December revolution, that a harmless article 
should trigger such a harsh reaction, unquote. 
  Related to this case, the press office of the Police General 
Inspectorate wishes to point out the following things: 
  Investigating the daily CUVINTUL SECURITATII [THE WORD OF 
SECURITATE], which is written by the journalists of the review 
CONFLICT, formerly bearing the name CARTEL, it was found that 
some of its items have a character that offends certain 
political personalities. Thus, the contents of two items titled 
"The Tale of the Pig -- A Christmas Fairy Tale" [Povestea 
porcului -- un basm de Craciuni] and "The Story of the Animal" 
[Povestea animalului] are obviously offending Romania's 
president and carry all the elements necessary for them to be 
regarded as the infraction of offending the authorities, which 
is punished by Article 238, Paragraph 1, of the Penal Code. 
  Despite the fact that the two items were signed with the 
pseudonyms Santa Claus and Veterinary Doctor, as a result of the 
steps that were taken, their author could still be identified as 
Andrei Nicolae, aged 31, a technical-high-school graduate, 
currently a journalist with the aforementioned publication. He 
lives in the village of Cosoveni, in Dolj County. Setting out 
from available evidence the police bodies decided to place him 
under arrest and, on the basis of the suggestion of the police, 
the state attorney's office functioning at the Dolj County Court 
issued a warrant for preventive arrest over a period of 30 days. 
  Investigations are still underway, concludes the communique 
issued by the press office of the Police General Inspectorate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liviu Luca, president of the PETROM </F>
Independent Trade Unions Federation and vice president of the 
Fratia National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions 
(CNSLR), by Liana Buligan on 11 February; place not given: "The 
Executive Power Is Experiencing a Dramatic Authority Crisis"] 
  [Excerpts] [Buligan] In your opinion, what is the actual 
position of our country's population following the 
intensification of the current economic and political crisis? 
  [Luca] There is an aspect that has to be pointed out to 
provide a correct answer. The population, that is the 
foundation of trade unions, is desperate and dumbfounded. At 
this point, no one in Romania understands anything -- neither 
the people, nor the electorate, and not even the leaders of 
various parties involved in the political game. To quote just 
one example: In a country that is extracting 8 million tonnes 
of crude oil a year, the oil industry is suffering from 
financial blockage and is on the brink of bankruptcy. [passage 
omitted] 
  The disaster continues and no one seems to be responsible 
for 
what is happening. Thus all efforts go into the silly game of 
acquiring power and the problem of tangible solutions to justify 
this portfolio- and position-hunting is not posed. 
  [Buligan] What is the situation of financial blockage at 
this point? 
  [Luca] If you could have frank discussions with the big 
shots in industry you would be surprised to note that they are 
totally confused. No one knows who is his leader and what 
strategy or program he has to implement. On the one hand, the 
Vacaroiu government is accused by everyone, including us, the 
trade unions, of not doing anything; on the other hand, what can 
he do as long as he does not have the economic levers in his 
hand and has no freedom to make decisions? 
  [Buligan] Who is holding these economic levers? 
  [Luca] Under the law, the head of the State Property Fund 
[FPS] is the holder of these levers, while the executive, 
however, belongs to the prime minister. Under the Privatization 
Law, an illogical situation has emerged in which decisionmaking 
is divided in such a way between the FPS and government that 
neither can do anything. The situation is such that we do not 
even know for sure how many powers there are in the state, thus 
even the country's integrity is questioned. Consequently, the 
population is fed up to such an extent that they confuse 
democracy with the crisis and almost are expecting a 
reorganization of sociopolitical structures, even if this would 
mean a military dictatorship. At this time, such notions as 
freedom, democracy, and reform are compromised in Romania. 
  [Buligan] What is the explanation of the fact that recently 
trade unions firmly demanded a broad national coalition 
government, meaning that they got involved in "politics," as 
some public figures say? 
  [Luca] We demanded the participation of the democratic 
opposition in government for at least two reasons. First, an 
economic one. Under the current single leadership of the Social 
Democracy Party [PDSR], the former communist nomenklatura is 
consolidating its positions in the economy, thus becoming a very 
rich, though small, segment of, let's say, 5 percent. As for 
the rest, there is great poverty. A country with no prosperous 
middle class, but with catastrophic economic differences is not 
a stable country. Through the participation of the other 
parties in government, the segment of the privileged would 
expand and our society would become a normal society. [passage 
omitted] 
  Returning to the financial blockage, an easy solution would 
be if oil producers concluded their contracts directly with 
refineries; that would eliminate financial blockage. Despite 
all our efforts, however, this is not possible. In their 
naivete, the trade unions thought that this problem would belong 
to the competence of the Ministry of Industry and the prime 
minister, but we were wrong because these authorities have no 
decisionmaking power. Thus we have to ask the question: Which 
are the dark powers behind those appointed to govern? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Buligan] Is there any solution to this blockage? 
  [Luca] In the oil sector, the blockage amounts to 160 
billion lei. Halting payments or, differently put, the 
application of the Bankruptcy Law is the only way out. 
Normally, such a financial blockage cannot last long; but maybe 
what is pursued is to exasperate people and ruin the economy in 
order to prove that Romania is unsuited for the market economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Buligan] Do you believe in the efficiency of a new 
government? 
  [Luca] No, because the country does not have the time needed 
to form and break in another government team. 
  [Buligan] Do you think that the legitimate power is 
experiencing an authority crisis? 
  [Luca] Yes, an authority crisis coupled with an outrageous 
lack of responsibility vis a vis national interests. The 
political forces have abandoned the nation, but the nation has 
also abandoned and isolated them in their silly game to win 
power. Thus, the country is split. [passage omitted] 
  [Buligan] What is your opinion about President Ion Iliescu 
in the current situation? 
  [Luca] His main asset is an outstanding resilience. At a 
recent meeting with trade union leaders, he emphasized the need 
for consensus through the participation of all in a government 
coalition, but, as you well know, even the road to hell is paved 
with good intentions. 
  [Buligan] What will the trade unions do next? 
  [Luca] We will continue to heed our responsibilities. 
[passage omitted] The problem of responsibility is a tangible 
and strict problem with us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On Thursday evening, 11 February, Mr. Liviu Luca, 
vice president of the National Confederation of Romania's Free

which Liviu Luca was seriously injured, while the "offender," 
SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] Lieutenant Colonel Ion 
Buica, died. Although the interview, which was granted 
confidentially in Mr. Luca's office, was published only on 
Monday, 14 February 1994, by TINERETUL LIBER, we ask ourselves 
to what extent his bold statements and the accident that was 
caused by a SRI officer were just an ordinary coincidence.

Russia, and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at a 
news conference in Pale on 17 February; both statements are in 
English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Churkin] I have today brought to Belgrade and Pale 
a letter from President Yeltsin. This letter is addressed to 
President Milosevic, Dr. Karadzic, and other Serb leaders, as 
well as the Serbian people. It contains Russia's request that, 
in the interest of halting the bloodshed, the Serbian side 
withdraw its heavy weapons from Sarajevo. 
  In that context, the Russian Federation would be prepared to 
send its troops to the Sarajevo area to participate in the UN 
peace operation. I am glad to state that this Russian 
initiative, which we believe is in the interests of both the 
Muslims and the Serbs and all the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
has been accepted by the Serbian side. We hope that the 
acceptance of the Russian initiative will put an end to the 
crisis around Sarajevo and we know that this will be a major 
step toward the overall settlement of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Karadzic] I would like to say that we are very grateful to 
Russia for its involvement in the crisis. We have accepted the 
proposal put forward by Russia regarding the withdrawal of the 
heavy weapons. We also think that further Russian participation 
in the conference and the peace process will be welcomed and 
fruitful. 
  We are going to do what we will do on the basis of, first of 
all, the Russian demands, which for us mean certain guarantees, 
and then on the basis of our agreement with Mr. Akashi of 7 
February and the Serbian-Muslim agreement of 9 February. We 
think that the war in Sarajevo is finally over.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Russian troops are not 
neutral and are "not welcome" on the Bosnian Serb frontlines in 
Sarajevo, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said Thursday [17 
February]. 
  Ganic was asked for his reaction to Thursday's agreement for 
the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo, 
following Russian mediation. In return, the Russians are to 
send peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. 
  Ganic said: "The Russians are not neutral and have never 
agreed with NATO on the demilitarisation process of Sarajevo. 
Therefore, they are not welcome." 
  Ganic said that if the Russian troops were deployed in the 
Sarajevo region, he would prefer "to see them guarding Bosnian 
heavy weapons placed under UN control rather than Serb weapons." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has threatened to 
bomb 
the Serb artillery from 2400 GMT Sunday if it were not withdrawn 
from around Sarajevo or put under control of the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The Bosnian army is mainly Moslem. The Russian government 
has come under domestic pressure to support the Serbs who are 
fellow Slavs and orthodox Christians. 
  Ganic added that the Russian initiative was "clumsy from a 
diplomatic point of view because it shows a lack of trust in the 
UNPROFOR", the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking in Athens 
on Thursday, said the Moslem side should now make concessions. 
  "The time has come for the West to prove that it knows how 
to 
do something better than an ultimatum, by encouraging the other 
side to undertake what we have obtained from the Serbs," he told 
journalists before holding talks with his German counterpart 
Klaus Kinkel.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Bosnian UN Ambassador </F>
Muhamed Sacirbey at UN Headquarters in New York on 18 February 
by Itay Engel -- recorded; Sacirbey speaks in English] 
  [Text] [Engel] Is there room for optimism with regard to 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? We sought to clarify and 
elaborate on this matter with Bosnian UN Ambassador Muhamed 
Sacirbey. On the phone from New York this morning, we first 
asked him to tell us how he perceives and interprets Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's evidently dramatic declaration 
that the war has come to an end. 
  [Sacirbey] These are the words of a man, of course, who has 
lied in the past and who has misrepresented the situation in the 
past. So, we will wait for his deeds rather than for his words. 
  [Engel] Sacirbey emphasized that he was not thrilled by the 
idea of deploying Russian troops on the hills surrounding 
Sarajevo, even if this results in a Serbian retreat. 
  [Sacirbey] As we know right now, there is growing Russian 
nationalism that now is gaining its expression through the 
Serbian fascism. We certainly do not welcome the presence of 
Russian troops overlooking the hills of Sarajevo. We were not 
consulted on this matter, and we should not accept it. 
Certainly, this would be akin to an invasion for us. 
  [Engel] At this point, Sacirbey quite skeptically referred 
to another positive development in Sarajevo over the past 24 
hours: the surrender of Serbian weapons to UN troops. 
  [Sacirbey] While, in fact, the heavy weapons, at least some 
of them, may be withdrawn or placed under the control of the 
United Nations -- the Serbian heavy weapons -- it is important 
that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted. And as long as the 
Serbians continue to control the communications, the 
transportation lines in and out of Sarajevo, as long as they 
continue to control the electricity, the water, then I do not 
believe the siege is lifted. 
  [Engel] Finally, in view of his interpretation of the events 
and two days before the deadline on the ultimatum to end the 
Serbian siege of Sarajevo, we asked the Bosnian UN ambassador 
whether he believes air strikes by NATO troops are still the 
right thing to do. 
  [Sacirbey] Well, of course, we need to see if the heavy 
weapons are withdrawn, but it's my opinion that there are too 
many elements that are opposed to the air strikes at any cost 
and that the air strikes, I think, are sought to be avoided by 
any means, including the means of defining withdrawal and 
control of Serbian heavy weapons in such a way that it's so 
permissive that the Serbians.... 
  [Engel] Sacirbey went on to say that some people are so 
convinced that such air strikes should be avoided at any cost 
that they are even persuading themselves that the Serbians are 
handing in their weapons to the United Nations and, 
consequently, are meeting the conditions imposed by the United 
Nations in a way that obviates the need for air strikes. 
Sacirbey said: I only hope that NATO and the West make sure 
that their demands are met in the field in an objective and 
genuine manner which at least coincides with the way I interpret 
terms such as cease-fire and withdrawal.

<F P=106> [Interview with General-Major Manojlo Milovanovic, commander </F>
of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, by 
Slavoljub Kacarevic; place and date not given: "NATO Will Not 
Strike"] 
  [Excerpts] It is said of General-Major Manojlo 
Milovanovic, commander of the general staff of the army of the 
Srpska republic, that he is the mastermind of this army. This 
general, nicknamed "Mali" [Little] by his friends, caught our 
attention when (in the first half of February] he started 
negotiations in the name of the Serbian side and signed the 
agreement on cease-fire around Sarajevo. [passage omitted] 
  [Kacarevic] Mr. General, there is plenty of talk about air 
strikes. The Serbian side is supposed to meet the conditions 
set by NATO by 21 February. If these strike do materialize, 
what consequences will this have for the Serbian Army? 
  [Milovanovic] Nobody in the world wants the creation of a 
Muslim state in the Balkans. They want that the peoples in the 
Balkans exhaust themselves and decimate each other as much as 
possible so that they could accomplish their interests more 
easily. It is very well known who has what interests. For 
example, France has the strongest interest in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Germany in Croatia, and Turkey in the 
eastern parts, that is to say, the territory of Macedonia and 
Kosovo. However, nobody, perhaps with the exception of Turkey 
and individual Islamic countries, wants the creation of the 
Islamic state. 
  The West is constantly promising some sort of support to the 
Muslims to keep up their combat morale. The threat of air 
strikes is the best booster for Muslim morale. And all this has 
been going on for over a year. Not one of their politicians has 
made a statement without mentioning this possibility. In this 
way, they maintain the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, 
the realization of these air strikes is very complicated. 
First, it is difficult to differentiate the targets and specify 
what and whom to pound. Second, the world has become very much 
involved in Bosnia through the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
and humanitarian organizations. 
  We are making it plain to everybody that if air strikes do 
take place all foreigners on the territory of the Srpska 
republic will become hostages. This also includes the 
representatives of the International Red Cross, the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], and, unfortunately, even 
journalists.... Therefore, gentlemen, go ahead and attack! 
This is one of our defense mechanisms. Furthermore, as of 1 
March, they have been flying in our sky and recorded everything. 
They have probably also placed numerous radio tracers [radio 
lokator] on the ground, along the separating lines. However, 
their problem is that they know all our capabilities [sentence 
as published]. Earlier they did not know, for example, that we 
can follow them all over Europe, and especially in Italy where 
they are concentrating. In one combat raid, as we soldiers call 
it, we can decimate their first shock group, which would consist 
of some 50 to 60 aircraft. Not a single chief of a state whose 
air force is taking part in the attack would be able to justify 
this at home. 
  To become involved in such a war now would be a catastrophe, 
however not for Bosnia, which has already met its fate anyway, 
but for the entire world. Also, regardless of all their 
technical equipment, they could, according to our estimates, 
destroy 12 to 18 percent of our military hardware. This, 
however, would not eliminate our advantage in military hardware 
over the Muslims. The Muslims now live in 12 enclaves on the 
territory of former Bosnia. They are all entirely within the 
range of our arms. There are also UNPROFOR members in these 
enclaves and they know very well that a sort of massacre of 
international representatives would take place. We have no other 
choice, we must defend ourselves. 
  [Kacarevic] Mr. General, is the claim of the western media 
that the FRY Army is taking part in the combat on the Bosnian 
battlefields correct? 
  [Milovanovic] This claim has recently been used for 
propaganda purposes. The Western press has written extensively 
about this, however, when they have remained without sufficient 
proof, the matter was put off the agenda. The Yugoslav Army has 
not taken place in the operations on the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina since 19 May 1992. Regarding volunteers, 
they are always welcome. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Three hundred UN French 
troops deployed among nine observations posts astride the 
frontlines on the hills overlooking Sarajevo could end up as 
sitting ducks if NATO starts bombing Serb positions. 
  The UN soldiers were deployed in their new observation posts 
following a ceasefire agreement signed by the Bosnian Serbs and 
Moslems, but the Serbs have since warned that they would 
retaliate against the UN soldiers if attacked by North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation planes in the wake of its ultimatum that 
heavy weapons be withdrawn by Sunday night from around the 
besieged Bosnian capital. 
  "The day when someone, from whatever camp, decides to kill 
Blue Helmets, he will probably be able to do so easily," 
according to a senior UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer who 
wished to remain anonymous. 
  "But this will be an act of war against the United Nations. 
He (the assailant) must know he will be taking big risks. A 
small (UN) group represents nothing by itself, but the balance 
of forces has recently changed in Bosnia. The air force is now 
here," he said. 
  Any guns that opened up on UN emplacements would have very 
little time before being spotted, attacked and destroyed, 
according to experts here. 
  "We have issued instructions in case a withdrawal is needed. 
But it is certain this would be delicate," another UNPROFOR 
officer said. 
  "We know that all our withdrawal routes can easily be cut. 
In case of air strikes, I think our men will remain in place. 
They are getting ready to protect themselves as best possible. 
There's no question of withdrawing them a few hours ahead (of 
an air strike), we would have to react after the event. In any 
case, we aren't kept informed of everything in the offing," he 
said. 
  In the snow and the cold which has dropped to minus 18 
degrees Celsius (zero degrees Fahrenheit), French UNPROFOR 
soldiers are camping out among the trenches and minefields of 
the warring parties, knowing both sides hold them in their 
gunsights. 
  "It is certain that one doesn't take such action without 
risk," according to Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pernod. 
  "But in case of trouble, they (the soldiers) have their 
armoured vehicles to protect them and allow them to move out. 
And of course, we have planned the means to get them out if 
their positions become untenable," he added. 
  In one such observation post, at Dobrinja, 16 French 
soldiers 
have been deployed for the past eight days, exactly between the 
frontlines. 
  They have removed the mines from a few square meters (yards) 
of territory, between two rows of blackened buildings where 
Bosnian Serbs hold the left side of the street and Bosnian 
Moslem the right side. 
  Armed shadows sometimes briefly appear behind blown-out 
windows, while all entrances are mined. The two UN armoured 
vehicles and two small tents appear lost in the midst of the 
ruins. 
  In another observation post, at Vidikovac up on a hill, 17 
soldiers are surrounded on three sides by Serb bunkers. 
  "We are going to build a shelter with bags of earth, beams 
and wooden planks we have brought with us," said Lieutenant 
Jean-Marie Pichouron. 
  But the frozen earth, under 50 centimeters (19 inches) of 
snow, does not lend itself easily to such work. 
  "The Serbs are very welcoming. They have invited us to 
dinner," one soldier said. 
  "They must say to themselves that while we are there, the 
planes will certainly not fire on them," he added.

  [Text] United Nations, Feb 17 (AFP) -- UN Protection Forces 
(UNPROFOR) will rely on armed ground forces established at 
several sites to ensure control of Bosnian Serb weapons around 
Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said Thursday [17 February]. 
  UN control "will be achieved through permanent, on the 
ground 
UNPROFOR armed presence on five or six established sites on each 
side where heavy weapons are regrouped," UN spokesman Ahmad 
Fawzi told reporters in New York. 
  "If either party attempts to retrieve those weapons it will 
have to use force and will therefore be in breach of the 
accepted conditions. Force will in turn be used against it," 
Fawzi said. 
  Serbian and Bosnian Moslem forces are due to withdraw their 
heavy weapons from a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of Sarajevo, 
or hand them over to UN control, by 0000 GMT Sunday or risk NATO 
airstrikes. 
  Bosnian Serbs said Thursday they would withdraw their heavy 
weaponry in time, following an intervention by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb convoys 
carrying equipment and heavy weapons were seen quitting the 
hills around Sarajevo Thursday [12 February] in what military 
observers viewed as a "major, very significant" withdrawal, a 
spokesman said. [passage omitted] 
  "Today the UNMOs (military observers) gave us reports of 
very 
significant withdrawal of Serb forces of the hills around 
Sarajevo," UN Protection Force Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman 
said. 
  "Up until now, the reports from the UNMOs have been of 
individual vehicles and pieces of equipment. Today, they're 
talking about convoys of equipment moving out of the hills," he 
added. 
  "A major, very significant withdrawal is going on," he said. 
  General Michael Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, "has received information from senior 
levels of the Bosnian Serb government that they will have their 
equipment out of a 20-kilometer (12-mile) zone within 36 hours, 
that means well before the deadline of midnight Sunday night," 
Aikman added. 
  Journalists in and around the capital however saw no 
immediate sign of the withdrawal. 
  There was no new activity at the Lukavica barracks, main

14 Warrior tanks, was expected to arrive here from the central 
Bosnian town of Vitez on Friday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lukavica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 18 (AFP) -- All 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo will be put under "efficient 
control" by Saturday midnight (2400 GMT), Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said here Friday. Karadzic was speaking after 
talks with United Nations special envoy for the former 
Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. 
  "We have been withdrawing already convoys and convoys, and 
we 
will withdraw even more," he said. "Those which can't be 
withdrawn because of snow will be placed under full effective 
control of the UN without any reservations." 
  "Tomorrow at 2400 regardless of other deadlines all heavy 
weapons will be under efficient control that is envisaged by UN 
regulations." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has warned that if 
Serb weapons ringing Sarajevo are not withdrawn to a distance of 
20 kilometres (12 miles) or put under UN control by Sunday 
midnight they will be attacked. 
  Akashi said that from Saturday armed troops of the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) will be controlling seven sites 
where heavy weapons will be grouped. 
  "There is a good momentum in full awareness that we have to 
make a very quick agreement," he added. 
  The heavy weapons on both Serb and Moslem side are being 
withdrawn or put under UNPROFOR control under an agreement 
concluded with the UN on February 9, the same day as NATO issued 
its ultimatum.

  [Text] Lukavica, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- Republic of Srpska 
president Radovan Karadzic stated today following talks with the 
UN secretary general's special envoy for former Yugoslavia, 
Yasushi Akashi, that the Srpska army planned to withdraw its 
heavy artillery from around Sarajevo until midnight tomorrow [19 
February]. 
  "We have set a certain deadline and it is 2400 [2300 GMT] 
tomorrow, regardless of other deadlines," Karadzic said. 
  He added that the Srpska army had already withdrawn a number 
of convoys of heavy weapons and that they were still 
withdrawing. Those that cannot be withdrawn due to the snow will 
be under full UN control, Karadzic said. 
  "From noon tomorrow [1100 GMT 19 February], UN members will 
control seven locations where heavy weaponry will be assembled," 
Akashi told journalists. 
  This refers to five locations where the Serbs ought to 
assemble their artillery and two locations where the Muslims are 
to assemble theirs.

  [Text] Lukavica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 18 (AFP) -- 
Bosnian Government and rebel Serb military commanders Friday 
agreed on three new control sites for grouping heavy weapons, 
said a UN spokesman who reaffirmed the threat of airstrikes if 
the NATO ultimatum was ignored. 
  Two sites for Serb heavy weapons and one for heavy artillery 
belonging to the Moslem-dominated Bosnian Army had been worked 
out, said UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel 
Richard Pernod. 
  "It is a positive step but the three-day deadline is still 
valid and both parties have to be convinced of that and respect 
their undertakings. Otherwise there will be air strikes," said 
Pernod. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum to Bosnian 
Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo expires 
Sunday at 2400 GMT. 
  "We expect other Serb convoys will leave the exclusion zone 
(around Sarajevo) today," he added, refering to the demand by 
NATO that heavy artillery be pulled back 20 kilometres (12 
miles) from central Sarajevo or placed under UN supervision. 
  However, the new sites agreement had not yet been enforced, 
said Pernod, and no new weapons had been handed in. 
  The additional control sites for Serbs are at the villages 
of 
Blagovat and Saracevac, north of Sarajevo. Mokro and Vela, east 
of the capital and the Serb-held Lukavica barracks in the 
Sarajevo suburbs are already in use. 
  The Bosnian Army, currently using the downtown Marshall Tito 
barracks to canton its heavy guns, is to place weapons under UN 
supervision at Malo Polje, on Mount Igman, southwest of Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Edin Nuhic report] </F>
  [Excerpts] The main topic of the news conference held by 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] today was the current 
political situation and NATO's ultimatum to the aggressor. 
Journalists were addressed by party president Mirsad Ceman and 
Fuad Didic, member of the Main Committee. Edin Nuhic reports: 
  [Nuhic] We are a bit skeptical about what is going to happen 
after NATO's ultimatum expires. This was stated by SDA 
President Mirsad Ceman at a news conference today. Considering 
our experience so far, it is not realistic to expect the 
ultimatum to be fully complied with. What is also 
characteristic is that the aggressor is not behaving in line 
with the threat that was addressed to it. 
  On the other hand, the visit by numerous world politicians 
to 
Sarajevo and the busy diplomatic activities in the world 
indicate that there is a certain change in the international 
community's attitudes toward the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The 
withdrawal of the weapons could, however, have some negative 
effects, Mirsad Ceman said. 
  [Begin Ceman recording] Regarding the lifting of the siege 
of 
Sarajevo, we would particularly like to express our fear that 
even if a more significant removal of heavy weapons deployed 
around Sarajevo took place, these weapons could still be 
deployed on other fronts, above all, as this is becoming 
evident, to the Bihac region, and other regions where the 
aggressor is carrying out attacks. Thus, NATO's decision, whose 
purpose is to protect the (?unprotected) zones, would in fact be 
brutally dodged, in another area. [end recording] 
  [Nuhic] The message of the SDA to the political leadership 
of the country and the international community is to block the 
roads that lead from Sarajevo to other regions and in this way 
prevent the aggressor from deploying heavy weapons in other 
regions. 
  The ultimate aim of the SDA is not to provoke NATO air 
strikes, Fuad Didic, member of the party's Main Committee, said. 
  [Begin Didic recording] Our ultimate aim is to have the arms 
embargo lifted. Our ultimate aim is arms in our own hands. 
This means that our ultimate aim is to secure our survival. We 
have not survived as a nation so far because of agreements. We 
Bosnian Muslims have survived because of our armed resistance. 
[end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Nuhic] At the end of today's news conference, the SDA 
representatives briefed the journalists on some details 
concerning the visit by [Presidency Member] Nijaz Durakovic to 
Australia. They said that they were told by the party members in 
the Australian branch of the SDA that, speaking at some rallies, 
Durakovic compared the SDA with the terrorist Serbian Democratic 
Party, saying, we quote, Adilbeg is saving Bosnia with his own 
means [not further specified]. 
  It is unacceptable, Ceman said, that some members of 
opposition parties should be entering the preelection campaign 
in this way while SDA members are bleeding in defending Bosnia.

  [Text] Lukavica, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- In accordance with the 
Russian initiative the Serb side today began withdrawal its 
heavy artillery around Sarajevo. A column of 30 pieces of heavy 
artillery started being withdrawn from Lukavica at 1300 [1200 
GMT], a TANJUG correspondent in Lukavica reports. 
  "By order of the Supreme Command, the artillery pieces were 
collected and are being moved to certain locations and placed 
under control," [as received] Colonel Tadija Manojlovic, the 
commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps artillery said. "The 
Serb side has done this in the interest of peace, and not in 
response to the NATO ultimatum," Manojlovic said.

  [Text] Lukavica, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, and Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy for former Yugoslavia, met in 
Lukavica today to discuss issues concerning the implementation 
the Russian initiative, the control and the withdrawal of Serb 
artillery, and the observance of the Sarajevo cease-fire. 
  Speaking at a news conference, Colonel Richard Pernod, head 
of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Sarajevo sector press 
center, could not confirm that the Serb artillery had already 
begun withdrawing. 
  Asked what was happening on the territory of Sarajevo, 
Pernod 
explained that weaponry was being assembled, and expressed the 
hope that the Serb and the Muslim sides would begin withdrawing 
within the envisaged period. 
  He added that "convoys were being formed on the Serb side" 
in 
five locations: Lukavica, Mokro, Vela, Blagovat, and Saracevac. 
As regards the Muslim army, these locations are Malo Polje and 
Marshal Tito barracks. 
  Asked whether the Serb convoys would move in the next 24 
hours, Pernod replied: "Naturally, the withdrawal should begin 
today, but so far I have no information." TANJUG has learned 
from Serb sources that more than 100 Serb artillery pieces on 
the territory of Sarajevo have already been put under control 
[as received], and that the handover of heavy artillery will be 
completed within the deadline agreed on with UN representatives.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- We are not abandoning 
Serb citizens in Sarajevo, nor are their lives in danger due to 
the withdrawal of a part of the heavy weaponry from a zone of 20 
kilometers surrounding Sarajevo, the prime minister of the 
Srpska republic, Vladimir Lukic, has told Radio Obrenovac [local 
radio in Serbia]. 
  Another part of the weaponry will be placed under UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] control; therefore, the reason for NATO 
air strikes no longer exists, prime minister Lukic said. 
  Replying to the question of when the Russian UNPROFOR 
soldiers could be expected to arrive in Sarajevo, Lukic did not 
specify the time but said that their deployment along frontlines 
would be an opportunity for the world finally to understand that 
it is not only one side -- the Muslims -- that care about peace.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Serb separatists seized 
Friday [18 February] a strategic border bridge between Bosnia 
and Croatia from Nepalese troops of the UN Protection Force, 
UNPROFOR spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Marcotte said. Some 
70 armed Serbs took over the bridge across the Sara river 
linking Stara Gradiska in southern Croatia to Bosanska Gradiska 
in northern Bosnia, Marcotte said. 
  The Nepalese were negotiating with the Serbs and had called 
for reinforcements from a Jordanian battalion, he added, but 
referred to the incident as "fairly minor" with no direct 
incidence on the war in Bosnia. 
  The spokesman was not able to say if the Serbs came from the 
self-proclaimed Krajina Republic in Croatia or the similar 
self-declared Serb Republic in Bosnia. 
  But the Croatian Serb news agency ISKRA monitored in 
Belgrade 
said the bridge had been seized by a unit of Krajina's "special 
police." 
  It said the bridge was a "means of UNPROFOR pressure on the 
Serbian people of Western Slavonia (in north-central Croatia)" 
and quoted the head of the "special police," Krsto Zekovic, as 
saying that his men would take over all points on the border 
between the two self-proclaimed Serbian republics guarded by UN 
troops.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 17 February carries 
within its regular 45-minute newscast several reports on the 
combat situation in the republic and in Sarajevo. 
  According to a correspondent in the operational zone of the 
7th South Operational Group, "the chetniks have started fierce 
tank and infantry attacks in the Filipovici region. These 
attacks have been going on for four days." He also says that in 
a "powerful counterattack, the fighters from this region 
destroyed yet another tank. Several dozens of chetniks have 
been put out of action. A number of infantry and antitank 
weapons were captured. This was the 77th enemy tank to have 
been destroyed in this region." 
  Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salikovic 
report that "continuous shelling of our positions has been going 
since this morning. The fiercest attacks are being launched by 
the enemy on the area between Omerbegovaca and Vranovaca. The 
chetniks are using mortars, of 155-mm and 122-mm howitzers, 
tanks, hill guns, portable mortars, and [word indistinct]. 
Double charge shells are being used increasingly frequently. 
The Brcko defense positions have been attacked for the first 
time with shells that explode about 10 meters above the ground. 
There are indications that this kind of shell was used by the 
aggressor for the massacre of civilians at the Sarajevo market 
[on 5 February]." 
  According to a reporter from the Information Service of the 
First Army Corps in Sarajevo, the "chetniks are continuing to 
violate the cease-fire in some parts of Sarajevo today. This 
started early this morning when they targeted NATO aircraft with 
illuminating [svetleci] bullets from Nedzarici. Then they fired 
mortar shells from Decija Glava and also used portable mortars 
to attack Hladivode from Gradina. Chetnik snipers have again 
been active, especially from Vraca, and they are using silencers 
so citizens are warned to exercise the maximum caution."

  [Text] Zvornik, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, chief of general staff of the army of the Serb 
Republic [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], told TANJUG today that the 
Sarajevo cease-fire agreement is mainly being observed, but that 
the Muslim side has called into question an important part of 
the agreement, which was reached at Sarajevo Airport on 9 
February. 
  This morning, without any explanation, the Muslim side 
refused to send its representatives to participate in the 
continuation of the work of a tripartite commission, which has 
already shown results, Milovanovic said. The task of the 
commission, made up of representatives of the Serb and the 
Muslim sides and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officers, is to 
draw up a solution for the control of the cease-fire. 
  The commission should have reached practical solutions on 
the 
basis of a direct insight into the situation in the field, which 
for the most part has been done, between 10 February and today, 
Gen. Milovanovic explained. 
  Due to the discontinuation of the work of the joint 
commission, it is necessary to hold a meeting as early as today 
between Serb and Muslim corps commanders and UNPROFOR troops in 
Sarajevo, Milovanovic said. 
  He added that by hampering the work of the tripartite 
commission the Muslim side has shown how much importance it 
attaches to the control and observance of the cease-fire in the 
Sarajevo area.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- The president of the 
Srpska republic, Radovan Karadzic, said today after a meeting 
with Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb Krajina 
[RSK], that Martic's visit "demonstrated solidarity of the 
people of the RSK with their brothers in the Srpska republic." 
  Martic was received in Pale with all state honors, and all 
aspects of cooperation, particularly military, were discussed in 
his lengthy talks with Karadzic. 
  "Our talks were very useful and in the interest of our 
people. We discussed military cooperation in particular," Martic 
told journalists, pointing out that he would not want this to be 
understood as a threat, "because we are one people and it is 
only natural that we cooperate with the aim of defending our 
territories." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Kresimir Zubak, president of the Croat </F>
republic of Herceg-Bosna Presidential Council, with unidentified 
correspondent; Zubak is in studio in Siroki Brijeg, Bosnia, the 
correspondent is in the Zagreb studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] The 
extraordinary session ended around 2100 this evening. As we 
have heard, there was a lot of talk about the role of the 
Presidential Council. What was so controversial? 
  [Zubak] You see, deputies were unclear about two issues. The 
first one was whether this abolishes the position of president 
of the republic. The second was who was to appoint members of 
the Presidential Council. Both issues have been clarified. 
  The proposed amendment to the fundamental decision on the 
establishing of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna specifies 
that the position of president of the republic still exists, but 
that a new body -- the Presidential Council -- is introduced. 
Concerning the appointment of president of the republic, it was 
clearly stated that the Presidential Council appoints the 
president of the republic, and that the Chamber of Deputies 
verifies the appointment. 
  [Correspondent] Perhaps we should specify what the status of 
Mate Boban is now. 
  [Zubak] At a session of the Chamber of Deputies in Livno on 
8 
February, Mate Boban put his mandate into the hands of the 
deputies of the Chamber of Deputies. In connection with that, 
at today's session the Chamber of Deputies decided that there 
were extraordinary circumstances and that during extraordinary 
circumstances the Presidential Council takes over the functions 
of president of the republic. Therefore, the post of president 
of the republic still exists, and Mate Boban, who has held that 
post so far, still remains the president of the republic, but 
with the status that I have just specified. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] At a session in Mostar, the Chamber of Deputies 
of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna set up a presidential 
council and passed a decision that the presidential council 
would carry out duties and obligations of the president of the 
Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna. Kresimir Zubak has been 
appointed president of the 11-member presidential council. 
Zdenko Vranjes reporting from Mostar. 
  Thanking the deputies for their trust, Kresimir Zubak said 
that the presidential council had a great task ahead in 
defending the rights and interests of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who must have the same position in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as the other two nations. We are still 
determined to solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina by peaceful 
means, and we accept all initiatives leading to this, Zubak said. 
  Other members of the presidential council are Ivan Bender, 
Pero Markovic, Ivo Zivkovic, Branimir Huterer, Jadranko Prlic, 
Jozo Martinovic, Valentin Coric, Mile Akmadzic, Ante Roso, and 
Ivo Lozancic. Vladislav Pogarcic was elected the council's 
secretary. [passage omitted] 
  The deputies are currently discussing a gathering of Croats 
held in Sarajevo recently, and the deputies have distanced 
themselves from the documents adopted at the meeting. They said 
that this group of Croats had no right to represent the 
interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that 
the documents adopted at the meeting in Sarajevo do not reflect 
the aspirations and interests of the Croats of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] The newly elected president of the presidential 
council of the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna, Kresimir Zubak, 
will head the Bosnian Croat delegation in the next round of 
Geneva talks early next month. Members of the negotiating 
delegation will be elected by the Chamber of Deputies or some 
other body in the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna. 
  The newly elected president of the Presidential Council of 
Herzeg-Bosna informed the deputies about the current situation 
at the Geneva peace negotiations. He said that certain new 
initiatives on the set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina had been 
presented in Geneva, but added that it was too early to discuss 
them. However, the new initiatives refer to the involvement of 
the United States into the solving of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions 
around Sarajevo if the Serbs do not withdraw their weapons.

Bosnia-Herzegovina by correspondent Qoroqi in Tehran on 17 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] In an interview with the Central News Unit, Omar 
Bahman, ambassador from the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
described the situation in Bosnia as extremely disturbing and 
called on international forums and especially on Islamic 
countries to adopt a serious decision. 
  [Begin recording of Omar Bahman in unidentified language 
with 
superimposed correspondent's report in Persian] Referring to 
recent NATO decisions for air operations in Bosnia, he said: 
This decision should have been made a long time ago. The 
situation in Bosnia has now reached such a stage that such 
temporary steps--even though positive--cannot solve the Bosnian 
people's problem. 
  Criticizing UN actions in Sarajevo and referring to the 
general disarmament in the city, Omar Bahman said: If this 
decision is carried out justly, it can be useful. But past 
experience shows that this step by the United Nations also 
serves the objectives of the Serbs and that in the long run only 
the Muslims will be disarmed since the Serbs can re-arm 
themselves with the support that they have. 
  The Bosnian ambassador in Tehran also described the West's 
political pressure to accept the peace plan as futile, and said: 
The Bosnian people are no longer fooled by the West's false 
slogans. 
  Continuing, Omar Bahman strongly criticized France and 
Russia 
and accused them of conveying the secret decisions adopted by 
NATO and the Security Council to the Serbs. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Geneva, Feb 18 (AFP) -- All overland aid convoys 
into Bosnia will be suspended Sunday and Monday [20-21 
February], UN relief officials said here Friday, amid continuing 
uncertainty over a NATO ultimatum threatening air strikes. 
  "Most convoys will return to base tomorrow evening and 
should 
be moving again on Tuesday," said UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) spokeswoman Sylvana Foa. 
  The decision would be reviewed Saturday morning, then again 
Sunday in light of the latest developments on the NATO 
ultimatum, which threatens air strikes if the two warring 
factions have not demilitarized Sarajevo by midnight Sunday. 
  She said it was taken both to avoid any needless risks over 
the NATO warning and because some of the UN units based along 
corridors used by UNHCR vehicles had been temporarily redeployed 
closer to Sarajevo. [passage omitted] 
  On Friday, aid convoys headed to the cities of Mostar in the 
south and Zenica in central Bosnia. Another convoy also set out 
for Maglaj, northwest of Sarajevo, which has only seen one 
convoy since last October, she said. 
  On Wednesday, a UNHCR convoy managed to get into the 
besieged 
Moslem enclave of Srebrenica, where a Canadian UN battalion is 
blocked as Bosnian Serbs forces have refused to allow its 
replacement by Dutch UN troops. 
  Foa stressed that the situation in several cities remained 
desperate, such as in Mostar, Gorazde and Maglaj where the 
everyday life of residents was much more difficult than for 
those in Sarajevo. 
  Most people in these locations "are living like rats in 
sewers." 
  "People could be fed if there were enough movement on the 
ground," Foa said, saying the UNHCR would like to see commercial 
traffic being resumed.

  [Text] Frankfurt, Germany, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Airdrops of 
emergency aid to the besieged Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia 
are continuing despite the threat of air strikes against Serb 
artillery around Sarajevo, a spokesman for the operation 
"Provide Promise" said Friday. 
  "Our operations haven't changed. We are continuing until the 
UN makes a decision otherwise," a spokesman at the Rhein-Main 
airbase said. 
  During Thursday night 11 planes dropped 78 tonnes of food, 
2.5 tonnes of medical supplies and just under six tonnes of 
clothing and blankets, Airman Stuart Camp said. 
  Since the start of the operation on Feruary 27, 1993, US, 
French and German transporter planes have dropped some 16,700 
tonnes of food, medical aid and winter supplies, he said.

<F P=106> [By Milan Dragovic] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 17 (AFP) -- NATO and UN officials 
meeting here Thursday said they "agreed" on control of heavy 
weapons around Sarajevo, in a bid to dispel reported differences 
on how to implement NATO's threat to bomb Bosnian Serb weapons 
still pointed at the Bosnian capital on Monday. 
  The meeting involved U.S. General George Joulwan, who is 
both 
NATO's supreme commander in Europe as well as commander of U.S. 
forces in Europe, special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi of Japan, 
French General Jean Cot, the commander of UN forces in former 
Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), and British General Charles Ritchie, the 
force's chief of staff. 
  Questioned by journalists afterwards, Akashi said the 
alleged 
differences have "never existed, except in some media reports." 
  "I gave to General Joulwan what our conception and 
definition 
of control is," he said. 
  Joulwan backed this up, adding: "We are in agreement on the 
definition of control." 
  Their meeting was called to define exactly what the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations consider 
acceptable concessions by the Bosnian Serbs on their weapons 
besieging the capital. 
  The meeting came three days ahead of a NATO ultimatum to 
Bosnia's warring parties -- primarily the Serbs -- to withdraw 
their weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN 
control by midnight Sunday. Failing this, they will be bombed. 
  In Brussels Wednesday, NATO and UN officials also moved to 
close ranks to dispel reports of differences over the definition 
of "control" and to warn there was nothing ambiguous about the 
ultimatum issued on February 9. 
  Joulwan is also to meet U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the 
commander of allied forces for southern Europe (AFSOUTH), NATO 
headquarters in Brussels said. 
  Boorda has been working closely with Cot for months, 
traveling to Zagreb three times in the last week. 
  "All possible plans, mechanisms and scenarios have been 
ready 
for a while now" for any possible air strikes in Bosnia, a UN 
military source told AFP. 
  The source said any mechanism to ensure no more shelling of 
Sarajevo -- and thus avoid air strikes -- was "very complicated, 
and even harder to implement since it must be accepted by all 
the parties," in a 22-month-old conflict where all attempts at 
resolving crises have broken down. 
  In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said there had 
been a "significant number" of Bosnian Serb weapons regrouped in 
UN-controlled zones, but said the Serbs appeared to be opting 
more for "withdrawal from the area" outside the 20-kilometer 
(12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO. 
  By Tuesday, Bosnian Serbs had regrouped 36 pieces in two of 
their barracks under the guard of unarmed UN military observers 
and on Wednesday placed 20 additional heavy weapons under UN 
control, but without moving them from their firing sites, 
according to a senior UNPROFOR officer. 
  But he said these weapons had only been registered with the 
UN, and not dismantled, in a procedure which observers said was 
not exactly in line with UNPROFOR statements last Wednesday 
specifying they must be put under armed UN guard. 
  UN spokesmen on the ground however expressed optimism, 
including Peter MacFarlane in Sarajevo who said Thursday the 
"process continues and at this stage those involved are 
satisfied." 
  In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia General Sir 
Michael Rose on Thursday also told the press "both parties 
continue to cooperate in fulfilling the conditions of the 
agreement." 
  He said the "essence" of UNPROFOR control over weapons was 
"that if either party wishes to get their weapons back, force 
will be used against them." 
  In The Hague, an official spokesman said the Dutch, U.S. and 
British defense ministers would meet Sunday in Italy -- where 
NATO warplanes are based -- at the request of U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry to discuss Bosnia.

  [Text] Vukovar, Feb 17 (TANJUG) -- The deputy defense 
minister of the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) Milan 
Milanovic Thursday warned UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] of 
possible undesirable consequences if parts of Russian and 
Belgian battalions leave the eastern UNPA [UN protected areas] 
sector for Sarajevo. 
  If that happens, Milanovic warned Commander Jean Cot, the 
situation in eastern Slavonia, Baranja and western Srem will be 
very difficult as no one will be left to ensure the 
disengagement of the R.S.K. (Serb state in Croatia) forces and 
the Croatian Army, which was precisely the reason why the two 
battalions had come to the eastern sector. 
  It could also happen that the population will prevent the 
departure of U.N. troops, Milanovic said, adding he also 
believed it would be better if they remained where they are now. 
  The UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British 
General 
Sir Michael Rose has asked for additional 3,000 troops to 
control the demilitarization of the 20 km exclusion zone around 
Sarajevo, capital of the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, neighboring on the eastern UNPA sector. 
  According to the eastern sector information service, French 
General Cot, whose headquarters are based in Croatia's capital 
Zagreb, is expected to arrive in Erdut on March 1 for a farewell 
visit to the area before handing over his duties to a successor.

<F P=106> [Article by Henryk Sroczynski: "`Let Us Not Invoke the </F>
Bogeyman of Financial Rackets...': Aleksander Kwasniewski Talks 
to GLOS PORANNY"] 
  [Text] "It is a pity that you did not wait for the 
conclusion of my talks with Waldemar Pawlak yesterday [Thursday 
3 Feb] because I intended to invite you all for a pizza 
afterward," Aleksander Kwasniewski quipped to a group of 
journalists in the Sejm corridors yesterday. This was greeted 
with laughter because, the previous night, the two leaders left 
the building of the Council of Ministers Office quietly by a 
side gate, just as they had entered it earlier, well after 2300 
hours. 
  Following that evening meeting as well as the one that took 
place yesterday afternoon, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
leader stressed that the talks, held after the present 
government's 100 days in office, were essential: Both sides, 
which had never collaborated officially before, should assess 
pragmatically what was good and what was bad in their joint 
track record so far. In Aleksander Kwasniewski's opinion, the 
case of [the resignation of Finance] Vice Minister Borowski, 
which arose in connection with Stefan Kawalec's dismissal, was a 
simple case of "casualty at work" and could not in any way 
affect relations within the coalition. According to Kwasniewski, 
the prime minister still wanted to work with Borowski, whom he 
regarded as an important figure in the government. "There is no 
other way than reinforcing the coalition," Aleksander 
Kwasniewski insisted, "because it would be a pity to waste time 
on conflicts." 
  GLOS PORANNY's reporter asked Aleksander Kwasniewski whether 
matters connected with privatization were one of the subjects of 
his talks with the prime minister. In reply, the SLD leader 
said: "Too much of a fuss is made about this problem. We have 
agreed with the prime minister that, beginning next week, we 
will talk about that whole question in the company of competent 
people. We do not score any credits by our present handling of 
the privatization question. The prime minister had an 
opportunity to talk in Brussels with representatives of the 
European Union as well as with U.S. investors, and he knows that 
they all await answers on questions of privatization. We cannot 
talk about these questions at the same time with the voice of 
Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek and that of 
Bogdan Pek (Polish Peasant Party), chairman of the Sejm 
Commission for Ownership Transformations, because no sensible 
concept will arise from the combination of these two views." 
The SLD leader also told us: "It is premature and probably 
quite inappropriate to talk about the Bank Slaski [Silesian 
Bank] racket [reference to recent stock exchange dealings]. I 
do not believe that anyone could formulate such far-reaching 
conclusions from the quite unique situation that prevails at the 
Warsaw Stock Exchange. Let us not make such rash judgments. If 
such an admittedly somewhat unfortunate operation connected with 
the Bank Slaski can become a potential starting point for a 
government crisis, we should draw only one conclusion from it: 
We must allow no more risky operations like that--no 
privatization, no stock exchange, no capital turnover. But what 
can we have instead? Well, we already know, more or less, what 
we can have instead. We cannot claim that we have not tried an 
alternative solution before. In my opinion, we should rather 
reinforce those mechanisms that permit better and more effective 
functioning of financial systems, and we should draw appropriate 
conclusions from our failures. But let us not resort to 
invoking the bogeyman of financial rackets."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chairman of the </F>
Polish National Bank, by Jan Kreft; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kreft] Six months ago you were reporting to Hanna 
Suchocka's government on the difficult situation of the Polish 
banking system. How do you assess the present condition of our 
banks? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The situation is largely unchanged. 
Several new banks were set up, and they are now in bad shape, 
too. In addition, those that were in trouble six months ago have 
failed to ameliorate their condition. 
  [Kreft] So far, the Polish National Bank [NBP] is almost the 
only one prepared to come to the assistance of other banks when 
they find themselves in difficulties. The parliamentary debate 
on this year's budget contained charges that the NBP was too 
involved in "pumping" money into private banks. What is the 
government's position on this problem? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, both the government and 
parliament demur at taking on tasks of such nature. After all, 
such tasks are not part of any supervisory bodies' brief. The 
NBP should merely recommend the appropriate steps to be taken; 
it cannot take upon itself the entire burden of the remedial 
operations. The involvement of the NBP and the Bank of Economic 
Initiatives in the rescue operation in aid of the Development 
Bank of Lodz and the takeover of the Prosper Bank and the First 
Commercial Bank of Lublin (set up by Bogatin) was necessary 
because the threatened collapse and liquidation of those banks 
would have put an intolerable burden on NBP finances. Although 
we still have not set up a deposit insurance society, we would 
be inclined to protect our clients' interests up to a certain 
limit, remembering that, when one bank collapses, as happened in 
the Coastal Region, a decidedly dubious climate soon develops 
around all of the other ones. 
  I will not deny that I found it rather difficult to persuade 
the previous government to embark on the process of restoring 
our banks to health. I trust that I will have an easier job of 
it with the current government. 
  [Kreft] Did the divergence of views between you and the 
previous government concern some specific cases, or did it rest 
on a range of general phenomena common to the whole banking 
system in Poland? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It concerned institutional solutions, 
notably five fundamental instruments of the system of restoring 
banks to sound health applied universally throughout the world, 
whose application in the Polish banking system was recommended 
by the NBP. 
  [Kreft] Immediately after the parliamentary election, 
without knowing the new government's makeup, you advised the 
left to spread the realization of its election promises over 
several years, did you not? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] More and more people from the very core 
of the left-wing orientation are now talking about the need to 
spread these promises over a longer period of time. 
  [Kreft] You also stipulated at the same time that the post 
of finance minister should be given to a person ready for 
compromise and...for a fight against inflation. Did Minister 
Borowski [who resigned after the interview] fulfill these 
expectations? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Minister Borowski is a rather determined 
person, but he has not pressed for an unjustified monetary 
supply. Such pressure was exerted by members of relevant Sejm 
commissions. 
  [Kreft] During the Sejm debate on this year's budget, the 
NBP became a target for intense attacks. The Union of Labor 
charged it with not allowing a sufficient flow of funds to the 
economy, did it not? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I am quite immune to such pressures. 
The present Sejm is, as a whole, oriented toward a loosening of 
monetary policy. When we compare the attitudes of the budget 
commissions in the previous and the current Sejms, we must 
conclude that, in the former case, the coalition members 
demonstrated greater coalition discipline. However, I still 
remember the statement made by Jerzy Osiatynski shortly after he 
was made finance minister. He said that the "hole" in the 
budget would come up to 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. That 
frightened me quite considerably. Of course, we soon came to an 
agreement over that question. 
  The present parliament is characterized by a greater 
differentiation of positions even within individual parties. 
  Pressure to print more money has always taken place and will 
continue to take place everywhere under the sun. In 1992, I was 
there when the German deputy finance minister launched an attack 
on the Bundesbank's financial policy, and that, after all, is 
something that does not happen all that often. 
  [Kreft] How do you assess this year's planned budget 
deficit? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] It is contained within fairly decent 
limits, although even this could be the subject of a lengthy 
debate. The beginning of the year has been promising. I do not 
remember another year with such a substantial prevalence of 
revenues over expenditure. 
  [Kreft] The NBP will finance the budget to the tune of 
Z30-35 trillion. But the parliamentary act on the NBP lowers 
the ceiling of the central bank's involvement in the budget to a 
much lower level. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The relevant article of that act was 
routinely suspended for a great many years in the past. During 
the life of the Olszewski and Suchocka governments, the level 
defined by the act was very seriously exceeded. Such extensive 
involvement on the part of the NBP has its roots in the 
insufficiently developed money market. 
  [Kreft] Do you share the opinion that, in the present 
economic situation, devaluation of the zloty would create more 
problems than it would solve? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that devaluation always causes 
more damage. Decisions to introduce abrupt devaluation are 
usually made when something is very amiss with the state 
monetary reserves. On the other hand, a lack of equilibrium in 
the trade balance is a natural phenomenon in a country 
experiencing an economic recovery process. As a result of the 
latest, 8-percent currency devaluation, we gained an increase of 
only 1 percent in our export figures. I believe that 
encouraging results can be achieved only through applying such 
government measures as, for example, an imports tax. No one has 
ever managed to improve a national economy permanently by a 
drastic devaluation of the currency rate. 
  [Kreft] But your views on this matter are not shared by a 
sizeable group of politicians, are they? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Nevertheless, my views are presented 
more and more often in the public forum. And they are certainly 
more popular today than when I assumed office as NBP chairman. 
  [Kreft] To go back to your "wish list": Two years ago you 
wished to see an increase in the level of economic education 
available to the public that would bring it to the level of 
economic knowledge displayed by the German public. Over there, 
the main thing the population expects is the lowest possible 
level of inflation. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] My adviser at the Bundesbank insists 
that the Germans have always remembered the massive inflation in 
the 1920's, as well as the inflation of the postwar years. I 
believe that we should just remember our own inflation in the 
1980's. 
  [Kreft] But we are, on the contrary, all too ready to forget 
it.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] During the election campaign, inflation 
was not too painful. Recent violent reactions to the November 
inflation should make advocates of a greater "loosening" of our 
monetary policy aware that inflation threatens their voters' 
interests. 
  [Kreft] You have an excellent opportunity to make 
comparisons: Is the present Sejm's level of economic education 
higher than that exhibited by the last one? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Naturally, I will refuse to answer 
this question. I can only refer you to statements made by 
representatives of the present Budget Commission, who maintain 
that theirs is the best budget commission ever.... 
  [Kreft] Recent opinions quoted in NBP circles indicate that 
it is perfectly feasible to accelerate the rate of inflation. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] You are talking about the so-called 
press-generated facts, which create their own reality and 
reinforce public expectations of continually increasing 
inflation as if a proportion of the press believes in the 
principle that the worse things look for the present government, 
the better for them. I believe that, regardless of our 
individual sense of financial ease and comfort, we should all be 
interested in stabilizing inflation at a reasonably low level. 
  [Kreft] But press commentators suggest that this is 
positively the last moment to increase the rate of inflation.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must stay cool and watch the 
developments calmly. I can only say that we hold constant 
discussions on precisely that subject. 
  [Kreft] It is hardly reasonable to expect that inflation 
will be stemmed without the need for sacrifices and without 
lowering the level of social benefits expenditure. Don't 
believe that we have again arrived at a moment when it will be 
necessary to tighten our belts? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] The problem lies not so much in being 
forced to lower the social benefits expenditure but in changing 
the entire concept of budgetary expenditure as such. I am, of 
course, speaking here of the huge sums allocated to social 
benefits funds in the past budgets. Over the past few years, we 
have not been able to bring about a reform of the social 
insurance system, and this has made a vital difference to the 
independence of decisions in the sphere of public finance. We 
cannot begin to hope for a decrease in inflation to a level 
below 20 percent without some radical cuts. In this sense, 
Poland is very much like Hungary, where they now have inflation 
on the order of 23 percent, and where they cannot even begin to 
reduce it because they also have been unsuccessful in dealing 
with the basic underlying difficulties. 
  [Kreft] Do you agree with the claim that our greatest 
financial threat comes from the need to service the internal 
debt? The only noninflationary way to reduce the deficit would 
be teh purchase of our treasury bonds by foreign banks. But the 
latter are not at all keen to buy them.... 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Because, among other things, they are 
afraid of devaluation. It is true that the servicing of our 
internal debt does present great difficulties at the moment. We 
are facing a whole range of so-called inflexible expenses, which 
seriously hamper our ability to maneuver within the budget 
framework. On the other hand, I am pleased that that problem 
has now, at long last, been noticed and acknowledged. 
  [Kreft] How do you assess the development of the Stock 
Exchange? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] So far, our Stock Exchange has enjoyed 
the opinion of being the best in the countries of the former 
socialist bloc, as well as enjoying a high--maybe even too 
high--degree of public confidence. The Stock Exchange is an 
institution of the market economy system, and the latter is only 
now beginning to expand in our country--hence, a number of 
anomalies that are perfectly natural at this stage. However, it 
would be dangerous to overestimate it and place excessive 
emphasis on stock exchange operations at this stage. That is 
why it is vitally necessary that the Stock Exchange be expanded 
and that many more companies enter it soon. This will make it 
much more stable. I believe that this is exactly what will 
happen. Minister Kaczmarek is determined to privatize further 
enterprises as soon as possible. 
  [Kreft] You are very protective of the watertight quality of 
our banking system. How, then, do you assess the unrestricted 
freedom of draining stock exchange profits away from our country 
by foreign investors? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Without them, the stock exchange would 
not be able to develop at all. 
  [Kreft] The stock exchange and the banks are seen as good 
places for laundering dirty money. How much truth is there in 
that belief? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I believe that we have very good and 
very precise legislative regulations protecting our banking 
system against that danger. We are able to check up on our bank 
investors, and we have a good system of verifying their agents' 
credentials. There have been instances in which, at our 
insistence that they disclose the identity of the true 
investors, such agents withdrew their offers to invest their 
capital in our banks. Among other things, this is also one of 
the reasons behind our decision to engage the NBP in the 
operation of restoring Prosper Bank and the First Commercial 
Bank of Lublin to financial health: The provenance of the money 
that was originally supposed to shore up these two banks proved 
on closer inspection not to be satisfactorily explained. 
  There is no doubt that the practice of laundering dirty 
money should be prosecuted by the law. It will not be much good 
if the only course of action open to us is mere monitoring of 
financial transactions. There must be statutory legal sanctions, 
too. 
  [Kreft] Where does the NBP chairman invest her savings? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the bank. I also bought some state 
treasury bonds in order to be able to claim personal tax 
allowance on them. 
  [Kreft] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Government of the Republic of </F>
Macedonia" after the closure of the Greek border with Macedonia, 
place and date not given: "Measures Contrary to the United 
Nations and the CSCE"] 
  [Text] "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia 
evaluates the newest resolution of the Government of the 
Republic of Greece, by which the activities of the Consulate of 
the Republic of Greece in Skopje and the trade of goods `from 
and to Skopje from the port of Salonika' are stopped, as an 
embargo against our country, as an act contrary to the 
regulations of the UN Charter, the CSCE documents, and 
International Law. By this act, the Greek side showed 
disrespect for the decision of the EC European Council at the 
Edinburgh Summit of 12 December 1992, according to which our 
country must be allowed a regular oil supply. Such unilateral 
and unacceptable measures applied by the Greek Government are of 
special concern because they are contrary to the UN Security 
Council resolution by which Macedonia and Greece are committed 
to overcome their differences through negotiations, with the 
mediation of the United Nations, and thus contribute to the 
promotion of peace and stability in the region. 
  "The Republic of Macedonia had, and still has, a peaceful 
position regarding all events on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia, it is outside the war, and it has done its best to 
construct a democratic society and a market economy, to settle 
interethnic relations through dialogue and tolerance. As far as 
the dispute with Greece is concerned, it has demonstrated 
maximum flexibility and good will in solving the outstanding 
questions. This Macedonian attitude is known to the whole 
world. Macedonia succeeded in maintaining peace and stability 
in the country, thus becoming a factor of peace and stability in 
the region. 
  "Therefore, at a time when the international community is 
involving great efforts for a peaceful and agreed solution of 
the most complicated problem, the stopping of the war in Bosnia 
included, it is a puzzle that Greece, a member of the United 
Nations, the CSCE, NATO, the European Council, and now current 
chairman of the European Union, undertakes such measures against 
our independent and peaceful country, contrary to International 
Law. The Greek Government is introducing them with the goal of 
applying economic, political, and other pressures against our 
country, using the fact that our country has no exit to the sea. 
  "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia wishes to 
emphasize that great damage is being done to the lasting 
interests of the two countries and peoples, as well as to future 
mutual relations and cooperation, for which Greece is 
responsible. Contrary to that, Macedonia remains firm in its 
determination for good relations with all its neighbors, 
including its southern neighbor, and it is ready to resume the 
Macedonian-Greek dialogue. 
  "The Government of the Republic of Macedonia will cautiously 
observe all the possible consequences of the Greek blockade, 
which has in no way been caused by the Macedonian side, and it 
will undertake all necessary measures and activities on the 
international plan in that regard."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Andonovski: "Athens' Last `Trump'"] </F>
  [Text] Andreas Papandreou has once again shown that he can 
surprise us, but unfortunately, this time it was an unpleasant 
surprise. The resolution of the Greek Government that put a 
stop to the Greek Consulate's activities in Skopje and blocked 
the trade of goods from the port of Salonika has certainly 
indicated that after assuming, more or less, the role of 
observer the past few months, Greece decided this was the proper 
time to flex its muscles -- by using the only trumps it has 
against Macedonia. Of course, we here exclude the possibility 
of a military threat (after closing the border and withdrawing 
the diplomats, practically the only thing that can follow is a 
proclamation of war) and, at least for now, nobody even thinks 
this is in Papandreou's bag of surprises. Greece has embarked 
on a course of either losing it all or getting it all, evidently 
figuring it will get it "all," which can be interpreted as 
"accomplishing a change in the flag and correction of the 
Constitution." 
  To Macedonia's constant efforts to reach out, Athens replied 
in a manner totally inconsistent with the proclaimed stance that 
"Greece is interested in having a stable and independent country 
on its northern border." It is also inconsistent with the norms 
of interstate relations. 
  It is impossible to believe that Papandreou has ignored the 
fact that he is undertaking such an action during Greece's 
tenure of the chairmanship the European Union, with all the 
attendant consequences and blights to its reputation, which will 
be even more affected now. It is also improbable that Papandreou 
has not taken into account the statement made by German 
Spokesman Vogel, who said after the first Greek threats that 
Greece could not close the border with Macedonia because it was 
not its own but that of the European Union. 
  Why did Athens, in the middle of this seemingly unfavorable 
situation for itself, decide to take this step? There are only 
two possible explanations. It is either a desperate attempt on 
the part of the insulted, who had expected some concessions on 
the eve of U.S. recognition, or Papandreou knows a lot! 
  Let us imagine a hypothetical situation in which, for 
instance, Macedonia and Greece are prepared, or have agreed, to 
make a barter agreement: Greece will "get" the flag and the 
correction of the Constitution by adopting the minority rights 
article from their constitution; in return, Macedonia will be 
recognized by the United States and Greece will not veto its 
admission to the CSCE. If that is correct, then Papandreou's 
move can be seen as a kind of blackmail of the Macedonian 
Government, pressuring it to fulfill its part in the disputed 
questions without previous negotiations. 
  And there is more to it. Right or wrong, Athens considers 
itself outwitted by Macedonia and President Gligorov, whom they 
consider to be the personification of Macedonian policy. Is 
this not a "thug's" reply by the unpredictable head of the Greek 
government, who is giving the ball back to Gligorov when the 
latter's hands are practically tied with the closure of the 
border, even if he wanted to make a "gesture of good will." If 
he does not relent -- the problem will remain, with greater 
shame and degradation for Greece's reputation in the eyes of the 
international public. If Gligorov relents -- he himself will be 
accused of surrendering to Greek pressure, which could engender 
unpredictable internal political complications. All this 
written down on paper may look like yet another example of the 
Balkan inclination to overanalyze things, however, taking into 
consideration the twists in the dispute thus far, it is not 
unlikely that Papandreou will try to absolve himself, preparing 
a "trap for Gligorov" at the same time. If we read the 
essential part of his statement, we once again see the same 
hypocrisy as usual. Papandreou said: "So far, Skopje has made 
absolutely no effort to demonstrate its wisdom and moderation," 
which is a blatant lie. To begin with, Macedonia uses every 
possible opportunity to call for discussions on "all outstanding 
questions." Macedonia continually reiterates its readiness to 
sign an agreement on respecting borders, friendship, 
goodneighborly relations, and cooperation.... 
  Has Athens officially asked itself how it looks when someone 
is constantly demanding something, without an expression of good 
will or the offer of anything in return. We have yet to note a 
Greek gesture of rapprochement. 
  It would be difficult to minimize the closing of the 
borders, 
but it shouldn't be exaggerated, either. We say -- closing of 
the border, not -- "a halt to the trade of goods from the Port 
of Salonika" (as Papandreou whimsically referred to it, avoiding 
the unpopular phrase), because that is essentially what has been 
going on since yesterday. If the Greek Consulate is closed down 
there are no visas, and if there are no visas, nobody can cross 
the border. If trade is not allowed from Salonika, it means that 
fuel and all trade from Greece will dry out. Nevertheless, on 
the other hand, one should not overestimate the effect because 
it would appear that Macedonia has enough fuel reserves right 
now. 
  To its constant efforts to reach out to its southern 
neighbor, Macedonia has experienced a truly incredible reply, 
outside the realm of good behavior....

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 February (TANJUG) -- This morning 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic received Vitaly Churkin, 
Russian deputy foreign minister and the Russian president's 
special envoy, who delivered a letter from President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  The Serbian president's office has announced that they 
discussed the current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
especially the crisis concerning Sarajevo, which is obstructing 
the peace process. They decided that steps should be taken to 
discourage the supporters of the war option and encourage the 
forces of peace in solving the crisis. The calming of war 
tensions in the Sarajevo area is undoubtedly of great importance 
for ending the conflict. 
  President Milosevic asked Vitaly Churkin to convey his 
greetings to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whom he thanks for 
the assistance given in overcoming the greatest crisis so far in 
the peace process and in reducing the danger of the war 
escalating.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ljubodrag Stojadinovic: "The Fourteenth </F>
Threat"] 
  [Text] If our count is correct, this is the fourteenth 
threat to the Serbs that bombs will finally start falling on 
them. The situation is much too serious to allow for the 
counting to continue as a type of inventory of modern military 
senselessness. At the same time, it is hard to believe that the 
operation will really commence, even if complete agreement were 
reached among those who carry the entire risk of deciding to go 
ahead with an operation that could be a prelude to a great 
catastrophe. 
  It is precisely in the mechanisms of decisionmaking and 
communicating decisions, in the ways of understanding authority, 
superiority, and operational finalization, that confusion and 
systemic indecision reign supreme. All this could lead to more 
confusion and great dangers. The mechanism has certainly been 
constructed with the intention of being full of dangerous 
"loopholes," in which procedural steps get lost, and big 
decisions are made contrary to the norms of behavior. So it has 
happened that NATO has slowly, but quite convincingly, become 
superior to the United Nations and has managed to impose on Mr. 
Butrus-Ghali the insulting and somewhat rusty institution of the 
ultimatum to the Serbs. 
  The time allotted for fulfilling the conditions is ticking 
away. If nothing changes, if there is no drama in the hour glass 
of the great crisis and NATO's dangerous experiment, time will 
run out on 21 February. For whom? What will happen then? What 
will happen afterwards? 
  These are the questions asked most often, both by serious 
analysts and the worried world at large, and they all fail to 
get an answer because it really does not exist. The ones who 
are most passionate about dropping bombs are the most 
shortsighted ones. If it were not so, they would soon get over 
this desire. 
  Even NATO operatives, and the headquarters of Italian 
General 
Boorda [as published], cannot envision what to do after the 
first decisive step. For example, a "small" series of air 
strikes are carried out against the positions and [artillery] 
pieces that for some reason were not moved in time. And then 
what? Chasing gunners around the mountains is a painstaking 
job, which -- based on the customary habits of the group that 
delights in the easy job of hitting large targets -- means that 
the planes would then turn toward Serbian cities. 
  An attack on the cities cannot be hidden, but in France and 
Germany there is a firm conviction that it can be justified. 
Paris and Bonn are already talking about the "destruction of 
the Serbian economy," which, of course, significantly surpasses 
the primary idea about "lifting the siege" of Sarajevo and other 
cities. It is almost certain that it is not the Serbian 
positions, but rather the Serbs themselves, that are the main 
issue, as Mr. Clinton himself said, either indiscreetly or on 
purpose. The Serbs, and not their guns, are the obsession of 
the Western air force that, for its part, has been called on to 
finish a job that it does not entirely understand. At least it 
does not seem to understand the time and the results that need 
to be accomplished before the job can be proclaimed finished. 
At this point, there is no longer any need to talk about 
injustice, lack of evidence, and marketplace necrophilia. All 
those who, for some reason, believe that they are experts on the 
matter because they have monitored its development from the 
beginning -- providing, of course, that the beginning can be 
established -- are persistently searching for an answer to the 
following question: What will the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia do? Actually, perhaps the question could be 
rephrased: What are they planning to do with Yugoslavia? Has 
not a part of the question been answered by the public spreading 
of euphoric hate primarily in Belgium, Germany, and France, 
where the borders of the bombing raid are expanding endlessly, 
both in terms of space and intensity. 
  Perhaps the Alliance does have its internal answer to the 
question of what it would like to accomplish, but it does not 
have a solution as to how to do it. For the time being, there 
is no talk about the openly announced, but currently frozen 
variant of "destroying the bridges on the Drina River," which, 
of course, would constitute open aggression against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. The drawers with top secret 
compartments that contain documents elaborating the variants of 
the operation for the complex national punishment of the Serbs, 
also contain the outline of the Serbian mother territory 
[maticni teritorij], as an excessively desired, but as the same 
time dangerous, prize. It represents the unit of measure for 
the Alliance's degree of disintegration and the extreme fear of 
its suicidal catharsis. For the time being, the Drina River 
represents a rather firm border, which they [NATO] would like to 
cross, but do not dare, because this would almost certainly 
ignite a big fire, the means to extinguish which have still not 
been found. 
  Maybe in this way only a part of the answer has been 
revealed: How far do we go? If, of course, all this depended 
only on those who believe that they have a monopoly on the first 
and last steps. However, things do not usually work in this way, 
because it is only possible to control a war while it is still 
on paper. Once it begins, its course and fate are dictated by 
irrational turnabouts, regardless of whether they are natural or 
construed. Just like the series of media suicides at the 
Sarajevo markets, the irrationality of which was used as 
evidence, which, after all, is completely logical for the 
concept of modern warfare. 
  Today, it is still not possible to say with any degree of 
certainty what could happen in the part of the Balkans as yet 
untouched by war, and what could cause it to spread. Every 
attempt at air strikes carries a risk of this kind, and every 
NATO advance toward the Drina River could be an intentional 
risk, a walk on the high wire of the precarious stability of the 
eastern Balkans. Precisely this is evidence that NATO does not 
understand the full implications of the ultimatum, nor the 
ethical symbolism of setting it. Time has started to tick to 
the tempo set by force, and the question "are they going to bomb 
us?" has again become the everyday urban uncertainty. Because 
the people (justifiably) believe that bombing the Serbs in 
Bosnia would be an unambiguous message to all Serbs, and that 
there is no longer any reason for fear, because the uncertainty 
is far worse than all the threats. 
  What is being awaited, what will they do, and what will we 
do? There are no answers, at least not of the kind that would 
make more sense than looking out of the window into the dark 
night.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F>
Kosovo, by Oszkar Fuzes in Washington; date not given: "We 
Would Like an Independent, Neutral Kosovo"] 
  [Text] In case of a Serbian provocation, the United States 
will defend the Albanians in Kosovo -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton assured the head of the province of Kosovo where the 90 
percent Albanian inhabitants are striving for independence. 
Ibrahim Rugova, the democratically elected leader of the Kosovo 
Albanians, was among the guests at the recent prayer breakfast 
held by Bill Clinton. Ibrahim Rugova gave an interview to our 
Washington correspondent. 
  [Rugova] I had the opportunity to talk to President Clinton 
and Vice President Gore about the Kosovo issue. The U.S. 
position is clear: If the Serbs commit or provoke some atrocity 
in Kosovo, the United States will defend us. They already said 
that clearly one year ago. According to the United States, an 
explosion in Kosovo would inflame the entire region. They 
appreciate highly the fact that we, the Kosovo Albanians, want 
to achieve our goals in a peaceful way, free of violence. 
  [Fuzes] Is it possible to achieve your goal, the secession 
of Kosovo from Serbia, without force? 
  [Rugova] Yes, if Kosovo is demilitarized and comes under 
international protection. In that case, a normal and democratic 
dialogue can start. I have been proposing this for quite some 
time but, naturally, I am aware that the implementation of this 
desire depends on the future of this entire stormy region. As 
for ourselves, we would like, first of all, a free, independent, 
and neutral Kosovo, one open to both Albania and Serbia. This 
is also a compromise from our side because, for the time being 
and because of Serb sensitivity, we abandon the unification of 
the Albanian nation. I am a realist and I know that all this 
also depends on a variety of major-power interests, and the 
decision will be made at a future international conference. 
  [Fuzes] At least one quarter of Macedonia's population are 
Albanians. What is their situation like? 
  [Rugova] Their situation is made more difficult by legal and 
constitutional problems. I would like to see to it that these 
problems are solved and the Albanians living there can 
systematically participate in the normal development of 
democratic Macedonia. 
  [Fuzes] Regarding Serbia, there is naturally a big 
difference between the situation of Kosovo Albanians and the 
situation of Vojvodina Hungarians. Nevertheless, is there any 
cooperation between the Albanian Democratic League of Kosova and 
the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians? 
  [Rugova] Unfortunately, the Hungarians in Vojvodina are also 
subjected to great pressure and, in many respects, they have to 
bear similar burdens. It is our principled position that the 
Hungarians in Vojvodina also have a right to some kind of 
autonomy, namely a type of autonomy they would justifiably 
desire. We agree on this but, under the current circumstances, 
we can have little genuine contact and, unfortunately, we can 
hardly help each other. 
  [Fuzes] The most timely question: Has any political 
solution been left at all to solve the Bosnian issue? 
  [Rugova] No matter how difficult it is now to envisage a 
political settlement of the problem, one must try because there 
is no other way. If Europe and the United States are unable to 
put an end to this war, it will inflame Southern-Eastern Europe 
and later, perhaps the entire continent. 
  [Fuzes] Only a historic rapprochement with the Serbs can 
bring a long-term calm. Are the Kosovo Albanians ready for this? 
  [Rugova] If anyone, we are really aware of the importance of 
a rapprochement between the two nations. We are also aware of 
the fact that we must work hard for this. The issue at hand is 
that the Serbs should now become reconciled with all their 
neighbors, and this requires a change in the regime in Belgrade. 
Moreover, this would not even be enough. Unfortunately, the 
Serbs have become infected by the aggressive nationalist 
mythology that measures the greatness of a nation in terms of 
acquired and "ethnically clean" territories. It will take a 
long time for the Serbs to rid themselves of this sickness and 
become disappointed with their extremist chauvinistic leaders.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Josef Zieleniec </F>
and Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by LIDOVE NOVINY reporters 
"vik, has"; place and date not given: "The Czech Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Is Convinced That Our Place Is by the Side of 
the Allies"] 
  [Text] Prague--The issue has been discussed for several 
days now as to whether President Havel's and Prime Minister 
Klaus's views on possible NATO air strikes in Bosnia differ. The 
view could also be heard that the minister of foreign affairs 
rather backs Vaclav Havel's statements in support of air 
strikes, made during the president's visit to Thailand. In this 
context, we asked Josef Zieleniec a few questions: 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your view of possible NATO air 
strikes in Bosnia? 
  [Zieleniec] First, it must be realized that the world is 
still at a loss about what to do about this conflict and that a 
solution can come only from within the former Yugoslavia, 
perhaps with help from international organizations. Second, 
however, we also have to realize that the NATO countries' 
ultimatum is meant, first and foremost, as some kind of relief 
for the citizens of Sarajevo. It is an attempt to prevent the 
city from being strangled. 
  It was very hard for the NATO states to arrive at this 
decision, which is not only militarily intricate but also 
politically risky. I believe that, at such a moment, our place 
is by their side. If we use the word "allies" in relation to 
these countries, we should be taking this term seriously in good 
times as well as in bad--that is, even when decisions that are 
painful and difficult for them are at stake. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Prime Minister Klaus does not believe that 
there will be any air strikes. What is your opinion? 
  [Zieleniec] I have been in politics for too long to let 
myself be dragged into forecasting. Nevertheless, I hope they 
will not occur. Everything suggests that NATO issued its 
ultimatum with all due responsibility, and it seems that the 
warring parties, too, realize this. If the ultimatum is 
accepted as a serious warning, there need not be any air 
strikes, which is certainly the wish of all people who care 
about peace in Europe. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Should we back the allies only with regard 
to the ultimatum, or should we back them also in the event of 
actual air strikes? 
  [Zieleniec] The ultimatum cannot be detached from its 
fulfillment, for otherwise it would be empty rhetoric and a 
political mistake. 
  Minister of Defense Antonin Baudys, too, spoke with LIDOVE 
NOVINY about the possibility of air strikes. He said, among 
other things, that the NATO Council's decision on whether to 
intervene in Bosnia has its pros and cons. "The NATO analysts 
and strategists have enough information and are sufficiently 
qualified to know how to decide. I believe that their decision 
was correct. It is true, and it is also my opinion that a 
solution does not lie in air raids or other acts of military 
intervention but only in negotiations. As the negotiations 
still have not produced any results, however, it was necessary 
to exert stronger pressure on the parties to the Bosnian 
conflict to sit down at the conference table with a greater 
measure of goodwill to seek a compromise. This is how I 
perceived the ultimatum and the NATO Council's agreement to the 
possible bombing of the Serbian artillery positions. As far as 
our attitude is concerned, I do not want to foist upon our 
representatives ulterior motives in the sense that, when we want 
to be in NATO, we must agree with it. NATO surely will not 
request our cooperation now because we are not a member."

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "U.S. Investigator Is Yet To </F>
Come to Prague"] 
  [Text] Prague--The independent U.S. investigator who is to 
verify whether, within the framework of the [1992 U.S.] 
presidential campaign, the Bush administration really tried 
illegally to obtain compromising information about Bill Clinton 
has not arrived in Prague yet. This has been confirmed by a 
Czech diplomatic source who did not wish to be named for fear of 
difficulties at his place of work. 
  The claim by the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST that the 
investigator had already visited Prague has also been denied by 
Stanislav Devaty, director of the secret service. Devaty said 
yesterday that he was not aware of any such person having been 
to the Czech Republic. 
  The Czech diplomatic source said yesterday that the 
investigator was attorney-at-law Joseph diGenova, who had been 
given this assignment by the U.S. Department of Justice. He 
thus set right yesterday's erroneous information about the 
investigator's name being Josephine Di Genova. 
  The U.S. lawyer is to find out in Prague details about 
whether the campaign team of former President George Bush had 
requested from the Czech intelligence service information about 
Bush's rival candidate, Bill Clinton. This information, aimed 
at discrediting Bush's opponent in the elections, concerned the 
1970's, when Clinton, as an Oxford University student, had spent 
a few days in Prague with the family of [widow of Jan Sverma, 
one of the founders of the Czech Communist Party] Marie Svermova. 
  The WASHINGTON POST wrote that the independent investigator 
was examining a possible breach of law in the search for 
compromising information in passport forms filed by Bill Clinton 
in the past. In connection with the search for this data, in 
the fall of 1992, Elisabeth Tamposi was forced to resign as 
assistant secretary of state.

<F P=106> ["Cs.S."-signed report: "The Federation of Young Democrats' </F>
Foreign Policy Program -- Domestic Stability and 
Constitutionality"] 
  [Text] With the elections approaching, the parties one by 
one are presenting their foreign policy programs and UJ 
MAGYARORSZAG is trying to publish these as they appear. 
  In the coming period, Hungary's main tasks are to preserve 
the changes in foreign policy orientation that have taken place 
in the past years and, within this, to reintegrate into Europe, 
according to parliamentary deputy Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the 
National Committee and the Foreign Affairs Cabinet of the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Szajer presented his 
party's foreign policy program as part of a series of lectures 
organized by the Foreign Affairs Association. At the first 
forum held in the conference room of the Political and Legal 
Sciences Faculty of the Lorand Eotvos University of Sciences, 
parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, member of the 
Management Body of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and 
the party's foreign affairs spokesman was the other lecturer. 
  Szajer explained that the Fidesz's foreign policy concept 
rests on three inseparable principles, namely joining the 
European Union [EU], establishing regional security, and 
satisfying national minority policy. Out of these, preference 
has to be given to the process of European integration, and 
Hungary's domestic stability and solid constitutional system are 
the main preconditions for this. As a second condition, the 
Fidesz attributes special importance to establishing lasting 
conflict-free relations with the neighboring countries. 
  In the Fidesz's view, preparing the country for EU 
membership 
is the task of the country's future leadership. The preparation 
includes, among other things, grass-roots development that will 
result in organizational compatibility, new economic 
legislation, and legal harmonization. Szajer pointed out that 
the supervision of European affairs must be in one hand in 
Hungary; therefore, the Foreign Ministry should take over the 
leading role within a moderately decentralized structure. A 
realistic time for joining the EU must be set out and the 
program must be designed accordingly. 
  Talking about the other two pillars of the Fidesz's foreign 
policy concept, namely the national minority and regional 
policy, Szajer said: It is vitally important to form a delicate 
balance between the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond 
the borders and establishing good-neighborly relations. He 
emphasized the importance of legitimate national minority 
organizations -- the authentic representatives of the given 
areas -- and maintaining relations with them. On the issue of 
the borders, the Fidesz is firmly convinced that changing the 
borders cannot be a solution to any problems. 
  The essence of the party's regional policy is that it firmly 
supports all cooperation in the Central Eastern European area, 
including joint action by the Visegrad countries in the interest 
of integration into Europe. 
  Szajer's report was preceded by Szent-Ivanyi's summary. 
Szent-Ivanyi again expounded that the SZDSZ had drawn up a 
strategic program that has realistic and achievable foreign 
policy goals.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Feb (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic 
president Radovan Karadzic told journalists today that the Serb 
side has accepted a Russian initiative for the overcoming of the 
latest crisis around Sarajevo and expressed great gratitude to 
Russia. 
  Karadzic had two-hour talks with special Russian envoy for 
former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in Pale today. Following the 
talks, Churkin told journalists that in Belgrade today, before 
leaving for Pale, he received a letter from President Boris 
Yeltsin addressed to Milosevic and Karadzic; that is, the 
Serbian leaders and the Serbian people. 
  He said the letter presents Russia's stands, which are "in 
the interest of stopping the bloodshed." 
  "The Serbian side will have to remove all heavy artillery 
around Sarajevo," Churkin said and announced that the Russian 
Federation would prepare fresh troops to be dispatched to the 
Sarajevo area to take part in the peacekeeping operation. 
  This refers to 400 Russian soldiers who will be transfered 
to 
the Sarajevo area from within the Russian battalion currently 
deployed in the UN protected areas [in Croatia].

  [Text] Warsaw, 17 Feb--The opening of a new chapter in 
Polish eastern policy was announced by Foreign Affairs Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Commission on Thursday. Olechowski presented the main 
assumptions of this policy. 
  The Polish foreign minister declared that the group of 
states 
of special interest to Poland was made up of Russia, Ukraine, 
Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova, and Kazakhstan. According 
to him, these countries are important from the point of view of 
Polish political and economic interests as well as from the 
point of view of Poland's security. 
  "We are vitally interested in the strenghtening of national 
identity and democratic and promarket transformations of these 
states," stated Olechowski. At the same time, he added that 
Poland "would not be prejudiced against close ties between these 
countries" if these were established without violence or 
violations of democratic procedures. 
  "We want a clear warming up of the climate in our relations 
with Russia," Olechowski declared. Among joint actions that 
Poland intends to propose to Russia, he mentioned diplomatic 
consultations, exchange of experiences in the fields of local 
democracy and agriculture, and coordination of struggle against 
organized crime. 
  The minister emphasized that this policy of "openness and 
friendliness in relations with Russia" would depend on whether 
Moscow respects the "strategic options of Polish foreign 
policy"--that is, Poland's striving to participate in the 
European Union, NATO, and the Western European Union. 
  According to Olechowski, friendly relations between peoples 
in this part of Europe could be threatened by intolerance. "We 
are noticing symptoms of such intolerance in Russia," the 
minister said. According to him, the neo-imperial option in 
Russian foreign policy, which results from unwillingness among 
parts of the political and military elites to change traditional 
methods of thinking and acting, should be treated as a real 
threat. 
  Olechowski said that the independence of Ukraine had a 
"strategic dimension" for Poland. "We will act for this country 
getting its due place in international politics, corresponding 
with Ukraine's potential," he announced. 
  The head of Polish diplomacy underscored that the support 
for 
political and military stability in the neighboring region was 
an important part of the Polish policy, which would contribute 
to the building of European security. "Poland resolutely 
supports the process of linking the East and the West into one 
whole," Olechowski said. He underscored that, by participating 
in Partnership for Peace, Poland not only strives after 
membership in NATO but also wants to use the initiative for 
cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. 
  According to Olechowski, the creation of new possibilities 
for economic cooperation is an important part of Poland's 
Eastern policy. He announced that he would recommend to the 
government the undertaking and the implementation of programs 
supporting relations between individuals conducive to creating 
mutual capital links, supporting Polish exporters and making 
possible a better use of Poland's geographical position. 
  Olechowski also announced a program for supporting the 
development of the market and democracy in the countries 
encompassed by the Eastern policy. To coordinate this policy, 
the minister plans to appoint a plenipotentiary for Eastern 
policy in the Foreign Ministry and intends to suggest to the 
government to set up an Eastern policy council.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 17 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of 
the parliment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) 
"most warmly" on Thursday thanked the Russian colleagues for a 
statement of Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, 
which stated concern over the discussions at NATO about the 
possibility of air strikes on the targets on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  A telegram expressing thanks was, on behalf of the 
parliament, sent by speakers of the parliament chambers Radoman 
Bozovic and Milos Radulovic to their Russian counter-parts, 
Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Ribkin. 
  The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed 
comprehensive and binding sanctions against the F.R.Y. over its 
alleged involvement in the war of local Serbs, Croats and 
Moslems in the neighboring, former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  NATO threatened on February 9 to carry out air strikes on 
positions of the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, who clashed around 
Sarajevo unless by Sunday midnight (GMT) heavy weapons were not 
withdrawn to a distance of 20 kilometers from the center of the 
city or placed under U.N. control. 
  We are convinced that the appeal of your esteemed parliament 
for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, lifting of the unjust 
and inhuman sanctions and reintegration of the F.R.Y. into the 
world community would be inspiring for friendly Russia to 
persevere in such initiatives at the U.N. Security Council and 
that this would mobilize all the justice-loving countries to 
implement this idea, the telegram said. 
  The solidarity of Duma with the Serbian people "at 
exceptionally difficult circumstance" was assessed in the 
telegram as "more than mere encouragement", that is, "as a 
confirmation of the fact that the Serbian people, in its just 
resistance to outside pressures, has in the Russian people a 
true friend and full understanding and support."

  [Text] Tirana, February 17 (ATA) -- The investigations on 
the penal case in charge of the defendants Fatos Thanas Nano, 
Sokrat Spiro Plaka, Robert Irakli Gjini and Hasan Halim Allko 
concluded on February 15, 1994, the Attorney's Office of Tirana 
reports. The former Premier Nano is accused for the crime of 
the peculation of the state property in large proportions, in 
the role of person in help, in the sum of 9.4 milliard [billion] 
lireta or 73,780,000 leks as well as for the crime of the 
falsification of the official documents, a penal case foreseen 
in the Articles 62 and 110 of the Penal Code. 
  The accuse against Mr. Fatos Nano is connected with the aid 
of 23 milliard lireta rendered Albania by the people and the 
Italian Government in the period February 1991 until June 1991, 
the time when the defendant was in the high-ranking function of 
the premier of the country. According to the report of the 
Tirana Attorney's Office, the Premier Nano is responsible for 
the appointment of the firm Levante Co of Bari with executive 
director, Giuseppe Perniola, for the promotion of the Italian 
aid in contrary to the procedures fixed by the Italian law. 
  He has avoided with direct actions the institutions and the 
specialized organs as the Ministry of the Foreign Trade and has 
appointed the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs to deal with the 
aid, executing the requests of Mr. Giuseppe Perniola, which were 
sent to Albania through faxes delivered by the defendants Ramiz 
and Arben Aliaj, as his partners. In contrary to the statute of 
that time of the presidency of the parliament, full aware of 
what he was doing, Nano has avoided the initiative of the state 
to reach bilateral agreements and its lack gave Mr. Nano the 
possibility to appoint Levante Co for the promotion of the 
Italian aid. 
  He has appointed Mr. Hajdin Sejdia, who was his personal 
adviser for the economical and financial problems in the role of 
dispatcher in Albania. 
  According to the dictation of the Italian side through the 
Italian ambassador in Albania, Mr. Torquatto Cardili, has 
ordered the change of the structure of the food and 
pharmaceutical articles which were indispensable with goods 
which didn't response to the emergency of that aid. Mr. Nano is 
responsible for the non- promulgation of a law on the way of 
taking to delivering goods of aid considering the fact that it 
was the first time that articles of aid were coming to Albania. 
Such a decision was approved from the Council of Ministers on 
March 12, 1991, entitled "For the organization and the 
delivering of aid," which created real possibilities for the 
covering of the differences. 
  All these as well as the mechanisms of achieving illegal 
great profits by Levanto Co were denounced by certain witnesses, 
who held state governing functions. They testified about the 
following: 
  -- Dishonesty of Levanto Co. 
  -- The non-accomplishing of certain actions by the organs in 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade. 
  -- The prices of the articles supplied were some times 
higher 
than the prices of the same articles sold in the Italian market. 
  -- The changing of the structure of the articles from 
emergency articles to unnecessary articles. 
  -- The spending in naval transport were very much inflated 
and the payments for their transportation were not accomplished. 
  -- Nano, acting in the function of an assistance, ignored 
all 
these written notifications and ordered its subordinates to 
pursue their way. He didn't undertake any official step to 
prevent the illegal embezzlement of his collaborators. 
  -- Also the defendant approved two decisions of the Council 
of Ministers without their previous consideration in the 
relevant meetings with the participation of all the government 
members, this action is considered as a falsification. The 
defendant Fatos Nano has accomplished this penal act to create 
privileges and facilities for himself in the form of a reward 
for the role he played as a dispatcher of the aids promoted by 
Levante Co and Hajdin Sejdia. 
  Three other defendants, Mr. Sokrat Plaka, Rober Gjini and 
Hasan Allko are accused for the crime of the abuse of duty 
causing the state an economical state [as received] of 
73,780,000 leks, 399,390 leks and 144,821 leks. Based on the 
Article 105 of the Penal Code, the materials of the investigated 
case in charge of the defendants will be sent for judgment in 
the judge's office of Tirana.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- According to 
Minister of Transport Kiril Ermenkov, the future West-East 
transport corridor is a very serious project and it has good 
prospects for development during the application of sanctions 
against ex-Yugoslavia. Mr. Ermenkov is taking part in the 
meeting of the transport ministers of Albania, Italy, Macedonia, 
Turkey and Bulgaria that opened today. The transport ministers 
gathered to consider the prospects for building the corridor. 
Starting from Italy's southern ports and crossing the Balkan 
countries, the transport corridor is expected to provide an 
alternative connection between Western and Central Europe on the 
one hand and the Middle east and the former Soviet republics on 
the other. [passage omitted] 
  The Black Sea port of Burgas is ready to take over the 
servicing of Macedonia's exports and imports, the Press Service 
of Port Burgas announced. The port authorities adopted the 
decision in connection with press reports that Greece had banned 
Macedonia from using the port of Thessaloniki for its commerce. 
All interested companies conducting trade with Macedonia can 
use the services of port Burgas, the announcement says.

  [Text] Sofia, February 18 (BTA) -- Speaking in question 
time in parliament today, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov 
described the criticism to which the Ministry of Defence and he 
personally were subjected for having frustrated a Macedonian 
initiative as groundless and biased. Mr. Khristo Biserov, MP of 
the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], had accused him of 
"spoiling initiatives for cooperation with Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]" and "acting to the 
detriment of Bulgaria's national security and national 
interests." 
  Before giving his answer, Mr. Aleksandrov explained that 
owing to the fact that specific, delicate and classified matter 
is concerned, he had addressed a letter to the chairman of 
parliament, appealing that the issue be discussed at a meeting 
of the Parliamentary Committees on Foreign Policy and National 
Security behind closed doors. "No such meeting was held, so I 
will have to answer in principle," he said. 
  He pointed out that the Ministry of Defence accepted the 
Macedonian proposal that an expert commission be set up to 
coordinate military cooperation issues. "In 1993 the experts 
met repeatedly to discuss the possibilities and prospects of our 
future military cooperation," the defence minister explained. 
  He said that a project has been developed for cooperation 
between the Defence Ministries of Bulgaria and Macedonia. It 
will be signed after Macedonia takes an official stand on its 
text and after its final approval by the Bulgarian Government.

<F P=106> ["Prosecutor-General Tatarchev: Judiciary Organization Bill </F>
Aims at Temporary Restoration of Communism" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- Prosecutor-General Ivan 
Tatarchev said the text of the Judiciary Organization Bill which 
passed yesterday achieves a temporary restoration of communism. 
  The new provision requires that the chairmen of the Supreme 
Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, the 
prosecutor-general and the director of the National 
Investigative Service have 14-year service in the legal 
profession, of which at least five years as judges, prosecutors 
or investigators. According to jurists, the incumbent 
prosecutor-general Ivan Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman 
Ivan Grigorov, both of them lawyers, are ineligible for a second 
term. Thus only people linked to the former Communist Party 
will qualify for the top positions in the judiciary. 
  Asked by BTA what will become of the lawsuits against the 
culprits for Bulgaria's economic catastrophe if he is dismissed, 
Tatarchev said in his view they would sink into oblivion. 
  Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov said the full 
recommunization of all areas yesterday hit the judiciary. "God 
save the non-Communists in Bulgaria," Grigorov added. 
  The new provision was sponsored by Asen Michkovski MP of the 
New Union for Democracy. Zlatka Ruseva, deputy floor leader of 
the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), described it as 
discriminatory and aimed at recommunization. She said the SDS 
would approach the Constitutional Court with a request to repeal 
the law. 
  The bill is unlikely to be enacted in the near future, 
according to MP's, because many points remain to be debated.

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- The leader of the Union 
of Democratic Forces (SDS), Mr. Filip Dimitrov, is going to walk 
out of parliament protesting against the adoption of an act 
establishing special requirements for the qualifications of 
members of Bulgaria's Supreme Courts. Reportedly, Mr. Dimitrov 
informed the SDS parliamentary group about his intention 
yesterday, commentaries on the issue appeared in today's press. 
The SDS leader made a special statement claiming 
misinterpretation of what he had said. His intention prompted a 
series of explanations by representatives of the SDS. 
  In his statement Mr. Dimitrov described the adoption of the 
Judiciary Organization Act on Tuesday as an "open communist 
counter-revolution." "The SDS chairman's walking out of 
parliament, backed by the SDS parliamentary group, can be 
interpreted as a clear signal of our readiness to react strongly 
if the act enters into force. Until that time the parliamentary 
SDS must go on fighting," Mr. Filip Dimitrov said. 
  Several SDS organizations has recently proposed that the SDS 
MP's walk out of parliament to provoke early elections. In 1991 
the SDS precipitated the elections taking a similar step. By 
Tuesday, the day on which the SDS top leadership holds its 
regular meetings, the coalition had not taken a stand on a 
possible boycott of parliament. Representatives of several 
influential SDS parties, including the Democratic Party and the 
Radical Democratic Party, let it be understood that they did not 
agree with walking out of the National Assembly. Local analysts 
believe that the unity of the coalition, which already suffered 
a serious split in 1991, is questionable. Some of the MP's, 
opposing the SDS walking out of parliament now, took part in the 
1991 parliamentary boycott. In their view, such an act now 
would be in vain. 
  This afternoon a number of representatives of the coalition 
came out with statements commenting on the SDS leader's 
intention to walk out of parliament. It became clear that Mr. 
Filip Dimitrov did not actually walk out of parliament, but 
intends to do so backed by the MP's of the SDS parliamentary 
group in protest against the communist counter-revolution in 
parliament, as he put it. SDS MP Zlatka Ruseva (affiliated to 
the Democratic Party) said that Mr. Dimitrov's decision was a 
personal one. "We are going to consider some variants of 
action, Mr. Dimitrov's variant is one of the possible ways of 
action, but the decision is to be made at a general meeting of 
the SDS leadership and the SDS parliamentary group," MP Nikolay 
Khristov, deputy floor leader of the SDS parliamentary group, 
told reporters.

  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria is in no way 
involved in the attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II in Rome 
on May 13, 1981 -- this is our final conclusion," Mr. Rumen 
Andreev, head of department at the National Investigation 
Service, said at a news conference today. The investigation in 
the case has been going on for 13 years now, with evidence on 
record already filling two rooms. 
  Two years ago the Bulgarian investigating magistrates were 
allowed access to the archives and the information database of 
the National Intelligence Service, the Security Service, the 
Military Intelligence Service and the Military 
Counterintelligence Service, i.e. all the secret services which 
theoretically could have been involved in some way or another in 
the assassination attempt. "We have found no evidence 
whatsoever of some Bulgarian connection in the assassination 
attempt," Mr. Andreev said. According to him, the investigative 
proceedings have been suspended because Bulgaria requested the 
Italian and Turkish investigative authorities to give it access 
to the materials related to Oral Celik's extradition to Italy. 
  Visiting Bulgaria in January this year, the director of 
Italy's Central Investigation Magistracy, Dr. Simone, was asked 
to hand over the records of the investigation reopened in Italy. 
The case can be closed only after the Bulgarian investigating 
magistrates are acquainted with those documents, the news 
conference was told.

  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- As little as 11,000 
million leva, instead of the 12,000 million initially reported, 
will be budgeted for the Bulgarian Army, Major General Kiril 
Maznev, chief of the Defence Ministry's Military Economic 
Directorate, said at a news briefing today. The NATO 
member-states allocate 40 percent [as received] of their 
military spending for armament, while the funds allocated to the 
Bulgarian Army will be just enough for the payment of salaries, 
subsistence and some supply services, he pointed out. If that 
amount passes the vote, parliament must take political 
responsibility for the liquidation of the Bulgarian Army, Mr. 
Rusan Georgiev, chairman of the Independent Trade Unions in the 
Army, told yesterday's news conference. In Maj. Gen. Maznev's 
view, the trade unions should also assist the efforts for the 
allocation of a larger amount to the Army. 
  Army units commanders are to propose measures for making 
their activities more efficient and for optimizing their 
structures. A commission is set up to help solve the problems 
of Defence Ministry financing. It is chaired by Mr. Vladimir 
Penchev, deputy minister of defence in charge of financial and 
foreign exchange affairs. The commission is expected to submit 
its estimates for the Army's draft budget and for the most 
efficient utilization of all internal reserves by March 15, 
Captain Tsvyatko Donchev, head of the Defence Ministry Press 
Centre, said at today's news briefing. 
  No losses will be reported by the military repair works for 
the 1993 fiscal year, the output sold is 3.7 percent up from 
1992 at comparable prices, Gen. Maznev said. Local customers 
owe the military repair works some 192 million leva (about $5.2 
million) and foreign customers in Russia, Iraq and Libya are 
indebted to them for another $15.5 millions. According to 
General Maznev, the Defence Ministry's allocation for equipment 
repair will not be enough to put into operation all damaged 
aircraft, armoured machines and automobiles, nor will it be 
enough to secure orders for the works. 
  The military plants do not rely only on the Defence 
Ministry's orders, Major General Dragomir Ivanov, defence 
industry chief at the Defence Ministry, specified at the news 
briefing. At present, civilian products accounts for 23 percent 
of the defence industry total output, it is planned to increase 
their share to 32 percent in 1994. The share of military 
products will be 54.3 percent, Maj. Gen. Ivanov said. A 
contract has been already signed with a foreign customer, 
another two contracts are awaiting signing. Gen. Ivanov 
believes that despite the meager funds which the Defence 
Ministry allocates to the military industry in its draft budget, 
external orders will help the military industry enterprises cope 
with the situation for the time being. A variety of civilian 
products made by the military plants are already exported to 
Italy and Germany, it is worked jointly with the Kirov Works at 
St. Petersburg and the U.S. Curtis, Gen. Ivanov said.

<F P=106> ["General Staff Did Not Sell Classified Information" -- BTA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, February 17 (BTA) -- No information 
classified as state secret has leaked about the work on the 
Euroref International Geodetoc Project, Colonel Nikolay Ivanov, 
head of the Topographic Service with the General Staff of the 
Bulgarian Army, said at a news briefing today. The Military 
Topographic Service has carried out its activities in compliance 
with the operative list of state secrets, he stressed. Besides 
Bulgaria, all Western and East European countries except for 
Russia took part in the project, Col. Ivanov said. Bulgaria's 
participation was organized by the Institute of Applied Geodesy 
in Frankfurt which is financed by the European Union. In 
1992-1993 joint teams comprising representatives of the 
institute, Bulgarian military topographers, scientific workers 
and students determined the co-ordinates of 15 geodetic points 
in the territory of Bulgaria. A database is being build, which 
will make it possible for the geodetic and topographic services 
to harmonize the national geodetic network with the European and 
the world system of geographic co-ordinates, Col. Ivanov 
explained. This, according to him, will help solve some 
problems of the international air and sea navigation. The 
Bulgarian system of co-ordinates is top secret and the 
Frankfurt-based institute has no methodology that would enable 
it to get classified data on the co-ordinates of geodetic points 
in Bulgaria, Col. Ivanov said. 
  He denied the allegations that appeared in DEMOKRATSIYA that 
classified information about Bulgaria's topography had leaked to 
the West and Turkey. Today's issue of DEMOKRATSIYA leads with 
an article describing the inclusion of the General Staff of the 
Bulgarian Army in the Euroref Project as "an unprecedented 
blunder" and "treason." Not mentioning names, the paper cites 
the opinion of top military officials who said that the 
Bulgarian supreme commander-in-chief, President Zhelyu Zhelev, 
must hold the General Staff chief and the Army's civil 
leadership responsible for having sold state secrets. There 
were no Turkish military experts in the teams working in 
Bulgaria on the Euroref Project, Col. Ivanov said. There were no 
Bulgarian military experts in the teams implementing the project 
in Turkey either, he went on to say. The head of the General 
Staff Topographic Service denied the allegations that the 
Bulgarian military working in the geodetic teams had been paid 
handsomely. DEMOKRATSIYA's source is inaccurate and 
ill-meaning, Col. Ivanov said describing the article as an 
attempt to discredit the Bulgarian Army's Topographic Service 
and its General Staff.

  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- Parliament passed an 
act today withdrawing reservations to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions and for adopting a declaration under Article 90, 
Section 2 (a) of the First Additional Protocol with the 1949 
Geneva Conventions. Bulgaria withdraws its reservations on 
Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the 
Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces, on Article 10 
of the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the 
Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, on 
Articles 10, 12 and 85 on the Convention Relative to the 
Treatment of Prisoners of War, and on Articles 11 and 45 of the 
Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
Time of War. 
  By a special act parliament ratified the Treaty for Friendly 
Relations and Cooperation Between Bulgaria and Belarus signed in 
October 1993 in Sofia. The treaty outlines the basic trends in 
cooperation in trade and payments, education, science, culture 
and transport. 
  By a special act parliament ratified the "Open Skies" Treaty 
signed in March 1992 in Helsinki. The treaty regulates 
reconnaissance flights by unarmed aircraft over the signatories, 
outlining a complex system of quotas and agreed technology. 
  Parliament ratified Bulgaria's credit agreement with Japan's 
Export-Import Bank signed last June in Tokyo. The agreement is 
for U.S.$100 million. The loan is extended in the form of 
co-financing the World Bank's structural adjustment loan. "The 
loan is granted at a time when this country is actually isolated 
in the international credit market and will have a positive 
effect on the stabilization of Bulgaria's economy and its 
successful adjustment to market principles," the prime minister 
wrote in his request to parliament for the ratification of the 
agreement. 
  Parliament also ratified the financial agreement between 
Bulgaria and the European Investment Bank (the Bulgarian 
Airspace Development and Control Project) signed in Luxembourg 
last July. The agreement is for ECU 30 million and will help 
upgrade Bulgaria's system of air navigation services. 
  Parliament passed on second reading parts of the road 
traffic 
law. 
  The registration of a fifth parliamentary group -- 
"Nezavisimost" ("Independence"), was announced today. It 
comprises deputies who left the ethnic Turks' Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the anti-communist Union of 
Democratic Forces and the coalition of the formerly communist 
Socialists. Making this announcement, National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that the "tendency towards a 
multiplication of parliamentary groups does not contribute to 
political stability." "The new formations are established far 
from the electors and create certain difficulties in 
parliament's work," Mr. Yordanov said. 
  At the beginning of today's sitting Socialist MP Yanaki 
Stoilov announced that the parliamentary faction of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is ready to discuss the closing 
down of the Legislative Committee in order to unblock the 
legislative process. Mr. Stoilov demanded changes in the 
Parliamentary Rules of Procedure which would no longer make it 
possible for the Legislative Committee to stop bills. According 
to Mr. Stoilov many important bills are being held up in the 
Legislative Committee. 
  According to Mr. Nino Stavrov MP of the BSP, at a session of 
the Parliamentary National Security Committee earlier today, 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said that Bulgaria's stand 
on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is neutrality. "This 
country is for a peaceful solution of the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia," Mr. Daskalov said, according to Mr. Stavrov. The 
committee heard today Colonel Stefan Dimitrov nominated as chief 
of the National Security Service. 
  DPS MP's had talks today with Finance Minister Stoyan 
Aleksandrov. The DPS asked for the allocation of more funds to 
the construction to country roads.

  [Text] Sofia, February 16 (BTA) -- Unemployment in 
Bulgaria hit 16.53 percent of the workforce in late January 
1994, rising 0.15 points from December 1993, the National 
Employment Service with the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Affairs today told BTA. 
  The unemployed numbered 632,000. The jobless rate was 
highest in Montana (northwestern Bulgaria) (23.9 percent) and 
lowest in Sofia (8.3 percent). Only one-third have a right to a 
compensation or social benefits. Data shows the number of 
jobless persons under 30 kept falling as it did in late 1993, 
which is seen as a positive trend. 
  Job vacancies in late January numbered 8,200, with 77 
jobless 
vying for a single vacancy. Most positions were to be found in 
Sofia. 
  In January alone, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
paid out 240.6 million leva in benefits and spent nearly 3 
million leva on retraining.

  [Text] Prague Feb 17 (CTK) -- The parliamentary Foreign 
Committee considers the UN Security Council and NATO Council 
resolution on the possibility of air strikes in defence of the 
civilian population of Sarajevo a significant step towards 
creating conditions for a political resolution to the conflict 
through talks in Geneva, CTK learnt today. 
  The Foreign Committee believes air strikes do not represent 
a 
solution in themselves if the warring sides do not reach 
agreement. Consequently it recommends the opposing sides to 
accept the NATO resolution as an emphatic call for the search 
for a durable solution to the crisis, the Foreign Committee 
resolution reads. 
  The NATO ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw 
their artillery from surrounding Sarajevo and turn them over to 
UN control by February 21. If they do not comply they face 
bombing by American, French and British aircraft.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The frozen discussions 
between the World Bank and the Czech Government concerning loans 
of $225 million for aid to North Bohemia are not connected to 
the fact that state guarantees, being able to amount to not more 
than eight percent of the state budget, have already been 
exhausted for this year, said Premier Vaclav Klaus after today's 
cabinet meeting. 
  He said that the government had accepted by no means all of 
the World Bank offerings, and added that regardless of whether 
the Czech Republic should or should not accept loans offered by 
the World Bank, or whether or not they complied with the aims of 
the country, scores of meetings would have to be conducted. 
  Klaus stated that the government was aware that the 
possibility to cover loans with state guarantees had been at its 
limit for a few years, but that this limit had never been 
breached. 
  The government carefully followed the provision of 
guarantees, he said. Nevertheless, during consideration of the 
provision of a guarantee for construction of the 
Decin-Praha-Breclav railway link, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik 
had been requested to put forward data on the provision of state 
guarantees for previous years.

  [Text] Prague, February 17 (CTK) -- An article in the 
political weekly RESPEKT comments on the announcement by the 
World Bank that it was ending all negotiations concerning a 
second loan of $225 million to the Czech Energy Works (CEZ) to 
be invested into improving the polluting coal-fired power 
stations of north Bohemia. 
  The World Bank's decision to stop the Energy II loan comes 
just as the American congress is deciding whether to guarantee a 
loan of $317 million from the Ex-Im Bank to the Westinghouse 
company for the completion of Temelin nuclear power station in 
south Bohemia. 
  A report issued by the Bank Information Center, an 
independent organization monitoring the work of several large 
banks, gives lack of interest on the part of the Czech 
Government as the reason for ending the talks on the Energy II 
loan. "Our relations with the World Bank have cooled so much 
that the talks were not going well," RESPEKT quotes CEZ 
spokesman Michal Kacena as saying. 
  Kacena said Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was to blame here for 
having said in Washington at the end of last year that the Czech 
Republic was not so badly off as to need developmental aid. 
  Detailed reasons for the freezing of negotiations between 
the 
World Bank and the Czech side remain unclear, RESPEKT says, but 
very probably concern the inability of the Czech Government to 
guarantee the loan from its resources, which are almost used up 
from guaranteeing the first loan (Energy I), the Ingolstadt 
pipeline, the development of telecommunications and the motorway 
to Germany, and now possibly for the Ex-Im Bank loan for Temelin. 
  RESPEKT said the key question was put to the CEZ chief 
spokesman last week when the English-language weekly THE PRAGUE 
POST asked if the reason for stopping the Energy II loan was 
that the money necessary for state guarantee had been swallowed 
up by the guarantee for Temelin. The answer was "probably yes." 
  It can be seen once more, RESPEKT writes, that last year's 
government decision to complete Temelin is bringing the country 
a whole number of economic problems. Moreover, it is being 
confirmed that the completion of Temelin is using up money which 
would otherwise be invested into north Bohemia. 
  The two loans from the World Bank, which refuses to finance 
nuclear power in any way, are to help desulfurize coal-fired 
power stations and to make their operation more efficient. 
  If the Energy II loan is not forthcoming, CEZ has three 
means 
of finding money to clean up the coal-fired power stations. 
Either it slows down their closure program and does not 
desulfurize them, or it increases the price of electricity, or 
it exports electricity. 
  Already last year CEZ broke a government regulation by 
exporting around 3 percent of the total electricity produced 
here instead of the approved 1.5 percent. Most of this went to 
Italy and Switzerland. If this had not happened, RESPEKT 
writes, at least two of the four blocs of the Tusimice II coal 
power station [could have been closed]. 
  Last year the export of electricity brought CEZ 2 billion 
crowns. The completion of Temelin costs approximately 20 million 
crowns a day. 
  The Children of the Earth environmental organization wants 
parliament to approve a law saying that the annual export of 
electricity may not exceed its import (last year the Czech 
Republic exported 3000 GwH and imported 885 GwH). 
  Meanwhile CEZ makes no secret of the future export of 
electricity from Temelin. "Financing the loan for Temelin 
nuclear power station to the amount of 30 billion crowns will 
ensure without problems the future production of electricity in 
this power station and its sale at home or abroad. The 
repayment of foreign credits by future export (approximately a 
quarter of the yearly output for 10 years) would also help the 
Czech Republic's hard currency balance," the CEZ public 
relations department said in 1992. 
  At the close of the article RESPEKT points out that last 
year's report by the World Bank (the one which Klaus said was 
"written overnight in a hotel," and therefore held no force for 
the Czech Government) says that "the medium-demand scenario for 
electricity shows that there will be no need of electricity from 
Temelin between 1995 and 2010." The report was written by Dale 
Grey, chief economist of the World Bank's Energy and 
Environmental Division.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The environmentalist 
movement Duha [Rainbow] is demanding an explanation from the 
government and the Czech Power Company, CEZ, on why it has been 
concealing sections of international reports casting doubt on 
the Temelin nuclear power station. 
  At a press conference today, Duha member Jan Beranek claimed 
the movement had obtained from the Library of the European Union 
a copy of a report conducted by the Belgian company Tractebel 
and financed by PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary]-Energy. The first part of the report has 
been frequently cited by the Czech Government because the 
completion of the Temelin plant in southern Bohemia is described 
as the cheapest way of meeting the national energy requirement, 
he said. 
  The second part, however, which deals with energy saving 
possibilities in the Czech Republic, is suppressed, Beranek 
claimed. The report concludes that investment into energy saving 
measures would cost less than the production of electricity by 
any method, including Temelin. 
  A second study -- by the German Society for Nuclear Safety 
-- 
observed that progress at the Temelin site was in fact very much 
less advanced than officially claimed. It also produced a 
higher cost estimate for the conversion and completion of 
Temelin than has been published in the Czech Republic, Beranek 
said. 
  Duha also pointed to a World Bank report from January this 
year which allegedly showed that loans offered to the Czech 
Republic for the desulfurization of coal power stations in north 
Bohemia (the loans were called "Energy II") and for the 
recultivation of disused open cast mines ("Environment") were 
suspended because of the "unconfirmed interest of the Czech 
Government." 
  The decision will definitely slow the environmental clean-up 
of northern Bohemia, Beranek said. He added that the Czech 
Government had granted a state guarantee to the completion of 
Temelin probably at the expense of the desulfurization of the 
coal plants.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliament today 
rejected the proposal to delete a clause providing for 
establishing a Senate, the upper chamber in the Czech 
Parliament, from the Czech Constitution. 
  Under the proposal submitted by seven deputies from the 
Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party 
(SPR-RSC) the Czech Parliament should remain one-chamber. The 
Constitution provides for a two-chamber parliament consisting of 
the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate which has not yet been 
filled. It is expected that senatorial elections would be held 
this autumn. 
  SPR-RSC Deputy Miroslav Kasparek, who gave the reasons for 
the proposal, said his party had proceeded from the conviction 
that the Senate could not fulfill its function envisaged by the 
Constitution. Already during the first Czechoslovak Republic of 
President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk the Senate was criticized as a 
"layer" for elderly politicians who were already incapable of 
fulfilling their duties in parliament. He said the 
establishment of the Senate was not aimed at dividing power but 
at its ever more concentration "in the hands of one party."

  [Text] Prague, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The group of deputies from 
the Czech-Moravian Centrist Party (CMSS), whose constituent 
session took place on Tuesday [15 February], has been 
established as a successor to the deputies' group of the 
Self-Governing Democracy Movement for Moravia and Silesia 
(HSDMS), the group's chairman Jan Jegla informed parliament 
chairman Milan Uhde today. 
  The nine-member group is composed of eight deputies from the 
former HSDMS and one deputy (Jiri Drapela) who joined the group 
after leaving the group of the Liberal Social Union (LSU). 
  The change in the group's name followed the transformation 
of 
the HSDMS into the CMSS in January 1994. 
  The party electoral program remains valid, but the group 
will 
try to work out a detailed strategy in some points, including 
unemployment and housing policy, which the group's members want 
to view as national problems, one of the group's deputies, 
Rudolf Opatril, told CTK. 
  There are 12 groups in the 200-seat Czech Parliament: The 
groups of the government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic 
Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS), and the opposition groups of the 
Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party 
(SPR-RSC), the CMSS, the Self-Governing Democracy 
Movement-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS), the Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD), the Left Bloc (LB), and the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM). 
  Deputy Josef Jezek, who left the ODS in January, is the 
single deputy in the house, who is not a member of any party. 
  Immediately after the last elections in June 1992, there 
were 
nine groups in the parliament. Most changes have affected the 
groups of non-government parties.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 February (MTI) -- Hungary's Government 
has decided NATO's AWACS surveillance aircraft may not stay in 
Hungarian airspace during any air strikes on Bosnian Serb 
positions, Andras Kelemen, state secretary of foreign affairs, 
told reporters today. 
  The government has asked Parliament's Defense and Foreign 
Affairs Committees to discuss this position. Prime Minister 
Peter Boross will inform NATO Secretary-General Manfred Worner 
on the committees' conclusions immediately, the state secretary 
said. 
  The Hungarian Government agrees that the bloodshed in Bosnia 
should be brought to an end, if required, even by resolute 
military action. In the absence of a NATO guarantee, however, 
Hungary cannot take part in such an act. In view of the 400,000 
ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina and other parts of Serbia, 
Hungary would like to avoid even the suspicion of a connection 
with any military action. 
  Under the Hungarian Constitution, participation in a 
military 
action requires parliamentary approval. Since the government 
has not asked for such approval, the idea that someone use 
Hungarian airspace for an air strike in Bosnia cannot be raised 
in the framework of constitutional order, Kelemen said. 
  The AWACS aircraft patrolling in Hungary are monitoring the 
fronts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina but are not authorized 
to provide logistical support for any air strike, Prime Minister 
Boross told NATO Headquarters last week. He indicated that 
modifying the mandate of AWACS fell within the scope of the 
Hungarian Parliament. 
  "NATO has not asked us to allow AWACS aircraft to control an 
air strike on Bosnian Serb positions. Nor will the government 
ask Parliament to extend the AWACS patrols' mandate," Kelemen 
said. 
  The state secretary added that a Hungarian role in a 
possible 
NATO air strike in Bosnia could trigger anti-Hungarian hysteria 
in both Serbia and the "Krajinas" under Serbian control. 
  Hungary's charge d'affaires in Belgrade has duly informed 
the 
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry on the Hungarian Government's 
position. On Monday [14 February] the Hungarian Foreign Ministry 
informed Yugoslavia's charge d'affaires in Budapest. 
  Kelemen said the Hungarian Foreign Ministry did not plan to 
recall the families of Hungarian diplomats accredited to Serbia 
and Montenegro. The Belgrade Embassy, he said, has not reported 
that any Hungarian citizen would be in danger. 
  In reply to a question, the state secretary said that the 
Hungarian position on the AWACS planes did not influence the 
peace partnership established between Hungary and NATO last week.

  [Text] Budapest, 18 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister 
Peter Boross is sending a letter to NATO Secretary-General 
Manfred Woerner, in which he will ask that the AWACS aircraft 
not be in Hungarian airspace during air strikes on Bosnia, 
reported the chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Laszlo Kovacs, after a closed joint session of the Foreign and 
Defence Committees. MPs supported the government and agreed 
that Hungary should not be affected in any military action, even 
indirectly. 
  "The demonstrative absence mainly serves to reassure 
Belgrade, indicating that Hungary wants to avoid even the 
semblance of participating in military action," Kovacs said. 
  He recalled that no parliamentary approval is necessary to 
let AWACS patrol in Hungarian airspace, or to ban them: The 
government decides on this alone. But parliamentary 
authorisation would be needed for NATO to ask that these 
aircraft take part in military actions. Kovacs said no such 
request has arrived from NATO. 
  He admitted there was a dilemma in Hungary holding back from 
the conflict yet at the same time protecting relations with NATO.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Feb (MTI) -- The Defence Committee of 
Hungarian Parliament on Wednesday [16 February] held a hearing 
for Lieutenant General Janos Deak, whom the minister of defence 
proposed for the post of commander of the Hungarian Army. The 
committee unanimously supported the nomination. 
  The general, who is also chief-of-staff of the Army, is to 
replace Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, who is retiring. The 
appointment will be signed by the president of the Republic of 
Hungary, who is the commander-in-chief of the Army. 
  During the 90-minute hearing, Deak stated that the mood 
among 
officers is not too good. He said that improving this is not 
merely a financial issue, but that the social prestige of 
military careers must also be increased. 
  There is presently a shortage of officers out among the 
troops, according to Deak. On the other hand, there are 13,000 
officers in the army. In his view, this number is overly high 
and should be readjusted to around 8,000. Deak also said 
replacements should be ensured not merely from the military 
colleges, but also from the university of arts and sciences, and 
the technical university.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 February (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's 
exports amounted to $8.907 billion last year, down 16.8 percent 
on 1992, the Minister of International Economic Relations, Bela 
Kadar, told the press on Thursday [17 February]. 
  Imports totalled $12.530 billion, but this sum includes $713 
million worth of MiG fighter planes given by Russia to Hungary 
in partial repayment of trade debts accumulated in rubles before 
the dissolution of COMECON. When the fighter planes are 
deducted, imports total $11.817 billion, 6.8 percent up on the 
previous year. 
  Government moves made last September to boost exports and 
improve the trade balance resulted in a tangible rise in exports 
in the fourth quarter of last year. While the monthly average 
of exports in the first nine months was $716 million, it rose to 
$820 million for the last three months of the year and to $866 
million in December. 
  Customs statistics showed a trade deficit of $3.623 billion 
for last year, including the import of the MiG fighters. The 
trade deficit amounted to $2.910 billion, not including the 
import of MiG fighters, and to $2.280 billion when other import 
items which do not appear in the current account were deducted. 
  Exports of agricultural goods and food products fell by 26.6 
percent, while exports of consumer goods fell by 20 percent. 
The export of products manufactured on commission fell $758 
million, exports of grain were down $384 million, and food 
exports were $246 million less than in 1992. The latter three 
items made up 77 percent of the decrease in exports last year. 
  Ninety percent of the decrease in exports was in sales to 
industrialized countries. Western Europe continued to suffer 
from the recession, with 64 to 65 percent of Hungary's exports 
going to countries like Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and the 
Benelux countries. The currencies of all of these countries 
depreciated against the U.S. dollar last year. 
  Hungary's exports decreased by about 10 percent in volume 
terms when adjustments were made in connection with the 
appreciation of the dollar, Kadar said. 
  Exports to former socialist countries made up 26 percent of 
total exports last year, while imports from these countries made 
up 29 percent of the total. 
  Exports to the United States rose by 9 percent, exports to 
Poland were up 12 percent, exports to Slovenia were up 30 
percent, and exports to the Czech Republic and Slovakia were 
each up 2 percent. 
  Figures for trade with Poland, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia in the second half of 1993 had already begun to show 
the effect of the free trade agreement signed early last year 
which abolished customs duties and import quotas for 50 percent 
of industrial goods. 
  Imports of consumer goods from the former socialist 
countries 
rose by 59 percent within an overall increase of 7 percent. 
This compares to a 2 percent rise in imports of consumer goods 
from industrialized countries. 
  Agricultural exports fell by $700 million compared to the 
previous year, while imports rose by $100 million. Half the 
increase was accounted for by products which were not in direct 
competition with Hungarian produce, such as tropical and citrus 
fruit. 
  Exports of machinery fell by 3 percent, while imports rose 
by 
15.1 percent, excluding the MiG-fighter planes but including 
$150 million worth of Boeing aircraft bought by the Hungarian 
airline, MALEV. The decline in the import of investment goods 
ceased, Kadar said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 16 -- President Lech Walesa received on 
Wednesday a delegation of the Republic of Moldova led by Foreign 
Minister Ion Botnaru, the presidential press office reported, 
adding that the meeting, attended by Polish Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski, focused on bilateral cooperation and 
European security. 
  In the opinion of the Polish president, the security of this 
part of the European continent depended in a considerable degree 
on the economic cooperation in the region. 
  "Societies want to live better and more peacefully. The 
point is to add to these values, and not to go back or avoid 
problems of the regional economic cooperation. It is necessary 
to make use of all the possibilities," Walesa said, adding that 
"we were living in a different epoch, in times of pluralism, 
freedom and free market where there existed neither a frontal 
threat nor confrontation." 
  Minister Botnaru stressed Lech Walesa's achievements in the 
process of dismantling communism. He thanked the Polish 
president for such a prompt recognition of the sovereignty of 
the republics of the former Soviet Union. 
  The Moldovan minister assured Lech Walesa that Moldova would 
not depart from the road of reforms which would be continued 
irrespective of the election results. 
  The foreign ministers of Poland and Moldova, Andrzej 
Olechowski and Ion Botnaru, respectively, presented to the 
president plans of future cooperation between the two countries. 
While speaking about the Polish minority in Moldova, Botnaru 
said that soon there would be new legal solutions which would 
make it possible for Poles to get back some buildings where they 
would be able to conduct educational and cultural work.

to Poland. Botnaru met with leaders of the Polish Economic 
Chamber (KIG), including its President Marek Kloczko, to discuss 
the development of economic cooperation in conditions of 
economic transformations underway in both countries.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 17 -- President Lech Walesa Thursday 
denied suggestions from reporters he had played an active role 
in the recent crisis in the ruling two-party coalition. The 
president denied that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak had 
contacted him in person during the crisis. "We only talked on 
the phone twice and had contact through other persons," Walesa 
explained. 
  Walesa met the press in the Sejm building to explain his 
motives for tabling two draft laws on the adoption of the new 
constitution. He said his role was "to create a platform for 
social participation" in the process of those parties which were 
not represented in parliament. "I know that many segments of 
public opinion are not represented in this parliament, in fact a 
majority of social forces are outside parliament, and the 
president of all Poles must create opportunities for them to 
take part in creating the new constitution," Walesa explained. 
  Asked whether he would support protest actions planned by 
the 
Solidarity trade union, Walesa said it depended on what were 
they about, what were their aims, whether the protests would be 
rational and constructive. 
  Replying to questions, the president revealed he and his 
closest collaborators would soon move their offices to 
Namiestnikowski Palace, a historical edifice renovated 
especially for this purpose.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 17 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski told the Senate foreign affairs committee on Thursday 
that Poland would open a new chapter in her eastern policy. He 
said that the policy towards countries situated east of Poland 
should focus on developing good relations with those which were 
important from the viewpoint of Polish political and economic 
interests and Polish security. 
  Olechowski stated that the countries of special interest to 
Poland were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova 
and Kazakhstan. 
  "We want the climate of our relations with Russia to warm 
up," the minister told senators. He added that the desired 
openness and friendliness of relations with Russia would depend 
on whether Russia respected the strategic option of the Polish 
foreign policy, ie. Poland's striving to join the European 
Union, NATO and the Western European Union. Olechowski added 
that the neo-imperial option in Russian foreign policy had to be 
regarded as a real threat. 
  He said the independence of Ukraine was of strategic 
importance for Poland. "We will act in favour of Ukraine's 
acquiring a position in international relations reflecting her 
potential," said the minister. 
  Olechowski also voiced support for the process of uniting 
the 
west and the east and stressed that by taking part in the 
Partnership for Peace initiative Poland not only strove for NATO 
membership, but also wanted to cooperate with Russia, Ukraine, 
Belarus and Lithuania. 
  The minister announced Polish support for the development of 
market relations and democracy in the countries east of Poland. 
He said he would appoint a commissioner for eastern policy and 
propose that the government establish a council for eastern 
policy.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 16 -- The interior ministry, after 
consultations with the Defence Ministry, the Central Office of 
Planning and the Justice Ministry, reduced the number of news 
that under a government-proposed draft law would be treated as 
state secrets, department director in the Interior Ministry 
Ryszard Taradejna announced Wednesday. A special Sejm 
subcommittee has been working on the draft since December 1993. 
  The penal chamber of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled 
that parliamentary immunity relates not only to the operation of 
a deputy in the Sejm and its committees but also to his/her 
activity outside the chamber if it falls in line with 
parliamentary functions. 
  The ruling may be essential for the final dropping of a 
trial 
of leader of Centre Alliance (PC) Jaroslaw Kaczynski charged 
with violating state secrets in 1992 while revealing an 
instruction of the State Protection Office (UOP).

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb 16 -- The Sejm Committee for Economy, 
Budget and Finance on Wednesday ended the work on the 1994 draft 
budget law and accepted the deficit, set by the government at 
the level of 83 trillion zlotys (around 3.8 billion USd). 
Voting on the entirety of the 1994 draft budget law is 
scheduled for Friday. 
  The committee also accepted government-proposed amendments 
to 
the budget law, under which spending and revenue was increased 
by 3 trillion zlotys to 696 trillion and 613 trillion 
respectively. 
  On the motion of deputies of the ruling coalition, the 
committee did not vote on motions providing for increasing 
revenue except for one motion filed by the Health Committee 
envisaging increased excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol. The 
planned price rises would bring in revenue of 6 trillion zlotys 
but the motion was rejected by the committee. 
  The committee did not accept either any motion for 
decreasing 
spending and made only minor shifts in funds between ministries. 
The Labour Ministry was granted additional 1.5 trillion zlotys, 
while over 0.5 trillion was earmarked for Walbrzych, Lodz and 
Katowice provinces. 
  In the near future, the committee is to vote also on 
"guidelines for privatisation in 1994" and on "guidelines for 
monetary policy in 1994". 
  At a joint meeting on Wednesday, the Sejm Legislative 
Committee, the Committee for Education and for Agriculture 
accepted deputy-proposed amendments to the law on the system of 
education including amendments sponsored by the government.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/2/1994 -- Mircea Ionescu 
Quintus, president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) announced 
a new round of negotiations for Thursday, 17 February, aiming at 
the unification of the liberal movement, an initiative involving 
the leadership of PNL, the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), and the 
fraction of the National Liberal Party that adhered to the 
Democratic Convention (PNL-CD.) The Liberal Party-93 (PL-93) is 
also to be represented at the talks by a group favorable to 
unification. 
  Asked to explain the situation created in PNL after the 
so-called "anti-ordinary" congress called by supporters of 
former PNL leader Radu Campeanu, both the present PNL President 
Ionescu-Quintus and PNL Vice President Viorel Catarama said the 
only chance for that grouping was to register as a new party, 
and said that Mr. Campeanu's supporters "brought grave prejudice 
to the liberal movement and to the opposition as a whole," and 
that the new leadership intended "no purge" in the party. 
  "The National Liberal Party, one of the main engineers of 
the 
great union of 1918, has taken note with disappointment and 
apprehension of the irresponsible and strongly anti-Romanian 
statements of President Mircea Snegur of Moldova," a PNL 
statement read by its president at the same news conference 
runs. "PNL hopes that the true Romanians in the Republic of 
Moldova will be able to defend their national being and 
independence from these new attempts of turning Bessarabia into 
a Russian colony," the statement winds up.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Premier Vladimir Meciar 
is unlikely to take seriously his own proclamation on launching 
a petition campaign to support his proposal for a June early 
election date, Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) told journalists today. 
  Procedures linked to the possible calling of a referendum, 
along with the constitutional provision that an electoral 
campaign cannot be launched earlier than 90 days after the 
referendum, make it impossible for the June term to be saved, 
Simko argued. 
  He expressed his disappointment over Wednesday's [16 
February] parliamentary voting on the government bill to shorten 
the electoral term by a half. The proposal was rejected not 
because of failure of the opposition, but because of the 
surprising abstention of Hungarian deputies, he said. This 
fact, along with Wednesday's support for the "ill Slovak 
Government" by those deputies from the Meciar-led Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) who internally disagree with Meciar's 
policy, might affect today's voting on the deputies' bill 
concerning the same issue, Simko stressed. 
  The bill on shortening the electoral term submitted by the 
opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) differs from the 
government bill only in the proposed date of early elections, 
which the SDL wants in November. 
  Simko drew attention to the current "Slovak Government's 
extraordinary privatization activity." In view of increasing 
speculations on a possible no confidence vote on the cabinet, 
"privatization has been underway even at night," he noted. 
  KDH Deputy Chairman Emil Komarik said that Slovakia was 
facing the threat of dictatorship and loss of independence. If 
a temporary broad coalition government is created, the KDH wants 
to share part of the executive power, while supposing the new 
premier to be again a HZDS member, Komarik said.

  [Text] Bratislava, February 17 (CTK) -- Dismissing Premier 
Vladimir Meciar and his government before the amendment to the 
Law on Large Privatization is passed and a decision on early 
elections made is not a good idea, chairman of Slovakia's 
strongest opposition party, the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
Peter Weiss said today. 
  After the opposition's failure in parliament today to have a 
law on early elections passed, Weiss said that he gave priority 
to negotiations by all parliamentary parties on the date of the 
elections. He also said that the parliament could bind the 
president to calling a referendum on early elections in November. 
  Weiss expressed the suspicion that Meciar's campaign for a 
referendum would be led in such a way so that voters agreed with 
the exit from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of 
those deputies who had infringed party discipline, and would say 
no to early elections. Meciar would also try and join in the 
referendum the question of the date of the elections and that of 
whether deputies who had left the party to which they were 
elected should be expelled from parliament, Weiss said. 
  With this scenario, Weiss said, "difficult" politicians 
could 
be removed from parliament and the parliamentary support of the 
present government coalition would be guaranteed until the end 
of the regular electoral term in 1996. However, this idea would 
meet with "great resistance" from the public, Weiss said.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Frantisek Miklosko, 
deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH), said today he saw a solution to the current stalemate in 
parliament by adopting a resolution charging the president with 
calling a referendum to decide on holding early elections in 
November. The constitutional bill of the Slovak opposition to 
hold early elections in November did not get the necessary 
three-fifths (90) of the votes in parliament today. 
  The opposition does, however, have a chance to push through 
a 
resolution on referendum as a simple majority of the votes in 
the 150-member parliament is required for it to be approved. 
The opposition has not yet come up with such a suggestion. 
  "The resolution would be a way out of the current crisis and 
then the question what to do with the privatization law and a 
vote of no confidence in parliament could be discussed. These 
things should be decided by all parties on the highest level," 
Miklosko said. 
  "The prospects for the dismissal of the cabinet of Premier 
Vladimir Meciar have become very complicated," he said. "It is 
one thing to dismiss the government and another to compose a new 
one," Miklosko said alluding to the stand of the Hungarian 
minority coalition. 
  The coalition of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH) and the Egyutteles movement made it clear that it would 
support a new cabinet provided the opposition promised in a 
written form to meet the Hungarian minority demands. Therefore 
votes of the 14 Hungarian deputies could prove to become 
decisive under the current stalemate distribution of forces 
between the coalition and the opposition. 
  "The position of Hungarian deputies is very problematic and 
we therefore do not have enough votes to compose a new 
government by ourselves," Miklosko said. 
  Referring to the intention of the governing Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to start collecting 350,000 
signatures on Monday [21 February] to call a referendum on 
holding parliamentary elections in June, Miklosko said that "it 
was an absolutely unrealistic plan." 
  "I regard it as an unambiguous attempt to exert pressure. To 
call elections in June is unrealistic," Miklosko said, adding 
that if a resolution binding the president to call a referendum 
is passed by parliament it would become impossible to call two 
referendums on early elections.

  [Text] Bratislava February 17 (CTK) -- Deputy Chairman of 
the Egyutteles Movement Istvan Harna today rejected the 
allegation that the dismissal of Premier Vladimir Meciar and the 
creation of a new Slovak Government "depended" on the position 
of Hungarian minority deputies. 
  According to Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
Peter Weiss, the opposition is hesitating to vote out the 
premier because a new cabinet would not have a definite stable 
majority in parliament and its ideas would sometimes differ from 
those of Hungarian deputies. 
  "Don't let them make excuses about us. The opposition has 
enough votes to recall the premier even without us. If such a 
proposal is made, the Hungarian coalition will vote for it," 
Harna said today. 
  He added that the Hungarian parties had not formulated 
demands concerning a possible new government, because they had 
not been invited to. "No one has talked to us yet about the 
formation of a new cabinet," Harna said. 
  "We do not agree with the opinion of the opposition parties 
that it would not be suitable for the Hungarian coalition to 
take part in the creation of a new government because we would 
be allegedly adding grist to the mill of Meciar's nationalists. 
We cannot agree with this, because we are just as much citizens 
of this state as other people," Harna said. 
  "We are absolutely not against a vote of no confidence being 
made in Meciar's government. The creation of a new government 
is a matter for further negotiation," the deputy chairman of 
Egyutteles said.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 18 (CTK) -- The Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) will not support the rest of the opposition parties 
if they try to use their majority in parliament and pass a 
no-confidence vote in the government, Milan Ftacnik, an SDL 
leader, told journalists after a meeting with opposition leaders 
today. 
  After Thursday's [17 February] failure of the opposition to 
assert holding early elections in November, SDL Chairman Peter 
Weiss expressed doubts that a possible new government would 
enjoy stable support of a majority of deputies. 
  The SDL is evidently reluctant to assume responsibility for 
the mistakes of Premier Vladimir Meciar's cabinet which the new 
government would have to be tackling until the early elections, 
some observers say.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament 
has passed the government's bill amending the law on large 
privatization with certain alterations. 
  The amendment allows cabinet members to retain posts in the 
Presidium and Inspectorate Council of the National Property Fund 
(FNM), whereby they can continue to intervene in the 
privatization process in Slovakia. 
  Members of the FNM Presidium and Inspectorate Council will, 
however, be elected by parliament. The government coalition of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and part of the 
Slovak National Party (SNS) has a minority in parliament. 
  "Wild privatization in Slovakia will go on while Premier 
Vladimir Meciar signs the parliament-approved bill on an 
amendment to the Law on Large Privatization," Juraj Plesnik, 
member of the Parliamentary Commission on Administration and 
Privatization for the Democratic Left Party (SDL), told 
journalists today. 
  If Meciar does sign, however, it will lead to the separation 
of political power from economic power in the state, Plesnik 
said. 
  The passing of the amendment represents a victory for the 
opposition because the National Property Fund (FNM) will be 
liberated from cabinet influence. Meciar, who is also acting 
privatization minister, will lose his claim to the post of 
chairman of the FNM Presidium and Finance Minister Julius Toth 
will have to resign from the post of chairman of the FNM 
Supervisory Council. 
  Opposition deputies believe, however, that Meciar will not 
sign it, but submit it to the president, who in turn will return 
it to parliamentary committees for discussion. This will allow 
Meciar to continue with privatization as he has done over the 
last few days, when the government for example approved 20 
privatization projects on the direct sale of the property of 
strategic Slovak companies. 
  Plesnik said the amendment precisely defined the extent and 
manner of the use of FNM property. High-ranking state officials 
will be able to work in the FNM once approved by parliament, but 
cabinet members cannot, he said. 
  The amendment requires the FNM to present a fresh list of 
companies to be privatized and companies to be excluded from 
privatization. Parliament will decide when the new lists have 
to be submitted, Plesnik said.

  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- Until March 31 Slovak 
customs authorities will require the same documents and 
certificates at the Czech border as they did before February 11, 
a Slovak Finance Ministry spokesman informed CTK today. Finance 
Minister Julius Toth's decision became effective straight after 
the Wednesday [16 February] meeting of the Customs Union Council 
(RCU). 
  Today the decision was discussed with Slovak customs 
authorities, the spokesman said. 
  The documents specified in the agreement between the Czech 
and Slovak offices for normalization, metrology, and inspection 
will be required at the border after March 31. Toth's decision 
states that the two sides must agree on mutual recognition of 
testing procedures and certificates. 
  Yesterday Slovakia withdrew from the sudden and unilateral 
requirement it made on February 11 according to which no food 
products could be imported into the country without a quality 
certificate issued by Slovak organs. Officials said the measure 
was inspired by concern to limit the import of poor quality food 
products.

of the six with which Russia is partially paying off the debt of 
the former Soviet Union to Slovakia landed in Slovakia last 
night, a spokeswoman for the Slovak Defense Ministry told CTK. 
  On November 30, 1993, Slovakia and Russia signed an 
agreement 
to partially decreasing the debts of the former Soviet Union and 
the Russian Federation to the Slovak Republic through supplies 
of special equipment. 
  Under the agreement, Slovakia bought in December weapons and 
military equipment worth $180 million, including six MiG-29 
fighters and spare parts for various types of weapons. 
  During his January visit to Moscow, Slovak Defense Ministry 
State Secretary Igor Urban and his Russian partners reached an 
agreement that Slovakia will purchase other military equipment, 
mainly spare parts, worth $80 million.

  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, told SIM Radio in Bijeljina 
today that "with the arrival in Sarajevo of 450, and later 
perhaps more, Russian blue helmets--the war in the area will be 
over." 
  "The Serb side is very pleased with the arrival of the 
Russian soldiers, for if it had not been for the Russian 
initiative we would now have certainly found ourselves in a 
dramatic situation," Karadzic added in a statement reported by 
SRNA. 
  Speaking about possible tricks by the Muslim side, similar 
to 
the one in the Sarajevo market, Karadzic said that he had 
reliable information that the Muslims "perhaps even today" are 
preparing a new trick. 
  "We have informed Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, about this," Karadzic said, and warned that 
"after Sarajevo, Tuzla and Bihac will certainly become the 
arenas for stage-managed massacres." 
  "The Muslim people have found themselves in the most 
difficult possible position due to the policy of its leadership, 
a policy which counts on giving cause for sympathy and 
compassion in the world," Karadzic stressed, noting that no 
people ever gained their own state in such a way.

  [Text] Czech Minister of Defense Antonin Baudys made a 
proposal at an extraordinary news conference at the Ministry of 
Defense on the resolution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Martin Dorazin has phoned in: 
  [Dorazin] The main aim is stop the war immediately. If you 
do not give a solution to the warring sides they will not stop 
fighting, Minister Baudys said. One cannot, however, seek a 
solution that would disadvantage one of the sides. According to 
Antonin Baudys, one has to give guarantees to the sides involved 
in the fighting. 
  The basic idea of the Czech proposal, therefore, takes its 
starting point as the ethnic and religious background of the 
Bosnian conflict. We can stop this war if the states whose 
religious and cultural identity is connected with the ideals of 
the warring sides become the guarantors of developments and the 
overall solution. 
  Minister Baudys proposes to create an executive goodwill 
committee in the United Nations in which Russia, Greece, Turkey, 
Pakistan, France, and Italy would be represented. These 
countries would thus take over direct protection of the 
countries of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Baudys's plan is based on the fact that the solution must be 
sought with a long-term perspective and that an immediate 
solution is not known by anyone. A short-term aim of Baudys's 
plan is disarmament, administrative arrangements, and the 
punishment of war criminals regardless of their national origin. 
  Political and diplomatic activities would follow in the 
coming two to five years, as would economic reconstruction. 
Conditions should arise for putting an end to direct 
protection. This would be followed for a period of up to 10 
years by a long-term solution and an overall settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict.

  [Text] A declaration of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs describes the process of withdrawing heavy armaments 
from Sarajevo as a sign of hope in connection with halting the 
military operations and in connection with solving the problems 
at the negotiating table. 
  The document expresses high appreciation for the efforts of 
the United Nations, NATO, the United States, and Russia, which 
although somewhat belated have demonstrated that acceptable 
solutions to alleviate the conflict can be achieved on the basis 
of coordinated efforts. 
  As a country closely situated near the area of the conflict 
and bearing a heavy share of the burden imposed by the 
international sanctions, the Republic of Bulgaria has a vital 
interest in promptly finding a just and lasting solution of the 
conflict, the declaration further reads. 
  The declaration points out that in confirming its resolve of 
not interfering in the armed conflict, the Republic of Bulgaria 
once again expresses its readiness to support all international 
efforts aimed at a peaceful and just solution of the conflict on 
the territory of former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] [Announcer] With the emergence of the first 
manifestations of an armed conflict on the territories of former 
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria declared that it would never, under any 
circumstances, try to take advantage of the disintegrating 
federation's difficulties, and our country has kept its word to 
this day. That is what Prime Minister Lyuben Berov pointed out 
in a statement about the Bulgarian Government's stand on the 
NATO ultimatum related to attacks from the air against positions 
of the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo. Let us hear part of the 
statement: 
  [Begin Berov recording] Bulgaria regards the request to lift 
the arms embargo imposed by Resolution No. 715 of the UN 
Security Council of 1991 as an element of the military balance 
in the Balkans which has not been disrupted so far, as a matter 
of fact. The lifting of the embargo is not only likely to 
disrupt the balance, but would also cause an escalation and 
expansion of the conflict. The warning about air attacks 
according to the NATO Council ultimatum adopted on 9 February 
1994 deserves particular attention. It confronts 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and presumably other Balkan countries with 
the menace of an escalation of the conflict accompanied by great 
material damages and the loss of human lives. Any external 
military interference whatsoever cannot be a solution for the 
Bosnian conflict as such, as long as the three sides involved in 
the conflict do not manifest sufficient good will for a peaceful 
solution. The interest of Bulgaria and of all Balkan states 
demands that they should contribute to such a solution.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Zhelyu Zhelev by an unidentified </F>
representative of the Panorama political review program in 
Sofia; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Panorama] Is it a 
coincidence that you signed the Partnership for Peace initiative 
precisely at this juncture, at the same time that NATO imposed 
its ultimatum? Is there any connection with the ultimatum that 
NATO has given to the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Zhelev] There is no connection of such a kind, although 
certain mass media, especially some newspapers, politicians, and 
representatives of various institutions, have permitted 
themselves to find such a connection. No such connection 
exists. The simple truth is that the decision to sign the 
initiative was made much earlier, prior to the ultimatum. The 
coincidence in time is purely accidental. 
  [Panorama] Since only 24 hours now remain before the 
ultimatum expires, I would nonetheless like to clear up one 
point. Has there been any change in Bulgaria's position 
regarding the air strikes, and do any differences exist between 
the main institutions of state on this issue? 
  [Zhelev] I will permit myself here to reiterate extremely 
concisely the main points of our position, because it is very 
often distorted and misrepresented in an incorrect light. 
Bulgaria was one of the first countries in the Balkans to 
formulate its position clearly and precisely regarding the 
disintegrating Federation of Yugoslavia. As you will remember, 
we were the first to recognize the four former Yugoslav 
republics; we were the first to declare that Bulgaria will under 
no circumstances exploit the difficulties that the former 
Yugoslavia was facing; and we were the first to declare that 
Bulgaria will under no circumstances participate militarily or 
allow military intervention on its part in the events in 
Yugoslavia, that we will send neither troops nor weapons, nor 
embark on any form of military path. I consider that we have 
preserved this position until the present day. 
  At the same time, we asked the other Balkan states and 
neighbors of the former Yugoslavia to adopt the same position of 
renouncing military intervention in the conflicts in Yugoslavia, 
because such an act, even if undertaken for the most noble 
motives, may prove to be a direct way to drag the country in 
question into a new Balkan war, a war in which all the other 
neighbor countries of former Yugoslavia will find themselves 
involved. 
  Of course, we have to adjust, to correct our position to 
take 
account of the new situation that has arisen, but there will be 
no fundamental changes in our position, which remains one of 
active neutrality. We regard the NATO ultimatum as one of the 
last peaceful means, a peace effort by the European structures 
to settle, [pause] to contribute to solving the conflict in 
Bosnia and in Sarajevo, in particular. 
  One has to draw a distinction between the ultimatum itself 
and the actual use of weapons. These are two quite different 
things. The ultimatum is purely and simply a warning, designed 
to compel the warring parties to sit down at the table and hold 
serious negotiations, first and foremost on halting the conflict 
and then on gradually settling the points at dispute, about 
which they are fighting. 
  [Panorama] Have you heard whether the ultimatum is producing 
any results regarding the disputes? 
  [Zhelev] Yes, you are right. So far, the ultimatum has 
produced very good results. According to the information that I 
have been receiving at least, the Serbs are withdrawing their 
heavy artillery at a fast rate, while the Muslims are fulfilling 
other actions that are required under the ultimatum. 
  [Panorama] Do you consider that the Greek Government 
decision to impose a unilateral de facto embargo against 
Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
complicates the situation in the Balkans? 
  [Zhelev] Naturally, Greece is a sovereign state and is 
entitled to decide its own moves, its own steps in the Balkans, 
but I consider that to make this move precisely at this moment 
does not contribute to reducing the tension in the Balkans. 
  [Panorama] Mr. President, in conclusion, in view of the 
development of events around Bosnia, does any real military 
threat exist for Bulgaria? 
  [Zhelev] No, I can state quite categorically that no such 
threat exists for Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Report by Yovo Nikolov] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov has denounced 
Albania's decision to place its airports at the disposal of NATO 
aircraft for an air raid against Bosnia. This is something that 
we do not like, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov declared after his return 
from a meeting of foreign ministers from neighboring countries 
of the former Yugoslavia. We are against the interference of 
any Balkan country whatsoever in the conflict because it might 
lead to an escalation of tension in the Balkans, he stated. 
  The minister of foreign affairs returned visibly depressed 
from the Geneva meeting. No decisions whatsoever were adopted 
at the meeting; however, that was not the purpose. An official 
report on how the Yugoembargo is affecting the neighboring 
countries was released. The participating countries should 
provide their own remarks on the document. 
  Stanislav Daskalov was not aware of President Zhelev's stand 
on being inclined to agree with air attacks over Bosnia. I 
cannot comment on something that I have not heard, the minister 
declared. 
  Bulgaria has always declared to be in favor of a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict. If air raids should be applied as 
an extreme measure, then several conditions should be fulfilled 
in this connection. The first condition, in our view, is that 
there should be no victims among the civilian population and 
that the air strikes should not lead to an expansion of the 
conflict likely to affect neighboring countries. The question 
was discussed in Geneva, but none of the sides dared to commit 
itself with providing guarantees. 
  In Suleyman Demirel's letter to President Zhelev, there was 
no mention of an air corridor through Bulgaria, Mr. Daskalov 
said in confirming the statement of the Turkish ambassador in 
Bulgaria. As far as the foreign minister remembers, the letter 
called for support in case of military intervention or in 
connection with lifting the arms embargo. 
  Stanislav Daskalov reported that he had agreed with the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees Office on the participation of 
Bulgarian business companies in humanitarian deliveries for 
former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] We telephoned Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky and asked him the opinion of the Hungarian Government 
about Sarajevo. 
  [Jeszenszky] [passage omitted] Russian mediation played a 
significant role here, not only insofar as Russia has persuaded 
the Serbs -- who have always been inclined to listen to Russian 
advice -- it has persuaded them to withdraw the weapons, but 
also insofar as Russia is filling the vacuum, and that Russian 
troops, in whom the Serbs perhaps have confidence, more 
confidence, are taking over control, at least in part, in these 
areas.

  [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic Arpad Goncz 
has received Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Our 
reporter, who was present at the event, has just got in touch, 
so we go over to Jozsef Barath: 
  [Barath] Good morning. Arpad Goncz began his talks with 
Andrey Kozyrev with congratulations. Russian diplomacy has 
saved the world from the dangers which the deterioration of the 
circumstances in Bosnia might have meant, he said. And it has 
saved NATO from the loss of prestige which would inevitably have 
followed from an intervention, or from unavoidable withdrawal. 
  At the same time, Russian diplomacy has once again 
strengthened its prestige, which increases the region's 
stability. 
  At the discussion, which was longer than planned, Arpad 
Goncz 
praised the cooperation of the West and NATO, which has led, 
which could lead, to the negotiated settlement of the Balkan 
crisis. The key to this, however, lies in the hands of the 
region's people. 
  Kozyrev conveyed the greetings of President Yeltsin to Arpad 
Goncz and said that in making foreign political decisions, Boris 
Yeltsin begins with what would increase security. If Russia had 
been left out of the Bosnian settlement, this could have 
destabilized the Balkans and the whole of Central Europe. That 
is why there was a need for Russia to assume an increased role. 
  Russia supports cooperation -- the Partnership for Peace -- 
with NATO. And within the CSCE process, it is ready for 
cooperation also in the matter of the national minorities and 
other issues as well.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] [passage omitted] Peter Gyuricza and 
Edit Schranz report on the day's events at the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] congress. 
  [Gyuricza] In the spring of 1989 the sober majority voted 
for 
pure democracy, and not for anarchy or the patching up of the 
defeated system. And the question now is whether democracy will 
remain, whether the pure system, whose foundations were laid by 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum together with the coalition 
partners, will continue, Lajos Fur said, thanking the National 
Convention for its trust. 
  He described fidelity [hueseg] as an important expression of 
our day. He recalled that four years ago a promise was made to 
remain faithful to the spirit of Lakitelek, to its declaration, 
to the MDF. Now there must be a pledge to remain faithful to 
the traditions, and at the same time, also to modern democracy, 
to social market economy, faithful to social justice, to the 
idea of the nation, to Hungarianness [magyarsag], MDF Chairman 
Lajos Fur said. 
  [Schranz] At the news conference tonight, weighing up the 
1994 elections, the MDF chairman said it would be ideal if the 
party gained as many seats in the parliament as in the 1990 
elections. But Lajos Fur also added that he is certain that the 
MDF's share in the election will be between 20 and 30 percent. 
  Sandor Lezsak, MDF deputy chairman and Presidium member, 
said 
in answer to a question: The MDF will not conclude a coalition 
just to be able to take part in government. It seems, continued 
the party's executive chairman, that the policies of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party and of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
are irreconcilable with the MDF's program.

  [Text] [Announcer] The keynote in the maiden speech of the 
new chairman was the importance of the struggle against the left 
wing. Our reporter Edit Schranz asked him about this. 
  [Begin recording] [Schranz] Lajos Fur, you are the chairman 
of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. In the speech you 
delivered after your election, you said that the stakes at the 
elections in May will be the same again -- that was how you put 
it: Will there be democracy, or to be more precise, will 
democracy remain? Because, you said, the left wing today wants 
to regain power. Would you tell us what you meant by that? Or 
rather, could we understand it to mean also that if the left 
wing were to win in the '94 elections, then democracy could be 
endangered in Hungary? 
  [Fur] Yes, that is precisely what it's about. I said here 
too that they could hijack -- they could divert from its path -- 
the process that we began, which, with its circumspect policies, 
I am convinced serves the country's real interests. 
  And with the left wing, unfortunately, ideological factors 
always come to the forefront -- some kind of ideological things 
-- and these ideological matters usually divert the truth from 
the channel in which it usually flows naturally. 
  [Schranz] Just one question: Even during the MDF period, 
accusations were been leveled at it that, from certain points of 
view, it [word indistinct] in, or it brings in ideology into 
this or that decision. What is your opinion? 
  [Fur] They were wrong, false accusations and slanders. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Lajos Fur, the new chairman of the MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum], has pledged to continue the policy of Joszef 
Antall. In the Sunday Newspaper radio program, he stressed that 
there must be reconciliation between the churches and various 
strata of society. 
  Evaluating the government party's economic policy, Fur said 
that it has been possible to squeeze back inflation. He 
mentioned by way of example that in January price increases were 
barely above 3 percent, although they had themselves been 
reckoning with inflation of around 6 percent. Economic growth 
had already begun last year, he said, mentioning the building 
industry as an example. 
  Lajos Fur spoke about the situation that has evolved along 
our southern borders. The Hungarian Government's position is 
unequivocal: It does not wish to get mixed up in the conflict 
and it also declared that when it stated that in the event of 
conflict, NATO planes would not be allowed into Hungary's 
airspace. The MDF chairman is of the view that there will 
probably not be any need for NATO air strikes, because the 
warring sides in Bosnia will hopefully see reason.

  [Text] According to Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, 
a democratic state that rejects both totalitarianism and 
excessive liberalism has to be established in Hungary. In his 
closing address to the National Convention of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] Boross said that legislation should 
continue to be given a dominant role in the future. However, 
the executive power should also be given adequate scope. 
  According to Boross, there is a need for a foreign policy 
which keeps in view the integration into the West as well as the 
life of Hungarians beyond the borders. The prime minister also 
spoke about the responsibility of the media, saying that the 
country needed objective, nonparty political, but pronation 
[nemzeti] public service media.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova </F>
at Havel's country house in Hradecek; date not given: 
"Conversations at Lany"--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Hulkova] One of the topics 
affecting the whole world and each of us is the situation in 
Sarajevo, which is now coming to a head. Although we have no 
idea today what will happen at midnight this Sunday [20 
February], could we discuss some aspects of what might ensue 
from this situation? For example, how was this situation 
reflected in our political scene? That's not an uninteresting 
subject. 
  [Havel] It was not a simple decision. Many wise men, both 
politicians and military leaders, eventually arrived at this 
decision. It is quite natural that there are some in our 
country who present it as a problem and who highlight some 
related dangers or risks. 
  I think that we should not forget the main thing, which is 
that this might be a real turning point in this situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  I firmly believe that there will be no need to start bombing 
artillery positions around Sarajevo. I firmly believe that this 
threat will result in the genuine pullout of Serb units. I 
firmly believe that this might amount to the beginning of a 
process in which they stop mocking the whole world, when not 
only the Serbs but also the other sides realize that the world 
is genuinely interested in this matter, and when the process of 
searching for a solution to this situation can perhaps begin. 
  I believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina should be preserved as a 
state under the international auspices of the United Nations. 
After all, Bosnia-Herzegovina has been internationally 
recognized. We should concentrate on looking for some form of 
regionalization and federalization of the state. We should 
slowly but, at the same time, with all our might, look for ways 
of renewing the coexistence between these ethnic groups and 
communities in a single society. 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, spokesmen of the Czechs living in 
Kazakhstan turned to you with the issue of resettling some 160 
families to our Republic because of difficult conditions of life 
in Kazakhstan. Regardless of how this matter is resolved, I 
would like to ask whether there are differences in our approach 
to wealthy and not very wealthy foreigners who are somehow 
linked to our country. 
  [Havel] I would not suspect the Czech Republic of this. The 
case of the Kazakhs is very complicated, and I have been 
following it with considerable attention. Indeed, these people 
find themselves in a dangerous situation. In my view, our 
Republic should accommodate their request. But they are wrong 
to think that it is the president who decides about these 
matters. The president is not the chief executive in our 
country. I responded to their appeals by writing a letter to 
the prime minister asking that the government take a position on 
this matter and decide whether resettling them could be 
considered. It appears that at issue is a resettlement of 
individual people. Nevertheless, the decision is up to the 
government. It is a matter that should not be treated with 
indifference. 
  Although our state cannot be built along purely ethnic lines 
and although we cannot elevate the feelings of Czech national 
identity above everything else, I still think that, regardless 
of these people being rich or poor, we should have and we should 
demonstrate stronger feelings for those who originate from this 
country, who speak this language, and who feel some bond with 
this country. 
  [Hulkova] But, according to the man on the street, we are 
not 
very generous to those who are of little use, as it were... 
  [Havel, interrupting] We should discriminate against no one, 
I think. By saying this I think that we should not discriminate 
against the poor, who arrive here with nothing, with neither a 
roof over their head nor money. But I think we should not 
discriminate against the rich either. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] And now about the parliamentary session dealing 
with the bill on foreign trade in military material. Is it 
really true that it will substantially change the image of our 
country? 
  [Havel] I think it is a very good law, a very strict law. By 
itself, a law is not sufficient to improve the image of our 
country. What is important is the practice and the application 
of the law. However, the law is an important precondition. It 
seems to me that this whole area will become more transparent 
now. It will become clear what the state did allow and what it 
did not allow, why it allowed it and why it did not allow it. 
Of course, there is no law that cannot be bypassed by inventive 
people. It will be important that the law is really functional 
and not bypassed. That will be fundamental in securing a good 
image of our state. 
  [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Let us return now to the 
parliament. Mr. President, what adjective would you use to 
describe what happened there last Friday [18 February]? 
  [Havel] I would rather not use any adjective. However, I 
will simply say that I am very, very disappointed, even almost 
outraged. The return of property to the Jewish communities is 
being dragged out for too long. It is undignified, and it is 
beginning to be offensive. I am very alarmed by it because an 
impression is being created that we do not want to see justice 
done, and it even harms our reputation abroad. It is generally 
known why this law failed to be passed. An amendment was 
adopted, and it must be said that it was in accordance with the 
government's standpoint, that local authorities would not be 
so-called legal persons, which would mean that local authorities 
would decide whether these properties should be returned to the 
Jewish communities or not. In case they do not return it, the 
Jewish communities should be financially compensated by the 
state. The reason behind this amendment was an argument that 
such a thing would be a de facto expropriation serving as a 
precedent for appeal by other legal persons in other restitution 
claims. I think this argument does not hold water and is weak. 
I understand the reasons that led to part of the Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] and the opposition being reluctant to 
make the issue of local property ownership more problematic. I 
understand it from the legal and economic point of view and 
because of possible precedents. However, these are insufficient 
reasons for postponing this matter again, for not being resolved 
once again. I absolutely understand those deputies who then 
left the chamber to make it impossible for the law in this form 
to be passed. Next week, I plan to invite several deputies 
involved in this, talk to them more thoroughly, to understand 
their attitudes and arguments and find out if there is a chance 
to finally solve this matter and, if so, what kind of chance. 
  [Hulkova] Do you think that the way we are dealing with this 
matter is being observed from abroad? 
  [Havel] They are observing it with great attention, and I am 
not sure if these legal or concrete arguments that are being 
used will be understood as sufficient and legitimate arguments 
by the international community. I rather doubt it. It is 
likely to be understood as unwillingness of the state to release 
this property, although I am convinced that our state is willing 
to release this property to the Jewish communities. 
  [Hulkova] Let's talk about the visit of Andrey Kozyrev to 
Hradecek. Can you tell us what was the main idea around which 
your talks revolved? 
  [Havel] It was the future security setup in Europe. I 
explained our position. I even drew a chart for him that he 
regarded as a starting point for the debate. He himself used it 
to demonstrate what his own view was. I explained to him the 
reasons for our striving for future membership of NATO, my idea 
of relations between NATO and Russia, and the reasons the 
position of small Central European countries differed altogether 
from that of Russia. I also explained to him the specific 
features of Russia's position as a major nuclear power in Europe 
and Asia, a power that has to have a firm partnership with NATO. 
I explained to him that the (?eulogistical) nature of these 
relations will always be totally different from those between 
NATO and small Central European or European countries. I 
explained to him that even a possible enlargement of NATO was 
plausible only if solid relations with Russia existed. These 
relations could also be based on the Partnership for Peace 
program because this program provides for various types of 
relations. 
  On the other hand, he explained Russia's way of thinking to 
me--the reasons that Russia fears the further enlargement of 
NATO, which would eventually encompass various European 
countries without incorporating Russia itself. Russian society 
perceives this as some kind of discrimination and alienation. 
  What is important, I think, is that I had a chance to look 
deeper into the political ideas and the thinking behind Russian 
diplomacy. I also regard as important the fact that the 
minister told me that, following my explanation, his 
understanding of our position is far better. He understood why 
it was unsuitable to use the expression "sphere of interests" 
and why we showed such displeasure at Russia using this 
expression. 
  It was a very friendly and informal discussion and i was 
also 
a result of being in a home environment, but it was, in my view, 
a very useful discussion. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Czech Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda ended his 
visit in Great Britain on 19 February. In his talks with State 
Secretary at the Foreign Office Douglas Hogg, the situation in 
Bosnia was discussed. On his arrival in Prague, Jan Kalvoda 
told the Czech radio the following. 
  [Begin Kalvoda recording] Two days ago, I was assured that 
the determination of Great Britain, which is an important 
member, is unshakable. I think that in this situation -- once a 
decision is made and declared, it has to be carried out. I am 
not really exhorting anybody to any kind of shortcut or violent 
solution of a situation which can be resolved by negotiations, 
but nowadays, all political negotiations have their content, a 
degree of effectiveness, and it would be very harmful to accept 
a principle of never using force as a means of sanction against 
the use of force in mutual relationships. I only confirmed that 
our attitude has been stated by authorized representatives of 
the Czech state at an international level, expressing in 
principle our support for the NATO decision to use bombing if 
the ultimatum fails, with the proviso that no rational person, 
nor the alliance, would consider the bombardment of Sarajevo to 
be a panacea for ending the tension and war in the former 
Yugoslavia. Certainly not. [end recording]

  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Russian Federation and 
the Czech Republic met in Prague today for private talks in 
Cernin Palace, seat of the Czech Foreign Ministry. Their 
meeting was followed by a meeting between the delegations of the 
two states. Afterwards, Andrey Kozyrev and Josef Zieleniec gave 
a joint news conference. Correspondent David Stahlavsky, who was 
there, reports: 
  [Stahlavsky] Journalists' questions concerned two main 
areas--the Russian effort aimed at settling the Bosnian conflict 
and the position of the Czech Republic in the policy of Russia, 
as a superpower. 
  Kozyrev confirmed that no direct clash of interests exists 
between our states and that, when some differences do occur, 
they are generated by the complexity of the problems that have 
to be solved jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need 
to quickly draft documents for the visit of Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus to Russia, agreed by presidents Havel and Yeltsin 
last summer. 
  Minister Zieleniec said he sees no big differences of views 
existing with regard to our country's efforts aimed at being 
incorportated into West European integrational structures. 
  Kozyrev declined to comment directly on Russia's continuing 
to regard the Czech Republic as a sphere of its vital interests. 
The only interest he admitted was that Russian artists should be 
influential in our country and that Czech artists should be 
influential in Russia because both countries are interested in 
each other. 
  Responding to a Czech Radio question, Kozyrev said that the 
purpose of the talks is not that the Czech Republic should back 
the Russian attitude to Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, 
although the views held by Moscow and Prague are very close. 
The purpose of the talks is to jointly find an answer to this 
very complex situation. Russia has influence there because it is 
familiar with this region. It is evident that Czech foreign 
policy also has influence in this region. They should pool 
their efforts aimed at solving the conflict. 
  Kozyrev said he did not want to even think, let alone 
comment, on the new political situation that would evolve after 
a bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. As is known, Russia 
regards the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serbian artillery 
from the vicinity of Sarajevo as illegal and strongly disagrees 
with it.

  [Text] [Announcer] Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Andrey Kozyrev arrived in Prague yesterday on a working visit. 
Correspondent David Stahlavsky talked with Kozyrev about his 
planned talks with Czech officials. 
  [Stahlavsky] The Russian foreign minister is convinced that 
the talks will concern the Bosnian issue, among other things, 
because the stability of the Central and East European region is 
in the interests of all. Andrey Kozyrev said that relations 
between the Czech Republic and Russia are based on history and 
enjoy good prospects. An assessment should be made of the ways 
in which European partnership could be developed. This 
assessment should be free of prejudice and mutual suspicions. 
  Kozyrev told Czech Radio that he is against reviving the old 
doctrines on the inequality of relations. The main thing is to 
build a new, big, and united Europe. The Russian minister of 
foreign affairs emphasized that no one has a ready-made 
prescription for doing this. He went on to add: 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording in Russian, fading to superimposed 
Czech translation] Partnership for Peace is one of the variants 
for joining NATO. We do not prevent anyone from doing so 
because this is a matter on which all of the states, including 
the Czech Republic, will have to decide themselves. [end 
recording] 
  [Stahlavsky] But Andrey Kozyrev emphasized that there is no 
need to focus only on NATO and recalled the existence of the 
Visegrad Four, the CSCE, and others. There is no need to work 
against these forms of cooperation. All of the options should 
be used in the interest of political, economic, and cultural 
benefit, Kozyrev said.

talks, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec had tete-a-tete 
talks with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, in Cernin 
Palace [seat of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs] in Prague 
today. The two delegations' talks are focused on the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking about this issue, First Deputy 
Foreign Minister Alexander Vondra said that the Czech side was 
also ready to discuss relations between the Czech Republic and 
Russia and clarify issues concerning security in Central Europe. 
  Czech President Vaclav Havel is to receive the Russian guest 
in Hradecek near Trutnov [Havel's country house in northeast 
Bohemia] this afternoon. Kozyrev is due to meet Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus tomorrow [20 February].

  [Text] Following a meeting between the two foreign 
ministers [Josef Zieleniec and Andrey Kozyrev], the Russian 
guest was received by Czech President Vaclav Havel. Our 
correspondent Eva Hulkova reports about their meeting at 
Hradecek [Havel's private cottage] that ended a short time ago. 
  [Hulkova] The aim of my visit was to learn about the 
feelings 
of our neighbors, Andrey Kozyrev said during his visit today to 
Hradecek, where he arrived by helicopter. According to Vaclav 
Havel, their very intensive talks had one subject: the future 
security setup in Europe and, in this context, the role of NATO 
and the CSCE. 
  Havel and Kozyrev briefed each other about the political 
visions of their countries and about the social reality in their 
countries that influences these political visions. 
  Havel explained to the Russian foreign minister the causes 
of 
alarm whenever there are views voiced in Russia containing the 
hidden intention of including the Czech Republic in the Russian 
sphere of influence. Kozyrev showed understanding for this 
explanation and told journalists that, if the words "sphere of 
interest" evoked the past, he was fully prepared not to use that 
expression. 
  Kozyrev appreciated the opportunity to meet Havel, besides 
other things, because the Czech President is actively building 
democracy and a new system in Europe. 
  Regarding the [NATO] ultimatum [to the Bosnian Serbs], Havel 
understands it, but, at the same time, he understands why Russia 
was dissatisfied with the fact that it was consulted about this. 
  The two officials agreed that talks like the ones they held 
make sense and should continue.

  [Text] One of the main topics of the news conference in 
Prague today by the Russian and Czech foreign ministers, Andrey 
Kozyrev and Josef Zieleniec, was the position of the Czech 
Republic in Russia's policies as a great power. David 
Stahlavsky has the details: 
  [Stahlavsky] Andrey Kozyrev has confirmed that there is no 
direct clash of interests between our states. He attributed 
some differences to the complexity of the problems we must solve 
jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need to prepare 
quickly the documents on the visit of Prime Minister Klaus to 
Russia, which was agreed last summer by Presidents Havel and 
Yeltsin. 
  Although Minister Zieleniec thinks there are no great 
differences of view on the attempts of our country to become a 
member of West European structures, his Russian partner refused 
to comment directly on whether Russia continues to consider the 
Czech Republic to be in its sphere of vital interests. Good 
relations are the vital interest. 
  Kozyrev repeatedly conceded to all countries, including the 
Czech Republic, the right to join any international 
organization, even NATO. He documented it jokingly by the 
possibility of our entry to the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. Russia would not be against it. 
  Russia, however, maintains the right to express its views on 
the optimal construction of European security, which was 
confirmed by President Yeltsin in his letter to Western 
countries shortly after his visit to Warsaw and Prague, in which 
he rejected the admission of Central and East European countries 
to NATO before Russia. According to Kozyrev, however, this 
argument is no longer topical by virtue of accepting the 
Partership for Peace program. NATO is an organization with 
which one has to cooperate, and Russia will join this program. 
No organization on its own, however, can respond to Europe's 
problems, Kozyrev said.

  [Text] The Czech Foreign Ministry today expressed 
fundamental disagreement with the action of Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys, who, at the end of last week, submitted to some 
foreign representatives his initiative for solving the situation 
in Bosnia. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry's statement, the action of 
[Defense] Minister [Antonin] Baudys has created a totally 
unacceptable situation for the foreign policy interests of the 
Czech Republic, has damaged its reputation, and is a clear 
infringement of a government minister's jurisdiction.

  [Text] In an interview with journalists during his visit to 
Turkey, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys admitted today that the 
way his initiative was made public, without preliminary 
consultation with the government, was unusual. He said that he 
had been forced to take this course of action by the approaching 
deadline of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia Serbs. He said that 
his intention was guided by a wish that several ideas were 
tabled to the international officials who could make a decision 
on the issues concerned. 
  According to Baudys, a possible lengthy debate on the 
initiative in Czech political structures would have devalued the 
content of the document.

  [Text] Prague/Adamov--The Adast Adamov shareholding 
company has 440 KONKURS antitank guided missiles intended for 
sale in its warehouses. This information was given to a LIDOVE 
NOVINY correspondent by Adast Director General Jan Dosek. 
  Adast acquired the weapons, worth 168 million korunas, as a 
debt payment from the Slovak enterprise ZVS [General Engineering 
Plants] Dubnica, which made the explosive and propulsion 
elements of the casings for the missiles manufactured in Adamov. 
Dubnica went into debt in 1992 when the Federal Army (as the 
only customer) refused to take delivery of an order for 900 
missiles. "Payment in missiles was the only way of getting the 
debt from Dubnica," said Dosek. Adast Adamov has entrusted the 
Prague-based Omnipol company with the deal. It deals in the 
export of Czech weapons. 
  "So far, we have not managed to sell one KONKURS missile," 
said Jiri Sir, Omnipol's commercial director, to LIDOVE NOVINY. 
According to him, these are weapons made under a Russian license 
at a relatively high cost. Sir claims that comparable missiles, 
the French MILAN missile and the U.S. TOW missile, are cheaper 
than our missiles. He said that the weapons trade is going 
through a recession, and, moreover, the market is flooded with 
antitank missiles from the states of the former USSR. 
"Supplying these defensive weapons to UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] units offers us some chance," added Sir. He ruled out 
the possibility of a contract with any of the warring sides, 
however. Equipping the KONKURS missiles with an adaptor for the 
NATO weapon system and selling them to the Czech Army would be 
an extreme solution. 
  S. Fritzl, deputy director of the special materials 
department at the Trade and Industry Ministry Licensing 
Administration, told LIDOVE NOVINY that Omnipol submitted two 
applications last year for a license to export the KONKURS 
missiles; however, his department turned them down. The reason 
was that the international community considers the end-user 
countries to be high-risk regions. The Licensing Administration 
has not registered any applications this year to export antitank 
missiles.

  [Text] In the presidential palace today, Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman received Ambassador Charles Redman, the U.S. 
President's special envoy at the conference on the former 
Yugoslavia. Redman was accompanied by Ambassador to Croatia 
Peter Galbraith. The meeting was also attended by Jure Radic, 
head of the president's office. Ambassador Redman informed the 
president about positive U.S. attitudes toward the convergence 
of Croatian and Muslim stands regarding the securing of a 
cease-fire and the implementation of a final solution in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He supported Croatia's approach based on a peaceful solution 
and promised the international community's support in protecting 
the Croatian areas that are under siege at the moment. He 
stressed in particular the United States' readiness and resolve 
to contribute -- in parallel with resolving the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis -- to the establishment of the full 
sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia in all areas within its 
internationally recognized borders, urging the opening of 
communications, and restoration of economic links. 
  President Tudjman thanked the ambassador and the U.S. 
Government for their constructive and active role in resolving 
the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 20 (TANJUG) -- The talks between the 
Bosnian Muslims and Croatia ended in Frankfurt on Saturday 
without producing any concrete headway in the resolution of 
disputed issues. 
  Although Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian 
Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said after the talks that 
differences between the two sides had been narrowed, according 
to foreign news agencies, they did concede that the two sides 
were still far from any significant agreement. 
  Granic, who is also deputy Croatian prime minister, said the 
Muslim side was interested in a confederation with Croatia, but 
the two sides were still not in agreement about the future form 
of organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Granic said each member 
of the planned confederation would be a member of the United 
Nations. Granic said various ideas about the division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into ethnic republics or cantons and a 
ceasefire in central Bosnia had been discussed. 
  Granic and Silajdzic said the talks on future 
Croatian-Muslim 
relations would be resumed in the Croatian capital of Zagreb 
next week at the level of experts, after which they said the two 
of them would most likely meet again. 
  Granic and Silajdzic first separately met with special 
United 
States envoy for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ambassador Charles Redman. 
Ambassador Redman said he was trying to have the two sides more 
decisively approach the resolution of issues of their future 
coexistence.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ante Gugo: "Solution Even Without Pale"] </F>
  [Text] The Saturday meeting in Frankfurt of Croatian 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dr. Mate Granic with 
Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the government of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims, could, in the future, be interpreted 
as an event that marked the turning point in the war on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia. In brief, it is evident from 
the statements given by Ganic and Silajdzic that, for the time 
being, the two still-warring sides have drawn closer. Analyzing 
the factors that lead to such a turnabout, one should, among 
other things, examine a visit of Clinton's envoy Charles Redman 
to Zagreb, which lasted several days. If we view Clinton's 
address to the nation within this context, it becomes clear that 
the United States has assumed, without the possibility of a 
deferment, responsibility for bringing this war crisis to an 
end. One could also examine the influence of Zhirinovskiy and 
some other factors here, however, for the time being, the 
relation between the Croats and the Muslims is the most 
important, as it will ultimately determine the situation that 
will prevail from the Alps to the Ionian Sea. 
  None of the statesmen wishes to say a word about Redman's 
initiative. However, by analyzing the statements of Granic and 
Silajdzic in Frankfurt, it will not be difficult to grasp the 
contents of this possible solution. Dr. Granic reiterated 
Croatia's stand on the need for cooperation with the Muslims and 
on the possible cooperation of the future states, which has 
already been contained in President Tudjman's peace initiative. 
Dr. Silajdzic did not repeat his previous stand. On this 
occasion he spoke in favor of something entirely new, from which 
it can be concluded that the alliance of the two peoples in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is possible. The Bosnia-Herzegovina prime 
minister said that there are still differences regarding the 
nuances of the internal constitution, but that this can be 
overcome and that the model of relations between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia should be discussed afterward. As 
opposed to earlier views that nothing can be solved without the 
Serbs, even though it was Izetbegovic who was saying it most 
frequently, on this occasion, the Muslim side put forward a 
proposal that the doors be left open to the Serbs for this type 
of regulation of internal relations. Therefore, one can 
conclude that it will be a Serbian problem whether they accept 
it or not. The Muslims, so it seems, are willing to enter a 
joint state without the Serbs. 
  This was all agreed in the presence of U.S. envoy Redman and 
the leading people from the European Union. The only question 
remaining now is what kind of a state will this be without the 
Serbs who are situated in the west of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
Bearing in mind that this is evidently an U.S. initiative, 
which has also produced threats of air strikes, the possibility 
that they could carry out this threat should be borne in mind. 
It means that Clinton's preparation of the nation for military 
engagement does not mean preparation for the liberation of 
Sarajevo, but has much wider dimensions. The Serbs will perhaps 
want to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it might prove awfully 
expensive for them. On the other hand, if the world returns to 
the old and realistic geo-strategic divisions, the Croats and 
the Muslims could prosper well together. The precondition for 
this is the safeguarding of human rights for both peoples on the 
principle of reciprocity and with the supervision and guarantees 
of the international community. 
  The Russians, as a very interested side, have realized too 
late what is happening. Sending 400 of their soldiers to 
Sarajevo will not bring some great change in the present U.S. 
plans. The leap westward of the traditional geo-strategic 
positions would be a gain for Yeltsin and the generals who 
should be placated. However, if nothing, or less than expected, 
materializes out of this, and if at the same time the failure is 
paid for in cash for the restoration of the economy, the 
Russians could be very satisfied. For that reason, the fact 
that European Union representatives were also present at the 
talks in Frankfurt beside the United State is also encouraging.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador </F>
to the United Nations, by unidentified correspondent in New York 
on 18 February; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The UN Security Council this evening 
is discussing UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report 
on the presence of members of the Croatian Army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this reason, we have phoned Mario 
Nobilo, our ambassador to the United Nations. Good evening, Mr. 
Nobilo. Please tell us whether the debate in the Security 
Council is still going on. 
  [Nobilo] In fact, there will be no debate today after my 
conversation with the chairman of the Security Council. The 
debate will probably be put off until next week. There is no 
urgency in the Security Council's moves, and I managed to 
explain to the Security Council chairman at today's meeting that 
Butrus-Ghali's report itself--unfavorable for Croatia at first 
glance--warns about UNPROFOR's limited resources in verifying 
the withdrawal, which I had noted in my letter to Butrus-Ghali 
yesterday. 
  However, what is important in the earlier Security Council 
demand is the insistence that progress be made. We are 
primarily linking the progress to the guarantees we are 
demanding of the Security Council for the security of the Croat 
enclaves in central Bosnia. It also depends on the progress 
achieved in the promising negotiations between the Croat and 
Muslim sides in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And, of course--there is a 
new element here--the withdrawal of enormous quantities of heavy 
weapons and the new military situation around Sarajevo create a 
new military balance in the region. That could be used against 
the Croat side; we would like the Security Council to prevent 
the regrouping of Muslim forces against the Croats. I do not 
believe that will happen, but the Security Council is aware of 
the new circumstances. 
  I believe, therefore, that this whole report is a form of 
pressure on Croatia--not only on Croatia, but on all sides in 
former Yugoslavia--to reach a peaceful settlement. This 
particularly serves the West and the international community in 
their endeavors to have the remaining disputed issues between 
the Croat and Muslim sides resolved and to see the defining of 
the future good and dynamic relations between the two peoples 
and states--which is why I think this pressure should be viewed 
in the context of such a process. This is primarily a process. 
  What is important, however, is that finally we have an 
active 
consensus of the great powers on the European level and that 
people are finally talking in resolute tones. Croatia will 
certainly--in this sense, as it has hitherto--be the most 
cooperative party so that there is no direct danger if this 
process--which began with the president's Bonn initiative--were 
to continue to develop favorably, despite international factors 
being as active as they are now. 
  [Correspondent] In the secretary general's report--at least 
according to the text that we have received--quite a few things 
are unclear. Mr. Butrus-Ghali says the blue helmets were not 
able to supervise the withdrawal throughout the area, but there 
was a withdrawal. It is stated that not a single command center 
of the Croatian Army nor activity by any brigade was identified, 
and it speculates that the formations of the Croatian Army are 
probably significantly more careful. Dr. Nobilo, what can 
transpire from such a report for Croatia? 
  [Nobilo] Nothing directly. But I repeat: It will always be a 
way of exerting pressure on Croatia if things deteriorate, and 
things will resolve themselves if things improve so that there 
are no immediate effects. Butrus-Ghali's report itself 
distances itself from all this by saying that they think, and 
they believe, and they do not have sufficient proof, and they do 
not have sufficient people and mechanisms to carry out the 
inspections. This is indicative of the possible relations in 
this military area, but it is also certainly to be seen in the 
context of the situation in central Bosnia and the talks on the 
latest developments around Sarajevo. It should always be seen 
in a broad context. We should try not to do ourselves harm 
here, but on the contrary, to benefit from it.

  [Text] A regular weekly meeting between Yasushi Akashi and 
[head of the Croatian Office for State Security] Hrvoje Sarinic 
was held today at the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
headquarters in Zagreb. The meeting was also attended by 
General Milivoj Petkovic and General Ante Roso. In addition to 
the usual topics, their meeting today was an introduction to an 
event that is to take place tomorrow: A cease-fire agreement 
which is to be signed by General Ante Roso and General Rasim 
Delic. 
  [Petkovic] I hope Delic will come to Zagreb tomorrow so that 
we can sign an agreement which, unlike those that I have signed 
so far and that have not produced any results, will finally be 
an agreement which will yield not only short-term but also 
long-term results. The most important objective is that combat 
actions between the Croatian Defense Council formations and the 
Muslim forces cease. 
  [Reporter] Tomorrow is a decisive day, as you say. Will it 
be successful and are you expecting real results? 
  [Roso] Many things are changing with the spring. I would not 
like to add anything to what General Petkovic said, I think it 
is sufficient. Hopefully, this agreement will be final and in 
this way the Croatian Defense Council will contribute to the 
restoration of peace in the Balkans. 
  [Reporter] The agreement will be signed on neutral ground. 
  [Akashi, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] Today we had a very fruitful meeting. The result 
is a possibility to sign an agreement on the cessation of 
hostilities between General Roso and General Delic. This will 
be an historic moment -- the return of peace to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Reporter] Another topic discussed at the meeting, of no 
less 
importance, is also in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the alleged presence of the Croatian Army there. Generals Roso 
and Petkovic put forward a proposal to UNPROFOR to carry out a 
thorough inspection of all formations and positions so that 
allegations on the presence of regular Croatian Army formations 
can be refuted. The important thing is that the allegation on 
the presence of Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina has by this 
been relatively neutralized. 
  [Sarinic] It has absolutely been neutralized, and no way is 
that the case [changes thought], we will wait for about a week 
until they have collated all the details and verified them, and 
only then should the UN Security Council get reliable reports; 
it should not make any decisions on the basis of some gossip. 
Their conclusions can be, as I have already said, very serious 
and fatal for Croatia. 
  [Reporter] In the next seven days UNPROFOR commissions are 
to 
examine the situation and send a report to Yasushi Akashi.

  [Text] According to the Public Relations Office of the 
UNPROFOR Command in Zagreb, today's scheduled meeting between 
the Croat Defense Council [HVO] Commander, General Ante Roso, 
and the commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, General Rasim 
Delic will not take place. A spokesman for UNPROFOR could not 
reveal the reasons behind the postponement of their meeting. 
  Croatian sources assume that Gen Delic has encountered some 
difficulties while on his way to Zagreb. The talks between 
generals Delic and Roso were arranged during a recent round of 
the Geneva negotiations between Croat Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Mate Granic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime minister Haris 
Silajdzic. They reconfirmed this arrangement when they met in 
Frankfurt last Saturday. 
  Yesterday, following their meeting with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi at the UNPROFOR 
Headquarters in Zagreb, HVO generals Ante Roso and Milivoj 
Petkovic said that they would hold talks today with Rasim Delic 
and that they hoped they would sign an agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities. 
  Speaking about the possibilities of signing an agreement on 
the cessation of hostilites, Akashi yesterday said that this 
would be an historic moment in the return of peace to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [By Slim Allagui] </F>
  [Text] Copenhagen, Feb 21 (AFP) -- NATO may renew its 
threat of air strikes against Bosnia's Serbs to forcibly reopen 
the airport in Tuzla and to ensure a changeover of UN troops in 
Srebrenica, Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup said Monday. 
  "We are taking one problem at a time, by choosing Sarajevo 
first before going on to other problems," Haekkerup said, 
referring to the threat of NATO air strikes which convinced the 
Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or 
place them under UN control. 
  "The threat of air strikes will be used again," Haekkerup 
told the daily DET FRIE AKTUELT. ``If we managed to force the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, the UN and 
NATO are ready to impose new conditions, and there is a good 
chance they will be respected. 
  "You can't deny that they (the Serbs) took the NATO threat 
seriously," he said. "The situation on the ground confirms that." 
  The airport in the northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla is 
held 
by UN troops but the Serbs have steadfastly refused to let it be 
used to fly in emergency aid. 
  The Serbs have also prevented Canadian UN peacekeepers from 
being rotated out of the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica 
in the east of the country. 
  Also Monday, Danish Premier Poul Rasmussen said the United 
Nations had asked his government to divert to Sarajevo a column 
of tanks bound for Tuzla. 
  Rasmussen, emerging from a meeting of the Danish 
Parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government had received the 
request during the night but had not yet decided whether it was 
going to reply favourably. 
  He said the United Nations wanted the tanks to be on the 
outskirts of Sarajevo ready to intervene if the withdrawal of 
heavy artillery by the Bosnian Serbs did not go as planned. 
  The 10 German-designed Leopard tanks, accompanied by 100 
Danish soldiers, are already on their way to join the Nordic 
battalion in Tuzla from the south after being refused permission 
by the Serbs for some four months to go in from the north. 
  Rasmussen said any change in itinerary would have to be 
approved by parliament. 
  The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Peter 
Duetoft, 
said "The United Nations is within its rights to divert our 
tanks temporarily, but their final destination remains Tuzla, 
where they will defend the Nordic battalion of around 1,000 men 
and contribute to opening up the airport of this besieged town." 
  Rasmussen also emphasised Denmark's support for keeping up 
pressure on the Serbs. 
  "Pressure on the Serbs should be maintained even if the risk 
of NATO air strikes on Serb positions is much less than a few 
days ago," he said. 
  "In the longer term, one could imagine putting similar 
pressure on other towns in difficulty in Bosnia." 
  He said he was glad that the NATO threat to launch air 
strikes on heavy weapons not withdrawn from a radius of 20 
kilometers (12.5 miles) from the center of Sarajevo had been 
taken seriously, and "confident in the Serbs' inclination to 
keep their promises to withdraw all their heavy weaponry from 
around Sarajevo."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 21 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Stanislav 
Galic, the commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, said today 
that his units had fullfilled all the obligations regarding the 
movement of its artillery and its placement under UN control, in 
compliance with the decisions of the Srpska republic army's 
supreme command. 
  "Some very insignificant deviations from the general trend 
of 
the withdrawal were caused by weather conditions, but we are 
ready to agree on that, too, and to finalize that part of the 
job at any moment," General Galisc said. 
  Asked about the current situation in the zone of 
responsibility of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, Galic stressed 
the soldiers of his corps were in a state of increased combat 
readiness, primarily because they expected that the Muslim 
forces could take advantage of the current circumstances. 
  "Whoever attacks us is our enemy, and we shall defend 
ourselves to the very end," Galic added. 
  Commenting on the arrival in Sarajevo of the Russian 
UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] battalion Galic said this was a case of 
the Russians coming back to their old, primordial friends and 
that the friendship ought to continue to be fostered. 
  "We welcomed them as brothers, as people, and as soldiers. 
We shall do our utmost to facilitate them in performing their 
task of peacekeeping in the area." 
  "The Russian battalion will be deployed between the warring 
parties; that is, in front of our defense lines. UNPROFOR does 
not have a sufficient number of soldiers to cover the whole 
front line, but the Russians will take certain positions from 
which they will be able to efficiently supervise the 
cease-fire," Galic said, adding that he had visited the Russian 
battalion with General Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo. 
  Asked what was the subject of his talks today with General 
Michael Rose, Galic gave a brief answer: "General Rose was doing 
his routine tour of the area, and he called on the command of 
the Sarajevo-Romanija corps for consultations over coffee, 
something that is a part of his professional duties and 
cooperation."

  [Text] Pale -- What has been done about Sarajevo has been 
done, it seems to me, in the best possible way, states General 
Manojlo Milovanovic, head of the general staff of the army of 
the Srpska republic. The combat readiness of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija Corps has not been disturbed one bit, although 
we had to give in a little and put certain artillery pieces 
under [UN] control. However, these artillery pieces are still 
operational, their ammunition is beside them, and they can act 
at any moment, Milovanovic says. 
  According to Gen. Milovanovic, these events may be "the 
beginning of the end of the war" if a political solution is 
found for Sarajevo, as is being announced. If a political 
solution is not found within the next month, the end of the war 
will still be far away.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Presidency member Ejup Ganic by </F>
Midhat Kulender in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Kulender] Mr. Ganic, we heard the report from the 
news conference. It is now 2221, has there been anything new, 
any new reports since the news conference this evening? 
  [Ganic] No. The fact is that the task has not been carried 
out the way the NATO ultimatum demanded. UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] troops are still trying to get the job done, 
but I personally believe they are far from achieving the 
objective. The task has, therefore, not been achieved in 
accordance with the NATO declaration. 
  [Kulender] Our state has fulfilled all conditions contained 
in the NATO declaration? 
  [Ganic] Of course. I would like to tell the listeners that 
many traps were set for our state in the process of the adoption 
and implementation of the declaration. The day NATO held their 
session in Brussels an urgent meeting of military 
representatives was convened at the airport here in Sarajevo 
under great pressure from the Belgrade regime. The Serb side 
offered an ostensibly extremely flexible agreement on the 
withdrawal of weapons, but an overly vague, imprecise agreement. 
They insisted that the agreement be signed by 1500 at the 
latest. 
  President Izetbegovic and I were at the Presidency and we 
withdrew our delegation for consultations and gave them 
instructions. We quickly saw through the game. The Belgrade 
regime's objective was that a report be promptly sent to 
Brussels from the meeting at Sarajevo airport saying that an 
agreement had been achieved on some withdrawal or other of the 
heavy weaponry so that NATO would not pass a specific 
resolution, that is, an ultimatum. We avoided that first trap. 
  After the declaration was passed, UNPROFOR, that is those 
who 
in a certain way control UNPROFOR, insisted that several 
commissions and subcommissions be formed to implement the NATO 
declaration and the ultimatum. President Izetbegovic then formed 
a crisis headquarters whose members are known -- I am the head 
of the crisis headquarters -- and whose task was to cooperate 
with UNPROFOR and find a way to avoid all traps set in order to 
prevent the implementation of the declaration. 
  What was the aggressor's aim and, I must say, the aim of 
some 
states who have their troops within UNPROFOR forces? Their aim 
was to drag us into some negotiations, futile negotiations at 
the airport, into signing several kinds of agreements in order 
to make it look -- when the ultimatum deadline expires -- as if 
we could not agree with the Serb side on the positions, on the 
details, and on the timing of the withdrawal and make it look 
like both sides were to blame for the failure to implement the 
resolution. 
  We adopted a very clear strategy. We said that we understood 
the NATO declaration perfectly well; we wish to maintain contact 
with UNPROFOR on a strictly written basis -- we shall go on 
meeting but, prior to each meeting, we insist that we have 
written material, questions in writing, and that everything be 
meticulously documented. This used to drive them insane, but it 
helped resolve all the problems between us and UNPROFOR. It 
helped us observe the resolution, and we left it up to them to 
haggle with the Serb side. 
  Naturally, they failed to accomplish anything with the Serb 
side over this eight-day period. They have been working on the 
implementation of the NATO declaration for only two days, which 
is why this whole crisis broke out. UNPROFOR made a mistake, a 
serious blunder -- this is yet to be elucidated -- because it 
used the NATO declaration, the NATO ultimatum, as working 
material for negotiations with the Serb side. In other words, 
they fell into the trap set by Belgrade's diplomacy, which has 
been pulling the strings all along. This was the result -- 
UNPROFOR's people scattered all over the hills over the past two 
days discovering weapons and, in a way, trying to collect what 
could be collected and, to a certain extent, I feel that General 
Rose -- who has a brilliant resume -- is slowly sinking into the 
same quagmire and making the same mistakes as his predecessors. 
The outcome of all this, and this was confirmed by Mr. Akashi 
who said that 20 percent of the weapons are not under control, 
is that the approximate locations are known but the percentage 
of uncontrolled weapons is much higher. Therefore, the NATO 
resolution has not been respected by the aggressor. 
  We did our job professionally and consistently, and this is 
a 
diplomatic victory for us. The Western countries should now 
decide whether they wish to keep their promises and, of course, 
whether they wish to base their future policies on the strength 
of their promises. 
  [Kulender] The Russian troops that are supposed to be part 
of 
the UN force arrived in Pale this evening. 
  [Ganic] Yes, they have arrived. I believe, you know, the 
United Nations rallies most of the world. The Russian troops 
are part of the UN force, we shall keep that in mind. Russia 
did not take part, it did not cooperate, it did not even assist 
in drawing up this NATO declaration. Naturally, this caused a 
certain degree of wariness, not only here in Bosnia but in the 
democratic world at large. However, these troops are under Gen. 
Rose's command and their deployment will compensate for the 
expectations of the Pale regime [as heard].

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 21 (AFP) -- United Nations forces in 
Sarajevo are Monday [21 February] to verify the continuing 
withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons and to consolidate 
their positions around the battered capital. 
  UN officials late Sunday confirmed that both Bosnian Serb 
and 
Moslem forces had sufficiently complied with a NATO ultimatum to 
remove their artillery units from around the city by 0000 GMT 
Monday. 
  As a result, they said, there was no immediate need for NATO 
warplanes to carry out threatened air strikes. 
  General Andre Soubirou, UN commander for Sarajevo, expressed 
satisfaction that in the 10 days since the NATO ultimatum was 
issued Bosnian Serb units had handed over 225 weapons to UN 
control and the mainly Moslem Bosnian army 43. 
  While some weapony does remain within a 20-kilometer (12.5 
mile) Sarajevo exclusion zone imposed by NATO, United Nations 
officers on Sunday minimized its importance. 
  UN troops on Monday will be flown by helicopter to the nine 
Serb military sites -- out of 41 -- that they had been unable to 
inspect by the end of the day Sunday because of heavy snow. 
  From first light reconnaissance aircraft will also return to 
action, and according to Soubirou, "we should have a precise 
idea of the situation by the end of the morning." 
  At the 10 weapons collection points already established -- 
eight for the Serbs and two for the Moslems -- armed UN guards 
have orders to use force to prevent any party from recovering 
them. 
  NATO air strikes are also possible if UN ground troops 
holding the weapons come under attack. 
  Monday should also see the arrival outside Sarajevo of a 
second contingent of the 400 Russian peacekeeping troops whose 
deployment had been sought by the Serbs in exchange for 
compliance with the NATO ultimatum. 
  A first contingent has since late Sunday been stationed near 
Grbavica, where they are to deploy.

  [Text] Following the withdrawal of the Serb aggressor's 
artillery from Sarajevo, Alija Izetbegovic, president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, gave a statement for Sarajevo TV. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe this is a great 
victory for us. Perhaps it is not a completely clear victory, 
it is not faultless, some things have spoiled our joy a bit. 
But it still remains our victory for we are not being killed 
any more. You can let your children skate freely, they can go 
to school, you can go to the market without fear that someone 
will not return home. This is a great achievement after 22 or 
23 months of misery. 
  This is not their victory, as they want to present it. They 
have even convinced themselves, 500 or 600 years ago when they 
lost their state [in 1389, the Serbs were defeated by the Turks 
in the Kosovo battle] that that was their victory, and not a 
defeat. This is their clear defeat. 
  For eight days they had been hesitating to withdraw their 
weapons, they were making up some kinds of reasons, from 
categorical refusing to different pretexts -- snow, adverse 
weather conditions, and so on. In two days only they were 
forced to take to a headlong flight, leaving behind weaponry in 
their retreat. Do not let yourselves be convinced that this is 
a victory for them as they are now trying to convince themselves 
in those hills up there. They left behind -- handed in -- 262 
pieces of heavy weaponry, including 36 tanks and armored 
vehicles. 
  I think that this is our victory and a first step, first in 
a 
series of good things that are going to happen to this city. 
Electricity and water supply will be better, food supplies will 
be better, convoys carrying food and medicines will enter more 
safely, a kind of spring is coming. Therefore, please celebrate 
this victory and do not be afraid any longer. Of course, we are 
not going to allow the city to be divided. We must not be 
afraid of that either. This is a political solution. They are 
no longer there with their tanks and their guns above our heads.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan </F>
Karadzic by Elliniki Radhiofonia correspondents Yeoryios 
Kharvalias and Nikolaos Meletis in Pale; date not 
given--interview in English with subtitles in Greek] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, there were some 
measures taken recently by the Greek Government against the 
Republic of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] and actually we closed the borders to impose 
an embargo. What is your opinion about these measures? 
  [Karadzic] I fully understand the Greek Government and its 
sensitivity toward the name and symbols of Macedonia. I think 
that Skopje should return to Yugoslavia to prevent the 
dissolution of this country because Albanians would like to take 
the whole of Macedonia or to take the eastern part of Macedonia. 
Then there would be another Balkan war. Greece is right to be 
very cautious about what is happening in the neighborhood of 
Greece. We do hope that we will be always neighbors and maybe 
some time even be a confederation. 
  [Correspondent] Really? 
  [Karadzic] I would like to see this. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any message for the Greek people? 
  [Karadzic] Yes, thanks to the whole Greek nation, two 
governments, two oppositions, to the church for what they have 
done for the Serb people. We will never forget this. I do 
think that a good foundation for the Balkans is for Greece and 
Serbia to have good relations and I see now Bulgaria is also 
sympathizing with the Serbs and this is a good contact for peace. 
  [Correspondent] And one last question, Mr. President. 
Actually, the ultimatum expires in some hours. What will 
actually happen if there is a bombardment? How are you going to 
react? Your troops against the blue helmets? 
  [Karadzic] If we are attacked by anyone, no matter who it 
may 
be, we will defend ourselves. It is the legitimate right of the 
people to defend themselves. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Slobodan Jankovic] </F>
  [Text] Pale -- The day after the ultimatum -- a day of 
relief in the areas around Sarajevo. The task of deploying the 
Russian blue helmets along the demarcation lines has been drawn 
to a close, and the remaining Serbian heavy weaponry has been 
moved. Obviously, the moments of high tension are over. The 
media event of the day was the news conference of the Srpska 
republic's political leadership. Numerous correspondents asked 
some 20 questions, most of which were addressed to president 
Karadzic. The situation around Sarajevo was the center of 
attention, primarily as the first step, the future model for 
solving the remaining crisis points. Commenting on this, 
Radovan Karadzic stressed that the Serbian side has proposed to 
Akashi to continue this peace process -- particularly in the 
case of Tuzla -- which was a subject that interested many 
foreign correspondents. In reply to a question about Russia's 
return to the great diplomatic scene, Radovan Karadzic said: 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that it was completely 
unnatural that Russia had been absent from all these tasks, and 
I think that the West had forgotten that Russia is a great 
country and a great power, and now it was reminded of this fact 
in the best possible way. We are ready to swiftly continue -- 
in cooperation with primarily Russia, followed by Greece and 
Great Britain -- and we are ready to include or accept France 
and the United States into this cooperation. [sentence as heard] 
[end recording] 
  Serbian heavy artillery and information on how much has been 
done regarding its withdrawal elicited a brief but precise 
answer from president Karadzic. Over 50 percent of the weaponry 
has been withdrawn to outside the 20-km exclusion zone, while 
the rest has been placed under UN control. As soon as weather 
conditions permit, we will withdraw these weapons as well, 
replied Karadzic. As far as the continuation of the Geneva 
negotiations is concerned, the president of the Srpska republic 
said that the negotiations now depend on the cochairmen's 
ambitions and the readiness of the other two warring sides. We 
shall discuss exchange of territory, but Sarajevo will remain 
divided into two neighboring cities, said Radovan Karadzic at a 
news conference held this afternoon. 
  We have also noted a significant assessment by the Srpska 
republic military leadership regarding the ultimatum. General 
Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the Srpska republic army's general 
staff, said today that the Serbs had carried out their part of 
the bargain. What has been done around Sarajevo has been done 
in the best possible way. The combat readiness of the Sarajevo 
Corps has not been endangered by this, said General Milovanovic.

  [Text] In the program On the Spot this morning, Nikola 
Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic, commented on 
the significance of the turning point in the Bosnian drama: the 
involvement of the Russian diplomacy at five to twelve. 
  [Begin Koljevic recording] It is important that it is five 
to twelve. The turning point happened at the last moment, the 
moment after which there can be no other turning point. I think 
that this is a great success for the Russian diplomacy, and, I 
would add, a great success in recognizing what the Serbs have 
been committed to from the start. This is not an issue of the 
siege of Sarajevo, but an issue of defense, of two sides, of the 
strategic balance between the Serb artillery and the Muslim 
infantry. The Russian initiative has solved that problem. The 
arrival of Russian units will enable the withdrawal of the Serb 
artillery that will not endanger the safety of the Serbs around 
Sarajevo. 
  The only danger now, in my opinion, is that in the coming 
days of the so-called ultimatum, there might be provocations and 
incidents. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] is obliged to 
prevent any misinterpretation of such incidents, incidents that 
can be expected. Finally, the regular UNPROFOR reports can be 
enough to prevent such attempts by the Muslims. [end recording] 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Mr. Koljevic, 
we understand that you are saying that further developments 
depend on the behavior of the Muslim side and, of course, its 
western allies that support it. [end recording] 
  [Begin Koljevic recording] Of course, of course, 
particularly because the Serbian side has been cooperative to 
the maximum and, I would add, now it is protected, after the 
Russian initiative there is no more concern about the disruption 
of the strategic balance. It is known from the UN Charter that 
the basic thing in all peace operations is that no side can 
profit during the peace process. That would compromise the 
United Nations very much, and that is what UNPROFOR fears the 
most. We hope that this will have a considerable effect on 
overcoming this crisis, this need of theirs, that no side should 
benefit from this. [end recording]

  [Text] Before leaving Pale, Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy 
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, assessed the latest events: 
  [Begin recording] [Churkin] This was a very good night. I 
slept very well. As of this morning, the Russian battalion is 
in its place. Things are stable and under control. I am 
pleased and I am going back to Zagreb. I will return to 
Sarajevo, however, if anything should go wrong. 
  I had a long conversation yesterday with some Bosnian Serb 
leaders and generals. They assured me that they are going to 
completely fulfill the promises they gave us on the basis of our 
agreement. Our troops are stable, the weapons have been 
removed, and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is in control. 
There are good relations between the Serbs and UNPROFOR, as well 
as among us, UNPROFOR, and the Bosnian Serbs. This is a secure 
network and everything is heading towards peace. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What do you think of the Muslim 
wish to nevertheless bomb the Serbs? 
  [Churkin] If they are disappointed by the lack of strikes 
and that there are no more battles, then they have some 
psychological problems. We are talking about wrong things here. 
However, honestly speaking, I do not think that this mood 
prevails in the Muslim government. I think that they do realize 
what this city and country mean and that they need more peace 
than war. I think that they can be satisfied that arrangements 
initiated by the Serbo- Muslim agreement were implemented at the 
request of Russia and have not led to confrontation but to 
cooperation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Danish tanks and a 
humanitarian convoy headed for the northeastern Bosnian town of 
Tuzla on Tuesday after Western allies vowed to reopen the city's 
airport to help relieve the stricken Moslem population. 
  The concerted action came after Kofi Annan, the chief of UN 
peacekeeping operations, said in New York that the United 
Nations planned to reopen the huge Tuzla airport on March 7. 
  The international community turned its attention to enclaves 
around Bosnia following the success of a NATO ultimatum, which 
threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions unless 
heavy weapons were withdrawn from around Sarajevo by midnight 
GMT Sunday. 
  "The UN and NATO have decided to strike while the iron is 
hot" in the wake of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
ultimatum on Sarajevo issued on February 9, commented a UN 
officer here, who declined to be identified. 
  The Tuzla airport, which has been closed by Bosnian Serb 
gunners since May last year, is scheduled to open March 7, said 
Annan after meeting with UN member countries involved in the 
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  UN troops backed by air support could be used to reopen the 
airport if necessary following discussions with the parties on 
the ground, Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has told the 
Security Council. 
  NATO last month renewed an offer to use its warplanes to end 
the strangulation of Bosnian Serb-besieged Moslem communities if 
requested by the United Nations. 
  The million-strong mainly Moslem population of Tuzla, which 
includes a large minority of refugees fleeing the Bosnian 
fighting, has been supplied by road convoys alone because of the 
airport's closure. 
  According to the UN officer here, the Serbs could no longer 
prevent the airport reopening at Tuzla, and ``NATO planes can 
overfly Tuzla as they do for Sarajevo, and take out any weapon 
targeting the airport. 
  "The balance of power has changed, and the Serbs, who have 
realised that in Sarajevo, would do well to realise it in 
Tuzla," he added. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by the TANJUG 
news agency, hinted Monday that the Serbs were ready to discuss 
the airport reopening, although he argued that from a 
humanitarian point of view it was not necessary as road 
corridors to the town were open. [passage omitted] 
  Road convoys can be stopped "like turning off a tap," 
according to Tuzla UNHCR chief Robyn Ziebert. "If we could get 
the necessary convoys through, we wouldn't necessarily need the 
airport," he said Tuesday. 
  The 2.5 kilometre (1.5 mile) runway has been under the 
threat 
of Serb gunners who are on three sides of the airport. 
  On February 1 and 2, about 40 shells exploded inside the 
airport perimeter. On Monday, as the international community 
began to single out Tuzla for attention, 17 shells landed just 
outside. 
  The Swedish peacekeepers, from their observation posts, 
noted 
the positions from where the shells were fired but were 
powerless to riposte. 
  After months of hesitation, the 1,000 Swedish and Danish UN 
troops stationed near Tuzla began preparing to reopen the 
airport some nine weeks ago. 
  "Everything is ready so that we can land the first aircraft 
four days after taking control of the area," said Colonel Bengt 
Berlin of the Tuzla contingent.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Relief convoys to Bosnia 
resumed on Tuesday after a break of two-and-a-half days, a 
spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Ron 
Redmond (eds: correct) said. 
  Several convoys left Metkovic in southern Croatia for 
central 
Bosnia on Tuesday morning and several more were scheduled to 
leave on Wednesday, he said. 
  The UNHCR's air lifts to Sajarevo also resumed on Tuesday, 
with a total of 27 humanitarian flights scheduled for the day, 
he added. 
  The UNHCR suspended relief to Bosnia on Saturday afternoon 
because of NATO threats to bomb Serb positions unless heavy 
artillery was withdrawn before the expiry of an ultimatum set 
for 0000 GMT Monday. 
  Redmond added that UNHCR staff who left Bosnia for safety 
reasons after the ultimatum had started going back, with some 
already back in Sarajevo after flying in early on Tuesday. 
  At UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, spokeswoman Christiane 
Berthiaume said the convoys from Metkovic included eight heading 
for Zenica, with the others travelling to Jablanica, Tuzla, and 
the Croatian and Moslem sectors of Mostar. Two further convoys 
were leaving Belgrade for Gorazde and Srebrenica. 
  Asked about the opening of Tuzla airport, which the Bosnian 
Serbs have been opposing, Berthiaume said it would be a major 
step, given the large number of displaced persons in that 
Moslem-majority part of Bosnia. The head of UN peacekeeping 
operations Kofi Annan has set March 7 as the date for opening 
the airport, closed since May l992. 
  The spokeswoman noted that last month the UNHCR could 
deliver 
only 1,800 tonnes of relief to Tuzla by road, whereas needs were 
estimated at 7,400 tonnes. 
  In Sarajevo, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) military 
spokesman Bill Aikman of Canada said 10 Danish Leopard tanks had 
reached the British Army base at Vitez in central Bosnia 
overnight and were continuing on to Tuzla to rejoin the rest of 
their battalion, which is to supervise the airport opening. 
  The tanks are the first heavy armour deployed in Bosnia by 
UNPROFOR. They were stuck in a Belgrade suburb for four months 
because of Serb objections, then did a roundabout rail journey 
through Hungary, Austria and Italy, to be shipped from Trieste 
to the Croatian port of Split, from where they set out on Monday.

  [Text] Jagodina, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the 
situation around Sarajevo, the chairman of the Srpska republic's 
assembly, Momcilo Krajisnik, told Radio Jagodina today that the 
Serb side had asked for impartial mediators from UNPROFOR and 
got them in the UN's Russian units. 
  "UNPROFOR is generally implementing the agreement between 
the 
Serb and Muslim sides very correctly and with good intentions. 
The Serb side not only has no complaints, but it also commends 
the impartial and mediating role of the `international forces,'" 
Krajisnik said. 
  Asked to comment on air strike threats if the Serbs did not 
allow Tuzla airport to open, Krajisnik said: 
  "We do not have anything against the opening of Tuzla 
airport 
if we get guarantees that it will not be used to arm Muslim 
forces, thus prolonging the war. However, those who want to 
open the airport straight away do not have good intentions." 
We, Krajisnik added, also have no complaints about the 
demilitarization of the warring sides in Zepa, Srebrenica, and 
other enclaves because our goal is peace and a demarcation 
between the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. However, not a single 
percent of Serb territory can be threatened by this act. We 
have opted for a peaceful resolution accompanied by a 
demarcation between the three states in the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and any attempt to join the three nations is 
in reality a prolongation of military operations, Krajisnik said.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo was blessed with another calm day. 
[passage omitted] Stephane Manier and Marcel Martin report: 
  [Begin recording] [Manier] [passage omitted] Whereas the man 
on the streets keeps turning his bitterness over without really 
realizing that he can now think about it at his leisure, 
politicians look at the situation with more distance: 
  [Ejup Ganic, Bosnian vice president, in English with French 
voiceover] I, for one, did not think that at 0100 last night, 
something would necessarily happen. In the case of an 
ultimatum, you never know when reactions start effectively. 
However, I am worried when I see that there is still quite a 
lot of uncontrolled artillery. It is up to NATO to defend its 
own credibility. We complied and cooperated. The Serbs did 
not. I think that we are now pressing for the Serbs to 
cooperate, but I do believe that the UN made a mistake when it 
negotiated the ultimatum with the Serbs. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Muslim side again 
violated the cease-fire last night in the Sarajevo area, TANJUG 
learned from Serb military sources in the Srpska republic. 
  According to the same sources, UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] members identified the culprits and the location from 
which they opened fire, and "a resolute effort" was made to stop 
the shooting from Muslim positions. 
  According to Serb military sources, members of Muslim units 
have been using infantry weapons to target Serb areas from 
several directions. The Muslim side violated the cease-fire in 
the Lukavica, Lemezovic Kuca, Kosevo, and Grbavica areas of 
Sarajevo. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It was one of the worst days -- if one can draw such 
comparisons at all -- in this 16-day offensive by the Serb 
aggressor on the Bihac region. The howitzers, tanks, [words 
indistinct] multiple-rocket launchers, antiaircraft machine guns 
on the nearby hills allow themselves no respite. Throughout the 
day fierce battles have raged on the Grmusa and Grabez plains. 
This afternoon the chetniks launched one of their heaviest tank 
and infantry attacks. 
  In the course of this hand-to-hand battle lasting several 
hours fighters of the 5th Corps have managed to repel the 
chetnik vampires. The Serbs have been reinforced with special 
units from Banja Luka and Prnjavor, who among their ranks have 
notorious criminals whose hands are heavily stained with blood. 
Some 30 of them will never leave the plain while dozens have 
been taken out of action. A number of our fighters have been 
wounded in the furious fighting and shelling. 
  Today's chetnik defeat was yet another reason behind the 
intensified artillery destruction of Bihac and Cazin and their 
outlying districts. Also targeted were mosques, particularly in 
the Cazin municipality. As if this was not enough, the chetniks 
from the territory of the so-called Republic of Serb Krajina 
also joined in the action. They, moreover, did so from [word 
indistinct] in full view of the UN force stationed on the state 
border of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the course of the day helicopters, delivering more combat 
equipment, have also been sighted. This shows that the chetniks 
are still taking advantage of world opinion being focused on the 
lifting of siege of Sarajevo as they pursue their goals in other 
areas. This is why the civilian and military authorities have 
demanded once again from the government and state presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that it make further efforts leading to 
compliance with the UN resolution under which the Bihac region 
is designated as a protected area. Along the demarcation lines 
with the so-called autonomous province of Velika Kladusa some 
provocations and actions by the most extremist groups have taken 
place during the day.

<F P=106> [Report on Senada Cumurovic -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Cumurovic] The situation in Bihac County, which 
is protected by a UN resolution, was first assessed militarily. 
Brigadier General Arif Pasalic, assistant to the defense 
minister for military affairs, elaborated on the situation. 
  [Pasalic] In the past 15 days, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor, 
assisted by Fikret Abdic's so-called western Krajina forces, has 
been conducting an offensive against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
5th Corps. The consequences of this aggression are a great 
number of killed and wounded, most of them civilians, and based 
on the military situation in the past 24 hours, the 
Serbo-chetnik aggressor's lines have moved.... [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Cumurovic] This offensive perpetrated by the aggressor 
further complicates the already grave situation in the area 
under control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 5th Corps. So 
far, 1,500 civilians have been killed, 160 of them children. 
Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic discussed the letter that 
Fikret Abdic sent to Milosevic and Tudjman, in which he set a 
meeting in Velika Kladusa at which issues pertaining to the 
status of the so-called west Bosnian Krajina would be reviewed. 
  [Alispahic] We know that Fikret Abdic and his [word 
indistinct] are in touch with these people. Moreover, they have 
open support from certain people in these countries [Serbia and 
Croatia]. We have uncovered open cooperation with the chetnik 
forces, which, together with the western Bosnia army members, 
are taking part in the attacks [words indistinct]. This open 
cooperation and support that has been extended by the two states 
has (?encouraged) Fikret Abdic to launch an open, terrorist 
conflict, which has been very damaging for Bihac County. 
  [Cumurovic] A successful operation of the Bihac (?Security 
Service) cut short the terrorist activity of Abdic's group. 
  The humanitarian situation is critical, particularly in the 
past 10-15 days, since the aid deliveries have been suspended. 
[Words indistinct] 78 metric tons of food were delivered to 
Bihac, while Velika Kladusa received 108 tons of food in the 
same period of time. 
  Only one state delegation has visited this area to date, 
stressed Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, because one of the 
essential problems is the region's isolation from other parts of 
the republic. The Bihac region is also isolated in terms of 
communication, since the only way to communicate is through ham 
radio operators because reestablishing telephone lines has 
proved impossible. There is a possibility of having a satellite 
link in the future, explained Minister for Reconstruction and 
Development Munevar Imamovic. 
  At the end of the open part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government session, at which the situation in the Bihac County 
was reviewed, a decision was made to call for a UN Security 
Council session that would review the situation in the area. 
Second, it was concluded that a corridor had to be opened via 
Licko Petrovo Selo, which would ensure that aid for Bihac would 
no longer travel via Velika Kladusa. Moreover, it was decided to 
ask the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to move its warehouses 
from Velika Kladusa to Bihac. The proposal to open Bihac 
airport was also supported, as was the need to enable the return 
of deputies. [sentence as heard] Finally, it was stressed that 
the government had so far twice sent humanitarian aid to the 
legitimate bodies of authority, and that it had enough aid to 
alleviate the grave situation in the Bihac region.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 22 February carries in 
its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting 
in the republic. Reception is fair. 
  Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that 
"today, on the 17th day of the heaviest offensive by the Serb 
aggressor, the town is under attack from all sides. Some 5,000 
chetniks have been brought from other fronts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to capture this area. They have been 
bringing in new military equipment by road and by helicopter. 
The heavy artillery from the surrounding Bihac hills has been 
systematically destroying Bihac and Cazin. Heavy fighting has 
again been under way on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, and the 
chetnik artillery guns have been pounding the defense lines 
since this morning." 
  In his report from Maglaj, Smajl Terzic says that "there is 
an abundance here of snow and Russian-made shells, though 
fortunately only one in 10 explodes, fired at the suffering 
people in Sije, Mrkotic, Kalosevic, Tesanj, Maglaj, and the free 
Teslic and Doboj territories. During the 37th day of the 
offensive, the [Serb] aggressor is bringing in new forces, and 
conducting mobilization of Muslims under the age of 16. They 
are being forced into the mine fields and if they resist, they 
are shot on the spot." 
  Reporting from Gornji Vakuf, Akif Agic says that "Croatian 
artillery has been pounding the villages near the town. Tanks 
from (?Kupe) and (?Darovac) have been firing selectively at 
civilian targets. The center of Gornji Vakuf has also been 
shelled with howitzers, mortars, and tanks." He says that "the 
HVO has been destroyed, and now the Croatian Army is assuming 
the role of the attacker." 
  An unidentified correspondent reports from Kalesija that 
"fierce artillery attacks on Donje Vukovije near Tuzla airport 
have continued today. The [Serb] aggressor's artillery attacks 
are under way as we report and the citizens of Vukovije are in 
their cellars, where they have been for days. The enemy is 
firing from Mt. Majevica with howitzers, and if these intense 
attacks continue, Vukovije will be razed to the ground." 
  Mira Salihodzic reports from Olovo that "this afternoon the 
[Serb] enemy artillery has been targeting civilian areas in the 
Krivaja River valley in retaliation for the losses that the 
chetniks suffered in successful commando operations over the 
last few days." She says that "large convoys of enemy forces 
from the direction of Han Pijesak and Sokolac have been moving 
hurriedly. Enemy armored-mechanized and infantry forces have 
been concentrating around Olovo."

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 21 (TANJUG) -- Ranking Bosnian Muslim 
official Arif Pasalic said on Monday that "the Muslim forces 
must war on for the liberation of entire Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In an interview given to the Zagreb weekly DANAS, Muslim 
Deputy Foreign Minister Pasalic listed as the Muslim priorities 
at this time the recapture of the Lasva River Valley in central 
Bosnia and the launching of a counter-offensive in the Brcko 
area in the north and the Mostar area in the southwest. 
  "It is our strategic objective to liberate central Bosnia 
(from Croat control). If we accomplish this, we shall improve 
our chances in the valleys of the Neretva in the southwest and 
the Bosna in the north, and, eventually, for the liberation of 
all of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he underscored. 
  "It does not matter if it takes eight months, or four years, 
or even 12 years, we must and can war on," said Pasalic. 
  The statement came at a time when tensions have been eased 
around Sarajevo with the withdrawal and placing of Bosnian Serb 
and Muslim artillery under U.N. control, which most politicians 
and media in the world interpret as a major step forward in 
bringing the peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Bosnian Muslims have invariably been rejecting all peace 
offers for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the belief, encouraged by 
military successes against the Croats in central Bosnia, that 
they would get more territory at arms than they could at the 
conference table.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Jovan Divjak, deputy commander of </F>
the General Staff of the Supreme Command of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, by Livia Klingl in Sarajevo; date not 
given: "General Divjak: `A Division of Bosnia Means War Again'"] 
  [Text] [Klingl] Is the war over, as Serbian leader 
Karadzic says? 
  [Divjak] Karadzic must explain to his people that he now 
wants peace. He is reacting to pressure from NATO and Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  [Klingl] Will NATO intervene if the Serbs neglect NATO 
demands? 
  [Divjak] NATO will not bomb the Serbs. We now have a 
stalemate in the political game. The Serbs are withdrawing a 
few weapons, others they will shift to other areas of war. 
  [Klingl] Can a political solution be found through this 
stalemate? 
  [Divjak] The Sarajevo solution could be successful one in 
other parts of Bosnia as well, which would have a positive 
influence on the negotiations. 
  [Klingl] Can you accept Russian blue helmets as monitoring 
the Bosnian weapons? 
  [Divjak] The Bosnian Army is pleased to be monitored by 
them. If they are used on the Serbian side, abuse cannot be 
ruled out. 
  [Klingl] Would a division of Bosnia into three parts bring 
about peace? 
  [Divjak] A division along ethnic lines would mean war again. 
Our culture, history, and economy are interlaced; 900,000 
marriages are mixed marriages. 
  [Klingl] Would you, a Serb, live in a Muslim state? 
  [Divjak] I am staying where I am. Here we will not have a 
Muslim state but a country in which all citizens will have their 
rights. 
  [Klingl] You negotiated the cease-fire with the Serbs. What 
is it like to sit at the same table with the aggressors? 
  [Divjak] They did not want to negotiate with us because I 
was there. I told them that this is not a question of wanting 
but a question of a cease-fire. I am very glad that I am not on 
the side of those who are committing genocide on the Muslims.

  [Text] At this evening's continuation of the Frankfurt 
round of Croatian-Muslim talks, the mutual standpoints are 
drawing closer together. Both delegations, it has been learned, 
have accepted the model of the cantonal organization of the 
future Bosnia-Herzegovina, but some of their standpoints are, 
nevertheless, different. The Muslim side sees the cantons as 
the basis for the development of a future state while the 
Croatian side sees them as only a framework guaranteeing the 
appropriate participation of both nations in the government. In 
this connection, stress is laid on the U.S. initiative on the 
territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons. 
  Of the concrete agreements, stress is placed on the 
forthcoming meeting between military commanders General Ante 
Roso and Rasim Delic, which should provide a definite cessation 
of hostilities between the Croatian Defense Council and the 
Muslim army, something that will make further negotiations 
easier. Both delegations agreed with the U.S. approach to the 
talks -- that first there should be an agreement between Croats 
and Muslims on Bosnia-Herzegovina before an agreed proposal is 
put to the third side, the Bosnian Serbs.

Vitez] 
  [Excerpt] According to the HVO's [Croatian Defense Council] 
operational zone in Vitez [largest Croat enclave in central 
Bosnia], the town center came under an artillery attack again 
last night. Two civilians were wounded. 
  According to the same source, the Muslim Army is deploying 
fresh units on the northern approaches to Vitez. The command of 
the Vitez operational zone links this with the lifting of the 
blockade of Sarajevo and a large influx of infantry belonging to 
the Muslim Army's First Corps [based in Sarajevo] to Croat areas 
in central Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mayors of [the Croat-held towns of] Kresevo, 
Kiseljak, and Fojnica today sent a [joint] letter to the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command. In the letter they are 
asking whether UNPROFOR is going to do anything to prevent 
Muslim infantry units, currently being moved from Sarajevo, from 
taking part in the offensive against the Croat areas in central 
Bosnia. 
  The Muslim infantry is no longer needed in Sarajevo and they 
are already moving into central Bosnia, with the aim of 
occupying Croat areas, the letter says.

<F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic from Maglaj] </F>
  [Text] Maglaj is today again the target of the aggressor's 
artillery weapons. The criminals continue to employ their 
surprise tactic of sudden shelling, usually at times when the 
population is most relaxed. Their sole objective is to kill as 
many innocent people as possible. A general alarm signal was 
sounded at 1300 [1200 GMT] because some 10 120-mm mortar shells 
were launched at the town center in a relatively short period. 
The shelling of civilian targets is still in progress. We do 
not have any information on the killed and wounded, but we do 
know for certain that there are casualties.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 21 February reports 
escalation of combat in the following areas: 
  A report by the press service of the 3d Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army claims that "Croatian Army aircraft 
early yesterday morning shelled Vitez [word indistinct]. An 
aircraft and two helicopters flew from the direction of Gornji 
Vakuf and fired 12 projectiles [words indistinct]. Afterward, 
the aircraft in a low-level flight strafed this settlement. 
This air attack by the aggressor's Croatian Army resulted in 
enormous material damage." The report here adds an observation 
that this attack was carried out while "the international 
organizations and public are preoccupied with the NATO 
ultimatum" in hope that it will passed "unnoticed." 
  "In the zone of responsibility of the 4th Corps IKM 
[expansion unknown] Konjic the forces of the Croatian Army and 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] would not cease shelling 
Muslim villages. On two occasions last night the ustashas 
shelled (?Scipe) in the free Prozor territory from a multiple 
rocket launcher. Late last night the Croatian Army air force 
was active, too, which in the region of Scipe village dropped 
(?four) [word indistinct] bombs. At the time of sending this 
dispatch we could not obtain any information about the 
consequences of the activity of the ustasha air force and 
artillery," a dispatch by the 4th Corps Information Service 
reports. 
  "Again no peace on the free Olovo territory," reports a 
correspondent whose name is indistinct. "Yesterday passed in 
attacks of the chetnik artillery on the civilian quarters of the 
town and settled areas along river Krivaja." She continues to 
report that "in the course of the night the infantry arms fire 
along the entire front line of [word indistinct] Olovo defenders 
has been intensified" and reports that "the morning in the 
freedom-loving Olovo started with renewed activity of the enemy 
artillery, which is again pounding the lines of our defense with 
intensified small arms fire. The lines of defense are stable and 
under full control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters."

  [Text] At the end of the news conference that has just 
concluded at Victoria Palace the government spokesman, Mr. Ioan 
Rosca, read the executive declaration regarding the decision on 
withdrawal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo area. The 
declaration reads as follows: 
  Romania's Government with satisfaction took note of and 
hails 
the decision of the Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw heavy 
weapons from the Sarajevo area, as well as the decision that the 
Muslims will turn in certain pieces of heavy artillery. This 
decision will prevent the risk of expansion of military actions 
and will make a contribution to actions aimed at defusing the 
situation in the Sarajevo area. 
  Reasserting complete support for a political settlement of 
the conflict and noting that under the current circumstances a 
possible military intervention might have unforeseeable 
consequences and even consequences that are opposite to the 
proposed goals, the Romanian Government expresses hope that the 
favorable moment that has been created will mark the beginning 
of actions aimed at finding durable solutions both in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the rest of the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  In conclusion it is also mentioned that, as far as it is 
concerned, the Romanian Government continues to express its 
willingness to contribute to actions of finding political 
solutions to the conflict together with the other countries 
neighboring the former Yugoslavia and with other interested 
countries. 
  The news conference continued with the spokesman summing up 
the major issues discussed today during the meeting of the 
executive. 
  The minister of agriculture, Ioan Oancea, read a report on 
the stage of agricultural works and stressed that the soil 
fertilization is taking place at a very slow pace because of the 
lack of funds. However, the situation is about to improve, 
through the implementation of a recent government decision. 
  In the same context, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu called 
for the expansion of control over the implementation of the 
government norms and over the application of reform in various 
economic sectors. 
  Also during the government meeting, Minister of State Mircea 
Cosea, president of the Coordination, Strategy, and Economic 
Reform Council, briefed those present about the stage of the 
discussions regarding the actions that have been taken in the 
privatization acceleration process. Mr. Mircea Cosea insisted 
on the need to ensure a uniform coordination of privatization 
policies of various bodies in charge of various sectors in this 
area. The norms currently valid in connection with reform and 
certain norms that are in the middle of a finalization process 
have been reviewed, namely, a draft decision regarding the 
organization and functioning of the secondary market for 
property certificates, another draft decision regarding methods 
to sell bonds, and the draft law on accelerating the 
privatization process. 
  Likewise, it was noted that there are plans to reorganize 
the 
National Agency for Privatization. 
  At the same time, proposals were made to modify certain 
existing norms, respectively law No. 15 regarding the legal 
status of commercial companies and their responsibility. State 
Minister Mircea Cosea mentioned that a first action to speed up 
privatization will be to make a public offer, that is to sell 
bonds from six commercial companies, out of the 63 that will be 
privatized in April-May 1994. 
  Further, Mr. Mircea Cosea presented the projects for the 
future development of small and medium-sized enterprises, 
informing the executive that the Romanian Fund for Guaranteeing 
Credits for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise, in which the 
Romanian state has a share of 98 percent, started operating. He 
also informed the executive that the Balkan Center for Small and 
Medium-Sized Enterprises has been set up in Bucharest. 
  Also during the meeting that the cabinet held today, the 
draft decision to increase the salary fund, exempt from 
additional tax, has been adopted, as a result of the increase of 
economic efficiency of the activity carried out by commercial 
companies whose majority shares belong to the state and 
autonomous public corporations. He also noted that, as a result 
of discussions with trade unions, the basis for calculating 
salary increase according to other economic indicators, remains 
open.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest has 
issued a statement expressing satisfaction over the receptivity 
shown by the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict when they 
accepted the measures aimed at halting hostilities in the 
Sarajevo area, which is seen as a first step to finding a 
negotiable and viable arrangement for Bosnia-Herzegovina as well 
as for all Yugoslav territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
also considers that the Russian contingent within UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] can play a positive role in totally assuaging 
the tense situation in Sarajevo and welcomes the realism shown 
by the ministers of certain important NATO states in examining 
the situation in Sarajevo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
believes that all these encouraging signs can give further 
impetus to negotiations.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu </F>
by unidentified RESALAT correspondent in Bucharest during 
Foreign Minister Velayati's visit to Romania] 
  [Excerpts] [RESALAT] While expressing gratitude to Your 
Excellency for giving us your time, I wish to ask your opinion 
on the future prospects for relations between Iran and Romania 
in view of the fact that 940 Iranian companies are currently 
engaged in economic activities in your country and have invested 
there. 
  [Iliescu] Initially, I wish to emphasize that the relations 
between the two countries are very strong and are favored by the 
people of the two countries. In recent years, our relations 
have improved on the basis of mutual respect and trust. Despite 
all the changes that have taken place between Iran and Romania, 
relations have continued in a cohesive form and have been 
strengthened by suitable political circumstances, the will of 
the leaders to preserve traditional political and economic 
relations, and those leaders' interest in regional cooperation 
because of the distinctive characteristics of the two countries 
that have culminated in economic closeness. 
  Those relations have been constantly expanding so that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is the fourth greatest partner in 
economic exchanges with Romania, which shows the capabilities of 
the two countries for greater economic cooperation. Of course, 
there is also the possibility of upgrading the exchanges, which 
are currently at half a billion dollars annually. We believe 
that it would be appropriate to increase the exchanges because 
of the reciprocal recognition and relations between the two 
economic parties. 
  Iran is the most important supplier of oil to Romania. A 
project is underway for the construction of a gas pipeline from 
Iran to Europe in which Romania is actively involved. It is 
hoped that the project will materialize soon. In the near 
future, a joint commission of the two projects will be set up in 
Bucharest. Only today a trade and commerce agreement was signed 
between Iran and Romania, which facilitates the increase in 
trade, and new plans for cooperation will be specified at the 
joint commission's session. We will support them and are very 
hopeful of the implementation of such projects. 
  [RESALAT] Does your leanings toward the West, especially in 
the field of free trade and a market economy, mean that you will 
change your relations with those countries with which you have 
traditional ties, such as Iran? 
  [Iliescu] On the contrary, I believe that the world is 
leaning toward the participation of countries in international 
exchanges and that we are witnessing a trend toward integrating 
national economies with international economies. [passage 
omitted] 
  [RESALAT] Europe and the rest of the West have not been able 
to end the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your 
assessment of the issue? Ostensibly, the United Nations treats 
the people of Europe--including the Bosnian Muslims--very 
unjustly. Why is that? 
  [Iliescu] The tragedy that the people of the former 
Yugoslavia have been faced with, especially the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, has also affected Romania because it is a 
neighbor of Yugoslavia. In the past we have had very cordial 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  We believe that this conflict can be resolved by the 
international community as the continuation of war and bloodshed 
can only deepen the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of 
course, steps have been taken in this direction. In the Geneva 
talks the basic conditions were discussed and an understanding 
was achieved. Therefore, constant efforts should be made until a 
solution is reached. 
  We are confident that logic will be victorious, since the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have lived together for centuries. 
It is not a mere ethnic conflict, as a large number of people 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina are Serbs and Croats who accepted Islam 
during the Ottoman empire. [passage omitted on historical 
details] 
  [RESALAT] How are your relations with Russia, especially on 
economic issues? What is your opinion on the statements made by 
Zhirinovskiy? He has threatened Russia's neighbors. What do 
you think about this? 
  [Iliescu] We are following the developments in Russia very 
carefully, as it is a major country in out region. We are 
neighbors and we should maintain our relations with Russia. We 
have had both positive and negative relations throughout 
history, and it is to our benefit that democratic forces should 
triumph in Russia so internal stability may be ensured and it 
can play a positive role in the world. 
  Unfortunately, there have been problems in the republics of 
the former Soviet Union, especially economic disarray that has 
had a negative impact on the lives of the people. This has 
resulted in the emergence of extremists such as Zhirinovskiy, 
who are considered very dangerous. With such forces coming into 
power, not only Russian reforms but the stability of the region, 
Europe, and the world are in danger. We are interested in 
having good relations with Russia. We want to expand such 
relations with Russia and Ukraine on the basis of respect and 
safeguarding reciprocal interests. We want our relations to be 
based on mutual respect and the preservation of the interests of 
both sides. [passage omitted] 
  As president of Romania, I wish to congratulate the Iranian 
nation on its auspicious celebrations of victory over the shah's 
regime and hope that you are successful in consolidating society 
and every department of your country. The people of Romania 
welcomed the struggles of the people of Iran and interpreted 
them as the wishes of the Iranian nation.

  [Text] Discussions started at the Ministry of Industry at 
around 1515 local time between the delegation of the Lignitul 
Mining Trade Union Federation Targu Jiu, which includes five 
trade union leaders and two technical counselors, accompanied by 
Mr. Ilie Torsan, the president of the League of Mining Trade 
Unions, in his capacity as observer on behalf of the League, and 
the representatives of the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Protection, the Department in Charge of Relations With Trade 
Unions and Employers' Association, the Ministry of Industry, 
Department of Mining and Geology, and the Brown Coal Autonomous 
Public Corporation. The group's talks are being coordinated by 
Dumitru Popescu, the minister of industry. 
  Our correspondents have informed us that so far the press 
has 
not been permitted access to the talks. 
  The demonstrators, who this afternoon have been in the 
square 
of the Gorj Prefect's Office, continue to wait in a tense 
atmosphere for the results of the negotiations held at the 
Ministry of Industry. 
  According to our correspondent's reports, a new element came 
up after 1300. Mr. Virgil Magureanu, the director of the 
Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] addressed the miners for a 
few minutes at the microphone installed at the entrance of the 
Targu Jiu Brown Coal Autonomous Public Corporation. He 
mentioned that he has learned from Miron Cosma [leader of 
Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation] about their claims 
and that all of them should display patience. Mr. Virgil 
Magureanu said that in the next few days, an investigation will 
be carried out in connection with the accusations against the 
Administration Council of the Brown Coal Public Corporation and 
the results of the investigation will be made public. The 
demonstrators did not agree with this delay.

  [Text] At this hour groups of miners, although in smaller 
numbers as compared to previous days, are gathered in the square 
next to the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation, where they 
are waiting for the arrival of Miron Cosma [leader of Romania's 
Miners' Free Trade Unions], who on Friday [18 February] night 
let them understand that he would arrive today at 1200 [1000 
GMT]. 
  Today the Targu Jiu Court of Justice admitted the request 
forwarded to it by the aforementioned public corporation and 
declared illegal the strike held between 14-18 February [by the 
Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation members] in the square of 
the Gorj County Prefect's Office. The court of justice 
established that its ruling may be appealed within 48 hours. 
  Following that decision Mr. Nicolae Mihu, the chairman of 
the 
Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation stated that he will 
appeal the sentence and that the strike will continue despite 
the fact that it is considered illegal. The halting of the 
strike depends on who will be the members of the government 
commission [to be sent to inquire about the causes of the 
strike] and the beginning of the investigations to find the 
irregularities at the brown coal public corporation. 
  Within a few minutes a news conference is scheduled to begin 
at the Gorj County Prefect's Office headquarters, which is to be 
attended by Gorj County Prefect Gheorghe Caralicea-Marculescu 
and the representatives of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public 
Corporation. 
  Our correspondent accredited to Victoria Palace [government 
headquarters] learned from sources at the Ministry of Industry 
that this morning four general directors of the aforementioned 
ministry left for Targu Jiu to examine, in the light of the 
written complaints sent to the ministry by the Lignitul Mining 
Trade Union Federation, the activity of the administration board 
of the brown coal public corporation . They will also discuss 
the issues raised by that trade union federation in connection 
with the collective labor contract.

  [Text] At a news conference today, Corneliu Coposu, 
chairman of the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party 
[PNTCD], discussed the results of his recent tour through a 
number of European countries. Coposu said that, generally 
speaking, Romania enjoys the sympathy of the West, but there is 
also some reticence, which Coposu termed as a tendency to set up 
a left-wing government and reestablish communism in Romania. As 
a consequence of this, Coposu stressed that the West might 
reconsider its position regarding Romania's final acceptance as 
a full member of the Council of Europe. 
  Coposu also said that during his tour, he paid a visit to 
Versoix [Switzerland, residence of Romanian King], where he met 
with the former sovereign of Romania, after which he emphasized 
that the king does not intend to apply for an entry visa for 
Easter or 10 May [Romania's national day during the monarchy], 
although he did express his wish to visit Romania as soon as 
possible, reports our correspondent Iulia Gherman.

<F P=106> [``Excerpts'' from open letter addressed by the Greater </F>
Romania Party to President Ion Iliescu, presented by party 
president Corneliu Vadim Tudor at his regular weekly news 
conference in Bucharest, on 18 February: "The Greater Romania 
Party Addresses an Open Letter, Full of Reproaches, to President 
Iliescu"] 
  [Text] If before December 1989 the Romanians were worried 
about the future, now they are worried about the present, since 
they are no longer sure whether they are going to see the end of 
the day, because of the hunger, the cold in their homes, 
sickness, epidemics, and the ever growing crime rate. On the 
rare occasions when I participated alongside of you in certain 
events devoted to various historical commemorations, several 
earnest Romanian women called out to us: "Take care of our 
president, do not allow him to be overthrown by the opposition!" 
If you remember well, Mr. Iliescu, we took care of you as much 
as we could. We punished your unfair adversaries, massively 
supported you in your election campaign, and contributed our 
share to the country's stability. (...) Unfortunately, while we 
took good care of you, Mr. President, and ourselves became the 
targets of many arrows meant for you, you did not take too much 
care of the country, since if you had done, one would have been 
able to see some results after four years of experimentation. 
So far, in your opinion and the opinion of certain profiteers 
you have surrounded yourself with, everybody is guilty for the 
country's disaster, except you, who are clean as Snow White. Is 
is possible to show such a lack of responsibility? When you 
were dreaming, from the wings, to become Ceausescu's successor, 
what did you think that the tasks of a Romanian head of state 
are? To be photographed together with singer Michael Jackson, 
to partake in artistic happenings and drinking bouts in various 
Bucharest establishments, or to go to theater shows and attend 
musical soirees, where you could indulge in your own reveries? 
Do you not think that while you fall in musical ecstasies 
amidst the dressing gowns of famous ladies, we are all living 
through the last moments of the Titanic, which sank while the 
band was playing? Mr. President, the country is crying, in 
desperation the workers of Grivita Workshops are attacking the 
headquarters of the Ministry of Transport. The situation is as 
explosive as during the February 1933 strikes, let alone the 
strike wave that has hit the entire country -- and it would be a 
mistake to think that all these actions are politically 
motivated. (...) Mr. President, although you are a hydraulics 
and energy engineer by profession, I am sure you have heard of 
the great Roman orator Cato, who said, I quote: "The thieves 
who steal from individuals end up in chains, while those who 
thieve from the people live in wealth and splendor," end of 
quote. Aside from having done nothing in the past four years to 
curb corruption and thievery, you have now begun to openly take 
the side of certain proven criminals. What kind of hold do the 
likes of Petre Roman [president of the Democratic Party National 
Salvation Front], Niculae Spiroiu, and so forth have on you? As 
straightforward people, who clearly and openly state what they 
think, allow us to point out another sad story: Against the 
background of certain preconceived ideas of yours, which make 
you punish the Romanians, while embracing the minority members, 
certain appalling manifestations have acquired an ever greater 
scope, such as the conceitedness of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania, the impertinence of Rabbi Moses Rosen and 
of other Jews who blame the Romanians for the Holocaust, and the 
magnitude of the Gypsy crime rate, all of which are making 
Romanians to feel like strangers in their own home, which is to 
feel uncertain, threatened, and blamed by these minority 
members, who are abusing our traditional humanity. 
  At this dramatic time for the country, the Greater Romania 
Party [PRM] informs the electorate that it is suspending all 
negotiations begun with the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] on a possible participation in the government. We ask 
the government first to establish order in its own backyard, 
institute the rule of law, and dismiss and sue the thieves, 
after which we can talk again. We are not seeking public status 
and positions; we have been and remain a party of the many, 
simple, and poor people. (...) The country is on fire, Mr. 
Iliescu. Hard times are ahead of us all and so far you have 
given no indication that you can feel the true pulse of events. 
We think that a possible outbreak of popular despair would be 
much more ravaging than the December 1989 revolt, on whose wings 
you came to power. (...) Wake up, Mr. Iliescu, if not out of 
patriotism or pity for the many oppressed and dispossessed, then 
out of an instinct of preservation. We are not afraid of early 
elections, but why are those around you afraid of them? We 
conclude this letter by assuring you of our full regard for your 
real qualities and high position. We inform all Romanians who 
love their country that the National Bloc awaits them with open 
arms and the tricolor national flag in our hearts! 
  The letter is signed by the entire PRM Steering Committee.

<F P=106> [Adrian Halpert article: "Corneliu Vadim Tudor Insinuates </F>
That President Ion Iliescu Was Involved in Sexual Scandals"] 
  [Text] In today's issue of the magazine POLITICA, Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor, senator of the Greater Romania Party [PRM], resumes 
-- this time under his own signature -- the attacks launched 
against Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, President Ion Iliescu's 
spokesman, "despite the suspect protection he enjoys from 
Messrs. Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase [executive president of 
the Social Democracy Party of Romania-PDSR]." 
  In an article published on the front page of the 
aforementioned weekly, the PRM leader claims that "the 
information about Madame Roxana Sugurel (former secretary of 
Traian Chebeleu when the latter was working at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs -- editorial note), with whom the insatiable 
Chebeleu was caught in compromising circumstances inside the 
sanctuary of Cotroceni [presidential palace], were telephoned in 
to our magazine by an aide to President Ion Iliescu, whose 
allegations were also backed by a senator." 
  After vilifying Traian Chebeleu once more, Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor launches a frontal attack against President Ion Iliescu, 
insinuating that he might also have been involved in similar 
sexual scandals: "Why do you defend his sexual escapades and 
aberrations, Mr. Iliescu? Do you want us to believe the similar 
press accusations against you on the same subject, regarding 
certain affairs you had when you were first secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth or on your 
various assignments in Iasi, Timisoara, the Ministry of Waters, 
or the Technical Publishing House?" 
  Corneliu Vadim Tudor does not forget Adrian Nastase, either, 
who is picked as a target for the letter of support he has sent 
to the presidential spokesman. The PDSR executive president, 
Adrian Nastase, is called "sweetheart beatitude" (preafericitul 
bombonel), winner of the great "silver condom" prize. 
  Finally, in the PRM leader's opinion, the two politicians, 
Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase, "are surely leading the country 
to new disasters."

  [Text] Shortly after 1500 the Senate resumed its plenary 
session in Omnia Hall. After the agenda was agreed, they 
discussed a number of organizational issues. 
  Following this, the chairman of the session, Senate Speaker 
Oliviu Gherman presented a communique released by the Senate 
Commission for Defense, Public Order, and National Security 
referring to the accusations of [Greater Romania Party] Senator 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor made during the plenary session of the 
Senate and by means of the mass media against the minister of 
national defense [Lieutenant General Nicolae Spiroiu] and other 
top officials in that ministry. The communique states that, 
quote, within the next two weeks the commission will examine the 
documents and the assertions underlying those accusations, as 
well as the extent to which the comply with reality. On the 
basis of the conclusions that will be drawn from those 
investigations the Commission for Defense, Public Order, and 
National Security will make suggestions to the Senate with 
respect to the way in which the case should be solved, unquote. 
  Our correspondent, Victor Spirache, reports that the session 
then proceeded to hear a number of reports elaborated by the 
mediation commissions [mediating between the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies], after which the senators continued to 
discuss the articles of the draft bill on labor protection.

  [Text] The official Slovak Government delegation, headed by 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, left by air for a visit to the 
People's Republic of China early this evening. The composition 
of our delegation, which includes Finance Minister Julius Toth, 
Economy Minister Jan Ducky, Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik, 
Vladimir Masar, the governor of the National Bank of Slovakia, 
and representatives of commercial and business circles, 
forecasts the aim of this Asian journey. It is signing an 
agreement on trade and economic cooperation that will supplement 
the agreements signed so far--for example, that on prevention 
of double taxation, on the support and protection of 
investments, on economic and technical cooperation, and on the 
1992 protocol on mutual trade. 
  Whether or not the fact that China was one of the first 
countries that recognized the independent Slovak Republic can be 
understood as a certain guarantee that that country counts on us 
for the future as its business and economic partner will be 
clearer for us only after the end of mutual talks. 
  Martin Bartisek interviewed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
in 
this connection before his departure for China. 
  [Begin recording] [Bartisek] Chinese products are not 
unknown 
on our markets. This country is at present undergoing what I 
would term a quiet economic boom. To a certain extent it is 
helped by the United States, and the West European and advanced 
Asian countries. Has our economy any chance in this strong 
competition on the Chinese market? 
  [Meciar] The first condition is for us to be there, to be 
able to cope with the environment, to master the new conditions 
because businessmen from all over the place are going to China 
now. Nowadays there is room there for a chemical industry, a 
textile industry, consumer goods. It is a market with an 
enormous number of people. In other words, it is an opportunity 
for us to be there. 
  On the other hand, we offer the possibility of cooperation 
with our firms for Chinese businessmen, the possibility of 
cooperation in that they could get to our markets, the 
possibility of cooperation in that we might think of joint 
actions in third countries and that there could even be a 
certain form of capital interlinking that would be advantageous 
for us. All these are facts that are important for us, and that 
is why I consider the visit to China very significant. After 
it, the visit to Thailand will follow. It has a different aim, 
but opening the doors to great China is an opportunity for 
Slovakia. 
  [Bartisek] Prime Minister, your delegation, apart from 
Economy Minister Jan Ducky, includes a number of businessmen, 
heads of state enterprises, and private companies. I ask 
whether conditions have been created today for our small private 
businesses to establish concrete agreements in China. 
  [Meciar] The basic conditions are being created, but let us 
say that it is customary that, during my travels, I am 
accompanied by representatives of employers' unions. It is 
because each trip has to be highly efficient, used not only in 
the political and economic part I am presenting but also in the 
part that is presented by representatives of the unions, 
industry, and so on. They gain practical experience of an 
actual partner and then implement what I agree. Thus, the time 
between my visit and their visit is shortened to zero. China 
now buys a lot of goods abroad [words indistinct] sell our work.

  [Text] [Announcer] It has been reported from parliament by 
our colleague Michal Tvarozek that deputies from the Party of 
the Democratic Left [SDL] have proposed the abolition of the 
government decree on the conditions of the transfer of state 
property to other persons, the authority of Julius Toth to 
endorse excemptions, and a resolution that endorses the sale of 
the Novofruct enterprise in Nove Zamky. 
  They have also asked the general prosecutor to investigate 
the legality of these proceedings. 
  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said at a news conference at 
1130 [1030 GMT] today that the draft of the resolution had been 
brought to him by Ivan Gasparovic, parliamentary speaker, this 
morning. 
  Vladimir Meciar went on to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Meciar] I would like to point out the 
following: The draft of the resolution of the Slovak parliament 
(?although it is not signed by anyone) is a result of talks 
between the SDL and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. 
  It says in Point 1: 
  It abolishes, according to Paragraph 87, Section 3 of Law 
No. 
44 of 1989 first the Decree of the Government of the Slovak 
Republic No. 273 of 1991 on the excemptions from Paragraph 45 of 
Law No. 92 of 1991 on the conditions of the transfer of state 
property to other persons; the Decree of the Slovak Government 
No. 40 of 1992; the Decree of the Slovak Goverment No. 144 of 
1993; and the decree of the Slovak Government No. 151 of 1993. 
  Second, the Decree of the Government of the Slovak Republic 
of 15 February 1994, which authorizes Julius Toth, deputy prime 
minister and minister of finance, to endorse the excemptions 
from Paragraph 45, Section 1 of Law No. 92 of 1991. 
  Third, the Resolution of the Government of the Slovak 
Republic of 15 February 1994, which endorses the transfer of the 
property of the Novofruct state enterprise in Nove Zamky by 
direct sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and the 
(?Maktomat) Ltd Zvolen. 
  In Section 2: According to Paragraph 91 of Law No. 44 of 
1989 
and Article 4 of Law No. 17 of 1993 it asks the general 
prosecutor to launch investigations against Vladimir Meciar, 
Slovak prime minister, who is also in charge of the Ministry for 
Administration and Privatization of the Slovak Republic, and 
also against Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and minister of 
finance of the Slovak Republic, in the matter of the legality of: 
  First, the transfer of the ownership and the property of 
enterprises carried out according to Paragraph 45, Section 2 of 
Law No. 92 of 1991 in the version of the decree of the Slovak 
Government No. 151 of 1993 and according to the resolution of 
the government of 15 February 1994, which authorizes the deputy 
prime minister and minister of finance to endorse excemptions 
according to Paragraph 45, Section 2. 
  Second, decisions of the government on the transfer of the 
property of the Novofruct Nove Zamky state enterprise by direct 
sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and 
(?Matsomat) Ltd Zvolen. 
  Third, the decision of the government on the sale of the 
shares [words indistinct] by direct sale to the company (?Monis) 
Ltd in Levice. 
  In Section 3: It calls on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, 
who is in charge of the Ministry for Administration and 
Privatization of National Property, and Julius Toth, deputy 
prime minister and minister of finance, to resign due to the 
deliberate violation of the constitutional oath on observing the 
law in cases of the transfer of state property. 
  Commenting on those facts I would like to say the following: 
  First, the National Council does not have the right to 
cancel 
cabinet resolutions. This is why some different bodies are 
entitled to act if these resolutions contradict the law. 
  Second, I do not have anything against the request addressed 
to the General Prosecutor's Office to assess whether any action 
by the cabinet is in accordance with the law. On the contrary, 
I am in favor of this course of action. In this context I am 
sending a letter to the prosecutor general to ask him to 
investigate whether the matter of the October early elections is 
not linked to an attempt to politically blackmail the prime 
minister and the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  Third, this appeal (?anticipates) the result. It was not put 
together on the basis of any investigation. Nobody studied the 
evidence and nobody studied the facts of the case. This is an 
attempt to disgrace some people. 
  I would like to say that this is just putting the finishing 
touches to the picture of the deep, above all moral, crisis of 
Slovakia's political life, polititics of the SDL, and others who 
participate in this. This also indicates the depth of the 
crisis of political life in which the Slovak Republic has found 
itself. This also indicates an attempt to solve the problem of 
elections by disgracing the name of the government coalition 
representatives even before the elections starts. 
  I have already experienced something similar. It was when I 
was persecuted for being perceived as the main representative of 
the future formation of the Slovak state. You have witnessed 
many events, many scandals involving me--including when I was 
accused of crimes--and attempts to discredit me. As 
intelligence documents have gradually emerged from the archives 
those involved have even attempted suicides. 
  This is the first time this has come from the midst of 
Slovak 
political parties, an attempt to discredit another party and its 
leadership without any evidence and without proper study. 
  I refute such methods. I also reject those who are involved 
in carrying them out. 
  Last night there were talks between the SDL and the KDH, and 
talks were being prepared between the HZDS and the SDL. Today 
at 1500 [1400 GMT] we were to meet each other. I think that 
given the aforementioned information we do not have anything to 
discuss. We need an honest partner. The use of blackmail and 
pressure as the means of talks with HZDS officials is not 
permissable for anybody under any circumstances. 
  Parliamentary mathematics gives them a majority. They can 
express a vote of no confidence in the cabinet and the cabinet 
can resign. This is democratic. I reject their methods and 
will neither submit to them nor respect them.

  [Excerpt] Despite the fact that a bill on early elections 
sponsored by deputies received the support of as many as 11 
deputies from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
yesterday and that another 11 HZDS deputies abstained from the 
vote, this movement is still the biggest parliamentary party and 
thus a new date for early parliamentary elections cannot be 
approved without the HZDS. 
  Martin Bartisek obtained the answers of Vladimir Meciar, the 
movement's chairman and Slovak prime minister, on the following 
topical issues. 
  [Begin recording] [Bartisek] As the word referendum is 
likely 
to be used with increasing frequency in the days to come, I 
would like to ask the following question: Certain political 
moves will undoubtedly follow and, as you yourself have said, 
there is a chance of reaching a political agreement between 
political parties and movements. Following political talks, is 
the month of September, when the early elections should be held, 
acceptable to you? 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should we need such a long 
period to organize elections? Who needs it? The later the 
elections are held the worse, the worse it will be for the 
state, the worse it will be for the economy, and the worse it 
will be for the social sphere. That's what the struggle we are 
waging with the opposition parties is all about. 
  As for who is holding the initiative in this respect, then 
this is a matter of no consequence. What is important is that 
the state benefits, and whether we succeed or not is a matter of 
secondary importance to me; the protection of the state has 
priority. That's the essence of how I feel and how the HZDS 
feels about the elections. 
  [Bartisek] Still, is September actually realistic for you, 
or 
will it not be acceptable? 
  [Meciar] At the moment this is under discussion. All the 
parties are engaged in permanent consultations and, until these 
talks have ended, I do not want to say anything about their 
conclusion. 
  [Bartisek] In your view, how should the question in the 
referendum--the question on which citizens should give their 
unequivocal answer--be formulated?. 
  [Meciar] Let's recall the Slovak Republic's electoral system 
and the interpretation of the constitutional provisions which 
deputies interpreted to benefit them rather than the people. In 
other words, here I am, I have made promises, and I am not 
fulfilling my promises. That must not happen. The way in which 
the question should be formulated is that the deputies, who 
abandoned the initial policies and the parties and movements on 
behalf of which they stood, should not thus lose their mandate. 
Another reason is that the electoral system is based on 
proportional representation of the parties. 
  The second question should ask whether early elections 
should 
be held immediately, but no later than June 1994 which is in the 
interest of the state. 
  The third question should ask whether all those are taking 
part in privatization should not be compelled to show where 
their money for privatization comes from. I would like this to 
be included in the referendum, because so far I have been unable 
to assert this in any other way. Showing where the money comes 
from could be one of the dominant questions in the referendum... 
  [Bartisek, interrupting] Do you think that you could get 
away with putting three questions of such importance to a 
citizen in the referendum? Is it actually acceptable? 
  [Meciar] Yes, I think it is. In technical terms it can be 
done. It is possible. These are the three questions which 
cannot be answered anywhere else. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Regular interview with Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir </F>
Meciar by Martin Bartisek; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bartisek] [passage omitted] This week's events 
in the Slovak National Council were very meaningful. But we are 
not here to comment on them in the literal sense, although their 
progress has disturbed citizens to a certain degree. There now 
exists only the possibility of a referendum, since the 
government and deputies have failed to have their proposals 
passed on shortening the term of office. Mr. Prime Minister, 
what are your next steps in this direction? 
  [Meciar] Today, nobody doubts anymore that there is a 
parliamentary crisis here. We must do everything we can to 
avoid this developing into a government crisis. This 
parliamentary crisis can be resolved in two ways. I consider it 
fundamental for citizens to support a referendum through the 
petition documents. Of course, there is a chance that the 
opposition will propose a petition, by means of a decree by the 
republic's president, that would also support a referendum, but 
with a different content and as late as possible. Between these 
two proposals--that of the government and that of the 
opposition--it seems on the surface that it is only a period of 
a few months. No, it is a question of one year of economic and 
social life. If the country and political life are not speedily 
stabilized, the loans will be delayed, they will be made 
conditional on still further compromises, there will be a 
slowdown and an end to foreign help and investment, we will 
become untrustworthy in the context of privatization, and we 
might find ourselves in a situation where the economy and 
stability of prices and other things is split to such a degree 
that the citizen would have to pay. The citizen has the right 
and duty to avoid this development. [passage omitted] 
  [Bartisek] Mr. Prime Minister, you put forward a proposal to 
dismiss Roman Kovac, saying that his post would not be filled 
again. Does this mean that the complex of issues he is 
responsible for will be spread among others, or does it mean 
that four deputy prime ministers are really a sufficient number 
now? 
  [Meciar] My proposal views the solution as one of personal 
attitude toward the program and the movement. It is obvious 
that Cabinet members who join a conspiracy to prepare a new 
Cabinet cannot stay on in this Cabinet. I am waiting for the 
president's reaction, I have not heard from him yet. 
  The fact that for the time being I will not appoint anybody 
to the post of deputy prime minister does not affect the number 
of posts; it is a matter of political anticipation. I am aware 
of the fact that I have to reach an accord with somebody. 
However, those I will reach an accord with will ask for an 
appropriate representation in the Cabinet. This means I am 
keeping the door open for future talks and for future decisions. 
I think we will not have to wait long for such talks, for such 
decisions. 
  I am concerned about the possibility that the opposition 
will 
engage in piecemeal tactics in parliament, dismissing one 
Cabinet member after another. This would lead to further 
instability and might lead to a crisis within the Cabinet, were 
Cabinet members to stop being flexible [zatali by sa] and not 
prepared to continue their work under such conditions. 
  I cannot fail to see that the president is also hinting at 
something that does not necessarily seem to be going in the 
direction that he outlined on 1 January 1994. The development 
should be normal, it should lead to the stabilization of our 
state, and it should finally allow us to concentrate on positive 
work instead of fighting each other. Fighting for what? For a 
failure? For the failure of our state? That would be the 
failure of all of us. Thus, I am inclined to expect from the 
opposition a change of attitude and statesmanlike wisdom. 
  [Bartisek] Have you not revealed too many of your cards now? 
  [Meciar] I have revealed only some, but without having 
something more in reserve I would not tell you this. 
  [Bartisek] At its meeting yesterday the National Council 
passed the heavily debated bill amending the present law on the 
privatization of big enterprises. Some parliamentary deputies 
have described it as being consistent since it combines positive 
aspects of the government's draft with positive aspects 
submitted by the opposition. This amendment should be close to 
being perfect. This is why it would be interesting to know 
whether you will sign the bill. 
  [Meciar] We shall first examine the bill. It is 99 percent 
certain that the government will return it to the National 
Council by way of the president. The duty to sign the bill will 
arise only after it has been debated once again. The bill 
contains certain matters that have not been thought through 
properly, and we, therefore, regard it as correct that the 
National Council should again discuss comments the government 
will make. I expect that these discussions will lead to me 
being able shortly to introduce to the public the new minister 
for privatization, since in the original version of the bill 
there was not going to be a Ministry for Privatization at all. 
This is why it was logical for us to expect that after the 
final standpoint was clarified an appointment might be made. 
There is no longer any doubt at present that the opposition too 
is interested in maintaining the ministry, and one fundamental 
obstacle to an appointment has, therefore, been removed. My 
hands shall, therefore, be somewhat freed for political work.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar gave an extraordinary 
news conference in Bratislava today at which he accused the 
opposition of attempting to blackmail him to accept the October 
election date. 
  He announced that before noon he had been visited by 
Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, who had shown him a draft 
resolution by Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies to be 
adopted by the National Council should the prime minister not 
agree to hold early elections in October this year. 
  The resolution proposes to cancel some previous Cabinet 
decisions in the sphere of privatization of enterprises and to 
have the course of action taken by the prime minister and Julius 
Toth, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, 
investigated by the General Prosecutor's Office. The resolution 
calls on the two Cabinet officials to resign. 
  In this context, Vladimir Meciar said that he is asking the 
General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the possibility of 
this being attempted political blackmail. He added that this 
illustrates the deep moral crisis of the politics of the SDL and 
others who participated in this action. 
  Meciar went on to confirm that the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia held talks yesterday evening about a broad coalition 
with the representatives of the Slovak National Party, the SDL, 
and the Christian Democratic Movement. However, he rejected 
speculation that he had offered specific ministerial posts to 
SDL Deputy Chairman Peter Kanis.

  [Text] At a special news conference held in the 
parliamentary building today, Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party 
of the Democratic Left [SDL], rejected accusations levelled 
against the SDL that they had attempted to blackmail Prime 
Minister Meciar and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS]. Weiss said that on the basis of the 17 February debate 
on the endorsement of privatization projects, Deputy Juraj 
Plesnik, as the vice chairman of the parliamentary committee for 
privatization, had examined certain procedures adopted by the 
government when endorsing privatization projects during the past 
days. He had come to a conclusion that a suspicion existed that 
the law had been violated. 
  Weiss went on to say that, in view of the seriousness of the 
content of the speech Deputy Plesnik had planned to make to the 
National Council, he had deemed it appropriate to inform 
parliamentary speaker Ivan Gasparovic. The latter had visited 
Vladimir Meciar and had given him the first version of the draft 
resolution. According to Weiss, that version had been different 
than the one Deputy Plesnik had delivered to the National 
Council. 
  Weiss regards the move made by Meciar as being a pretext to 
prevent an agreement on holding an early election and a 
referendum.

  [Text] An extraordinary congress of the Slovak National 
Party [SNS] is under way in Zilina today. Our colleague Marian 
Hudec reports: 
  [Hudec] The beginning of the expected SNS congress has not 
attracted the attention of the Zilina population. 
  At the very beginning SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and over 
40 
other delegates left the hall, allegedly as a protest against 
undemocratic practices in the form of manipulation of the 
congress deliberations beforehand. 
  The delegates to the extraordinary congress expelled Cernak, 
Anton Hrnko, and Vladimir Miskovsky from the party. The other 
rebels still have a chance to rejoin the party, if they ask for 
their readmission in writing before a deadline. 
  The chairman of the SNS parliamentary group announced a 
little while ago that Ludovit Cernak will be deprived of his 
post of deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. This ensues from coalition talks. An SNS candidate 
will be appointed to the post. 
  The delegates to the congress are electing a new party 
chairman now. There are four candidates for this post: Jozef 
Prokes, Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jan Slota. 
  Cernak supporters are holding deliberations at the House of 
Technology in Zilina, probably about the formation of a new 
party.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The several months of arguments in 
the Slovak National Party about its priorities and directions 
culminated in the National Council in December of last year. At 
that time, a parliamentary National Democratic Group of the 
Slovak National Party [SNS] came into being, headed by Ludovit 
Cernak. The existence of two parliamentary groups under the 
roof of one political party should have definitively been solved 
by the sixth SNS congress in Zilina today. Anna Samelova and 
Ivan Samel report: 
  [Passage omitted] [Samelova] The delegates slimmed down the 
original congress agenda. Instead of the planned address by 
Ludovit Cernak with a report on the activity of the party since 
the last congress in April of last year, the report by Jozef 
Prokes on the situation in the Slovak National Party, following 
the birth of the SNS parliamentary National Democratic Group, a 
debate on the two addresses, and the following voting on the 
recall of Ludovit Cernak from the post of SNS chairman, the 
delegates reduced by voting all the four points into one: And 
that is recalling Ludovit Cernak. The explanation was on the 
pretext of saving time. After that, however, Jozef Prokes 
granted the following explanation to the journalists. 
  [Begin Prokes recording] This assembly was called as 
extraordinary on the basis of a 15 January Central Council 
resolution on the basis of the fact that the chairman does not 
fulfill the resolutions of this Central Council or any other 
resolutions, thus infringing upon the statutes. This congress 
has not been convened to discuss the development of the whole 
party or its administration, but because of his [Cernak's] 
activities. For example, the actual Central Council resolutions 
of 15 January presented to the deputies, members of the SNS, to 
return to the SNS group. Then it [the Council] asked him to 
give up the post of chairman, which he did not do. [end 
recording] 
  [Samel] Ludovit Cernak, Vladimir Miskovsky, Anton Hrnko, and 
63 participants in the congress, out of this approximately 50 
delegates from 18 districts, considered the explanations 
formulated in this way to be an undemocratic solution to the 
problems. That is why they left the debating hall at 1230 and 
moved to the Zilina House of Technology. [passage omitted] 
  [Samel] From this moment, two independent groups of the 
formerly united SNS had talks. As to Ludovit Cernak, we were 
interested in the next political steps of his group. 
  [Begin Cernak recording] In Slovakia political parties 
cannot 
be born by division like cells. On the other hand, as 
politicians, we are responsible for crystallizing embryos that 
crystallize on the Slovak political scene. That is why I should 
like to address very briefly the other parties in the center, 
right of center, possibly those on the other side of the center, 
on the political orientation and to coordinate the progress. 
Consistent policies are then capable of shifting those 
political forces that only talk and do not act according to 
their orientation. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] According to the latest information, a group of 
Ludovit Cernak's supporters decided to form a new political 
entity under the working name of the National Democratic Party 
[Narodno-Demokraticka Strana (NDS)]. 
  Meanwhile, the delegates to the original SNS congress 
dismissed SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and, after two voting 
rounds, elected Jan Slota as his successor. He received 70 
votes, with 59 against. [Bratislava Rozhlasova Stanica Slovensko 
Network in Slovak at 2030 GMT reports a varying final total, 
noting that Jan Slota was elected SNS chairman by 70 votes in 
favor and 49 opposed.]

  [Text] The Slovak National Party [SNS] has been purified 
after the departure of Cernak and his colleagues. In the 
future, it will again have a national orientation, as its name 
indicates. 
  Jan Slota said this at a briefing in Zilina after his being 
elected chairman of the SNS. 
  According to Slota, the SNS will continue to cooperate with 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia as a coalition partner, 
while supporting programs of other parties that have the good of 
Slovak citizens in mind.

  [Excerpts] Members of the parliamentary National Democratic 
Club of the Slovak National Party [SNS] headed by Ludovit Cernak 
have decided to establish a new party with the working title 
National Democratic Party [Narodno Demokraticka Strana]. In 
this context our correspondent asked the leader of this group 
Ludovit Cernak for a comment. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] How will the situation that has arisen 
affect 
the Slovak domestic political scene as a whole? 
  [Cernak] It will affect the domestic political situation. We 
have to find a proper place, a place we belong to. We will have 
to do this, so that a normal voter would recognize whose 
policies are demagogic and who is genuinely interested in 
defending Slovakia's interests. In the medium term, given the 
people we have, given their ideas and their potential, I dare 
say I will very quickly build a nationally oriented alternative 
for Slovakia, an alternative that will not play second fiddle in 
the early parliamentary elections. 
  [Correspondent] In what way are you going to sort out the 
situation of the SNS National Democratic group in the parliament? 
  [Cernak] It is likely that the decision to expel us and to 
urge us to surrender our mandates will not be made in the 
parliament. But no matter what happens, we will retain our 
membership in the deputies' group we have created and we will be 
implementing the policy which the whole group and not only our 
faction should have represented. We will give the correct names 
to all the deeds and all the mishaps, so that the Slovak voter 
will not succumb to populism again, so that this voter can 
compare words with deeds. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Today the Hungarian Civic Party of Slovakia 
issued a call urging the coalition of three Hungarian parties. 
Our Bratislava correspondent Ildiko Nagy outlines the document. 
  [Nagy] With respect to the activity of the governing party's 
petition committee, which was formed at the weekend, aimed at 
collecting 350,000 signatures to demand a referendum, today the 
Hungarian Civic Party published an appeal. It calls on 
Slovakia's citizens, especially the Hungarian electors, not to 
join the call for a referendum, which [Prime Minister] Meciar 
has been urging. 
  It also calls on the leaders of the Coexistence and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement to start talks without 
delay in preparation for a Hungarian three-party coalition, with 
regard to the situation that has evolved and the possibility of 
early elections. 
  The need for this coalition is also proved by what 
[Coexistence leader] Miklos Duray said at today's news briefing 
of the Coexistence, namely that prior to last week's parliament 
session the Slovak opposition had not held talks with the 
Hungarian parliamentary coalition on cooperation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] [passage omitted] There is an 
internal political crisis in Slovakia at the moment. [passage 
omitted] Ildiko Nagy reports: 
  [Nagy] [passage omitted] The preparations for the big 
parliamentary battle did have one beneficial outcome: The 
Hungarian parliamentary parties and the Slovak opposition sat 
down at last at the negotiating table. We asked Bela Bugar 
[also known as Vojtech Bugar], chairman of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement, about the significance of this. 
  [Begin recording] [Bugar] The opposition finally understood 
that it is not possible to leave out of this process the views 
of Slovakia's (?15) percent Hungarians, of their legitimate 
representatives. They were not even aware that while they 
needed the 14 votes [of the ethnic Hungarian coalition], they 
merely pushed the [voting] button; they did not even coordinate 
with us. 
  We had asked for several things. In the end, we managed to 
agree that the government--that is, the government coalition, 
which would function until the elections, early elections--when 
it is formed, will not conduct a policy of confrontation 
vis-a-vis the minorities. Those methods that it will employ in 
its minority policy, it will coordinate with the recommendations 
of the Council of Europe. 
  I know that this is not a great achievement; what is more, I 
would not even call this an achievement. But on the other hand 
we must also realize a number of things. One thing is that this 
government, when it is formed, will be able to function for six 
to eight months. Now it will not even be that long. Because it 
will depend on whether we manage to agree to get the Meciar 
government, let us say, to fall within a short time. 
  The other thing is that it is in peoples' interest, as 
voting 
citizens, but I think of all of us, that Meciar's government 
should vanish very rapidly from the political scene. One only 
has to look: They privatize about 10 firms every day, which of 
course brings in large amounts of money, and one cannot say that 
the decisions are taken to the advantage of the voting citizen. 
  Another thing is that this government cannot alter the 
political method that it has shaped here in the last two years. 
This [method] does not satisfy a single citizen of Slovakia. 
  [Nagy] Will the agreement that has just come about between 
the Hungarian parties and the Slovak opposition parties be valid 
even if the new coalition government does not come into being? 
  [Bugar] Perhaps I could put it this way: I am convinced that 
after yesterday's [18 February] discussions, and if our previous 
steps are taken into consideration, I think that not only Jan 
Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement] and 
his people, but also the other political movements--perhaps with 
the exception of the Slovak National Party--will be ready for 
this agreement. So, I feel that by now a system has evolved in 
which we can cooperate. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone statement by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic in New </F>
York; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Yesterday started with a meeting with Cardinal 
O'Connor on sanctions and the humanitarian needs of Yugoslavia. 
I would say that the cardinal had carried out a very impressive 
analysis of the global character of the sanctions and their 
counterproductiveness. We agreed that the sanctions were in fact 
the inability of the international community to find a political 
solution for certain conflicts, and that sanctions were hitting 
the weakest and the most innocent and were, therefore, untenable. 
  The main event of yesterday was the meeting with UN 
Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These talks concerned the Yugoslav 
crisis and its solution, particularly in view of the latest NATO 
ultimatum concerning the air strikes against the positions of 
the Bosnian Serbs. We agreed that the only just and justifiable 
solution is a political one, a political agreement that could be 
reached among the three warring sides without much interference 
from outside, an agreement that would take into account their 
legitimate interests. We also agreed that the agreement on the 
deployment of a UN peacekeeping battalion between the warring 
sides -- after the withdrawal of the Serb artillery -- is a 
sufficient guarantee for a peaceful outcome to the crisis around 
Sarajevo -- that is, the demilitarization of Sarajevo -- and 
that this in effect removed all reasons for a possible air raid 
by NATO against the Serb positions. 
  I would say that the secretary general had a positive 
attitude toward out request for the lifting of the sanctions, 
but he stressed that this depends not only on him and his views 
but primarily on the Security Council members -- that is, some 
of its members, who are still not ready to do so. We said he 
preferred a gradual lifting of the sanctions, just as they were 
imposed. At our request for the reintegration of Yugoslavia 
into the United Nations, I think he reacted positively, but he 
also stressed that this also depended on the General Assembly. 
He suggested that we start preparing the ground for our return 
to the United Nations. 
  I personally think that he was slightly surprised by the 
hard 
attitude, which I presented to him, that the Commission for 
Sanctions was taking when it came to giving permission connected 
to humanitarian aid, the humanitarian needs of the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. Of course, this relates primarily to 
energy suppliers and raw materials for medicine. He promised 
that he would intervene with the Commission for Sanctions so as 
to make it have a more benevolent attitude, and he personally 
asked to be informed about my talks with the chairman of the 
Commission for Sanctions.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Grubac] </F>
  [Text] The Russian initiative has worked and there will be 
no bombing of Serb positions. The news on the first channel of 
the French television that the Muslims committed the crime at 
the Sarajevo market sounds cynical. It arrived, as always, 
after everything [sentence as heard]. Russia has finally 
stepped on the international political scene and -- through 
offensive diplomacy at a very delicate moment -- stopped the 
militant West. The Russian initiative, whose author is 
President Yeltsin with his closest associates, would not have 
worked, of course, had it not been met with full cooperation by 
the Serb side. The triumph of Russian policy over the Western 
arms should not only be temporary. As a serious country with 
serious policies, Russia has now imposed on itself certain 
obligations. Does that mean there will be a new balance of 
power? Is this the beginning of a new era in international 
relations with the new -- that is, old -- Russian factor? 
  According to CNN, 80 percent of the Russians in a poll 
opposed the bombing of Serb positions. Again, according to CNN, 
60 percent of the Russians believe that an attack on the Serbs 
is an attack on Russia. The Russian Church also opposes air 
strikes against Serb positions. Patriarch (Aleksey) II said 
that even the thought of air strikes must be rejected. Of 
course, the Russian initiative contains the views of Serbia's 
policy, since -- as we could see -- Vitaliy Churkin, as Boris 
Yeltsin's special envoy, spent most of his time in talks with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. So Serbia and the Serb 
republic, or rather the Serb side, has been providing evidence 
of the continuity of their peace-loving policy. 
  We will soon see whether the United States will use its 
influence on the Muslim side, not only at this time but also in 
the future. Izetbegovic promised that the Muslim artillery would 
also be moved and silenced. This is a promise that will mean 
nothing unless there is clear insistence on that by the 
international community, particularly the United States, as 
pointed out two days ago by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei 
Kozyrev. The Russian minister stressed the obligations facing 
the Muslim side. Russia has done its bit, now it is the turn of 
the United States. The new peace negotiations will begin, no 
doubt, with new territorial demands by the Muslim side. All 
this has been staged for that reason, to strengthen the 
negotiating position of the Muslims -- from the event on the 
Sarajevo market to the threat of air strikes. 
  The threat of sanctions against Croatia, of course, remain 
in 
the media shadow of these events. Croatia was told to withdraw 
its army from Bosnia by 17 February, as Butrus-Ghali reminded. 
However, it is hard to believe that Germany and its bloc, which 
is still very powerful, will allow sanctions to be introduced 
against Croatia. That would be yet another example of 
inconsistency and double standards of the international 
community toward the protagonists in the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Those who wanted to could have seen once again that had it 
been up to the Serb side, the war would have stopped a long time 
ago.

  [Text] [Announcer] Europe and the United States have 
respectively the same views regarding the solution of the Kosova 
issue, though the United States is more committed to a 
preventive action in Kosova. That was what President of the 
Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova precisely declared to 
reporters at his news conference held today. For further 
details, let us follow a report from Prishtina by reporter 
Mehmet Haziri: 
  [Haziri] President Rugova highly assessed his meeting with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and other U.S. high-level officials. 
Rugova said that President Clinton expressed his deep concern 
over the situation in Kosova and gave his support to a political 
and peaceful solution to this problem. 
  President Rugova considered his visit to the United States 
important also for the fact that all his interlocutors in the 
U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Congress highly assessed 
the peaceful policy followed by the parties and the Albanian 
people in Kosova to achieve independence. 
  Confronted with a reality of violence and apartheid in 
Kosova, which has recently intensified with raids and massive 
arrests of Albanians, draconian punishments in trials, and 
threats to destroy the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the 
Republic of Kosova as the only scientific institution that had 
so far worked in its own halls, President Rugova asked the 
international community to undertake a preventive action to stop 
the Serbian violence that has swept all segments of life in 
Kosova. 
  Despite the NATO ultimatum to interrupt the destructive 
operations of the parties in Bosnia, the international community 
does not dare to divert its attention away from Kosova, Rugova 
pointed out. He considered the trials held in Kosova as 
trumped-up political charges, now obsolete even in the former 
communist countries, which aim to discredit the peaceful policy 
followed by the political leadership and the Albanian people of 
Kosova. 
  Asked by Serbian reporters how he assesses the newest 
Russian 
initiative to unblock Sarajevo, Rugova answered that the Russian 
initiative is good as long as this will be supported by the 
Serbian party. 
  Asked to comment on several articles in the Serbian press on 
the alleged cracks in inter-Albanian relations, based on the 
results of the last congress of the Party of Democratic 
Prosperity, President Rugova was categorical that no 
discrepancies exist between Tirana and Prishtina and him and 
Chairman Berisha. We hope that even the problems within the 
Party of Democratic Prosperity will be expeditiously overcome 
through a pure cooperation and reciprocal tolerance. 
  President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.

Americans Unsafe in Macedonia"] 
  [Text] "The eventual bombardment of the Serbs in Bosnia 
means a bombardment of all Serbs, and with that, the safety of 
the U.S. soldiers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] is brought into question," the president of 
the Democratic Party of the Serbs in Macedonia Dragisa Miletic, 
threatened yesterday. 
  At the press conference, Miletic accused the Macedonian 
authorities of lying to the Serbs and Montenegrins in Macedonia, 
for the past three years, that they will be "returned" in the 
Constitution. The party's vice president Stojan Trajkovic 
announced that the Serbs will boycott the forthcoming census in 
Macedonia, unless two census lists and the participation of 
representatives of the Serbian people, in the census 
commissions, is provided.

  [Text] [Announcer] Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic

Crvenkovski returned to Skopje today from a two-day official 
visit to the Republic of Albania. Albania's support for 
Macedonia's integrity and stability, and its offer to help our 
country in matters of transport and communications, and in 
alleviating the effects of the Greek blockade were the most 
important results of the visit to Tirana. 
  [Begin Crvenkovski recording] The Albanian side reiterated 
its support for the independence and territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Macedonia. We expressed our readiness for 
developing cooperation and for pursuing a policy of peace, 
good-neighborly relations, and non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs. We also discussed economic ties, especially 
projects related to the East-West corridor. The Albanian side 
has already condemned Greece's unilateral attack against the 
Republic of Macedonia and they offered us, within their means, 
the use of their transportation system and port facilities for 
the transport of Macedonia's goods. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Sofia, Dec 18 (AFP) -- Countries bordering 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
agreed on Friday [18 February] to set up a supply corridor to 
the country, to help break a controversial trade embargo imposed 
by Greece. 
  Transport officials from Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania and Italy 
and Macedonia told journalists they had agreed on a road and 
rail link to the former Yugoslav republic, which would be 
coordinated in the Bulgarian capital. 
  The creation of such a corridor was an "urgent necessity" 
after Greece's decision Wednesday to bar Macedonia access to the 
Greek port of Salonika, halting its oil imports, the country's 
deputy Transport Minister Yorgo Sundovski said at a press 
conference. [passage omitted] 
  Greece's EC partners sharply criticised the trade embargo on 
Friday. [passage omitted]

left Macedonia. The complete furnishings from the Skopje-based 
consulate were also moved to Greece. 
  Border crossings on the Greek-Macedonian border will be 
closed until further notice, not only for Macedonian citizens 
and vehicles, but also for citizens from European countries, 
with the exception of the citizens of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. As Macedonian radio has reported, long lines of 
heavy vehicles from Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, 
Macedonia, and other countries are piling up on both sides of 
the border. Rail traffic was also interrupted in recent days.

[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] still 
remains without any public reactions from official Belgrade. 
The exception is only the party SK-DJ [Communist League

act, and emphasized that the consequences would mostly be felt 
by the innocent citizens. 
  However, the most obvious demonstration of the policy of 
double standards is best represented by the attitude of the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], which, at a state level, came 
out against the UN intention to impose sanctions against 
Croatia, while it silently supported an illegal and damaging 
Greek measure, otherwise, immediately condemned throughout the 
world.

<F P=106> [Speech by FYROM President Kiro Gligorov reprinted from </F>
STUDENTSKI ZBOR; place and date not given: "No Solution Without 
the Word `Macedonia'"] 
  [Text] The negotiations can be resumed in a wider 
framework that can lead to an agreement encompassing all the 
questions, not only those we are now concentrated on -- the 
name, the flag, and so on -- which are charged with negative 
emotions in advance. In that agreement, we must take reality 
into account, which means we must reach a lasting solution for 
all problems connected to our economic, political, cultural, and 
other links. We must not concentrate only on those matters that 
are now seen as problems, and thus exclude far more essential 
questions. That is why we followed an example that seems the 
most acceptable in this situation; the agreement between Poland 
and Germany, solving all the questions between these two 
countries that have had great disputes throughout history. All 
of a sudden, different relations were created between these two 
countries, which is a good example of how Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Greece should solve 
the outstanding questions. Regarding the name, the Republic of 
Macedonia is the most suitable solution and is not only in our 
interests, but also in the interests of Greece. Here are the 
reasons for that: If our neighbor cools its emotions and starts 
thinking more realistically, it will see that all the other 
solutions proposed so far were deemed unsuitable by the 
negotiators, and therefore they were not accepted. The name 
"Northern Macedonia" was launched. Later, they said it was not 
adequate because it implied other situations leading to a desire 
for unification. "Vardar Macedonia" was the hit name for some 
time. Nevertheless, they dropped it because the Vardar River 
flows through Salonika. The name "Slav Macedonia" was very 
attractive to the Greek side. However, we were categorically 
against it because we have to take into account all the citizens 
of this country. The citizens must feel the country is their 
own. That is one aspect we have not discussed very much -- 
stability and a better future for this republic. After a number 
of proposals, I think our arguments are now being taken into 
consideration, and they are of a very simple nature. After it 
became clear in Edinburgh that there can be no solution without 
the word Macedonia, and yet a suffix is needed, the best suffix 
to our name is Republic, because Republic Macedonia is a legal 
and state entity and, as such, has its constitution and borders 
defined precisely by the constitution, which makes a clear 
distinction between the geographic name Macedonia and Republic 
Macedonia as a state. Any other solution will imply certain 
suspicions. The question of the flag and some other questions 
are matters that we are ready to debate. It is impossible to 
look for an outcome of this situation without open dialogue, 
which must normally be based on the force of argument. There 
will be no outcome if one side or the other imposes selective 
solutions. That is why we see the solution in a broader 
discussion that will provide prosperity to our relations. After 
all the events that have taken place in the north, it is now the 
moment to look at these matters with open eyes, with a defined 
vision in looking for a solution to the problems, without 
entrenching ourselves in our Balkan positions, which could make 
the lives of this and future generations uncertain.

  [Excerpts] The Hague, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Macedonia is 
prepared to seek a compromise over the use of its name with 
Greece, despite the trade blockade imposed by Athens last week, 
Skopje's foreign minister said here Monday. 
  Stevo Crvenkovski said following a meeting with his Dutch 
counterpart Pieter Kooijmans that his country was prepared to 
resume talks with Greece over the issue, Kooijmans's spokesman 
Bob Hiensch told AFP. 
  The dispute between Skopje and Athens over the use of the 
name Macedonia, which Greece claims belongs exclusively its own 
northern province of that name, came to a head last week, when 
Greece imposed and then stiffened a trade blockade against its 
neighbour. 
  Greece has also demanded that Macedonia, a former Yugoslav 
republic which gained independence in 1991 and which has since 
been recognised by most other European Community countries and 
the United States, stops "hostile propaganda" against Athens. 
[passage omitted] 
  Crvenkovski, who ends a two-day official visit to the 
Netherlands on Tuesday, said the Greek sanctions were bitterly 
resented in Macedonia and that Greece had now closed its borders 
to all traffic barring trains.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirka Velinovska: "A Balkan Step Backwards"] </F>
  [Text] As far as we know, the first reactions of 
politicians from the European Union and the United States to the 
Greek decision on introducing sanctions against our country were 
that the politicians were totally caught off guard and 
surprised. This indicated that all the European and world 
politicians actively engaged in Balkan matters in the past two 
to three years had not acquired greater knowledge in the 
"matters." They had not dug deeply in decoding the specific 
Balkan mental code. 
  To be honest, we have not done better ourselves, which 
proves 
that we are another world among the Balkan peoples: a civilized 
people, a normal state, a decent society. That is probably why 
this decision caught us by surprise, although we survive in the 
middle of all possible Balkan obstructions, nationalisms, 
chauvinisms, political narrowness, and nonsense. Logic made us 
think that Greece could not decide to take the irrational action 
of closing down its consulate or the Thessaloniki port. We had 
in mind a European Greece. We missed the possibility that the 
European Union, of which our southern neighbor is a part, does 
not itself guarantee that all its members have achieved European 
habits. Absolutely the contrary. The latest actions, first of 
all the Thessaloniki meetings headed by the Greek priests, then 
the changes in the U.S. names of streets and public buildings in 
Drama -- as an expression of Greece's dissatisfaction with U.S. 
policy toward Macedonia -- and the decision of the Greek 
government of Papandreou, show that it is a typical Balkan state. 
  It was only a couple of weeks ago that we took into 
consideration the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] position in the dispute with Greece in case 
that country, that is its political leadership, would change its 
policy of imposing conditions, blackmail, and denial. 
  Papandreou presented the resolution of his government as a 
"message" to Macedonia, but also to "others", even to all those 
"who participate in the formation of the stance of the 
international community." The Greek prime minister thinks that 
the recognition of our state by a greater part of European 
countries and the United States was misunderstood in Macedonia, 
which "got false impressions that it could ignore the Greek 
positions, and thus create problems for stability in the region 
at large." According to his evaluation our country "has not 
taken a single moderate or cautious step" since the breakup of 
Yugoslavia until today, while "the basic determination of Greece 
is peace, stability, and security in the region at large." 
  As a matter of fact, we should look for the background and 
the essence of the Greek action exactly in this formulation. 
First of all, Papandreou expressed the Greek insult because of 
the behavior of Greece's partners and allies in reference to its 
proposals, initiatives, and stances for the solution of the 
Bosnian conflict. They have been mainly ignored, and the 
chairmanship of the European Union, while it is being held by 
Greece, has been reduced to a permanent supervision over the 
Balkan "juvenile." Papandreou has been insulted by the behavior 
of the NATO allies who did not take into account the Greek 
objections to applying force for solving the Bosnian conflict. 
  And now the right time for Greece has come: By turning 
attention to the south, amidst the general mess, it is trying to 
prove that Macedonia is a potential factor of crisis in the 
Balkans, a destabilizing bullet. It is exactly here that Greece 
wants to achieve a possible national score, at least as long as 
it chairs the European Union. Thus it hopes to annul the 
efforts of the world for a preventive stabilization of the 
furthest south of the Balkans by recognizing Macedonia and 
allotting it (at least in perspective) economic assistance. 
  In making a decision on this action, the Papandreou 
government has, as a matter of fact, helped its friend Milosevic 
in relieving him of some of the enormous pressures he has been 
exposed to. It is not the first time in the past two years that 
the Greek penalties for Macedonia have been synchronized with 
official Belgrade, with the agreement of the interests of our 
two neighbors. The last one was very much welcomed in Serbia. 
It was commented as a "Greek reply to the behavior of the White 
House which is attaching a growing importance to Skopje by 
installing itself in the Balkans, at the expense of Greece." 
  If we judge by commentaries in the Greek media, or at least 
by the way they had been interpreted by their colleagues in 
Belgrade, it seems that Greece is concerned because the 
importance of its position in Europe, that is in the region, has 
been diminished. Instead of starting a new policy, as suggested 
by some of its domestic political elements, for taking the place 
that belongs to it -- something which Papandreou insists on very 
much -- by creating problems for the international community 
Greece becomes even more distant and places itself on the 
margins. However, the worst of all is that the first reactions 
of the EU partners bring the latest decision of the Papandreou 
government related to Macedonia in close connection with the 
NATO ultimatum, that is its resoluteness finally to become 
active in Bosnia, as well as with the visit of Papulias to 
Belgrade. 
  As far as our country is concerned, the Greek decision on 
closing the borders has certainly been received with surprise 
and concern, while Athens rejoiced (a typical Balkan 
characteristic). The concern comes from the fact that with the 
closure of Thessaloniki's port our economy will suffer 
additional damage. Due to the respect for the sanctions against 
Serbia and Montenegro, a large part of our economy was 
reoriented to this port, and now hard times are ahead for us. 
And this time, not only due to the lack of gasoline. 
  However, did Macedonia have an easy time at all during the 
past three years? It constructed its vitality on the basis of 
difficulties, and I don't see any reason why it should not be 
that way this time, too. As a matter of fact, one must take 
into account that the material damages experienced by Macedonia 
due to such a Greek decision will not be greater than the 
political ones that Greece will be faced with. 
  The greatest achievement of Macedonia's official attitude so 
far has been not to succumb to emotions. For instance, to think 
of some kinds of reciprocal measures or anything similar, which 
would put us in an equal situation with Greece. 
  We now have a wonderful opportunity to promote our 
reputation 
as a European state and people that we mustn't gamble away. It 
means we mustn't allow any Balkan-style reaction. We must 
endure the blow and follow up Greece's behavior in the aspect of 
length of time of the "sanctions" that were simply introduced by 
the Papandreou government. We must be ready to experience a 
probable obstruction in Macedonia's admission to the CSCE in 
March, because Greece has already made such announcements, in 
order to see how Greece is going to resist the pressures from 
its partners and allies if it decides to take such an action. 
  Anyhow, if Athens "is not clear to its European and U.S. 
friends" with its latest action, if its decision is evaluated as 
a "serious incident," it will be a clear sign that it has taken 
a key step backward, into the world of Balkan emotions and 
irrationalities which can lead to a lot of things -- to its 
damage, in the first place. 
  Let us recall where Greece was and what it was two years ago 
compared to Macedonia, which was considered to be a Balkan 
country, unidentified, full of conflicts, and far away from 
Europe. Where is it leading to now?

  [Text] [Announcer Monika Boniecka] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, has, after 
all, decided to come to Poland on 12 March. 
  [Correspondent Witold Laskowski, in Moscow] An accused 
former 
activist in the radical Self-Defense Movement was meeting the 
leader of Russian nationalists in freshly refurbished offices in 
a prestigious building in the center of Moscow, which he 
described as his Moscow bureau. In a small conference room 
plates with halves of eggs with black caviar, sandwiches with a 
less prestigious red caviar, fish, cold meats in aspic, and 
fruit were already on the table. 
  This meeting today -- does it have any special aim? Are you 
(?discussing] any concrete issues, or is it just a friendly, 
social meeting? 
  [Janusz Bryczkowski, Front Narodowy-Samoobrona, identified 
by 
caption] A friendly meeting and we want to discuss, as it were, 
the agenda of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's visit to Poland. 
  [Laskowski] Is there already a date? 
  [Bryczkowski] Oh, yes, there is: The congress of our party 
is 
on 12 March. 
  [Laskowski] And then Mr. Zhirinovskiy would be coming to 
Poland? 
  [Bryczkowski] Yes, he announced that he would come with all 
the entourage of the, as it were, Polish set of his deputies: 
Mr. (?Zhebrovskiy), Mr. Vengerovskiy. 
  [Laskowski] Zhirinovskiy failed to come to Poland in January 
because, as he claims, he had problems with means of transport 
from Belgrade. Now, Janusz Bryczkowski promises him that he 
will be meeting businessmen and representatives of otherwise 
unspecified social organizations. 
  Zhirinovskiy considers his greatest successes since the 
parliamentary elections to be the fact that several radical 
reformers led by Gaydar have left the government. He is 
temporarily tolerating Prime Minister Chernomyrdin treating him 
as a lesser evil. He claims that his organization is growing 
every day. He intends to win the 1996 presidential elections 
when he is leader of the party with a membership of half a 
million. Several days ago we almost witnessed a split in 
Zhirinovskiy's parliamentary faction: One of his closest aides 
could not agree to irresponsible statements issued by his boss 
while on foreign trips. Everything is pointing to the fact that 
Zhirinovskiy will weigh his words while in Poland: Otherwise 
this visit could just be one of his last foreign trips. 
  Witold Laskowski speaking for the Wiadomosci [bulletin] from 
Moscow. [video shows Brykczynski showing Zhirinovskiy into his

  [Excerpts] Leader of Russian Liberal Democratic Party, 
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, is to visit Poland on 12 March 
at the invitation of Janusz Bryczkowski, chairman of the 
Sammoobrona-National Front, who met Zhirinovskiy today in 
Moscow. Here's Andrzej Siezieniewski from Moscow. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Zhirinovskiy will take 
part 
in the first congress of the National Front. His will probably 
stay several days. Asked about the agenda of the visit, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy with superimposed Polish translation] Janusz 
Bryczkowski promised to prepare the whole program. There will 
be meetings with social organizations, representatives of 
business and journalists. We will want to pay a visit to some 
places of national remembrance. 
  [Siezieniewski] Asked if he is not afraid, that his remarks, 
for instance about the corridor from Germany to East Prussia 
across Poland, will not ensure a good reception among the Poles, 
Zhirinovskiy said: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I spoke about it as a possible course of 
events. If the leaderships of Russia and Poland do not take 
preventive actions in due time, then the West will try to move 
its border further. I was in Germany and I know that there are 
forces willing to regain Moravia, Silesia, or Prussia. I 
stress, however, that what I was saying was just an outline of a 
possible scenario for the development of events. We would like 
that Poland and Russia were linked by good relations, that we 
finally break with, to a certain extent, the hostility that 
existed between us. [end recording] 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed the hope that his visit to 
Poland would serve the rapprochement of our both Slavonic 
nations.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Feb -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev will arrive in Poland on 22 February for a two-day 
working visit. The Russian foreign minister will be visiting 
Krakow, where he will meet Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  The talks between the two ministers will be dominated by 
political issues. The Polish side expects Kozyrev to present a 
new concept of relations between Russia and the states of 
east-central Europe. Moreover, the ministers will exchange 
views on the subject of European security and present their 
positions on cooperation with NATO, including "Partnership for 
Peace." Bilateral economic contacts will also be discussed. 
  According to officials of the Polish MSZ [Foreign Ministry], 
regarding bilateral issues the two sides are likely to seek 
forms of political and economic cooperation in spite of the 
existing differences on individual issues. 
  One of the problems in Polish-Russian relations is an 
impasse 
in talks on settling the status of the Vistula Lagoon. Russia 
regards the lagoon as part of its internal waters, whereas 
Poland is demanding that it be designated as open sea, which 
would make shipping easier and facilitate the development of the 
town of Frombork as a sea harbor. 
  An important unresolved issue is also the continued fishing 
of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk. Some Russian deputies, as 
well as ministers, are demanding that fishing ships flying 
foreign flags be withdrawn from the so-called open area of the 
Sea of Okhotsk, that is, from international waters. Among other 
things they are demanding is that the 1987 fishing agreement 
with Poland be broken off. 
  During Kozyrev's visit a Polish-Russian agreement will be 
signed on graves and sites of remembrance. Under the agreement, 
each sides will, among other things, finance the protection in 
their own country of sites commemorating deaths of the other 
country's citizens. 
  On 23 February the foreign ministers will take part along 
with politicians and academics in the opening of a three-day 
Polish-Russian conference entitled "Toward a New Partnership."

  [Text] The Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, who is now 
in Poland, and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski have 
announced that President Lech Walesa would be paying a three-day 
visit to the Swiss Confederation in the second half of May. 
  Much attention was paid during talks to the possibilities of 
improving economic cooperation between our two countries. 
Attention was also drawn to the need to build a security system 
in this part of Europe. 
  Andrzej Olechowski assessed relations between Poland and 
Switzerland very positively. 
  [Begin Olechowski recording] It is a country whose 
friendship 
and will to help and cooperate with Poland is something we 
experience every day. Today too this willingness was expressed 
both in the interest shown by the minister in events in our 
region, in his understanding of the importance of this region 
for the future of Europe and in his understanding -- which we 
traditionally find among the Swiss -- for economic affairs, 
something which we also discussed for quite a while.

<F P=106> [Interview with IMF Mission Chief Michael Deppler, by Danuta </F>
Walewska; place and date not given: "Poland Met IMF Criteria; 
Open Road to Debt Reduction"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Walewska] Will Poland be in a 
position to obtain a new standby [preceding word in English] 
agreement? Doubts have emerged whether we will be able to meet 
the requirements that are necessary to achieve such a new 
agreement. 
  [Deppler] If someone doubts this, he has bad information. 
The 1994 budget is a basis for a good economic plan. However, 
there is more to it than merely the government's economic 
policy. Its preparation must take some time. Nonetheless, I do 
not think this should last long. I believe that there is a 
100-percent probability that I will return to Warsaw within two 
months and we will negotiate another standby agreement. The 
International Monetary Fund [IMF] cooperated with all the Polish 
governments after the democratic transformation started and it 
intends to continue to cooperate with them. 
  [Walewska] Thus it is still possible to negotiate a standby 
agreement for 1994? 
  [Deppler] Absolutely. 
  [Walewska] Still, you hoped to negotiate this agreement 
during this stay in Poland, did you not? 
  [Deppler] Yes, we hoped to do this indeed, but the 
government came to the conclusion that it needed more time to 
define some details of the economic plan; we had to respect 
this. It must be remembered, however, that the negotiations 
with the Paris Club and the second tranche of the reduction of 
the debt toward governments (31 March) was for us a deadline 
that we could not miss. Now, the part of the mission that had 
to deal with preparing all the documents which had to be 
submitted to the Paris Club was forced to leave Warsaw last 
weekend--if it wanted to get there in time. The government was 
busy working on the budget and it did not really have the time 
to handle any other economic issues. Therefore, for purely 
practical reasons it was not possible to reach the agreement. 
  [Walewska] Then what else must be prepared so that the 
negotiations for the next standby agreement can be started? 
  [Deppler] We must take a good look at the reforms and the 
plans for implementing them in the future. I would not like to 
go into details now because it is a matter of mutual trust 
between the government and IMF. It does not allow me to reveal 
the details. However, there are still many important matters 
that the government has only just begun to work on. I also know 
that this work is supposed to be expedited; when everything is 
ready, we will return to Warsaw. 
  [Walewska] However, is it already known what goals the 
government has set for privatization, what the money supply is 
supposed to be, and how inflation is going to be controlled? 
  [Deppler] The financial aspects of the 1994 program are 
absolutely acceptable. The policy of the National Bank of 
Poland is clear. In the medium-term strategy we agreed that 
Poland will maintain the growth rate and that inflation will be 
limited. Nevertheless, there still remains the question of what 
should be done to implement these goals? This brings up the 
issue of the government's expenditures. What will have to be 
done if the budget's revenues are smaller. We also stressed in 
the talks with the prime minister that state enterprises should 
be a more significant source of the economic growth. Thus, 
there is quite considerable agreement concerning the future 
economic program as well as the means by which this should be 
achieved. These are very complex problems; both we and the 
government simply need more time to be able to explain 
everything to each other. 
  [Walewska] What risk can you see in the budget itself? 
  [Deppler] In line with our estimates, the 1994 budget is 
realistic. It is possible that the economy may turn out to be 
weaker; however, this is a rather remote possibility. We 
believe that the forecasts of a 4.5-percent economic growth are 
very real. We cannot see any dangers in what is currently going 
on in the economy, even though we are alarmed at the recent 
price and wage increase. 
  [Walewska] How about the methods of financing the budget 
deficit? 
  [Deppler] This was a problem of last year. The key issue 
here will be the creation of the conditions that will allow the 
people to believe in the value of the zloty. Therefore, the 
government should have fewer problems financing the deficit by 
means of the Treasury bonds. 
  [Walewska] However, there were already problems related to 
the sale of those bonds last year. Do you think that this is 
going to be easier this year? 
  [Deppler] One cannot be certain about anything in Poland. 
We must remember, however, that the situation was special last 
year; there were also constant fears of devaluating the zloty. 
I hope that this year's solutions will encourage people to buy 
the bonds. 
  [Walewska] The criteria, which are usually set by IMF, are, 
in the case of Poland, always similar: inflation, the size of 
the budget deficit, domestic debt. Is there anything else that 
draws special attention of the IMF? I have not yet heard you 
speak about privatization. 
  [Deppler] IMF has always been interested in the reforms. 
Last year we discussed the packet of structural reforms--the 
Mass Privatization Program, the Pact on State Enterprise, social 
protection. We always think about what the government is doing 
to encourage the people to participate in the reforms and to 
finish the transformation of the economy. As for this 
government, we trust that we will reach agreement in all these 
issues. 
  [Walewska] Is there not a possibility for Poland to be able 
to negotiate a "better" agreement with IMF, the extended 
facility [preceding word in English], which is considered to be 
the next step after the standby? 
  [Deppler] We have not signed such an agreement with any 
Central and East European states; we believe that the annual 
standby is more profitable for states that are transforming 
their economies; it is better if the implementation of the 
criteria is reviewed every six months. This extended facility 
that you have talked about, was the only agreement that was not 
a success. 
  [Walewska] What was your greatest disappointment during this 
mission: the fact that the finance minister was not present at 
the negotiation table, or the fact that we did not satisfy the 
conditions for negotiating the agreement as IMF had expected us 
to? 
  [Deppler] We have made considerable progress and worked out 
a solid foundation for a new agreement. At any rate, now I am 
much more convinced than I was when I arrived in Warsaw.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lech Falandysz, minister of state in the </F>
Polish President's Office, by Krzysztof Skowronski at the Radio 
Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today is Professor 
Lech Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office. 
Good evening. 
  [Falandysz] Good evening to you [addressing Skowronski], and 
to you, Ladies and Gentlemen. 
  [Skowronski] What will be the consequences of the 
parliament's rejection today of the president's constitutional 
initiative? 
  [Falandysz] It would be hard to predict all the 
consequences, but it is not true what Sejm Speaker Oleksy says 
when he talks about rejection of initiatives being a routine 
type of measure by the parliament, and that it happens often. 
The truth is that as far as I can recall, it has never happened 
that a presidential initiative would have been rejected. The 
point is that a presidential initiative comes from an organ of 
state power which is elected in popular elections, so it is not 
just an ordinary legislative initiative but quite a special one. 
Naturally, the rejection....[Falandysz pauses] The parliament 
and the majority there can do anything it wants to that is 
completely legal, except that, in my view, it is quite 
incomprehensible and also unreasonable, and quite arrogant, when 
you think about it. That is because I cannot think of a reason 
for having done such a thing--that in effect amounted to 
prohibiting the president from joining the debate on what he had 
proposed. After all, the situation was that the debate was cut 
off and the initiative was not forwarded to the appropriate Sejm 
commission. So by doing this, the parliamentary majority 
demonstrated it does not want to conduct a dialogue with the 
president on constitutional issues--and that is exactly what is 
painful. 
  [Skowronski] And what will be the consequences of that? 
  [Falandysz] Well [words indistinct] 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] What kind of conclusions will the 
president draw from that? 
  [Falandysz] What I think is that questions must be asked 
about the future of the president's cooperation with the 
National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, if constitutional 
issues are what we are talking about here. Well, it so happened 
that yesterday, Sejm Deputy Jaskiernia very strongly emphasized 
that the president will be coresponsible for the Constitution 
since, after all, he is participating in designing the document. 
Well, the point is he does not have to participate. Of course, 
the president has not made a decision on that yet, but he is 
empowered to discontinue his participation in the Assembly's 
Constitutional Commission; he can withdraw his representative 
there--that is myself. I will then have less work to do. He is 
also empowered not to put forward any initiative or to withdraw 
the one he had submitted.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] And what will that mean in turn? 
I mean what if the president decides to withdraw your 
participation from the proceedings of the.... 
  [Falandysz, interrupting] Well, that will mean that the 
constitution will be designed without the president's 
participation. Perhaps Mr. Kwasniewski will be happy with that, 
and perhaps he will say: Who needs the president anyway? At 
least nobody will get in our way. We will manage without him. 
  But that will be a significant event. I think the president 
is fully empowered to act this way because the Sejm acted in 
quite a determinant way--let me put it this way--and they 
refused to talk to him. And with the Sejm additionally not 
making it easier to submit other extraparliamentary initiatives. 
By the way, both Mr. Oleksy and Mr. Kwasniewski had said that as 
far as constitutional issues are concerned, there should be 
compromise, national consensus, and joint work. Forgive me, but 
how is one supposed to view today's decision by the Sejm in the 
light of those declarations? 
  [Skowronski] Yes, but it so happens that Sejm Speaker Oleksy 
and Aleksander Kwasniewski voted in favor. How did it happen 
that the leaders voted in favor whereas all the other Sejm 
deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voted against? 
  [Falandysz] You know, I do not know why. That is their 
secret. You should ask them first of all. They are bound to 
know what happened. 
  [Skowronski] But it was a strange situation. 
  [Falandysz] Well, if you allow me to speculate a bit here--I 
am not saying that this is what really happened--there are just 
two possibilities: Either the gentlemen, all the SLD leaders--I 
mean the elites, the deputies club's leaders, there is a whole 
elite there--voted in favor of the president, which would be 
very nice. The only problem is that either the elites' views are 
different than the rest of the deputies club, or its big 
majority, and that is of course a bad thing to happen since it 
means they have no control over the deputies club. The other 
possibility is that they have conspired in a cunning and 
Machiavellian way, along the lines of: Gentlemen, it wouldn't 
look good if we were to vote against, so we will vote in favor, 
but you, gentlemen, should vote against and this way we will 
save face and it will look like we of course love the president. 
  Except that is not only a fraud, but it is also a kind of 
cowardly behavior since one is afraid to declare one's views 
publicly. So either way, there is a pathology involved in this. 
  [Skowronski] Does today's vote and the rejection [of the 
president's initiative] mean a substantially new situation on 
the political scene? 
  [Falandysz] I do not think so. As I said, the president 
will think about whether to cooperate with the Constitutional 
Commission. It is an open question as to how the other parties 
will act--I mean the parties outside of the circles of the 
governing coalition or the Union of Labor [UP], I mean those 
parties whose votes indicated that they were kind of willing to 
support the president's initiative. Despite their 
criticism--the Democratic Union [UD] is especially 
characteristic in that regard--they were all very critical but 
they were all almost unanimously in favor of at least debating 
the initiative and of sending it to the appropriate Sejm 
commission. After all, that would not amount to enacting it into 
law. One must also consider whether these parties should also 
[hesitating] not do some thinking about their role in the 
drafting of the constitution since the role is indeed marginal. 
The parties are dominated by a huge majority, so their 
coauthorship is nonexistent. In that sense, this may bring 
about some additional consequences. 
  [Skowronski] Perhaps we should try to explain what the 
president's initiative was all about. 
  [Falandysz] In essence, the initiative was quite 
straightforward. It was initiated with the idea in mind that 
under the concept of direct democracy, the president will have 
his contribution. Well, it is not the president but UP that 
began tinkering with a law on the procedures for enacting and 
preparing a constitution, which had been enacted some time in 
the past. They also proposed a preconstitutional referendum. 
The president said: All right, a referendum is a form of direct 
democracy, but there is another form as well, which is less well 
known and applied less frequently; it is called Citizens' 
Legislative Initiative; in this case it would apply to the 
constitution. According to the initiative, a group of 100,000 
citizens--it could be bigger than that, it does not matter, but 
it would have to be some organized centers outside of the 
parliament--could submit their constitutional drafts to the Sejm 
commission and they would have their representative on the 
commission whose rights would be the same as those of the 
president's, the government's, or the Constitutional Tribunal's 
representatives. To my amazement, yesterday everyone said of 
that initiative: Of course, we are in favor of democracy, and 
so forth. But what they did not like a lot was the second .... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean item number two [words 
indistinct] 
  [Falandysz] Exactly. Of course, that is also a debatable 
issue. But the debate was cut off extremely quickly, as if they 
were afraid to continue with it. Namely, the president used to 
say: Under a situation where [hesitating] it is the parliament 
that is kind of responsible for the constitution--or to be more 
exact, the significant constitutional majority in the 
parliament, since it is only they that enact a 
constitution--then in that case, if the referendum's outcome is 
negative for them, then they should be dissolved by force of 
law. Of course, that situation [of the Sejm's dissolution] may 
happen anyway, because if the Constitutional Commission and the 
governing coalition are left completely on their own with the 
constitution, that is if the others decide to leave, and if they 
lead to a referendum, which, it is true, would be a very good 
referendum from their standpoint since....[Falandysz pauses] 
Perhaps they will get rid of referenda now, I do not know. So 
even if they lose the referendum, that would not mean anything 
to them, they will be able to continue with the proceedings as 
if nothing happened: We lost a referendum and so what? 
  A constitution is the basis for all laws, it is a country's 
fundamental law. And if the Sejm is not capable of [hesitating] 
recommending--let me put it this way--such a law to the nation, 
then I have no idea how the Sejm should be capable of enacting 
laws of lesser importance. It is a very comfortable situation 
[for the Sejm majority] since most probably, the goal is to 
survive [hesitating] for four years at any cost. Four years is 
the magical number in this case. 
  [Skowronski] Yesterday, the president visited the 
parliament to take part in the constitutional debate. He had 
not been there for three months, I think. Was that the 
president's last visit to the parliament? 
  [Falandysz] You know, it would be hard to say no, at least 
under that kind of situation [laughing]. As you know, I have no 
intention of making jokes on this, of course. There are history 
books where one can read about that. But as far as the 
[hesitating] normal type of situation is concerned, I mean when 
a president comes to visit a friendly parliament. By the way, 
Speaker Oleksy gave the president a very warm reception there 
and he said: As you can see, Mr. President, we decided to deal 
with all of your initiatives as absolute priorities. We are 
very much in a hurry. 
  [Skowronski] We are dealing with them, and then they go to 
the waste basket? 
  [Falandysz] Exactly. So that is interesting, and Mr. Oleksy 
no longer smiled at today's press conference. It is not a good 
situation because there are signs that our prominent SLD leaders 
are kind of losing touch; they seem to have such a good presence 
and be so European, but it does not quite work for them. 
  [Skowronski] What do you mean when you say the SLD leaders 
are losing touch? 
  [Falandysz] You know, I would put it this way: Mr. 
Kwasniewski for instance seems to think that the internal 
coalition agreements are more important than the president's 
constitutional powers. He often says: The coalition decided on 
this, or that, and the president is supposed to follow what the 
coalition has decided. My question is: How on earth did he 
figure that out? 
  You know why I am amazed? Because this is an example of the 
old Marxist thesis on the supremacy of politics over law. 
Kwasniewski learned about that at some point, and he continues 
to have it in his mind, to the effect that once the coalition 
decided something, that is the way it has to be. But I am 
saying: That was the situation under the Polish People's 
Republic [PRL]. 
  As regards the Sejm's role, the situation in the times of 
PRL 
was that the Sejm was the organ of supreme authority, and that 
provision was included in the Constitution. Now Sejm Speaker 
Oleksy seems to be beginning to believe that he is the organ of 
supreme authority. My answer is: There is no such thing as the 
organ of supreme authority. We have a division of powers in 
effect in Poland; there are three kinds of powers and one must 
gradually get used to that. I hope this is just a temporary 
forgetfulness on his part. 
  [Skowronski] And what if it is not? 
  [Falandysz] If it is not, then I suppose the education 
process would have to be extended. After all, we are all 
learning democracy. I am not saying that I or anybody like me 
already knows everything there is to know about democracy. Of 
course, people make mistakes, but you know, when an individual 
makes a mistake, even if he is the president, that is very human 
because an individual is entitled to make a mistake. But when 
you have the case of a body of people making mistakes and acting 
like [hesitating] someone malicious or envious, that is a bad 
thing to happen, I mean when a majority makes unreasonable 
decisions. I remember that in the period of martial law, I 
think it was Professor Lopatka [a male] who was running around 
the Sejm saying: The Sejm can do anything, it can even pass a 
law which would say that I am a female. Now what I say is: Of 
course it can do that, but it would make no sense at all. The 
Sejm is empowered to reject a presidential initiative and that 
is a legal thing to do, except that it makes no sense at all. 
  [Skowronski] How will one live in a country where the 
president has disputes with the parliament? The president will 
fail to show up in the parliament and all the governing 
coalition will think about is how to eliminate him. 
  [Falandysz] You know, there is nothing bad about it. There 
is a rule in effect in many democracies, that the president does 
not enter the parliament at all and does not pay visits there. 
In Poland, under some remnants of the previous system, the 
president used to pay visits to the parliament, and he even 
enjoyed it and felt comfortable. But after the most recent 
incident, I think he will not enjoy it as much. But let us not 
overreact when it comes to having disputes. In my view, these 
are the usual symptoms of political competition. 
  You know, here is how I would reflect on this: Perhaps this 
[hesitating] whole sudden measure by the Sejm....[Falandysz 
pauses] What did it prevent, for instance? Well, it prevented, 
for instance, the National Commission of Solidarity--which had 
established an alternative constitutional commission of its 
own--from taking a serious measure. The trade union can easily 
gather 500,000 signatures under a constitutional draft, if the 
draft is of a specified, easily propagatable nature. I do not 
suppose that was the goal, but there will be more political 
events in Poland in that regard, and unfortunately one must 
remember that President Walesa is not any kind of friend either 
to Mr. Oleksy, or to Mr. Kwasniewski, or to the people 
associated with the two of them. Historically speaking, they 
were always on opposite sides, and right now it is precisely 
that group which makes all that happen. I mean the people who 
feel very self-confident because of their gigantic majority. 
  [Skowronski] So are you saying the old divisions are 
coming back now? Or are these old divisions under new labels? 
  [Falandysz] I do not know that. I think that it just so 
happens in life that people who used to be in power, want to be 
back in power. I am not saying that....[Falandysz pauses] You 
know, I do not use terms like postcommunists or 
communists--these are misleading labels. But the fact is that 
they want to be back in power under a different situation, and 
they are fully entitled to that, since we are in a democracy. 
But if it is their plan for instance to [hesitating] eliminate 
President Walesa--I mean eliminate in legal and constitutional 
terms--then to be honest, that is not a nice intention to have. 
  [Skowronski] Do you think such an idea has emerged? 
  [Falandysz] I do not know that. You would have to ask those 
gentlemen who keep smiling. But of course, they will not tell 
you. They will smile and say: But Mr. President, that is 
absolutely not true; we would do anything for you. But they do 
something different behind his back. That unfortunately is also 
a certain trait that is inherent in politics. We will see as 
time goes by--perhaps there will be better times. 
  [Skowronski] Today, Aleksander Kwasniewski said, in the 
aftermath of statements by [presidential spokesman] Drzycimski, 
or by the president, that things are no longer merry and funny, 
they are scary now. What is the scary part about, according to 
Aleksander Kwasniewski? 
  [Falandysz] I do not know; you must ask him about that, too. 
I do not know what he got scared of. Perhaps he got scared of 
his own courage and of the discipline in his own deputies club? 
I just do not know. 
  [Skowronski] We will talk about all that during the 
breakfast show. Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski will be here, and 
also you [addressing Falandysz] will be here, so we will have a 
chance to talk about all that. 
  [Falandysz] I hope so. 
  [Skowronski] So we will talk about that at more length, and 
right now, I thank you for the conversation. 
  [Falandysz] Thank you very much. 
  [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Lech 
Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office.

"Polish East Policy; We Want Warmer Relations With Russia"] 
  [Text] We want to open a new chapter in Poland's 
East policy. This requirement results from both the changes 
that have taken place in the area of the former USSR and the 
changes in our relations with the Russian Federation. 
  The main subject of the policy that has been carried out so 
far was the rapid establishment of equal relations with the 15 
newly independent states. The activity of Poland focused on: 
  --establishing diplomatic and treaty relations with them; 
  --creating foundations for regular political dialogue by 
establishing contacts at various levels; 
  --taking steps aimed at the withdrawal of former Soviet 
troops from Poland; 
  --concluding economic agreements; 
  --fostering processes of democratization and the building of 
a market economy; 
  --explaining the responsibility of the repression apparatus 
of the former USSR for crimes committed against Poles, and for 
deportations; 
  --protecting the sites of the martyrdom of Poles and 
monuments of Polish culture. 
  We have made considerable progress in these areas by 
creating 
the foundations for an East policy of the fully sovereign 
Republic of Poland. 
  The tasks of the East policy. 
  We are currently facing new challenges and new 
possibilities. 
To measure up to them, we must focus our East policy on the 
following three tasks: 
  First, we seek to develop comprehensive and good relations 
with those states which are of particular importance from the 
point of view of our political interests, as well as the 
interests of security and economy. The necessity of making a 
choice here also results from the fact that we have only limited 
resources at our disposal. For obvious reasons, priorities 
include, first of all, the neighboring states; the entire group 
of states, in which we are particularly interested, consists of 
the following: Russia, Belarus, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan, 
and Moldova. 
  Russia and Ukraine occupy a special place due to their 
economic potential, as well as their political and military 
significance: the development of our relations with these states 
will spell either the success or failure of our policy. 
  The second task is backing up political and military 
stability in the region. Since the threats are of a regional 
character, that is, they do not pertain exclusively to Poland, 
our policy should be as synchronized as is possible with the 
policies of our western, northern, and southern neighbors. As 
much as possible, Poland should be the initiator and an active 
participant in joint activities; it should take on the role of a 
regional "stability exporter." It is authorized and obliged to 
do this by the maturity--outstanding in the region--of 
democratic establishments, economic dynamism, and respect for 
civil rights. 
  Third, we aim to create new possibilities for taking 
advantage of economic opportunities. This task must be 
approached realistically, which means that we must see that the 
changes which are taking place in the area of the former USSR 
are resulting in new possibilities and opportunities for Poland; 
however, dangers are still prevalent today. In addition, if we 
want to be able to take advantage of the chances to make a 
profit in the future, we must take certain steps and pay some 
costs today. 
<H5>  Bilateral Political Relations </H5>
  Poland treats all of its neighbors to the east, as well as 
other countries, as fully independent and sovereign states. It 
is in our vital interest to see them strengthen their national 
identity as well as their democratic and promarket 
transformations. This does not mean, however, that we will be 
against any close relations among those states, unless their 
establishment is accompanied by violence, dictate, or the 
violation of democratic procedures, we treat them as natural 
processes which are in accordance with the international legal 
order. 
  We want a substantially warmer climate in our relations with 
Russia. We will intensify and extend the scope of diplomatic 
consultations in bilateral and international issues, including 
those concerning security and disarmament. We are ready for 
intense contacts at the level of governments and parliaments; we 
will also create possibilities for frequent regular 
extragovernmental contacts. We seek to broaden the scope of the 
exchange of information and experience, especially in the area 
of local democracy and individual agriculture. We intend to 
propose a joint international initiative which will aim at 
coordinating the fight against organized crime. In the 
international arena, we would like to be of assistance in 
regulating the status of Russian minorities in line with 
European standards. We will support the membership of Russia, 
as well as other states of the former USSR, in the Council of 
Europe after they accept the formal conditions. We hope that 
the Russian Federation will participate in the "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative. This will enable us to intensify our 
dialogue on military issues and to take the initiative in 
multilateral practice and training with the participation of 
Russia, the states of the region, and NATO members. 
  The "lower" border of the policy of openness and 
friendliness 
in the relations with Russia is respect for the fundamental 
strategic option of Polish foreign policy, which is 
participation in three Western establishments: the European 
Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU]. 
  In our relations with Ukraine we will take similar steps as 
in the case of Russia: steps aimed at extending the 
comprehensive neighborly cooperation. Their special dimension 
will be the establishment of Polish cultural agencies in Kiev 
and Lvov, as well as the building of milieus friendly to Poland 
around them. 
  However, the fundamental issue in our political relations is 
obviously the issue of Ukraine's independence, which presents a 
strategic dimension for Poland. The recently concluded 
trilateral agreement among Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States is favorable for the consolidation of this independence. 
On the one hand, we will encourage Ukraine to implement this 
agreement fully; we will also want more vigorous political and 
economic forms; on the other hand, we will take action to help 
this state achieve a deserved position in international 
politics, a position that would better correspond to its 
potential. In particular, we would like one of the agencies of 
the CSCE to be relocated to Kiev; we would like Ukraine to be 
included to the projects that are implemented within the 
framework of the Central European Initiative; we would also like 
dialogue on some elements of the Kravchuk plan [not further 
identified]. We also expect intensive military-political 
cooperation in the "Partnership for Peace" with Ukraine. 
  We are especially alarmed by the statements concerning 
"particular interests" and a "special role" for Russia in 
Ukraine. We do not accept them and we believe deeply that 
Ukraine's independence is in the long run favorable for the 
development of democracy and economy in Russia as well. 
  In our political relations with the Baltic states, a special 
position will be reserved for activities underscoring the 
independent existence of these states in the international arena 
and supporting the process of gradually including them in 
European structures. We expect that very soon the 
Polish-Lithuanian treaty will finally be concluded. It will 
provide foundations for a rapid development of comprehensive 
relations, especially in the area of economic ties. We will pay 
special attention to the issue of national minorities, including 
the issue of the Polish minority in Lithuania. It is worth 
recalling that Poland supports the idea of civil integration of 
ethnic minorities, where cultural and lingual autonomy would be 
maintained. We do not support political-economic autonomy, but 
we agree that the rights of minorities should be respected in 
line with the standards of CSCE and the EU. Any act violating 
these minimum standards will meet with our forceful response. 
Similarly, demands going beyond these standards will not 
receive our support or our friendly attitude. 
  In the development of good-neighborly relations with 
Belarus, 
we want to place emphasis on long-term activities--first of all 
on economic and cultural activities. The example of the latter 
is the opening of a diplomatic mission in Minsk. In the case of 
Kazakhstan, diplomatic activities will be focused on creating a 
positive image of Poland as a friendly state. The main subject 
of the consular activities of the embassy, which is being set up 
there, is obviously the large Polish community. Finally, in the 
case of Moldova, where we are also opening a diplomatic post, 
our political cooperation will chiefly be of a multilateral 
dimension; our promising economic contacts will be extended. 
<H5>  Activities for the Stability of the Region </H5>
  The most important task that helps enhance stability in the 
region is active contribution toward the building of 
all-European security. Good relations with our neighbors to the 
east are undoubtedly an important and joint contribution as well. 
  Poland definitely supports the progressive process of 
combining East and West into one whole. This process, however, 
does not include and cannot include liquidating the forms of 
cooperation that have been present so far, departing from the 
fully shaped and freely implemented methods of cooperation, 
abandoning the ambition to take part in the ones which seem to 
be particularly close. 
  This process does envision, however, the tightening of 
cooperation among states and establishments, as well as 
increasingly closer cooperation based on the principle of the 
indivisibility of European security. In this process, there is 
a role to be played by NATO, the EU, the WEU, the Council of 
Europe, and the CSCE. An important place should also be 
occupied by the CIS, if it opens up to cooperation with other 
structures and, just like them, it is based on democratic 
foundations and values. 
  We all want an efficient, all-European security system. But 
it will not appear all of a sudden like some magical illusion. 
It will be the result of common efforts and of an evolution 
taking place in and among existing structures. We are watching 
attentively the changes that are under way. The establishment 
of NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council, as well as the 
establishment of the WEU Consultative Forum, "Partnership for 
Peace," and the prospect of widening these structures--these are 
very important steps. They are not about forming new divisions 
but about overcoming the old ones. Through our participation in 
the "Partnership for Peace" we not only strive for membership in 
NATO, but we also want to use this frameworks for cooperation 
with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania for the sake of a 
common strengthening of security. 
  Intensifying regional dialogue on security issues is also 
desirable. Part of that dialogue is in the form of 
consultations, not just within the framework of European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures, but also within regional ones, such as 
the Visegrad Group or the Council of Baltic States. 
Possibilities are emerging for setting in motion a mechanism of 
regular, multilateral consultations with the participation of 
the states of East and Central Europe which are particularly 
sensitive to issues of regional security (such is the intention 
of, for example, the consultations among planners from eight 
countries of the region which are currently taking place, 
including, among others, representatives of Germany, Austria, 
and Sweden). We are very thoroughly examining initiatives and 
proposals relating to our region's security, including plans by 
Balladur and Krawczuk. 
  Any constructive regional cooperation is a significant 
factor 
for strengthening security and stability. Cooperation among the 
Visegrad Group countries is an example of this kind of 
cooperation, in particular the free-trade zone (CEFTA) [Central 
European Free Trade Association]. That cooperation, while being 
a clear example of understanding and cooperation among countries 
going through a period of transformations, is an example for 
other countries to follow in terms of how to achieve European 
integration. 
  Bilateral relations obviously contribute greatly to 
increasing regional security and cooperation. The partnership 
between Poland and Ukraine, which is still taking shape, 
provides good evidence of that. The two countries have a 
difficult history of mutual relations, but thanks to imagination 
and political will, they managed to overcome the rankling 
resentments and claims. 
<H5>  Economic Cooperation </H5>
  Eastern markets are oftentimes portrayed as untapped, mainly 
because of a not very active foreign policy geared in only one 
direction. While agreeing with the accusation of insufficient 
activity, one should at the same time state very clearly, that a 
systematic analysis leads to a conclusion that what prevails in 
those markets today, is a risk of loss and not a possibility of 
profit. One should also very clearly state that the political 
and systemwide changes indeed created some big opportunities for 
significant and permanent benefits, but they cannot be 
implemented soon and without significant investments. One 
should also state very clearly that Polish enterprises, both 
private and state-owned, will not be able to use this potential 
without significant assistance from the state. 
  The most important dangers linked to the systemwide 
transformations and to the uncertain future of the countries of 
the former Soviet Union, include: A possibility of using 
economic cooperation and commercial exchange for political 
goals; destabilization (intended or unintended) of supplies of 
raw materials; unfair competition in Poland and in third 
markets; systemwide incompatibility and instrumental treatment 
of the law; disorganization and mafia activity; and the 
destabilization of Polish financial institutions in case of over 
involvement in transactions with the East. Perceiving Poland as 
a country in an unstable region is also a special kind of 
danger. That danger is not linked with Poland's bilateral 
relations with the countries of the region, but it may be a 
consequence of political and economic instability in the 
individual countries, or of conflicts between them. 
  On the other hand, the most important opportunities which 
have opened up at this time in front of Polish entrepreneurs, 
include: establishment of foundations for a significant and 
permanent capital-related position; achievement of a permanent 
position in certain merchandise markets; potentially large 
demand for transit services and for mediation in transactions 
between Eastern and Western companies; signing of contracts for 
significant supplies by state-owned partners; and, finally, the 
possibility of importing services, merchandise, and technologies 
at prices which are lower than on the world market. 
  The "Fundamentals of Pro-Export Policies," which were 
recently adopted by the government, as well as the listing of 
financial resources for that goal in the draft budget for 1994, 
mean better possibilities of support by the state for Polish 
economic activity in the East. The forms and extent of that 
support are still too modest to efficiently enable use of 
opportunities and counteraction of dangers. That is why I 
intend to suggest to the government that it implement four 
programs which will comprise urgently needed measures. We named 
these programs: "Contact," "Associates," "Wokulski," and 
"Transit." 
  "Contact" comprises measures supporting contact among 
people at all levels and in all aspects, among others making 
border crossings more efficient and enlarging them. 
"Associates" is a program of measures aimed at establishing 
mutual capital relations which would render economic cooperation 
more permanent. "Wokulski" is a program of measures which will 
support Polish exporters of merchandise and services. Finally, 
the "Transit" program covers measures aimed at improving and 
enlarging the infrastructure which would make it possible to 
profit from Poland's geographical location. A fifth program, 
which we would like to implement, is named "Market and 
Democracy" and it will cover both governmental and 
extragovernmental drafts supporting the development of market 
and democracy in the countries covered by East policies. 
  Specific measures within these programs which have already 
been identified, will be subjected to interministry 
consultations followed by their presentation in front of the 
Council of Ministers. Their implementation does not require 
significant additional financial resources this year. 
<H5>  Coordination of East Policies </H5>
  Most of the tasks being planned within the framework of East 
policies, will be performed by Polish diplomats. In particular, 
we will submit several international proposals over the next few 
months, such as an East European Commercial Initiative, a 
Consultative Committee for Democratic Transformations and Market 
Reforms, an Association for Prevention of Organized Crime, an 
international data bank on investment possibilities, a draft for 
a trilateral institute of Polish-Ukrainian-Belarusian culture, 
and the establishment of an informal forum for regular meetings 
among leaders and political elites of East and Central European 
countries. We will also undertake many bilateral initiatives. 
We are in the process of widening the network of our agencies 
in the East. With regard to diplomats, both in the headquarters 
and in their missions, we must prepare them better for the 
implementation of tasks envisaged by the programs. 
  We must also coordinate our measures better and more 
efficiently, both within the Foreign Affairs Ministry and in the 
entire administration. With that goal in mind, I will establish 
in the near future the post of plenipotentiary for East policies 
within the Foreign Affairs Ministry; he will exercise 
supervision over subsequent work on the programs and their 
implementation. In terms of the state as a whole, to minimize 
the syndrome of "ministry policies," which is unfortunately so 
common in Poland, I will propose before the government the 
establishment of an East Policy Council, the goal of which would 
be: Consultation of proposals for resolving specific issues, 
exercise of operative supervision over the implementation of 
initiatives and programs, and consultation on ways of financing 
programs while using the resources which are spread over various 
institutions. Apart from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the 
council should also include representatives of the President's 
Office, the Office of the Council of Ministers, the Foreign 
Economic Cooperation Ministry, and other institutions. 
<H5>  Danger </H5>
  I think that Poland's activity vis-a-vis its Eastern 
neighbors defined and organized this way, will serve the 
interests of Poland, its neighbors, and the entire region well 
and efficiently. We want to implement the activity with 
enthusiasm and openness. But for the policy to bring about the 
desired results, we must encounter a similar enthusiasm and 
openness on the part of our partners. 
  We have no reason to doubt their good intentions; we can 
feel 
they have a lot of cordiality and a will to undertake joint 
measures. We all feel that, as my Russian colleague Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of 
Poland's independence , right now we have an "historic chance to 
build genuinely friendly relations, without anybody dictating, 
without paternalism, without ideological patterns and false 
embraces." 
  Nations which differ between them and which respect the 
differences, are still friendly toward one another; if there 
were no differences between them, then they would merge into 
just one nation, and if they did not respect the differences, 
then they would be enemies. Poles differ from their neighbors. 
Our neighbors differ among themselves. We can see those 
differences, we respect and appreciate them. Our culture and 
identity have used them for ages. We are ready to become 
friends. 
  This idea could be endangered by an intolerance by one of 
the 
countries. We can see signs of such intolerance in Russia. We 
are afraid of intolerance. Right now, it is the biggest danger 
to the development of friendly ties in our region. 
  The Russian Federation is today a superpower going through 
transformations which is not capable of completely meeting or 
efficiently protecting some global ambitions which had been 
aroused in the past. That facilitates the emergence of the 
"besieged fortress" syndrome, which is a result of the 
reluctance of part of the political and military elites to 
change traditional ways of thinking and acting, the reference 
point of which is Russia as an empire. Consequently, the 
concept of a strong superpower, which Russia is and will be, 
becomes synonymous with the idea of neoimperialism. That is why 
the neoimperial direction in Russian foreign policy must be 
regarded as a real danger. 
  On the other hand, one would have to have bad faith not to 
see the positive changes in Russia and the progress in that 
country's hard but consistent path toward democracy, a market, 
and the people's prosperity. We believe that, just like other 
nations, Russians are aware that building a power and an empire 
has high costs, and that it is taking place at the expense of 
their personal poverty. They will not allow for politicians to 
return permanently to past goals and slogans. They demonstrated 
that during the most recent elections, in which only a minority 
expressed support for the imperial slogans of nationalistic 
groups. 
  It is that minority that we fear. But we are optimistic. We 
believe in the majority: Our Russian friends, Russian democrats.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Ryszard Malik] </F>
  [Text] After taking up the post of Polish diplomacy chief, 
Andrzej Olechowski had not yet had an opportunity to present a 
set of principles on which Poland's East policies are based. 
This kind of opportunity presented itself with an invitation 
issued by the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission where Minister 
Olechowski spoke Thursday [17 February]. 
  His speech was very concrete. The minister, who has been 
talking from the beginning about a need for close cooperation 
between politics and economics, outlined five programs for 
specific cooperation with the countries from beyond our Eastern 
border: 
  --"Contact" is a program that is designed to support the 
development of human contacts, broadly speaking--individual, 
interparliamentary, intergovernmental, interministerial, and 
cultural contacts; 
  --"Associates" is a program of measures aimed at 
establishing 
mutual, capital-related associations which would strengthen 
economic cooperation; 
  --"Wokulski" is a program designed to support Polish 
exporters of merchandise and services; 
  --"Transit" is a program of measures for improving and 
widening the infrastructure which would make it possible to 
profit from Poland's beneficial geographical location; 
  --"Market and Democracy" is a program designed to cover 
governmental and extra-governmental projects which will support 
the development of market and democracy. 
  Polish East policies are without a doubt a continuation of 
the policies of postcommunist governments. But since 1989, so 
much has been happening beyond our Eastern border, that a 
straightforward continuation of the policies applied up to now 
is not possible. Besides, it turned out that while Poland has a 
vision of a policy regarding its own security and that of the 
region, Russia has no such vision. At least that was the 
impression made after the "whole confusion" linked with 
President Boris Yeltsin's Warsaw statement regarding our 
membership in NATO. 
  We will be able to find out soon what kind of policy Russia 
really wants to conduct vis-a-vis Poland and East and Central 
Europe. The Russian foreign minister will talk about that in 
Krakow next week--he has been invited to a Polish-Russian 
conference called "In the Direction of a New Partnership," which 
is being organized by the International Center for the 
Development of Democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Marian Krol, Polish Peasant </F>
Party activist, by correspondent Leszek Luczak; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Luczak] Was Waldemar Pawlak right to recall Vice 
Minister Stefan Kawalec from his post? 
  [Krol] The prime minister's decision was correct. Vice 
Minister Kawalec was largely responsible for the fact that 
certain reforms in Poland were not carried out as they should 
have been--for example, the reform of the insurance and banking 
systems, and, of course, privatization. Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voters expected to see 
dynamic changes: They hoped that all the factors leading to 
pathological changes in our economic life would be firmly and 
energetically identified and eliminated. Unfortunately, they 
suffered bitter and rather extensive disappointment, and now 
they view the apparent continuation of the damage done by the 
previous teams with mounting irritation. For example, 
privatization of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy [Wielkopolski 
Credit Bank, WBK] has demonstrated clearly that not all 
solutions are equally acceptable. The bank's share prices were 
artificially depressed when they were offered for sale on the 
Stock Exchange, and as a result they rose considerably more than 
tenfold in a very short time. Those who profited most from this 
operation were the Western strategic investor and the WBK's own 
employees, especially its management cadre, who had been offered 
the opportunity to buy many more shares, and on vastly more 
preferential terms, than ordinary outside investors. It was not 
through their own work aimed at improving the WBK financial 
situation but through an unearned privilege that those people 
became very wealthy virtually from one day to the next. And now 
we have just seen the same maneuver being applied, under the 
rule of, of all things, a left-wing government team, in the 
privatization of the Bank Slaski [Silesian Bank]. Forgive me, 
but we must neither condone nor permit such practices. 
  [Luczak] I understand you are making your statement in the 
interest of so-called social justice? 
  [Krol] Precisely. We do not interpret that social justice, 
of which you speak with ever so slight irony, as the principle 
of distributing goods to everyone on a rigidly equal basis. We 
believe that the differentiation of material circumstances 
within society is a perfectly natural thing. We support 
development of the free market economy, privatization, and 
reprivatization. However, the differences we have just mentioned 
should be first and foremost the result of the hard work, 
enterprise, inventiveness, and talent shown by people, rather 
than administrative decisions which give tremendous material 
advantages to some while forcing others downward into even 
greater poverty. Even in the capitalist system we should 
observe certain principles of social justice and fair play. 
Both the past and present history of Western states can show us 
clearly what happens when these principles are violated. Social 
peace in every country and in every sociopolitical system is 
based on general public acceptance of a certain minimum of rules 
and solutions. The reserves of such acceptance are dwindling 
very fast in Poland now, and that is precisely why we have been 
calling for changes. To go back to the Bank Slaski affair, I 
believe that all the circumstances of its privatization should 
be very thoroughly clarified in the public interest. 
  [Luczak] Recent opinion poll findings demonstrate clearly 
and unequivocally that the public, in particular the left-voting 
electorate, is not prepared to approve privatization of state 
enterprises. Consequently, you should put a stop to the 
privatization process at once. 
  [Krol] No, we should not. We understand that 
privatization is vitally necessary. The antiprivatization 
stance of our voters is not the result of any ideological 
considerations but the conclusion drawn from observation of the 
consequences of the privatization process as it has been 
executed to date. The ordinary man in the street notes very 
well how some become very wealthy in the process, through being 
able to buy our public assets not because they like the offer 
and have the money but because they can pull strings, have 
access to those in charge of the operations, or know how to push 
and shove. Such people end up grabbing all kinds of 
preferential chances not accessible to others. Then your 
ordinary man in the street is bound to draw the wrong 
conclusion: Privatization is something evil. That is why, in 
order to defend the case for privatization, we must restore it 
to health. There is no justification for repeating old mistakes 
over and over again. 
  For example, I valued highly the professional expertise 
shown 
by the former minister of ownership transformations Janusz 
Lewandowski, and I appreciated the very hard work he did for the 
cause of privatization in Poland. Many of his errors and 
mistakes could be explained by the fact that he was a pioneer in 
that field, and a liberal in his economic thinking. However, by 
now we have gained much more experience in privatization, and if 
ministers from our current ruling government coalition persist 
in continuing the same mistakes, we can only attribute them to 
ill will. And that, among other things, was probabaly why it 
was necessary to recall Kawalec. 
  [Luczak] Was it also because Kawalec refused to approve the 
project of pouring central capital into the Food Economy Bank 
[BGZ], which is, after all, associated with the PSL? 
  [Krol] The PSL does not own the BGZ. The BGZ is one of 
Poland's largest banks offering financial services to the rural 
sector. Admittedly, it has financial problems, but who has 
caused them? Not the bank itself but the policies pursued by 
the previous governments. They dismantled the system of state 
farms for political reasons, but they did so in a way which 
destroyed the viability of those large farms. And the state 
farms were, after all, the BGZ's main borrowers, so inevitably 
their financial troubles were bound to hurt the bank. State 
banks have received 10 trillion zlotys [Z] for so-called 
restructuring, which in practical terms was tantamount to 
assistance in covering their losses resulting from the high 
proportion of unrecoverable loans. The state decided that it was 
not the banks' fault, since they were simply obliged to give 
those credits in the past. So far so good. However, why should 
the BGZ, which is a joint state-and-cooperative bank, be treated 
differently? The BGZ works in cooperation with a great many 
other cooperative banks, and if they were all to join forces 
together, they could create a bank with a dominant proportion of 
cooperative capital. That would change its profile and at the 
same time restore it to health very effectively. We cannot have 
situations in which people like Mr. Kawalec keep throwing a 
wrench in just because they happen to have taken an exception to 
Chairman Cichosz. It is in Polish agriculture's best interest 
to assist the BGZ in getting back on its feet. 
  [Luczak] Let us assume that Prime Minister Pawlak had very 
strong arguments in favor of dismissing Vice Minister Kawalec. 
But would it not have been both easier and politically safer to 
present these arguments fist to the SLD leadership and to Deputy 
Prime Minister Borowski? Instead, Pawlak recalled Kawalec very 
quickly, as if in an emergency. It looked as if every minute's 
delay could heighten the danger of Kawalec's grabbing the 
state's cash box under his coat and making off with it. 
  [Krol] According to my information, the prime minister could 
not count on getting Deputy Prime Minister Borowski to agree to 
his vice minister's dismissal, so he was forced to act as he did. 
  [Luczak] But in this way he risked a split in the coalition 
and an eventual profound political crisis in Poland, did he not? 
  [Krol] I do not believe that the government coalition was or 
is likely to fall apart. It is far more probable that the SLD 
group will disintegrate first. Very many SLD deputies agree 
with us, either openly or covertly, in disapproving strongly of 
the activities of the group of liberals within the SLD who are 
gathered around Aleksander Kwasniewski.

<F P=106> ["Transcript" of speech by Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman </F>
of the Democratic Left Alliance, at the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, Switzerland, on 29 January] 
  [Text] I would like to start by referring to an important 
remark made by Professor Fogel that there are no standard 
solutions in our countries, and that we must be open and avoid 
stereotypes. 
  Journalists sometimes ask me about the situation in these 
countries, and I assume from their questions that they are 
seeking analogies with the West. The history of Western 
capitalism is well known. Many volumes have been written on the 
subject, describing the path from feudalism to the first 
accumulation of capital. But not so much has been written 
describing the path from a socialist to a free-market economy, 
and on how to solve social problems along the way. This is a 
little-known topic. And yet we are dealing with this topic 
every day, we are adding chapters to this book every single day 
by means of our practical decisions, solutions, actions, and our 
society's reaction. This should be borne in mind by those who 
wish to understand our situation and avoid stereotypes. 
  I would like to draw your attention to three matters. The 
first one is the result of the latest parliamentary elections in 
Poland, where the present government was formed by traditional 
parties which, though changed, have their roots in the previous 
system. It is very important to know that this choice, made by 
the majority of society, does not mean that the population voted 
for a return to communism. It merely means that society voted 
for the best possible path, permitting a linking of the reforms 
to sensitivity for human affairs and expectations. This was a 
politically mature choice. 
  I think the new government's primary characteristic is that 
it is continuing the reforms. It has to do so. There is no 
other way for Poland, a country that has opted for democracy and 
democratic institutions, an efficient economy, and participation 
in European integration and the European security system. I 
think that these democratic elections (in Poland) were a clear 
sign that we are pursuing this path and that we are more mature 
and further ahead in this march than some of our critics make 
out. 
  The Polish people approve of the main paths of the reforms 
and the changes that have occurred over the past five years. 
But society still needs to make sacrifices. That remains a key 
issue. The problem has to be viewed from three angles -- 
political, economic, and perhaps the most important one, 
psychological. 
  From a political angle, the main problem is stability. This 
is essential for the political reforms, and we have a good 
chance of maintaining this stability over the next four years. 
That provides us with enough time to implement essential though 
sometimes unpopular decisions. I think the democratic system in 
Poland has to be steadily developed, and the elections have 
given us the chance to do so. 
  The economic sphere contains greater complications. The 
problem here is finding a compromise between the need to expand 
the economy and society's expectations, in order to avoid 
frustration and disenchantment. After many long debates, we 
have reached the conclusion that right now the government's 
chief task should be to protect the positive trends that have 
appeared in the economy. This is not in pursuance of some 
social democratic principle, but the consequence of a pragmatic 
approach toward the economy. This is necessary if we are to 
concern ourselves with the future of the economy. 
  So first of all it is necessary to maintain such positive 
trends as the increase in the GNP, and find the money with which 
to meet society's expectations half way and solve social 
problems. This is a question of social policy, for we cannot 
accept such high unemployment and the heavy, sometimes, tragic, 
living conditions that have become the lot of millions of Poles. 
  In this sphere we must proceed gradually, because a rapid 
change in the situation is impossible. From the political point 
of view, this is a basic problem for the Polish left wing, i.e. 
for the social democrats, who comprise the largest party in the 
ruling coalition. Our stance is very clear -- the first 
priority is economic development, and we are prepared to use all 
available means to protect the economic growth and raise the 
output of Polish industry. 
  Of course, our economic program must contain such basic 
issues as social security and general expenditures on social 
benefits. In every single postcommunist country, these problems 
are not just economic, but also political, and they occupy a 
prominent position in domestic policy. I think we have to be 
more energetic in our social policy, especially in combating 
unemployment, and I hope we will succeed in finding a fair 
compromise between the exigencies of economic development and 
the expectations of society over the next four years, which is 
when the present coalition will be still in power. 
  The psychological aspect of the reforms is perhaps the most 
important one. Not just in Poland, but also in Russia and other 
East European countries, there is a problem of how to convert 
people's thoughts about the future into reality following these 
great revolutionary, or, if you prefer, evolutionary changes. 
Social enthusiasm and patience used to be an important factor. 
Today, there is virtually no enthusiasm left, and society's 
patience has run out. And the main problem is compelling people 
to take an active role in the changes. 
  I do not think these issues are being correctly resolved in 
our countries. The problem is to encourage Poles to take an 
active part in democratic institutions, political structures at 
all levels, trade unions, and the country's economic life. 
  A very important and positive fact is that literally 
thousands of people are taking an active part in privatization, 
stock exchange operations, and the acquisition and disposal of 
shares. This is essential if we want to have a society that is 
energetic and geared to a free market. 
  Of course, Poland had and still has an advantage over its 
neighbors inasmuch as under the previous system it maintained a 
small but neverthleless real private sector in the economy. The 
main task at present is to convince people that further reforms 
possess a purpose and genuine justification, and that these 
further reforms are not being pursued just for the hell of it, 
nor have they been suggested by American advisers, the IMF, or 
our friends in Davos here. The reforms are of fundamental 
importance for every Polish family, because thanks to them we 
can proceed ahead to a better life. It is of vital importance 
that everyone understands this, and we must find good arguments 
to channel our educated society's energy potential into pursuing 
the reforms. 
  The chief danger to the reforms in Poland, and probably in 
other central and East European countries, is not the coming 
into power of a left wing or right wing party, but society's 
frustration and disenchantment, which could spoil the progress 
of the reforms. We must eliminate this danger, and I think that 
in Poland we are managing to do so.

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Feb -- Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman 
of the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission and the SLD 
[Democratic Left Alliance] leader, has described the president's 
decision to withdraw his representative from the Commission as a 
kind of political action with preparations for the next 
presidential election in mind. "This is a prelude to the 
election," Kwasniewski said in an interview for a PAP journalist. 
  He confirmed that the Commission was working in accordance 
with the 1991 law on the procedures of preparing and adopting 
the constitution, and that it was going to continue its task 
irrespective of the presidential representative's absence. He 
added that the "Constitution issue is moving to a political 
plane with the constitutional referendum as an epilogue." 
According to Kwasniewski, there will be a clear division of 
political forces during the referendum, with one group calling 
for the support of the constitution and another being against 
it. "The president clearly wants to attach himself to such an 
alternative to the present parliament," Kwasniewski said. 
  The SLD leader does not see the conflict as a kind of a 
"game 
at the top" between the president and parliament, as there are 
divergent interests. "The president is anxious to be reelected 
and he assumed that he could treat the Constitution as an 
element in the battle for reelection," Kwasniewski said. 
  While commenting on Lech Walesa's statement that the "post- 
communists have started feeling strong and they are becoming too 
cocksure and the president would like to clip their wings a 
bit," Kwasniewski said that he "did not know where this strength 
lay." According to him, the president "clearly wants to place 
himself closer to the right side, seeing there a chance for 
support. But if this is the way -- the president comments on 
the vote on his constitutional bills -- then he is exaggerating. 
There was no strategy in the voting. Not only the SLD 
deputies, but also his favorite Polish Peasant Party deputies 
voted against," Kwasniewski stated.

  [Text] The longest strike in the post-war history of Poland 
ended last night. After 19 days, 78 miners from the Pomorzany 
mine [belonging to the Boleslaw Mining and Metallurgical Plant] 
returned to the surface. 
  A signed agreement guarantees the miners a pay rise of 1.5 
million zlotys a month and a quarterly bonus based on the 
enterprise's profits. According to the director of the Boleslaw 
mining and metallurgical plant this is all the enterprise can 
manage at the moment.

  [Text] At the end of the Russian Foreign Minister talks in 
Prague, our correspondent David Stahlavsky obtained Andrey 
Kozyrev's exclusive answer to the following question: 
  [Stahlavsky] I asked the Russian foreign minister about the 
assumption voiced by some Western newspapers that the division 
of the world into two blocs or, in other words, the former 
Soviet and the Western bloc, is not over yet because Russia has 
failed to support the decision of the NATO Council to use force 
in the Bosnian conflict. The problem exists, and its essence is 
that NATO adopted this decision without consulting us, the 
foreign minister of the Russian Federation said in response to a 
question from Czech radio. 
  [Begin recording; Kozyrev in Russian fading into 
superimposed 
Czech translation] Thus the ball is in their court. We favor a 
joint course of action and our choice [volba] is thus absolutely 
clear. But this has nothing to do with the lasting East-West 
division. I think that the concept of all spheres of influence 
in the sense of superpowers enjoying a dominant position is a 
remnant of the past. If we talk about spheres of interests, I 
do not conceal the fact that we have an interest in having good 
relations with the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia and that 
we perhaps even have special interests. But we respect all 
countries. You certainly understand that distant countries, 
with which we have never had close contacts, are one thing; but 
our contacts with the Czech lands are the closest possible. 
  When I was speaking today to a professor of Russian at 
Charles University, he confirmed to me that there were so many 
people interested in studying it that students had to compete 
for places. We are pleased about this, and this is that special 
interest I spoke about--to preserve our cultural and spiritual 
relations. [end recording] 
  However, the interpretation of some people, who say that 
Russia intends to dominate, dictate, and issue permission or 
bans, is absurd. This all is the past, Andrey Kozyrev stressed 
in his interview with Czech Radio. He went on to say: 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] The division of the world into 
blocs, the West and the East, is also the past. This is why I 
am striving to search for ways that would not preserve this 
division. The unification of Europe is the CSCE's final aim, 
expressed in every [CSCE] document, involving both us and you. 
And it is necessary to make further progress. I discussed this 
with the [Czech] president and the [Czech] foreign minister. It 
is necessary to think in specific terms. To be more specific, a 
CSCE meeting at the highest level will take place at the end of 
this year. 
  In my view, this is the forum where decisions aimed at 
achieving this target should be made--instead of going the 
opposite way, toward some sort of crusade. The truth is that 
some demons, smelling of mothballs and emerging from graves, 
have been attacking us in an attempt to gain power over us. 
Some people speak about crusades, now at the end of the 20th 
century. Others speculate about a division of the world, for 
various reasons, into East and West. [end recording] 
  In reality, we are living at the end of the 20th century, 
when the topical issue is a united Europe, the Russian foreign 
minister repeated and stressed. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] This is a specific job. I am aware 
of the fact that many people do not like this because it 
involves ideas and day-to-day work. This is the most difficult 
process of dialogues, talks, and consultative meetings, 
acceptance of other views. You want one thing and your partner 
proposes something a bit different. Such day-to-day work is 
something you have to take into account. On the other hand, 
single-minded judges do not need to listen to anybody; they say 
what they want. This is why, for many cheap politicians, this 
is the activity they like most from a psychological point of 
view. On one side you have a concept, on the other a 
declaration. I am in favor of the former variant and this is 
also the purpose of my visit: not to look for disputed points 
and subjects but, instead, to look for progress towards a 
united Europe. As far as this is concerned, my talks with 
President Havel were very constructive indeed. He is a man who 
is also searching. He is prepared to listen and formulate 
ideas. To make statements to the media about insuperable 
differences is something different; it is a way to score 
political points on the domestic political scene. [end 
recording]

have, for the time being, given up the announced air strikes on 
the positions of the Srpska republic army around Sarajevo? 
  [Martic] I would say that a great political wisdom was shown 
here, particularly by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and 
certainly by Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic. In a very positive way, NATO forces found themselves 
in a situation in which the unpopular idea of bombing was simply 
avoided. 
  I also have to say that all of us here were somewhat 
positively surprised by Russia's diplomacy, but when one 
observes the entire picture, we must say that this was the last 
bandwagon Russia jumped on; it came to grips with other 
diplomatic circles in the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 21 (TANJUG) -- U.N. Secretary General 
special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi stated on 
Monday that the solution for the partial demilitarization of 
Sarajevo will be a model for other cities in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example Mostar. 
  Fighting has been going on for one year already in Mostar, 
southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, between Bosnian Moslems and Croats 
for domination over the city. 
  If there are no grave breeches of the ceasefire in the 
region 
of Sarajevo, we could say that the possibility that NATO air 
strikes be launched in Bosnia is longer existant, Akashi said in 
an interview to Japanese television. 
  Serbs and Moslems have complied with NATO's demand that by 
midnight February 20 heavy weapons around Sarajevo be withdrawn 
or placed under U.N. control, therefore according to UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] headquarters, NATO air strikes are not 
necessary. 
  The ceasefire, which was signed last Wednesday by Serbian 
and 
Moslem forces in Sarajevo, is also respected. 
  Akashi said he hoped that new agreements between the warring 
sides will be reached soon. The economic and social life in 
Sarajevo could be renewed and citizens could leave and enter the 
city freely, he said. 
  Akashi explained that NATO's threats of air strike have had 
a 
specific role in achieving the partial demilitarization of 
Sarajevo, but that other factors have also helped. 
  The complete calming of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cannot be achieved for several months yet, Akashi assessed and 
added that the U.N. will continue to use the carrot and stick 
method, to bring the warring sides to an agreement. 
  Akashi considered that the three warring sides in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, Moslem, Serbian and Croatian, will form three 
republics, gathered in a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina. Akashi 
said he hoped that the earlier communal life would be possible 
once again. 
  The plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into three ethnic 
republics, supported by the European Union and on the basis of 
which peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina are being led, is 
accepted by Bosnian Serbs and Croats, and rejected by Moslems.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic </F>
by Dragan Colovic on the "An Argument More" program; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Good day, Mr. Jovanovic. 
  [Jovanovic] Good day. 
  [Colovic] The news that there is no need for a military 
intervention by NATO in Sarajevo has been received and met with 
great relief, both in the country and in the world. In your 
opinion, who and what should be given credit for such a positive 
denouement? 
  [Jovanovic] One should, above all, give credit to the 
consistent and courageous peace-loving policy that the Serbs in 
Bosnia and we in Yugoslavia have persistently been conducting in 
order to overcome and solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This peace-loving policy could not but meet with a reaction 
among those people who are also interested in a peaceful 
solution: First, Russia, but also other countries -- Greece and 
others -- who all had uneasy feelings about the possibility that 
NATO's reckless policy in this crisis could upset the balance 
and all the conditions for creating regional stability. This is 
why the agreement on a cease- fire has been accompanied by the 
agreement on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which had been 
reached before issuing this hapless ultimatum that really 
appeared to be a shot in the dark. It was simply, as Mr. 
Karadzic put it, like walking through an open door [as heard]. 
This leads us to conclude that NATO also had other goals that 
it hoped to achieve with this ultimatum rather than influencing 
the solving of the crisis. It also had internal needs to 
reaffirm itself under the conditions of having lost its enemy 
and through aggravating the crisis in Bosnia, to strengthen its 
internal ranks, which were seriously threatened by the lack of 
outside danger. Therefore, the fact that peace was again 
maintained due to the presence of mind and principled stand of 
the Bosnian Serbs and us, as well as other peace-loving forces 
in the international community, is now a common good that.... 
  [Colovic, interrupting] should be preserved. 
  [Jovanovic] That should be preserved and strengthened so 
that strikes against the peace process will not be able to be 
(?repeated), such as the most recent one that could have 
permanently halted the peace process if one had failed to take 
care of it. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, what will it depend on that this 
positive moment could be taken advantage of for new and even 
more decisive steps toward peace, not only in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in the broader territories of the 
former Yugoslavia? 
  [Jovanovic] This reasonableness, responsibility, and 
experience in approaching a tense and critical situation should 
certainly be preserved and increased. However, one should 
immediately be warned that dangers to the present peace still 
exist. They may, above all, come from the Muslim side, which is 
inclined to carry out all sorts of diversions -- both staged and 
not -- against peace. One should also be wary of the leading 
Western factors that are continuing, and even intensifying, the 
unbalanced approach to solving the Bosnian crisis. These are 
two negative aspects that are still present, despite the 
regressing of the present crisis, and that could greatly damage 
the peace process if they acted freely. Moreover, it is very 
important that this peace process be continued and that this 
positive example of Sarajevo be used to reduce tension and 
demilitarization in other regions in which battles are still 
being waged or which could be dangerous for the peace process. 
When all this is accomplished, then this just and permanent 
peace that has long been talked about would really be at an 
arm's length. Let me warn you, however, that the advocators of 
ultimatums, of a forced and unjust solution, are still thinking 
about imposing this solution by using political and other forces. 
  [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, while you are on this topic, 
what else is equally important to strengthen this positive 
trend? I am mainly referring to what you have just mentioned -- 
that there are still people who would like to throw a monkey 
wrench into the wheels of this peace process, which has 
obviously been strengthened. 
  [Jovanovic] The forces that are in favor of this process, of 
reaching a balanced and just political solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, should become even more active and should be 
the very side to impose the tone for further negotiations. It 
should not be those forces who want to use the peace process to 
sabotage it and persuade the world that the war option is the 
only one for solving the crisis. 
  On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify our contacts 
with old and new neighbors who are also increasingly more 
interested in reaching this just and lasting peace. In this 
sense, we have permanent contacts with all our (?permanent) 
earlier neighbors, except for Albania, although we are open for 
contacts with this country as well. An envoy is visiting Turkey 
today and will hold political consultations with the Turkish 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also hope to have more dynamic 
contacts with other neighboring countries [as heard]. 
  Finally, in this context are also efforts to normalize our 
relations with Croatia in a way that would equally respect the 
legitimate rights and interest of the Serbian people in Krajina. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, I thank you very much on behalf of 
the listeners of the "An Argument More" program. 
  [Jovanovic] Not at all.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What Is Grounded at Salonika Port?"] </F>
  [Text] According to initial insights, the biggest losses 
from the Greek blockade will be suffered by the energetic [as 
received], the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy. 
  The review drawn up by the Chamber of Commerce shows that 
60-80 percent of the products of "Jugohrom," "Zletovo," FENI and 
the Skopje steelworks, intended for export, transit through 
Greece, that is the Salonika port, and out of the total raw 
materials and repromaterials, 50-60 percent are imported through 
Greece. 
  Some 52,000 tonnes of crude oil are currently at the crude 
oil installations of "Mamidakis" and "Jet Oil" in Salonika, 
while 116 cisterns are loaded at the station in Salonika and 
Idomeni. 
  A ship carrying 18,000 of phosphate for the smeltery in 
Veles 
was caught in the process of unloading, and only 28 wagons have 
been dispatched, so far. 
  800 tonnes of ferro-alloys are ready to be loaded, a wooden 
construction of 500 cubic meters has been stocked, and there are 
also some 400 tonnes of sheet metal awaiting delivery, at the 
same port. 
  As it was said yesterday, at the meeting of the Chamber of 
Commerce, this points to an alarming condition and the need to 
find alternative solutions. Certain businessmen said that the 
government is giving out hopes of false optimism, and that 
something much greater is behind this Greek move, and that a 
strategy of reciprocity should be worked out. The idea to look 
for a corridor for transit of the goods, through FR Yugoslavia, 
was also raised.

  [Text] The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] fully 
supports the position of the NATO states with regard to military 
intervention in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According 
to Jerzy Chmielewski, of the MSZ European Department, the 
current situation, which has arisen after the expiry of the NATO 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, should be used to consolidate 
the ceasefire and resume peace talks between the parties 
involved. Chmielewski's opinion is that as a transition stage, 
new areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated into the 
security zones.

  [Text] Belgrade Feb 22 (CTK) -- Nikola Koljevic, spokesman 
of the Bosnian Serbs, today described as very interesting Czech 
Defence Minister Antonin Baudys' proposal for solving the 
conflict in Bosnia. 
  Baudys' proposal consists mainly in setting up a 
seven-member 
Executive Committee of Good Will (ECGW), including countries 
"connected by their religious and cultural values" to the 
warring groups in Bosnia. Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, 
France and Italy could become members of such a committee, 
Baudys suggested on Saturday [19 February]. 
  "For us it is a new proposal. It should be discussed in 
Skupstina (parliament). Nevertheless it is very interesting 
especially because it is a practical proposal," Koljevic, 
vice-president of the Serbian Republic in Bosnia, told CTK by 
telephone from Pale near Sarajevo. 
  At the same time, he voiced certain doubts over "the 
possibility of implementation of the proposal in practice." 
Difficulties would arise in connection with full disarmament 
which has been already unambiguously rejected by the Moslem side 
at the Geneva talks, he said. 
  "However at least the restriction of weapons could certainly 
be discussed. It would represent great progress since a truce, 
if not peace, could be more easily achieved by this and the 
antagonistic ethnic groups would have greater certainty. This 
would be more realistic," Koljevic said.

  [Text] Sofia, February 19 (BTA) -- "The purpose of my 
visit is to convey the warm feelings of the Russian people 
towards Bulgaria. I was assigned this task by the newly elected 
members of the Duma of the Russian Federation," Mr. Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the Duma, the lower chamber of Russia's Federal 
Assembly, told the press. He is heading a Russian parliamentary 
delegation which arrived here today. 
  The chairman of Bulgaria's parliament, Mr. Aleksandur 
Yordanov, said he was happy that a Russian parliamentary 
delegation of such a high rank has come to Bulgaria immediately 
after the parliamentary elections and the passage of Russia's 
new Constitution. "Mr. Rybkin and I will have the opportunity 
to discuss various issues of bilateral cooperation as well as 
legislation problems in connection with the reform in our 
countries, and last but not least, we intend to discuss the 
situation in the Balkans," he explained. 
  In connection with the latest developments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Mr. Rybkin said that whatever happens, NATO's 
ultimatum should not be carried out and that a peaceful way out 
of the conflict will have to be found. Russian MP's believe 
that in order to find a peaceful settlement, the concerned 
parties should accept the proposal of the foreign minister, the 
government and the president of Russia that the members of the 
UN Security Council meet in Geneva and that all sanctions be 
lifted. 
  During its four-day visit here the Russian delegation will 
meet with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, the 
parliamentary political forces, Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov, and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. The delegation will 
also be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  Tomorrow the delegation is scheduled to visit Pleven (in 
northern Bulgaria).

  [Text] Sofia, February 21 (BTA) -- A delegation of the 
Russian Parliament, led by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State 
Duma, met with Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov this morning. The delegation arrived here on Saturday 
[19 February] on the first visit of Russian Duma members abroad. 
  Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Rybkin discussed the development of 
relations between Bulgaria and Russia and their economic crisis. 
  "We discussed the crisis in Bosnia and agreed that it can 
only be settled by peaceful means," Mr. Rybkin told reporters 
after the meeting. "All sanctions against former Yugoslavia 
which hinder our two countries' economies should be lifted," he 
said. "I familiarized Mr. Rybkin with Bulgaria's principled and 
invariable position of neutrality in the current complicated 
situation in ex- Yugoslavia. I also told him that for two years 
now Bulgaria has been calling on all countries in the Balkans to 
refrain from involvement in the Yugoconflict," the head of the 
Bulgarian Parliament said. "We assessed NATO's ultimatum as a 
means for faster settlement of the conflict, and the differences 
in our stands are minor," Mr. Yordanov added. 
  Later in the day, the Russian MP's discussed bilateral 
relations and the Yugocrisis at successive meetings with M.P's 
of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS), the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
(DPS) and the New Union for Democracy (formed by expellees or 
breakways from the parliamentary SDS). 
  BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva described the meeting as a 
beginning of contacts between the two parliaments in the light 
of a general tendency towards a left and left-of-centre 
orientation of East European countries, the Parliamentary Press 
Centre announced after the meeting. According to BSP leader 
Zhan Videnov, the Russian delegation's visit is part of the 
active policy which Russia has been pursuing in the Balkans. 
BSP believes Russia's decisive interference to prevent further 
escalation of the conflict was not accidental and could be 
viewed as a serious success, crowning the several months' 
efforts of Russian foreign policy, Mr. Videnov told reporters 
after the meeting. "The Yugoembargo should not stand in the way 
of the peace process in former Yugoslavia. If the peace process 
gets an impetus, in the next few days we will have to reconsider 
the positive and possibly negative effects of the embargo. This 
does not concern the arms embargo which by all means should be 
kept against all warring parties," Mr. Videnov said, commenting 
on Mr. Rybkin's opinion on lifting the embargo against former 
Yugoslavia. Mr. Videnov announced that a delegation of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party will visit Moscow in a week's time to 
meet Russian left-wing parties. 
  The parliamentary SDS set forth its position in favour of 
Bulgaria's independent foreign policy based on two priorities: 
Integration into the European structures and policy in the 
Balkans, stressing that the time of Balkan axes and blocs has 
gone, said Asparukh Panov MP of the SDS, chief Bulgarian 
delegate to the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. "We 
expressed our satisfaction with the demilitarization of Sarajevo 
and congratulated our guests on Russia's active diplomatic 
interference in the last few days, which contributed to the 
success of NATO's ultimatum," Mr. Panov added. Asked if 
Bulgarian MP's sitting in the CE [Council of Europe] 
Parliamentary Assembly would support Russia's application for 
membership in the CE, Mr. Panov said that Russia is a major 
factor in the European processes but should meet some 
requirements to qualify for full membership in the CE, mainly 
concerning human and minority rights. 
  Conferring with members of the Parliamentary DPS, Mr. Rybkin 
stressed that the members of the State Duma support President 
Yeltsin in his efforts towards peaceful settlement of the 
conflict in Bosnia, DPS spokesman Yunal Lyutfi said after the 
meeting. DPS MP's have been formally invited by Mr. Rybkin to 
visit the Russian Duma.

  [Text] Prague Feb 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
expressed resolute disagreement with the course of action of 
Defence Minister Antonin Baudys who proposed his initiative for 
solving the situation in Bosnia to foreign representatives at 
the end of last week. 
  In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Baudys' 
activity "has created an absolutely unacceptable situation from 
the point of view of the Czech Republic's foreign political 
interests and harmed its good name." With such a line of 
action, Baudys has definitely gone beyond the powers of a 
cabinet member, the ministry said. 
  The statement, given to CTK by Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Vit 
Kurfurst, says that Baudys did not consult either the Foreign 
Ministry or the government about his proposal. The Foreign 
Ministry first knew about its content from its foreign partners 
which, especially in view of the current visit of Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, has created an absolutely 
unacceptable situation from the point of view of the Czech 
Republic's foreign political interests. 
  The proposal was handed to representatives of foreign states 
and international organisations by Czech military and Air Force 
attaches at Czech representative offices abroad. Such an action 
harms the Czech Republic's good name abroad and the efforts of 
its diplomatic activity aimed at creating a picture of the Czech 
Republic as a reliable and predictable international partner, 
the statement says. 
  The ministry points to the fact that, regardless of the 
content of Baudys' proposal, his course of action represents a 
definite transgression of the powers of individual cabinet 
members as set down in the Czech Constitution and in the law on 
power sharing. The method Baudys chose for submitting his 
proposal rules out the possibility of this act being understood 
as the move of a private person if it were theoretically allowed 
for cabinet members to come into contact with foreign partners 
as private persons, the statement says. 
  Baudys informed journalists about his proposal for ending 
the 
Bosnian conflict on Saturday [19 February]. At the same time, 
he admitted that he had not consulted with either the government 
or parliament on it. According to Baudys' proposal a "committee 
of good will" to be entrusted by the united nations with 
overseeing the situation in the crisis regions should play a 
major role in Bosnia. According to Baudys, this committee should 
be made up of representatives of seven states religiously 
connected with the warring sides in Bosnia.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Chairman Vaclav Grulich today 
described Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys's initiative on 
a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
as "hasty." 
  Talking to journalists, he said Baudys "should never have 
made similar proposals public without discussing them in 
government." 
  He said the initiative could lead to further escalation of 
nationalist tension in the conflict, as he is actually proposing 
what the rest of the world is seeking to eliminate. 
  Baudys presented his initiative at a press conference in 
Prague on Saturday [19 February], prior to his visit to Turkey. 
His proposal envisages the creation of a UN executive goodwill 
committee, which would oversee the peace process in the area and 
in which selected countries the identity of which is linked to 
the religious and cultural values of the warring parties, would 
participate. 
  Baudys did not consult with the government or parliament 
about it and sent copies of it to various international 
organisations and prominent figures.

  [Text] Prague February 21 (CTK) -- Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys' "ideological solution" to the conflict in Bosnia 
is politically wrong and could harm the reputation of the Czech 
Republic abroad, acting deputy chairman of the Left Bloc Party 
(SLB) said today. 
  Baudys' solution suggested "the transfer of power to the 
occupational powers," and "the establishment of a protectorate." 
It is unbelievable, Ortman said, that such a significant state 
leader should not consult with the Foreign Ministry, the 
government or the president before making such statements. 
  His approach shows the level of communication between the 
coalition parties on foreign policy, Ortman said. 
  The basis of Baudys' proposal is that "the war can be 
stopped 
if the guarantors of future development and the search for a 
solution will be those states whose state identity is 
indubitably connected with the religious values of the 
participants in the conflict." 
  He suggested that within the UN there should be founded 
"some 
sort of executive council of good will consisting of seven UN 
states, who would be entrusted with direct supervision and 
protection of this territory." The states should be ones which 
are "connected by their religious and cultural values with those 
religious ethnic groups in the area." 
  Baudys told journalists about his idea at a special press 
conference on Saturday [19 February].

  [Excerpts] Prague, Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel does not consider Defence Minister Antonin Baudys' Bosnia 
initiative "fortunate and usual," but cannot discuss it in 
detail because he knows about it only from the press, his 
spokesman Ladislav Spacek told CTK today. 
  Baudys acquainted journalists with his proposal to end the 
Bosnia conflict on Saturday [19 February], admitting that he had 
consulted neither the government nor parliament. [passage 
omitted] 
  Havel believes that Baudys should have first discussed his 
proposal with Czech leaders, Spacek said, adding that Havel also 
doubts the composition of the committee because it is based on 
the assumption that the Bosnia conflict is a conflict of three 
cultural-religious orientations. 
  Havel believes that violence must be stopped in Bosnia and 
that civic society, in which people of various ethnic origins 
and religions co-exist in peace, must be restored, spacek 
pointed out. 
  Havel has also said that before being made public, similar 
initiatives must usually be consulted on confidentially through 
diplomatic channels with the parties concerned, Spacek stressed. 
  Commenting on the same issue, Jiri Holub, former 
Czechoslovak 
ambassador to Italy (1990-92) and coordinator of the Realistic 
Bloc, said at a press conference today: "I cannot imagine an 
acceptable explanation which Minister Baudys could give to the 
president, government and parliament after his return from 
Turkey." 
  Baudys left for a three-day official visit to Turkey on 
Sunday [20 February]. 
  The opposition Realistic Bloc is made up by the Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD), the Liberal Social Union (LSU) and 
several extra-parliamentary groupings.

  [Text] Prague Feb 21 (CTK) -- The Executive Council of the 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) shares the Foreign Ministry's 
opinion that Defence Minister Antonin Baudys has not only 
overstepped his bounds in submitting his personal Bosnia 
initiative to foreign partners, but also harmed his country's 
good name. 
  That is why the council has recommended to Premier and ODS 
Chairman Vaclav Klaus that he consider strict measures against 
Baudys up to and including his dismissal, ODS Deputy Chairman 
Jiri Vlach told journalists during a pause in the council's 
session today. 
  Baudys acquainted journalists with his proposal to end the 
Bosnia conflict on Saturday [19 February], admitting that he had 
consulted neither the government nor parliament. 
  Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a 
good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to 
supervise the situation. The committee would comprise seven 
states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties -- 
Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, Italy and one other 
unspecified country. 
  Vlach said that Baudys (Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) had acted at 
variance with the Constitution and harmed the Czech Republic's 
credit as a partner seeking membership of NATO and being greatly 
interested in joining the Partnership for Peace plan. 
  Vlach said it was not possible at the moment to say how many 
emergency sessions had been called to deal with Baudys's 
surprise move, but it was almost certain that the case would be 
addressed by the government on Wednesday [23 February]. 
  On Czech Television tonight Klaus called unprecedented the 
fact that Baudys's proposal was conveyed first to foreign 
partners and that the heads of foreign states received Baudys's 
letter earlier than Czech "leaders." 
  "We must deal with two things -- to what extent the offence 
was committed knowingly, and to what extent it was a badly 
thought-out move," Klaus said. 
  ODS Spokeswoman Jana Petrova said that when Baudys presented 
his proposal as his own personal initiative, it would have been 
appropriate "if he had signed the letter containing the 
initiative simply 'Antonin Baudys' and sent it by ordinary mail 
to the representatives of other countries." 
  But sending it via military attaches, as he did, is not a 
regular way for personal mail, Petrova added.

  [Text] Ankara Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys said here today he had informed Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec he was preparing his own personal initiative to 
solve the Bosnia conflict and about its main features. 
  "It is undeniable truth that during a joint luncheon on 
Friday [18 February] I informed Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec 
that I had drawn out my personal proposal to solve the situation 
in Bosnia and I gave him rough outlines of my initiative's 
contents," Baudys told a group of Czech journalists in Ankara, 
where he has been on a three-day official visit since Sunday [20 
February]. 
  The Foreign Ministry today published a statement saying that 
Baudys had consulted his proposal with neither the foreign 
minister nor the government and that the Foreign Ministry had 
learnt about it from its foreign partners. 
  Baudys said that after hearing the information, Zieleniec 
said that "if he is asked, he will reply that he had not been 
consulted on the matter." 
  Nevertheless, he tried to reach Baudys in the morning on 
Saturday [19 February] because he had found out that the 
initiative had already been dealt with by visiting Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "Kozyrev probably got a copy of my plan from the Russian 
Embassy in Prague, to which I also sent the document," Baudys 
said. 
  He stressed that in reaction to Zieleniec's effort to reach 
him he personally delivered the complete text of his proposal to 
the Foreign Ministry. "It is true it was in English, but the on 
the other hand, the Foreign Ministry had the document as early 
as Saturday's morning," Baudys added. 
  Some members of the Czech delegation in Ankara said the 
"almost hysterical" reaction by Czech political circles had 
harmed his position in talks with Turkish officials. 
  Baudys's initiative was received quite favourably by Turkish 
Defence Minister Mehmet Golhan on Sunday, the day of the Czech 
delegation's arrival in Ankara, but on Monday [21 February] 
Turkey's stance palpably changed and at the start of the 
official talks, Golhan rejected the initiative diplomatically, 
but unequivocally. 
  This happened in spite of the fact that Golhan was 
acquainted 
with the initiative as early as Sunday, as he himself said, 
because he got it via the Turkish Embassy in Prague. 
  According to information from the Czech delegation, it 
cannot 
be ruled out that Baudys's reception by Turkish Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller and Foreign Minister Himket Cetin planned on 
Tuesday [22 February] will be cancelled. The possible excuse 
would be lack of time due to a government session and 
preparations for local elections. 
  According to the same sources, Baudys's initiative was 
accepted during his talks at the U.S. diplomatic mission in 
Ankara and "it is not ruled out" allegedly that U.S. 
high-ranking officials will appreciate it.

  [Text] Prague, February 22 (CTK) -- The Liberal National 
and Social Party (LSNS) considers the personal initiative of 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys for solving the Bosnian crisis 
as highly unfortunate, LSNS Chairman Pavel Hirs told journalists 
today. 
  Hirs said the situation showed the need for coordination in 
the Czech Republic's foreign policy. 
  The LSNS completely disagrees and fundamentally rejects the 
idea of Baudys' plan, whereby a committee of countries connected 
to the warring sides in Bosnia by shared religious and cultural 
values would be created to oversee the peace process. Hirs said 
the problem of Bosnia could not be internationalized, for in 
this way Russia would very easily get into this space and would 
once again dominate southern and central Europe. The plan 
divided spheres of interest, which was always dangerous, Hirs 
said, because it would lead to the internationalization of the 
whole problem. 
  In democratic systems ministers leave their seats for 
relatively small sins, Hirs said. I would not like to comment 
myself on the decision of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) 
Executive Council. I believe that decisions concerning whether 
to dismiss or not to dismiss a coalition minister should be made 
by the government, not by the executive council of a party, 
although it is a coalition one, Hirs said, asked by CTK what he 
thought of the ODS Executive Council's recommendation that 
Premier Vaclav Klaus consider Baudys' dismissal. 
  LSNS believes that no minister, not even the premier, should 
be allowed to carry out foreign policy activity without 
informing their own government and the foreign ministry. If 
they did so, it was inexcusable and creates a very bad 
impression abroad. Foreign policy is the business of the whole 
government, and foreign activity should be coordinated, 
consulted and approved by the government, Hirs said.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said today that Defense Minister Antonin Baudys had overstepped 
the powers of a constitutional official and made a gross mistake 
which harmed the Czech Republic. 
  Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the world would 
smile at Baudys's initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict and 
doubt the very thing "which we are continuously trying to convey 
to the world -- that we are a normal country." 
  Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday with his proposal 
to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had consulted 
neither the government nor parliament. 
  Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a 
good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN. To 
supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several 
states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties, 
for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, and 
Italy. 
  Klaus said the sharp criticism of Baudys at Monday's session 
of the Executive Council of the Civic Democratic Party, of which 
Klaus is the Chairman, was not aimed at his immediate dismissal. 
But Baudys's move cannot be passed over in silence, Klaus 
pointed out.

  [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys claimed tonight he neither breached the 
Constitution nor exceeded his powers when he made public his 
personal initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict. 
  Returning from a three-day official visit to Turkey, Baudys 
said the only thing for which he could be reprimanded was that 
he used two military air attaches, in Brussels and Washington, 
to distribute the initiative. 
  "Dismissal of a minister is within the premier's 
jurisdiction 
and I see no reason to resign," he said, adding that he would 
make no further statements on the initiative today. 
  Baudys will meet with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec later 
tonight. 
  Baudys told journalists that Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin spoke shortly with him before his departure, which proves 
that "in Turkey, at least, the Czech Republic's interests have 
not been harmed by my initiative proposal."

  [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys said today he was convinced of the correctness of 
his initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict, adding that it was 
his private initiative which did have to be discussed 
beforehand. [sentence as received] 
  Speaking after his meeting with Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec tonight, he admitted that the way in which he made 
public the initiative was not only non-standard, but probably 
inappropriate from the diplomatic point of view. 
  Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday [19 February] with 
his proposal to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had 
consulted neither the government nor parliament. 
  Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a 
good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN to 
supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several 
states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties, 
for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France and Italy. 
  To defend his course of action, he said today it was due to 
the pressure of developments because as late as Sunday night, no 
one knew whether or not Sarajevo would be bombarded. 
  Baudys pointed out that Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] 
soldiers were stationed in Serbian Krajina and that, aware of 
his responsibility for their lives, "I did what I did." 
  "I agree that the way I did it was not probably appropriate 
and correct. Nevertheless, I believe that I have neither 
breached the constitution nor exceeded my powers," Baudys said. 
  He said that he and Zieleniec discussed mainly the technique 
of making public the proposal and that they discussed the 
contents only superficially. 
  Baudys said they also turned to their Friday discussion 
during a luncheon, when Baudys informed Zieleniec of his 
initiative. But he admitted that his statement at the press 
conference on Saturday could be misunderstood as if Zieleniec 
were informed not only of the proposal, but also of the way in 
which it was being made public. 
  Baudys said he told Zieleniec on Friday that he had sent off 
the letters containing his proposal to settle the situation in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, but did not tell him that he had sent 
them via embassies and two military air attaches. "He probably 
reached the impression that I had sent them via regular mail," 
Baudys admitted. 
  He said he believed that the factual contents of his 
proposal 
should be distinguished from the way in which it was made public 
and which will probably be the subject of further discussion.

  [Excerpts] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- The leadership of the 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) 
appreciated the ethical aspect of Defence Minister Antonin 
Baudys's appeal and did not ask him to resign from his post, 
Baudys himself told journalists after the session of the party 
leadership. [passage omitted] 
  "The leadership has supported in a way the ethical aspect of 
the call," said Baudys, adding that the dismissal of a minister 
should be preceded by the talks of the coalition parties about 
this move. The ethical aspect of his appeal should not be 
suppressed by formal shortcomings, he said. 
  The KDU-CSL meeting was not attended by Josef Lux, the party 
chairman. 
  On Monday [21 February] the Executive Council of the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS, the largest coalition party), recommended 
to Premier Vaclav Klaus that he take strict measures, perhaps 
even Baudys's dismissal.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 18 (CTK) -- Russia has not linked its 
initiative to convene a peace conference on Bosnia to the NATO 
ultimatum and its initiative has no direct connection with it, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told journalists upon 
his arrival in Prague today. 
  He said it was now important that nobody try with 
provocations to shatter a positive process which is the result 
of the initiative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who 
already approved it three weeks ago. The essence of the 
initiative lies mainly in strengthening the security zone around 
Sarajevo but also in other Bosnian regions. Now this initiative 
crystalised in a clear and concrete form, Kozyrev said. 
  He said that currently there existed the possibility for 
returning from unilateral to joint actions of the whole world 
community. He said Yeltsin was in direct contact with leading 
representatives of many states especially with German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl with whom he had another detailed conversation 
today. Constant contacts are being preserved also with the 
foreign ministers, especially of Britain, the United States and 
Germany, Kozyrev said. 
  He said that the possibility of joining some other countries 
is also being considered so that the chance offered by the 
Russian initiative is utilised. The process is not to be 
shattered by any provocations in the interests of strengthening 
it through far-reaching agreements on Sarajevo and on the whole 
of Bosnia. 
  "At the beginning of the next week meetings of 
representatives of the foreign ministries or possibly foreign 
ministers themselves are being planned. Then it will be seen 
what to do next," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 19 (CTK) -- Visiting Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today said Russia did not insist on 
playing a role of a superpower, which used to be played by the 
former Soviet Union. 
  Talking to journalists, Kozyrev said: "We did not carry out 
the democratic revolution to continue maintaining the same 
policy and once again become a superpower jeopardising peace. 
This is absolutely out of question," Kozyrev said. 
  He pointed out that objectively Russia was one of the 
biggest 
states in the world, but that it did not seek to return to a 
bipolar world. It wanted to fulfill its interests in practice 
through partnership, cooperation and good neighbourly relations. 
This role undoubtedly required an active independent foreign 
political line but not at the cost of confrontation, Kozyrev 
said. 
  Responding to a question about mistrust of the Sarajevo 
residents towards Russian soldiers who should reinforce the 
UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] units stationed in 
Bosnia Kozyrev described as absolutely unacceptable that the 
Moslems be backed up by the Islamic world, the Serbs by the 
Orthodox and the Croats by the Catholic churches. To set the 
20th century world back to the time of religious crusades would 
be a catastrophic scenario, said Kozyrev. "We will not allow 
any such catastrophe to occur and will work for cooperation and 
a unified approach by all super powers," he added. 
  He went on to say that the Bosnian leaders understood that 
it 
was necessary to advance towards a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict and that they were in favour of Russia's active role in 
the area, equal to that played by the other countries. 
  Commenting on his ministry's activities in the new Russian 
Government, he said no changes had occurred there. 
  On demands concerning his resignation, he said: "I do not 
dramatise them." He added that he frequently cooperated with 
President Boris Yeltsin and that as a result his work seemed 
easier to him.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev welcome the latest 
developments in Bosnia. 
  At a press conference after a working luncheon with Kozyrev, 
Klaus said he was satisfied that the pressure which increased 
after the issuing of NATO's ultimatum possibly led to positive 
developments in the area. He said he hoped the pressure would 
force the warring parties to sit down at the negotiating table 
and break the deadlock. 
  Kozyrev said he and Klaus agreed that it was necessary to 
build on positive moments and strive to strengthen them so that 
the situation in the war-ridden areas is consolidated. 
  Klaus and Kozyrev discussed the two countries' reforms as 
well as the economic and political situation in Russia. Klaus 
said their opinions in this area were very close. He added he 
believed that some of the Czech Republic's experiences could be 
relevant for Russia. Under discussion were also foreign policy 
topics and the two countries' views on Europe and NATO. 
  Kozyrev said the talks were very useful. "We have topics to 
consider and I will be pleased to convey them to our economic 
and political reformers," he added. He said that if it were not 
for the talks, his opinion on the all-European process from a 
strategic viewpoint would not be that clear. 
  On Monday [21 February] Kozyrev leaves for Hungary, from 
where he will go to Poland. The Czech Republic was the first 
leg on his tour of the Visegrad Group countries (the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). A planned visit to 
Slovakia which was postponed due to the government crisis there 
should take place in the middle of next week.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (CTK) -- The visit of Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev to this country confirmed both sides' 
interest in a more businesslike approach to bilateral questions, 
a statement issued by the Czech Foreign Ministry says. 
  The ministry's statement on the results of Kozyrev's visit 
was given to CTK today. 
  Kozyrev's successive meetings with President Vaclav Havel, 
Premier Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec showed 
the need for a dialogue on the top and high levels, the ministry 
says. 
  The Czech explained motives and goals of their foreign 
policy, their efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, membership 
of NATO, the European Union and the Western European Union, and 
their negative attitude towards attempts to create spheres of 
influence. 
  The Czechs heard Russian notions on European security that 
might be centered, Russians say, around the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  Kozyrev's visit is understood as part of the ongoing 
intensive discussion on European security and in this respect 
the Czech Foreign Ministry considers it to be very important, 
the statement says.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (CTK) -- The Partnership for Peace 
project is a partial step and the only "feasible possibility" at 
the moment, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus today said, in response 
to a question whether Czech-Russian military cooperation could 
be considered presently. 
  After a working luncheon with visiting Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Klaus told journalists that as a 
pragmatist who does not build castles in the air, he believed 
that it was in the interest of the Czech Republic to join the 
Partnership project of European security. He said he hoped he 
would sign a document on participation in the project in 
Brussels on March 10. "We will gradually seek ways how to 
implement it," Klaus said. 
  He went on to say that the idea to organise any bilateral 
Czech- Russian military contacts did not presently occur to him. 
"However, this should not be taken as a statement of 
fundamental position," he added. 
  Kozyrev said Russia was developing military cooperation with 
some NATO countries, namely bilateral arms supplies, conducting 
joint excercises and resolving problems concerning conversion of 
arms factories into peace production. 
  "Czech leaders often emphasise that the Czech Republic is a 
small country. I do not want to polemise with them -- maybe it 
is small from a geographical point of view, but with regard to 
its political importance it is much bigger," Kozyrev said, 
adding that Russia is interested in a continued extension of 
cultural, spiritual, political and economic contacts with the 
Czech Republic. 
  "I fully agree," Klaus said. 
  The Czech Republic, he said, strives to become a standard 
European country with all that involves, including membership of 
standard European organisations, namely the European Union and 
NATO. "In this context, for me, the Czech Republic's effort to 
join NATO is not primarily measured by our intention to defend 
ourselves against a sort of imaginatory Russian threat," Klaus 
said. 
  Being a small country in the heart of Europe and a subject 
to 
pressure by its neighbours, the "entry into institutions like 
NATO is always a positive step for us. But I would not twist 
the meaning one or the other side," Klaus added.

  [Text] Prague Feb 21 (CTK) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said he did not believe it would be appropriate 
to return to ultimatums or similar things in solving the Bosnian 
conflict since this decision had been taken without Russia. 
  Speaking to journalists before his departure from Prague, 
Kozyrev expressed hope that this would not be repeated. "We 
have now embarked on a better path of joined efforts and, in my 
opinion, it is extraordinarily important to concentrate on 
consolidating the success which was achieved within three days 
after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative was 
announced," Kozyrev said. 
  That was a reason why Russia was determined to join the 
United States, NATO and other partners in united actions and not 
in separate ones, Kozyrev said. 
  He expressed hope that now at last there would be mutual 
friendly feeling between the peoples of the Russian Federation 
and the Czech Republic in full measure -- without pressure, 
without a totalitarian regime, without any attempts to maintain 
in this or that form of the former socialist camp, without 
"Brezhnev's doctrines." 
  It is equality and mutual respect which are creating 
political trust and the political background for the renewal of 
close relations which existed between the cultures of both 
peoples, Kozyrev told CTK. 
  After that, Kozyrev left the Czech Republic where he was on 
a 
working visit at the invitation of Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec. On Saturday [19 February] in Prague Kozyrev held 
talks with Zieleniec and was received by Czech President Vaclav 
Havel in his cottage in Hradecek near Trutnov, East Bohemia. On 
Sunday [20 February] he had lunch with Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus. 
  Kozyrev's stay in Prague was part of his tour of the 
Visegrad 
Group (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland). From 
Prague Kozyrev made his way to Hungary from where he will travel 
to Poland. His planned visit to Slovakia which was due to have 
been first in this series was canceled because of the government 
crisis in Slovakia. According to diplomatic sources, nothing is 
known about a replacement date for his visit to Slovakia.

  [Text] Prague Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said today that in an interview published in the German daily 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG on Monday [21 February], he had 
only explained the Czech stance toward individual and collective 
rights regarding the Sudeten German question, and pointed to a 
collective solution being impossible. 
  Speaking to journalists after a ministerial session, Klaus 
said that the Sudeten German question could be solved only on 
the individual level. He was reacting to Monday's statement by 
Christian Schmidt, foreign political spokesman of the 
parliamentary group of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), 
in which Schmidt criticised Klaus over the interview. 
  Klaus said that each German had the right to apply for 
permanent residence in any country of the world, including the 
Czech Republic. "Individual access on the part of the Czech 
Republic is nothing new," he stressed. 
  In the interview for FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG, Klaus 
called the Sudeten German problems "individually solvable," but 
rejected any "collective settlement" of the question. He said 
the Sudeten German problem was an "unfortunate complication" in 
Czech-German relations, inherited by the Czech Government from 
the past. "Today we cannot settle all the problems we 
inherited," Klaus said in the paper. 
  In his press statement on Monday, headlined "Not Like This, 
Mr. Klaus" Schmidt welcomed Klaus's "evident effort at reviving 
and pushing forward Czech-German relations, which have been cool 
for a while." But at the same time he stressed that, regarding 
the sensitive question of post-war German expellees, it was not 
possible simply to "offer nice sounding sentences which pop in 
the air upon closer inspection." Schmidt said he considered 
Klaus's proposal to settle individually Sudeten German problems, 
which Germany views as open, a similar "soap bubble."

  [Text] Prague February 21 (CTK) -- The left-leaning RUDE 
PRAVO carries an interview with the deputy chairman of 
parliament's Defence and Security Committee, Tomas Fejfar, whom 
the paper says is known as a supporter of thorough cleansing in 
the army. 
  On this point, Fejfar says that while, on one hand, he 
believes the Czech Republic needs a less strong army, such as 
will be acceptable to NATO, on the other hand, during three 
years nothing much has changed in the army, and therefore it has 
to be cleansed. However, he does not mean the removal of former 
communists, whom he says formed 90 percent of the army command. 
  The categories Fejfar has in mind are firstly the former 
members of the military counterintelligence, of whom several 
hundred remained in the army. The second class are the former 
official political indoctrinators, who are still hiding in the 
army. They are very experienced and capable, with their own 
information channels, and are thus very dangerous, Fejfar says. 
Baudys' talk of how much has changed in the army he calls "a 
very optimistic view." 
  Asked to comment on his past statements concerning the 
operation of KGB officials in the army, Fejfar says they arose 
from a combination of concrete knowledge and certain suspicions, 
but he cannot talk about them in the paper. 
  On the subject of the "gentlemanly agreement" between 
Interior Minister Jiri Ruml [name as received] with the head of 
Russian counterintelligence that the two countries' intelligence 
services would not work against each other, Fejfar says it would 
be naive to imagine that foreign intelligence agents, including 
Russian ones, did not operate here. The question is whether 
they are working against the Czechs or whether they are merely 
monitoring the situation, whether their interest has not shifted 
to the economic sphere. Fejfar thinks Russian intelligence 
understands that the Czech Republic is no longer in their sphere 
of influence, and thus their aims are definitely changing. 
However, there has to be some cooperation, especially in the 
area of organised crime. Intelligence services work here, it is 
a question of keeping their activities within bounds, he says. 
  Asked what he thinks of the opinion that the Interior 
Ministry is run by a group of friends who know nothing about 
being professional, Fejfar says there are two options, either 
you leave the old (pre- revolution) professionals in place, 
which is no good, or you rely on friends whom you can trust 
fully. If there are affairs in the ministry, it is because the 
old is clashing with the new. There is the same problem in the 
army, but the affairs there are not written about, although they 
might be after there is radical change, he says.

of Hungary told journalists at their joint press conference 
following talks in Budapest on Monday [21 February]. 
  Indicating the importance of bilateral economic relations, 
Jeszenszky said Russia is currently Hungary's second most 
important trade partner, while Hungary is in 8th place among 
Russia's economic partners. The signing of new economic 
agreements, most probably this spring, is in the interest of 
both countries, they said. 
  Kozyrev said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is 
preparing to visit Hungary. He and the Hungarian prime minister 
will sign the new agreements, including ones on investment 
protection and the elimination of double taxation. 
  Discussions were also held on important issues involving 
Europe. Jeszenszky said European integration is of fundamental 
importance for Hungary, and the primary emphasis is not on 
becoming members in individual institutions. In other words, 
the first priority is not for Hungary to become a member of 
NATO. The Euro-Atlantic organizations are of equal importance 
for Hungary. However, Hungary calls for accelerating the CSCE 
process. 
  The Balkan crisis was an important topic of discussion. They 
had no major differences in the evaluation of this, the foreign 
ministers said. 
  Minority issues, which are of utmost importance from the 
point of view of Europe's future, were also discussed. 
Jeszenszky said the two countries follow common principles in 
this, as was expressed in the joint statement issued during the 
visit of President Yeltsin to Hungary in November 1992. 
  As regards cultural relations, Jeszenszky said it is 
important for church dignitaries to also hold regular meetings. 
He noted that Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksey II will be 
visiting Budapest shortly. 
  The Russian foreign minister said he hopes the new Russian 
Parliament will ratify the Hungarian-Russian basic agreement, 
including the paragraph condemning the 1956 Soviet intervention 
in Hungary. 
  With respect to the CSCE summit to be held in Budapest at 
the 
end of the year, the foreign ministers said a genuinely 
effective mechanism for creation of peace and the protection of 
national minorities should be worked out, whether it be in the 
Baltic regions or elsewhere. 
  In answer to questions on NATO's Peace Partnership plan, 
Jeszenszky said the existence of international forces that are 
capable of deterring anyone from aggression is an important 
element of the programme, in the spirit of conflict-preventive 
diplomacy. 
  Kozyrev stated flatly that Moscow will not give in to 
nationalistic pressure. "We have no hegemonistic, aggressive 
efforts, we are ready for friendship," he said. 
  The main point of Yeltsin's foreign policy is that Russia 
wants to create a "good-neighbour zone" with all countries with 
which it has historical, spiritual, human relations and economic 
interest connections, he said. 
  Kozyrev added Russia is ready for cooperation in the 
framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the 
Peace Partnership. He said he will use his current tour to 
disperse the anxieties related to the Russian threat. In his 
view, a democratic Europe should unite against nationalism. 
  With respect to the Bosnian crisis, Kozyrev said the most 
important point is to create an administrative control zone for 
the withdrawal and the cease-fire, and to somehow ensure 
conditions for peaceful life. Kozyrev mentioned Mostar and 
Tuzla being among new security zones. 
  However, the long-term goal is to settle the Bosnian 
situation itself. In this process, Moscow particularly counts 
on the participation of the United States, the European Union 
and Germany, he stated.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 February (MTI) -- Hungarian President 
Arpad Goncz met with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev in 
the Parliament today. 
  Presidential spokesman Andras Farago said the president 
congratulated Kozyrev on the joint Russian-Western success in 
dealing with the the situation in Sarajevo. 
  In Hungary's view, NATO's Partnership for Peace is not an 
empty initiative but a practicable scheme giving attention to 
the human, legal, and social factors of security, in addition to 
its military side. 
  Kozyrev conveyed greetings from President Boris Yeltsin to 
Goncz. He assured Goncz that Moscow always examines how its 
foreign policy moves contribute to Central-European stability. 
  He said Moscow supports cooperation and peace partnership 
with NATO, but stressed the need to find concrete solutions to 
individual problems in the region. 
  Russia also attaches great importance to the CSCE and its 
summit, to be held in Budapest at the end of the year.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 February (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross met with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei 
Kozyrev in the Parliament on Tuesday [22 February]. 
  According to foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman, Boross 
told Kozyrev that Budapest looks forward to the visit of Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  Regarding the south Slav crisis, Boross stressed Hungary is 
glad that the planned military intervention in Bosnia had become 
unnecessary, and recognizes the role Russia played in this. 
  Kozyrev expressed the hope that Russia and Hungary would 
soon 
work out a number of agreements giving business links a new 
impetus. Recent positive movement in bilateral economic ties 
provides a good basis for Chernomyrdin's trip to Hungary, he 
added. 
  The Russian foreign minister sees good chances for 
ratification of the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, which 
complies with Russian interests. 
  Kozyrev concluded his two-day state visit to Hungary and 
left 
Budapest today.

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 22 -- President Lech Walesa will 
withdraw his representative from the Constitutional Committee of 
the National Assembly as well as his own draft constitutional 
proposal that has been in the Sejm since the previous term of 
office. The president is expected to send a letter to the Sejm 
speaker. 
  The president told PAP on Tuesday that he considered the 
Sejm's rejection last Friday of the presidential constitutional 
drafts as a no-confidence vote in these drafts. 
  "It was the parliament that rejected the possibility of 
cooperation on the constitution and not myself, I was trying to 
cooperate," Walesa stressed. 
  "I am not taking away the right of parliament to work on the 
constitution because I have respect for democracy. But I must 
stress that the majority of the nation is outside parliament, 
and that even the best constitution which may be drawn up by 
this parliament, should be accepted by the majority of the 
nation. As president I wanted to have such a majority and win 
such an approval," Lech Walesa said. 
  Next, the president declared he would not discuss the 
constitution with the present parliament and added he was not 
sure whether he would discuss any other issues, either. 
  This does not mean a "war at the top," the president 
stressed, adding that this reflects "lack of consent to methods 
and a warning: Postcommunists are returning to old methods and 
the president cannot accept this." 
  Answering a question whether it was true that he intended to 
hold meetings all over Poland, the president recalled that he 
was trying to cooperate with the ruling bloc and stressed that 
now, when the postcommunists were feeling stronger he was going 
to "take them down a peg or two." 
  "That is why I will be travelling a lot to show that Poland 
needs peace and agreement, but not the silence of the 
graveyard," Walesa said, adding that "one should watch every day 
so that the communists or postcommunists do not take over 
everything, as they are willing to do so." 
  Walesa did not rule out that these meetings might result in 
a 
conflict with the "postcommunists of today" as he described them. 
  "If they want such a conflict, I am ready," the president 
said but stressed that he was aiming at agreement and a position 
of a minority group for the communists as they "are a minority 
and must remain as such." 
  "When they are becoming a majority, they are growing 
dangerous. Such is the truth we have experienced. And I am 
going to speak about all this during my meetings all over 
Poland," the president added. 
  Asked whether during these meetings he was going to set up 
an 
organization supporting him, the president said: "If it is 
necessary, if the communists are growing too dangerous and there 
will be no force to oppose such tendencies, I will have to do it 
myself and complete both the vetting and decommunization at 
last."

  [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 22 -- President Walesa's decision to 
withdraw his representative from the Constitutional Committee of 
the National Assembly as well as his own draft constitutional 
proposals submitted to that committee "will be a shame for 
parliament and the work of the committee," Deputy Speaker of the 
Sejm Jozef Zych said on Tuesday. 
  Zych recalled that the president's representative Lech 
Falandysz, was not a member of the committee but only took part 
in its proceedings. Zych thought that Walesa's descision would 
cause some damage. 
  The chairman of the Constitutional Committee and leader of 
the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski said 
that Walesa's decision was "a prelude" to the presidential 
elections which have to be held within the next two years. 
  He stressed that the committee was working in accordance 
with 
the law concerning the preparatory work for the constitution, 
passed in 1991. 
  Kwasniewski thought that there would eventually be a 
referendum on the constitution and that Walesa would oppose 
parliament's proposals. 
  Kwasniewski reacted to Walesa's comment that "the 
postcommunists are feeling strong". He said that he did not 
know what "strength" the president was referring to. 
  He thought Walesa was clearly trying to gain the support of 
the right wing. He added that there had been no "plan" to 
reject Walesa's proposals on the constitution. In the voting 
even Walesa's "favourites" in the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) had 
voted against Walesa's proposals, explained Kwasniewski. 
  The chairman of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Bronislaw 
Geremek, said on "Radio 3" on Tuesday that in politics one 
should not feel insulted. 
  Geremek also thought that Walesa was manoeuvring before the 
presidential elections. He said that his party the Democratic 
Union (UD) had voted to accept that Walesa's proposals would be 
worked on simply because it had wanted to show resepect towards 
the president of the Republic of Poland. 
  He did not think that Walesa's proposals were good because 
the president wanted parliament to be dissolved if it rejected 
the constitution.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 18/2/1994 -- Referring to the 
statements made by Moldova's Premier Andrei Sangheli, the 
spokesman for the presidency of Romania Traian Chebeleu said "we 
have learned about them with surprise," and made the point that 
the Romanian Foreign Ministry had made none of the statements it 
was blamed for. "This shows once more that there are forces in 
the Republic of Moldova which resort in their actions to forms 
of intoxication, trying to bring Romania and the Republic of 
Moldova at loggerheads. We must avoid falling into provocation 
snares, we must act with calm and have in view the particular 
circumstances of the election campaign," Chebeleu said. 
(Sangheli alleged recently that, by some of its statements, the 
Romanian Ministry of Foreign affairs had interfered in the 
internal affairs of the Republic of Moldova). 
  As for a possible change of Romania's policy in its 
relations 
with Chisinau, spokesman Chebeleu said that "Bucharest's policy 
is not circumstantial, it aims at developing long-term 
relations, as a constant of our foreign policy." 
  In a different line of thought, Traian Chebeleu, speaking of 
the intervention of the Russian Federation in the Yugoslav 
crisis, said that "any intervention is welcome if its purpose is 
to pacify and to help the political settlement of the conflict. 
In this respect, the intervention of the Russian Federation and 
its acceptance by the Serbian authorities of Bosnia is a 
positive contribution to the reinstatement of a peaceful 
climate."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 22/2/1994 -- "Together, we can 
surpass many problems," said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu during his interview on Tuesday with Poland's Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. 
  The Polish dignitary is visiting Bucharest in order to sign 
a 
military cooperation agreement expected to induce tighter 
bilateral relations in all fields. The collocutors expressed 
their desire to develop the bilateral economic relations, 
according to the real potential of the two economies. 
  The cooperation between traditional friends, such as Romania 
and Poland, based on updated, flexible and pragmatical 
agreements, are contributing to the building up of a stable 
structure on the continent, was a conclusion of the interview, 
attended also by Romanian Defense Minister Lieutenant-General 
Niculae Spiroiu and by Polish ambassador in Bucharest. 
  Premier Vacaroiu requested that the desire for intensified 
bilateral contacts be conveyed to his Polish counterpart. 
  The talks occasioned also an exchange of opinions on the 
"Partnership for Peace" recently joined in both by Romania and 
Poland.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 21 (CTK) -- Ukraine attaches great 
importance to the development of relations with Slovakia, 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko said after a meeting 
with his Slovak counterpart, Jozef Moravcik, today. 
  Zlenko, on a two-day visit to Slovakia is accompanied by 
Minister of External Economic Relations Oleh Slyepichev, 
Economics Minister Roman Shpek and Health Minister Yuriy 
Spizhenko. 
  Zlenko and Moravcik discussed bilateral relations, Ukraine's 
possible joining the Central European Initiative and ethnic 
minorities' issues. 
  "We can say that we hold close or identical views on all the 
issues discussed," stressed Zlenko who will inaugurate the 
Ukrainian Embassy in Slovakia. "In creating future Europe, we 
have many common interests such as solution to the ethnic 
minorities' issues," Moravcik said. 
  Slovakia favours resolving the minorities' issue on the 
basis 
of individual rights, while it refuses the collective rights for 
the minorities, including the right to self-rule, as advocated 
by Hungary. 
  Zlenko said that there was no problem with Ukrainians 
working 
"illegally" in Slovakia now. He added that the situation should 
be settled in a legislative way in the future. 
  There is no problem with the "autonomy for Subcarpathian 
Ruthenia," which is being "artificially created," Zlenko said. 
  The expansion of the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) by Ukraine was not discussed, 
Moravcik said.

  [Text] Bratislava Feb 21 (CTK) -- The Ukraine is one of a 
few countries which, thanks to the developed legal norms, is 
observing ethnic minority rights, Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko says in an interview with the independent 
NARODNA OBRODA today. 
  Zlenko, who arrived on a one-day visit to Slovakia today at 
the invitation of Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
stresses the need to conclude the agreements on investment 
protection and the prevention of double taxation between the 
Ukraine and Slovakia. "The Ukraine attaches great importance to 
the establishment of economic and trade relations with the 
Slovak Republic," he says. 
  Zlenko warns against ethnic and nationalist separatism which 
represents a problem for Slovakia also. He said 
Slovak-Ukrainian cooperation could help neutralise these 
phenomena, strengthen mutual relations and ensure stability in 
the region. 
  Zlenko says that the Crimea conflict should be solved by 
legal means in harmony with the Constitution. The efforts of 
the Crimean Republic at broader cooperation with the 
Commonwealth of the Independent States (CIS) are determined by 
political, economic and historic circumstances. "The Crimea is 
an integral part of the Ukraine and, therefore, Ukrainian laws 
are valid there," Zlenko says. 
  He spoke in favour of a security system open also to those 
countries which do not belong to the security structures of the 
North Atlantic Alliance or the CIS. Currently there exist no 
security guarantees for these states and their own strengths are 
not sufficient to stand up to any "pressure of external forces," 
Zlenko said. 
  "The Ukraine is a European state," said Zlenko, pointing to 
the Ukraine's striving to joint European political, financial 
and "other" structures. "The Ukraine has declared that it will 
be a state without nuclear weapons in the future," Zlenko said, 
adding that that was a choice of a "certain form" of neutrality 
from any military blocs.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia Feb 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia has 
agreed on mutual recognition of national decisions and 
certificates required for import only for goods where the same 
norms are in effect on both sides of the Czech-Slovak border. 
  Slovakia thus rejected the Czech proposal of mutual 
recognition of decisions and certificates for all commodities 
regardless of differences in state norms. 
  The decision was reached at a meeting of representatives of 
both the Czech Republic [CR] and Slovakia today, led by Michal 
Tosovsky and Lubomir Sutek, chairmen of the National Offices for 
Technical Normalisation, Metrology and State Testing. 
  As regards food products, as from April 1 the Slovak 
Agricultural and Food Inspectorate will issue a single 
certificate valid for Slovakia. The decisions taken by the 
Czech authorities will form the basis of the issuing of the 
certificate. 
  Until March 31 the Slovak customs authorities will require 
the same documents it required before February 11, when the 
Slovak customs authorities announced that food products without 
a Slovak quality certificate would not be allowed to enter the 
country.

director Juergen Chrobog said. [passage omitted] 
  [Russia's Vitaly] Churkin told reporters: "We know now what 
we are doing. We are acting together." 
  Asked if Russia would put pressure on the Serbs, he said 
that 
some countries had "special channels" by which to influence the 
warring parties "for the common good:" the Americans with the 
Moslems, the Germans with the Croats and the Russians with the 
Serbs. [passage omitted] 
  Chrobog said Tuesday's meeting concluded that the European 
peace plan for the former Yugoslav republic was "quantitatively 
more or less right" in giving a proposed 33 percent of the 
republic's territory to the Moslems, but that "qualitatively" 
there needed to be improvements in besieged Moslem enclaves. 
  For Sarajevo, the participants agreed the need for 
consolidation of the peace through demilitarisation, free access 
for humanitarian aid and a restoration of normal life with UN 
help, according to a joint statement. 
  They expressed their "deep concern" regarding the situation 
in other Bosnian regions, and stressed the need to "concentrate 
efforts on extending the security zones". They stressed the 
need to improve conditions for the besieged Moslem population of 
Maglaj, and called for a rapid reopening of the airport at Tuzla. 
  Regarding the fighting between Bosnian Moslem and Croat 
forces, they called for a ceasefire and withdrawal of artillery 
to allow a return to normal life in Mostar, and an effective 
ceasefire with a pulling back of the warring parties in central 
Bosnia. 
  The meeting was aimed at building on the peace in Sarajevo 
resulting from the withdrawal, under threat of NATO airstrikes, 
of the besieging Serb forces' artillery. NATO responded to the 
shock caused by a presumed Serb shell which killed 68 people and 
wounded some 200 in a Sarajevo market early February.

  [Text] Tirana, Feb 22 (FP) -- Albania has rejected a 
Yugoslav complaint to the United Nations Security Council 
accusing Tirana of responsibility for 46 border violations, a 
Foreign Ministry statement said Tuesday [22 February]. A 
Yugoslav memorandum handed over to the council on February 12 
said Yugoslav border guards had seized large quantities of arms 
and ammunition carried by Albanian nationals as they tried 
illegally to cross the border. 
  Twenty-one Albanians have died in the incidents since the 
start of last year, according to the ministry here. 
  The memorandum was "an anti-Albanian document, provocative 
and full of slander," the ministry said, adding: "The border 
provocations are part of (Serbian President Slobodan) 
Milosevic's strategy to create tension and trigger war, and its 
consequences will be unpredictable." 
  In its memorandum Belgrade also accused Tirana of supporting 
secessionist forces in Serbia's southern Kosovo province which 
is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. But the foreign ministry said 
Albanians living in Kosovo were "no minority but an entire 
people living on its own land."

<F P=106> [Speech by Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi </F>
to the Second Socialist Party National Conference in Tirana on 7 
February: "The Socialist Party Toward New Developments in 
Albanian Democracy"] 
  [Text] Comrade delegates and honored guests: We have 
gathered at this conference to present our alternatives for 
government at the present stage of transition and for overcoming 
the current political crisis. 
  Our conference is one in a normal organizational series, but 
the prolonged economic crisis and especially the tense political 
situation that is seriously jeopardizing democracy, pluralism, 
and normal political life in the country give it the dimensions 
and importance of an extraordinary conference. 
  One can see everywhere the tangible consequences of such a 
situation, in an unbridled and unprecedented war of words, in 
the persecution of political opponents, in political murders 
like that of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder on 14 January, down to 
the arrest and illegal and anticonstitutional detention in 
prison for political motives of the deputy Fatos Nano, our 
party's chairman. 
  It is nevertheless to the credit and honor of the Socialist 
Party [PSSh] that, as a party whose symbol is a rose, it has 
been able to preserve a cool head and maintain its political 
balance, presenting itself at home and abroad as a mature 
political force, responsible for the nation's destiny, and with 
wide popular support. With a highly developed sense of 
dedication and tangible commitment to the progress of democracy 
in Albania, even though in opposition, it has continually sent 
out a message of understanding, tolerance and democratic 
cooperation. Here at our Second National Conference is a 
political force with credibility for the future. 
  Our party now spreads throughout the country and includes, 
not just notionally but in reality, more than 100,000 members 
grouped in 3,720 party organizations. In 1993 alone, more than 
3,000 new members were admitted to its ranks. The massive 
Eurosocialist Youth Forum and the Socialist Women's Forum, which 
give a truly democratic spirit to the PSSh's structures, are 
evidence of the party's present and future strength. The 
admission of our Eurosocialist Youth Forum as an observer at the 
Socialist Youth International is a deserved sign of appreciation 
and a joy for us all, for which we send our warm congratulations 
from the platform of this conference! 
  We are nevertheless aware that successfully confronting the 
challenges of the times will in the future demand increasing 
attention to the party's standards and its work, calling for a 
party that will accompany diversity of opinion, a vigorous 
democratic life within its ranks, and a courageous commitment in 
all its structures with exemplary discipline and organization, 
very different from the models of centralist parties with a 
rigorous class character. We are determined to build on what we 
have achieved, in order always to have a party that is 
responsible for its duties and up to its well known option of 
democratic socialism. 
<H5>  A New Political Settlement -- A Demand of the Times </H5>
  The political life of our country is marked by phenomena and 
contradictions that indicate an increasing restriction of the 
scope of democracy. The political struggle is being waged with 
great intensity, savagery, and a marked lack of dialogue and 
consensus, fraught with severe historical and contemporary 
prejudices. The Democratic Party [PD] is using a new class 
struggle as its main instrument for maintaining power. The PD 
strikes at diversity of opinion, the opposition, views that 
oppose or compete with those of the state, and all those who 
think differently accompanying all this with the outlines of a 
police state. 
  The PD is responsible for the currently tense political 
situation in the country. Even though, for demagogy and 
political rhetoric, it does not hesitate to say "good morning" 
to the opposition, in reality it is attempting to paralyze every 
kind of opposition, including even the parties with which it is 
formally in coalition. The marked absence of will to create the 
political leeway for social compromise has led it into the 
absurd position of rejecting every other alternative and all 
forms of cooperation and tolerance. It is showing the mentality 
and practices of a one-party state everywhere and in almost 
everything. 
  As a result, the PD can no longer conceal its failure as a 
political force that equated itself with democracy or hide its 
inability to correct itself and its lack of confidence, ideas, 
and solutions. Chill disillusionment and a mass flight from its 
ranks have become a growing protest against the many illusions 
that its spread with its promises and its programs. 
  In an attempt to cope with its identity crisis, it is merely 
pursuing paths that deepen it further. Authoritarian centralism 
of power, a strengthening of the executive at the expense of 
parliament, the blockade of local government, and the creation 
of intermediary links in the shape of directorates appointed by 
and dependent on the central authorities are among the main 
signs of the crisis of the PD's government, as are the 
violations of democracy and the abuses of the people's free 
votes. The corruption of the members of government lifts them 
above the poverty of ordinary people, and cannot fail to be at 
the latter's expense. The PD's rule is now in political and 
institutional crisis, and it cannot emerge from this with the 
help of piecemeal repairs and patches, as the president is 
attempting to do with his aim of rescuing the PD's "top 
political command." 
  The open subjugation of the judiciary to the executive and 
the party-state is another highly dangerous and very disturbing 
phenomenon in our society today. The forced approval through 
the use of majority voting cards of some antidemocratic laws 
such as 24-1, the Press Law, and the totalitarian-style 
amendments to the Penal Code add to this disquieting phenomenon. 
  The violation of human rights and freedoms has become the 
most dangerous and disturbing phenomenon for our society. The 
mass dismissal of PSSh members and sympathizers from organs of 
the state and other institutions, even academic institutions, 
through the use of the antidemocratic 24-1 law, mass 
unemployment, court proceedings against journalists including 
members of the PSSh's forums, physical violence against some 
PSSh deputies, savage police terror and violence even inside 
police stations that has in some cases led to irreparable 
physical injury and even death, have become very worrying 
phenomena. Only in totalitarian states are counter rallies 
held, deputies are forbidden to meet their electorate, people 
are imprisoned for taking part in peaceful rallies and protests, 
or even just because they go to the cemeteries of the nation's 
martyrs, as happened on 29 November last year in Durres, 
Gjirokaster, and elsewhere. The radio and television have 
virtually closed their doors to the PSSh. 
  For five months now, the police throughout Albania have been 
rejecting on the most absurd pretexts the PSSh's applications to 
hold rallies in city squares. The example of Tirana, where the 
police have refused nine applications by the PSSh Managing 
Committee (on the final occasion with an unprecedented 
demonstration of force) clearly demonstrates the significant and 
worrying narrowing of the scope of democracy in our country. 
  The arrest and political imprisonment of Fatos Nano, PSSh 
chairman and People's Assembly deputy, marks the culmination of 
flagrant violations of human rights and freedoms. The manner in 
which he was accused, the time at which this charge was raised, 
his arrest a few days after the removal of his immunity and a 
few hours before the PSSh's peaceful and authorized rally, the 
replacement of two prosecutors in order to carry out the order 
for his arrest, his arrest by a newly-appointed prosecutor, his 
detention in prison under a harsh police regime, and the return 
of his file by the court because of lack of facts and evidence 
as a result of the investigating group's prior judgment of the 
case -- all these things show that Fatos Nano has been arrested 
as an opponent of the regime and has been imprisoned for 
political revenge and in order to attain definite political 
goals, to divide and liquidate the PSSh. However, such goals can 
never be attained, not today, and not tomorrow! This is our 
viewpoint. This is the will of the PSSh's members and 
supporters! 
  The powerful support of more then 700,000 members of the 
Albanian electorate who gave their signatures for the release of 
Fatos Nano and the broad support of well-known democratic 
organizations in Europe that have considered the "Nano affair" a 
political matter are proof to us of the justice of our stand. 
On this basis, we have demanded and demand from this conference 
too Fatos Nano's immediate release. This is a legitimate and 
democratic demand, and not an indicator of any "passion for 
creating cults!" We have never identified the party with 
individuals, whoever they may be. This matter has for us the 
value and weight of a principle! 
  Comrade delegates, faced with such a reality, the PSSh has 
played its vital and historic role for democracy as a 
constructive opposition, a force that expresses and defends 
broad social interests and an alternative that is well known in 
Europe. The PSSh is intensively struggling and working with 
legal means and democratic methods, not to bring back the old 
system, which failed and will never return, but to ensure the 
normal conduct of the transition and a changeover to a genuinely 
democratic society. In this sense, we as an opposition have not 
been the PD's "editors," but the "creators," of course not the 
only ones, of the Albanian political scene. Also, from the 
political struggle that has been waged so far, the PSSh has 
emerged more mature, more consolidated, and clearer in 
programing how its work is to be carried out. It now enjoys 
broad national and international support. 
  We have never viewed the struggle between political forces, 
particularly between the two main ones, the PD and the PSSh, as 
a struggle between opposing systems or between mutually 
exclusive poles, but as a competition of alternatives and 
concrete solutions for the difficult problems of the transition. 
In our view, it has never been said that competitors should 
necessarily be each other's enemies. The PD leaders, especially 
certain extremist sections in its government, cannot manage to 
understand this. Certain representatives of these sections, who 
pay only lip service to pluralism, do not even flinch from such 
statements as "Albania will never again allow itself to be led 
by the PSSh," thus further inciting divisions among the people. 
  On this occasion, we would like to return to the familiar 
principle that in a democratic country the opposition does not 
exist at the mercy of those in power, but is a legal and vitally 
important factor for the functioning of society and the defense 
of national interests and the basic values and principles of 
democracy. Whoever genuinely feels responsible for the 
country's fate must not behave demagogically with the opposition 
and must not resemble someone who "stabs you in the night and 
mourns you in the morning." 
  It is precisely these developments that disturb people, who 
are increasingly asking what is going on, where are we heading, 
how we will get over this excessively tense situation, how 
democracy will be defended and developed, how the crisis will be 
brought to an end, and whether or not the road will be opened 
toward stability, economic revival, employment, higher labor 
productivity, and the living standards without which there can 
be no genuine democracy. 
  In order to provide an answer to such reasonable questions, 
the PSSh today reemphasizes its political alternative. We aim 
thereby, first of all, to say "no" to confrontation, social 
tensions, the persecution of political opponents, corruption, 
and every other negative and antidemocratic phenomenon that 
threatens to become a social blight. Second, we give a powerful 
"yes" to a new political settlement in Albania, economic reform, 
democratic tolerance, pluralism, national understanding, social 
peace, and everything else that will assist Albania's dignified 
integration into a changing and developing world. 
  We think that the country today finds itself in a phase when 
the overthrow of the old, failed communist system has on a 
political plane come to an end, and is irreversible. It 
therefore follows that the strategy of political tension and 
confrontation that the ruling PD persists in following is not 
only outdated, but also extremely harmful and dangerous, because 
a basic orientation toward carrying out the economic reform, and 
all that means, guides all the Albanian political forces today. 
  That is why the foundation of our political alternative 
rests 
upon the conclusion that the basis of a secure and prosperous 
future requires the responsibility of all political forces, the 
compilation of an anticrisis program, and a strategy of economic 
and institutional reform, scientifically based and with broad 
social support. 
  In order to achieve this, to further promote the 
establishment of a democratic society in Albania, and to unblock 
the economy, it is our belief that it must be admitted that the 
premature political and moral exhaustion of the PD regime is a 
real fact, and that it has become imperative to create a new 
political balance and a new formula for government. 
  New elections! That is our demand today. That is our 
slogan of the day! We will struggle for these with democratic 
means, for the sake of democracy. Our demand for early 
elections at a time when the PD holds sway as an undemocratic 
force that admits no alternative, is neither anticonstitutional, 
antidemocratic, nor destabilizing, but in harmony with the 
dialectic of transition and the state of our institutions. We 
ask for elections for the sake of stabilizing the country, the 
defense of the country, and national affirmation. 
  We see that such a thing is common practice in other 
countries, even in countries famous for their democratic 
traditions. The PSSh's demand to put the political forces to 
the test once gain is therefore not exceptional, and is hampered 
by no constitutional obstacle. Article 28, Item Nine of the 
Main Constitutional Dispositions provides for and permits the 
dissolution of parliament by the president and the announcement 
of early elections. 
  Besides, in a period of transition such as this, there are 
many factors that prompt such an idea or could in practice lead 
to early elections. First of all, there is the economic factor, 
the economic crisis. When electors voted for the PD on 22 March 
[1992] with the motto, "Let's give the PD a try," they were 
thinking of the PD's promises to extract the country from its 
deep economic crisis and to create the necessary stability to 
pave the way for economic development. 
  Of course, the PD's two-year period in power has not been 
enough to fully achieve such an aim. However, it is enough time 
for the electorate to see whether the government and its 
management for affairs are heading in the right direction, 
whether the government shows dedication, and whether it has 
placed able and uncorrupted people in positions of power. We 
must admit that people's massive disillusionment in the PD and 
its government is entirely well- grounded. This was evident on 
26 July 1992, when local government elections were held, in 
which not only the majority of the electorate voted for the 
PSSh's candidates, but there was a significant increase in the 
number of people not going to the polls. Since that time, the 
pressure for change among the electorate has been rising, and we 
will not prejudge the issue by saying whether or not this is 
entirely to the benefit of our party. 
  At the same time, it must be said that the balance of forces 
within the PD itself has changed, with the departure from it of 
the group of "motionists," who formed the Democratic Alliance, 
and most recently, the departure of a realistic right-wing 
group, which is expected to form its own party. Changes have 
also occurred within other parties that did not achieve 
parliamentary representation. Such changes cannot fail to bring 
not only confusion, if not a situation of crisis, to the 
Albanian parliament, but also a significant decline in its 
authority and effectiveness. The Albanian parliament today does 
not reflect the country's political and electoral balance. 
  In response to these changes and this deep disproportion, 
and 
bearing in mind that the ruling party shows no readiness to 
cooperate with other political forces, especially of the 
opposition, in order to solve the many acute problems common to 
our society (and cooperation does not necessarily mean a 
government coalition), we have issued now well-known proposals: 
  1. Let the parliament approve as soon as possible the 
Albanian constitution, seeing this as a condition to guarantee 
the operation of all democratic institutions and mechanisms of 
the state and the judiciary, as well as for Albania's 
integration in the Council of Europe and other international 
organizations. We consider it necessary for the constitution to 
be subjected to the people's judgment and vote of confidence. 
Therefore, during the general elections, let the people also be 
given the opportunity to vote on the Albanian constitution. 
  2. Let a "roundtable" of parties start work in order discuss 
how to relieve the tension of the situation and to establish the 
equilibrium that has been so seriously upset. We think that the 
holding of early elections before this autumn would be the sole 
constitutional way to reach a new political settlement. For 
this, we propose the approval of a paraelectoral social pact 
that will ensure that the elections are held in a calm political 
situation. 
  The General Management Committee thought of singling out 
these two demands from the others, not only in order to indicate 
their importance, but also to give the conference the 
opportunity to express its view of them, and to say whether we 
agree to put them at the center of our action program this year. 
We take the view that these two demands require a total 
commitment from us, from all the PSSh structures, the 
Eurosocialist Youth Forum, and the Socialist Women's Forum, in 
publicizing the PSSh's achievements as a political force that 
knows no generation gap and has the ability to govern because it 
knows how to cooperate and to give the best alternative, in 
sounding out the electorate through frequent and lively 
meetings, in drawing up draft programs that will be as concrete 
as possible, and in selecting able candidates who enjoy the 
voters' support and trust, etc. 
  In the present situation, the General Management Committee 
also believes that the work of the PSSh parliamentary group 
claims priority, alongside cooperation with other political 
forces and such associations as those of the National Liberation 
War veterans, the war and labor invalids, the former prisoners 
and victims of political persecution, the Albanian Confederation 
of Trade Unions, and others. The PSSh again publicly declares 
that it respects every officially-recognized organization and 
association, because these are a product and necessary 
ingredient of democracy. It is open and ready to cooperate with 
them both locally and centrally. The nation and the development 
of the country, now as never before, require new and broad scope 
for cooperation and understanding among all representatives of 
society. 
  We are open to dialogue and cooperation with all political 
forces on the basis of the principles of equality among parties, 
whether great or small; of mutual trust and respect accompanied 
by a concern not to turn differences into obstacles to 
cooperation but into impulses toward finding a common language 
on definite issues; and of noninterference of one party in the 
affairs of another. 
  As so far, so in the future too, we will not hesitate, on 
the 
basis of these principles, to support just standpoints of the 
Democratic Alliance, the Social Democratic Party, the National 
Unity Party, the Popular Party, the Social Workers Party, the 
Agrarian Party, and even the PD and its government, just as we 
have always welcomed every standpoint of theirs that supports 
our alternatives, or criticizes them and presents other 
alternatives that are more realistic than ours. Such 
cooperation is to the benefit of democracy and the social peace 
that is so necessary, and does not constitute a kind of "anti-PD 
bloc," as the PD executive chairman hastened to call it. We use 
this opportunity to tell the PD that, if you feel isolated, you 
should look for the reason in your party and government, because 
finding room for cooperation is the ABC of a genuine democratic 
society, showing the ability of a political force to govern. 
  Room for cooperation in a genuinely democratic society can 
and must be found, but this requires the will and tolerance on 
all sides. In particular, no political force must lack this 
will as far as the national cause is concerned. So far, the 
political parties and certain groups both "affiliated" and 
"nonaffiliated" have devised theories and have also organized 
some political activities on the subject of national 
conciliation and unification. The PSSh has also several times 
come out in favor of this splendid initiative. However, the 
influence of this initiative is not evident in our 
sociopolitical life. One can even occasionally notice the 
opposite. 
  Our option is for all the pan-Albanian political forces to 
talk and to agree on two essential matters: first, a single 
national platform, and second, a long-term plan of action to 
realize the national cause. The time has come to put an end to 
this centuries- old delay, and for the Albanian political 
parties, all together, to take up the banner of pan national 
consensus as the first step toward national unification. 
<H5>  The Social Market Economy -- The PSSh's Priority Alternative </H5>
  Almost three years ago, when the Albanian economy was at the 
nadir of its crisis, the PSSh's program aimed to achieve two 
main goals: the stabilization of the economy and its orderly 
and carefully-considered transition to a social market economy. 
However, as is well known, political developments brought the PD 
to the leadership of political life in Albania, and the PD 
represented and began implementing its economic program based on 
the famous theory of "shock-therapy." 
  We do not say that there have been no successes at all 
during its two years in power. We appreciate the work done to 
draft and approve legislation that aims to establish a market 
economy in our country. Another positive feature has been the 
creation of a new class of businessmen who are increasingly 
assuming importance in the economic reform. The reining in of 
the inflation rate, although accomplished mainly by 
administrative rather than effective economic methods, has been 
a step that should be followed by other more effective ones. 
  However, we think that these and a few other achievements 
are 
first of all a result of the fact that Albania has now embarked 
on the road of irreversible transformations, and all Albanians 
and all political forces have been involved in them. Second, 
these achievements are not such as to justify the euphoria and 
demagogic exaggeration of successes and the concealment of 
failures in which the ruling party indulges, attempting to 
create an atmosphere in which people become accustomed to the 
crisis by saying, "Albania is all right with the PD, don't ask 
for any more!" With regret, but with a feeling of realism, we 
must admit that the PD program, which is based on neoliberalism, 
monetarism, the myth of the free market, and on the hope to 
stabilize the economy fast and to solve everything with help 
from abroad, in other words on one sidedness and haphazardness, 
is not as successful in our country as it is portrayed. The 
medium-term program put forward by the Meksi Government shows 
this very clearly. "The Albanian miracle" in the implementation 
of "shock therapy" has now failed, as also happened in other 
countries of East Europe. 
  The measures taken by the Meksi Government to control the 
crisis, beyond a strenuously-applied brake on the inflation 
rate, have not hit their targets: Production remains in general 
at minimal levels, far below the level of 1989 (although it is 
said that its decline has been halted); unemployment has 
reached the colossal figure of 44.5 percent of the able-bodied 
population, or about 400,000 people, while living standards have 
fallen more than 40 percent in one year, because the prices of 
consumer goods have risen nine- or 10-fold, while pay has only 
risen two- or three-fold. The foreign debt has risen from $400 
million to $625 million and is continuing to rise fast because 
of the very serious foreign trade deficit. 
  The galloping internal debt has totally asphyxiated the 
operations of enterprises. The market demand for goods and 
services is mainly ascribable to foreign-currency remittances 
from economic emigrees, a normal mechanism of the free market 
when the value of the lek falls in relation to goods on the 
domestic market, while it is artificially revalued in relation 
to foreign currencies. The state of public finances remains 
serious, and public finance relies solely on additions to the 
variety and size of taxes and on emergency interventions from 
the sale of state assets accumulated by the people for almost 
five decades. Meanwhile, the opportunities for the state and 
for investment credit for the expansion of production are very 
low. The failures to solve such vital problems as water, 
electricity, and fuel supplies, housing, and the health service, 
and the failure to guarantee minimum living conditions have 
become intolerable for ordinary people. 
  It can no longer be said that the economic crisis through 
which we are living is solely a result of the legacies of the 
past, because it is also a result of the policies pursued by the 
ruling PD in these two years of efforts to roughly shift us into 
a market economy. The incompetence of members of the 
government, the maladministration of foreign aid, and the lack 
of the hoped-for foreign investments led to the failure of such 
a course; the PD is therefore hastening, in the midst of this 
confusion, to make what "self-corrections" are possible, and 
even to talk about the "social economy of the market," which has 
now been reduced to a "welfare economy" without prospects. 
  Being much more realistically aware of the critical state of 
the economy than the party in power, the PSSh declares that it 
considers the reforms irreversible, but that it is necessary, as 
they are carried out, to make the necessary corrections. The 
PSSh is also a political force that is able to draw up and to 
present to the country its own alternative that ensures more 
successful solutions to the current and forthcoming problems of 
the economic reform. 
  The two fundamental axes of the PSSh's economic program 
remain the control of the economic and social crisis and the 
structural transformation of the economy in order to establish a 
social market economy. 
  Of course, the social market economy is neither an "abstract 
notion" nor a "play on words." The concept of the social market 
economy is much deeper than that which leaders of our right-wing 
leaders occasionally sneer at, as they attempt out of demagogy 
and political opportunism to equate it with some funds for 
social welfare which, in our country's case, would not suffice 
even to keep alive for six to 12 months our country's hundreds 
of thousands of unemployed. Nor is a social market economy made 
by adding a few public holidays, which are given to us by 
history or by God! Still less can it be achieved by the 
five-day week at a time when production and productivity are at 
very low levels. 
  The social market economy is now a theoretical and practical 
alternative that is mostly supported and implemented by 
political forces of a social-democratic tendency, which 
understand by the term a correction of capitalism in order to 
make it a humane society in which it becomes possible to achieve 
a genuine political democracy and an genuine economic democracy, 
a society that gives individuals equal opportunities and in 
which freedom of the citizen coexists with social 
responsibility, and a remuneration of ability with social 
solidarity and a struggle against poverty under the state's 
supervision. The social market economy is an economic model 
based on private property, whose sanctity we will defend with 
the law, and on free initiative and competition, but which does 
not exclude a variety of forms of ownership, the public sector, 
and other forms of ownership administered according to the 
principles of the market economy. 
  Relying on such an understanding of the social market 
economy, we Socialists place at the foundation of our economic 
alternative the idea of the new role of the democratic state, 
which obliquely intervenes in the economy with the aim of giving 
the market social and humane dimensions and guaranteeing the 
predominance of private property by creating total scope for the 
competition of all kinds of ownership. We are for a society 
that will be based on the logic of profit but at the same time 
on a logic of social solidarity, on a dynamic combination of the 
self-regulating mechanisms of the market and factors that 
balance the market's shortcomings. 
  In our economic alternative, the state will be required to 
devise the theoretical instruments for an anti-crisis reform 
program, but it will in particular determine measures for their 
practical implementation in two interrelated phases: 
  In the first phase, in accordance with the mechanism of the 
market economy, by giving continual regulatory nudges, while 
strategically, in the second phase, when the economy has assumed 
its normal form and will be close to using its potential, it 
will move to self-regulation. 
  The concept of property also lies at the basis of our 
economic alternative, with concrete programs to transform, 
restructure, and develop it, in order to lay the foundations of 
a mixed economy in which private and public property will 
coexist, confronting the competition of the market. 
  Privatization is for us too a basic component of the 
economic 
reform and a cardinal precondition for the creation of a market 
economy. However, the PSSh does not see it as a goal in itself 
or as the sole road. We are not for "total privatization," as 
it is normally put, but for the fastest possible privatization, 
while aiming at the decentralization of some enterprises, 
transforming them entirely and making them public, independent, 
and productive both nationally and locally, so that "a state of 
the best kind" may act in the economic field as a normal 
shareholder and a market agent, and so that there will be 
respect for the coexistence of the private sector and the public 
sector, which will gradually be wound down in favor of the 
private. 
  Our strategy in this direction remains the use of such 
methods as will be able to ensure, not the destruction and 
looting of property, as is happening, but a managerial 
transformation and a considered privatization that will 
guarantee the restructuring and revival of the economy. Our 
motto in this direction is, "Not change and privatization in 
order to simply change the owner, but in order to secure more 
production and more employment." 
  The PSSh considers to be illegal the privatization of more 
than 500 small and medium-sized state enterprises by government 
decrees, or by local privatization boards, without action and 
openly in the favor of certain individuals and groups. It 
promises to review the mistakes committed in the course of this 
process, and to redress all injustices with the help of modern 
legislation. 
  The PSSh has relied for its privatization program as a whole 
on the best European experience. This program also anticipates 
the privatization of large state enterprises, aiming at making 
property owners out of the largest number of citizens. 
  The PSSh favors privatization on the basis of vouchers 
assessed on the basis of the contribution, direct or indirect, 
of everybody who has labored and sweated to create this wealth 
during the last five decades. Bearing this in mind, we say that 
only the parliament elected by the people must legally decide on 
the distribution of this wealth, in order to avoid injustices 
and social tensions, whether old or new. This will mean that 
the correction of the injustices of the past will not lead to 
new injustices and social tensions. We do not see privatization 
as a return to the economy of 1938, but as a premise for putting 
ourselves on the lines of an up- to-date European economy. 
  The PSSh has come out against the PD's idea of privatizing 
everything. We think that the most sensitive sectors such as 
hydroelectric stations, mining, oil, the railroads, 
telecommunications, military industries, urban utilities, etc., 
should remain in public ownership. This stems from the idea of 
the new role of the democratic state in the social market 
economy and the need for a variety of forms of ownership, with 
the natural aim of creating total scope for competition and free 
initiative. 
  In short, the PSSh's economic alternative will, in changing 
the course of the economic reform, aim to simultaneously achieve 
three main objectives: 
  a) The maximal and effective mobilization of all our 
resources and assets, seeing this as the core of an anticrisis 
program. 
  b) Continuing to restructure the economy in order to adapt 
it as fast as possible to the demands of the market. 
  c) Guaranteeing the activities and high and stable profits 
of domestic and foreign capital. 
  Such changes in the course of the economic reform, seen both 
macro- and microeconomically, will be accompanied by the 
drafting and implementation of a range of concrete policies and 
solutions. 
  Thus, the PSSh does not view restraining inflation as an end 
in itself or in isolation from such social problems as high 
unemployment. We are for the optimal balance between these two 
indicators, and for a level of inflation that will reduce 
unemployment to 10-15 percent, i.e. slightly more than in other 
European countries. Our country's academics and economists are 
able to draft and implement programs for the maximal and 
effective mobilization of all our resources, deepening the 
restructuring of our economy for its fastest possible adaptation 
to the demands of the world market, guaranteeing high and stable 
profits for foreign capital alongside a higher spirit of 
cooperation and partnership, unfreezing economic emigration. 
  Particular attention must be devoted to the effective 
reactivization of some sectors of industry such as mines, 
mineral processing, engineering, light industry, the food 
industry, tourism, etc., in which it is anticipated that large 
numbers of people both in the towns and the countryside will 
find work. 
  In these directions, the PSSh is planning national, 
regional, 
and local programs to create new jobs, bearing particularly in 
mind the areas most affected by unemployment and a legacy of 
poverty. 
  It is well known that the liberalization of prices and their 
free determination by the market on the basis of supply and 
demand have significantly increased the cost of living, because 
the government has not allowed pay to follow the movement of 
prices. The PSSh favors an elastic policy in this, and believes 
that the free determination of prices should be followed by the 
necessary adjustments in the system of wages, pensions, social 
welfare, etc. 
  Our economy is not prepared to cope with the normal 
operation 
of the prices and wages mechanism, which is at present 
influenced by foreign production factors, earnings from 
emigration, international prices, customs tariffs, and currency 
exchange rates. Under these conditions, the state must now and 
again intervene in order to avoid possible speculative and 
undeserved profits. It is also necessary to maintain state 
guaranteed prices for the procurement of agricultural and dairy 
products, with the aim of encouraging the development of the 
products and byproducts the market demands. 
  As for pay, we favor a better appreciation of intellectual 
labor; reasonable differentials, in accordance with the economic 
situation, between high and low pay; a minimum wage calculated 
on the basis of a minimum subsistence; and wage freedom in the 
private sector, all to be regulated by laws approved in 
parliament. 
  The PSSh favors a credit, fiscal, and customs policy that 
will aim to stimulate and do what is possible to protect the 
domestic market for agricultural and industrial production, 
whether of traditional kinds or those "in their infancy." It 
also favors expanding the private sector and employing tens and 
hundreds of thousands of people in towns and centers of 
employment. 
  Fiscal policy must be regulated in two main directions: 
first, in order to stimulate and protect the development of 
domestic production and the equilibrium of the market and supply 
and demand. This would be helped by the establishment of a 
progressive taxation system and the replacement of turnover tax 
by a value-added tax. The second direction involves tightening 
the taxation administration in order to administrate revenue in 
the best possible way through improved financial control, and a 
struggle against corruption and improper profits that damage the 
interests of the state and of working people. A policy of 
reducing the budget deficit must take more care to distribute 
the burden better between the productive and the retail and 
service sectors. As part of a social market economy, we will 
reform the banking system, a financial institution with an 
irreplaceable role, by using the instruments of money, credit, 
and the financial market (in money and securities), in order to 
stabilize and further develop the range of production and to 
develop international economic relations and investments. 
  The establishment of local government on a stable and 
independent economic basis is a basic problem for us Socialists. 
We think that this is not simply a question of a skeletal law 
or a "local" budget that depends almost entirely on the 
government and the ministries, but an issue that demands a total 
regulation of the prerogatives of popular self-government and 
the assets and financial resources of these authorities, which 
will, on one hand, oblige and encourage these authorities to 
manage their productive activities and their natural resources, 
and also to confront and solve the many key problems of public 
services in the towns and the countryside. 
  A special policy will be devised favoring the countryside, 
especially the poor mountain regions. This will be supported by 
a range of concessionary policies for prices, loans, 
agricultural machinery, and nitrate fertilizers, and by devising 
and introducing at the proper time a customs and taxation system 
that will not only cover the fiscal aspect, as happened with the 
decree of the Meksi Government. We aim "to give oxygen" to 
Albanian agricultural and livestock production, or those 
products and trades for which every opportunity exists and where 
we do not lack a tradition. The PSSh opposes introducing taxes 
for the peasantry in 1994. 
  This conclusion is based on the current situation of 
agriculture and the countryside in general, which is in reality 
quite different from what those in power claim. The state of 
the countryside is serious. Land distribution has stuck at 70 
percent, while official spokesmen claim that it has reached 95 
percent. The countryside and agricultural production cannot set 
off on the right road without title deeds being distributed. 
  Albanian agriculture is still not in a position to secure 
bread and other products for the rural population, let alone the 
towns. The irrigation network has been to a large extent 
destroyed, the seed distribution system does not work, and the 
production of chemical fertilizer has sunk to the levels of 
several decades ago. The overwhelming majority of private 
peasants, especially those a long way from the towns, do not 
have any opportunity to send their produce to market. At the 
same time, peasants are obliged to buy industrial goods at 
European prices. 
  Our policy for the development of sheep-farming also aims at 
alleviating these areas today. Millions of dollars are today 
leaving Albania in order to import agricultural and dairy 
products that we used to export until yesterday, and can be 
produced at home; meanwhile, no ways are being found, no 
financially considered economic ways and means, to invest these 
millions in Albania, in agriculture, tourism, and other sectors. 
  We want to correct the anticonstitutional and illegal steps 
that were taken to destroy the agricultural enterprises. The 
parliament must issue a comprehensive law to cover these major 
assets of 200,000 hectares, which used to account for 25 percent 
of the country's agricultural production. 
  It is clear to everybody that Albanian agriculture cannot 
progress and achieve European levels divided into about 500,000 
individual plots; we therefore, in time, support the idea of 
the modern organization of private agricultural production. 
  We think that the future of democracy and the market economy 
in Albania depends on the abilities the political forces will 
show in devising and developing a social infrastructure and 
up-to-date systems of education, health, culture, social 
security, consumer protection, etc., things we regretfully note 
have been neglected or destroyed. The PSSh has devoted more 
attention than any other political force to human concerns and 
to the social dimension of the market economy, on the basis of 
the fact that we are faced with a marked deterioration of the 
social position of increasingly broad strata of our society; 
that 20 percent of urban families, or one in five, are totally 
destitute and receive no income other than what they receive as 
welfare; and that services in health, education, culture, etc., 
are less and less well covered. 
  We think that the economic reform can only be crowned with 
success if we show ourselves sensitive to human concerns, or, in 
other words, to the social costs of the reform. This is the 
reason that has impelled us not to rest content with compiling 
the most up- to-date social program possible, but to insist on 
realizing it on the basis of the new political settlement that 
we propose. 
  For example, the PSSh's alternative in the field of 
education 
lays down the goal of reforming and modernizing the educational 
system at all levels, in content and in structure, and 
completing the relevant legislation to make education open, 
democratic, secular, and modern. The broad basis of the 
education of Albanian citizens will continue to be in state 
schools. In this context, the educational rights of the 
minorities will be respected. Education will be paid for and 
conducted by the state. Private education will be permitted by 
law and its curricula will be subject to state standards. This 
will also be true of foreign schools. The criterion for 
employment and for promotion to supervisory responsibility at 
all levels of the schools will be professional ability. The 
status of a teacher and lecturer, of a school pupil and college 
student, and the duties of a parent in his relationship with the 
school, will be covered by a PSSh legislative initiative. 
Cooperation in European projects and the twinning of our schools 
and universities with those in foreign countries will remain an 
important resource in the future too. 
  In its program for health, the PSSh will rely on the 
principle that every citizen will receive the health care he 
requires, regardless of his social position or economic level. 
  Faced with the economic condition of a state that cannot 
promise adequate budget resources for health, the idea of health 
insurance, dependent on income, will be gradually introduced, as 
the only way to achieve a modern medical service, the best 
possible pay for health personnel, and also the basic 
preconditions for a struggle against corruption in the health 
sector. The aim will be to improve all three levels of the 
health service, and to devote particular attention to the 
modernization of preventive medicine and the emergency service. 
  By means of the social security system, we aim to offer 
protection against the perils of age, illness, accidents, 
invalidity, unemployment, and at the same time the poverty in 
which certain strata of society will continue to find 
themselves. The social security system at which we aim combines 
personal responsibility and social solidarity. Its structure 
will be subdivided into insurance, solidarity funds, aid, etc., 
and also for different ages and professions. We will care for 
war veterans according to the same standards other European 
countries adopt toward those who contributed to the struggle 
against fascism. 
  At a time when cultural and academic contacts with other 
countries are increasing, our state and society have the duty to 
maintain and support our national cultural identity. We 
therefore favor support for the dignified revival of central 
institutions of pan-national importance such as the Academy of 
Sciences, the National Theater, the Opera and Ballet Theater, 
Albanfilm, the Naim Frasheri Publishing House, the central 
museums, etc. This will be supplemented by cooperation between 
the central institutions and social organizations, by agreements 
with international organizations and associations, and also by 
demanding a certain quota from private enterprises. 
  In this same area, the PSSh alternative provides for 
certain specific measures for the intelligentsia, for the 
operation of existing academic institutions and their increased 
cooperation with individual European bodies and projects, the 
maintenance of high university numbers, legislative and economic 
incentives for the private sector to invest in academic 
institutions, improved pay and welfare for intellectuals with 
high levels of postgraduate qualifications, and the legal 
protection of authors' copyright within Albania and abroad, etc. 
  In conclusion, the PSSh declares that its alternative gives 
optimal solutions to the problems that have accumulated during 
our country's economic crisis, and that it is able to confront 
the challenges of the times in this difficult transition period. 
Nevertheless, it defends the view that the country requires 
medium- term and long-term macroeconomic guidelines that cannot 
be included within the framework of the program of an individual 
government of whatever party. These guidelines require a broad 
consensus and we will be unsparing in our commitment and efforts 
to achieve this. 
<H5>  For an Active and Realistic Foreign Policy </H5>
  The PSSh has assembled a broad and realistic vision 
regarding 
both foreign policy and the influence of foreign factors on the 
successful realization of the reforms in Albania. It has 
clearly expressed its stands in its program documents and in its 
daily work. Therefore, without pretending to give a total 
overview of foreign policy, we would wish merely to stress 
certain objections and priorities. 
  We value the steps that have been taken to overcome 
Albania's 
foreign isolation and support the development of the process of 
international relations as well as efforts to establish a new 
order of peace and stability that will exclude all kinds of 
political, national, economic, ethnic, or religious conflict 
among countries and peoples, especially in our tense region. 
  The PSSh once again takes the opportunity to express 
gratitude to the countries and states of Europe, the United 
States, China, and the countries of the Islamic community for 
the help they have given to our country in this difficult period 
of transition. We appreciate the continually active roles of 
the EU, the Western European Union, and more broadly, that of 
the CSCE, not only in the process of economic renewal, but also 
politically and in support of our national cause. 
  We hold fast to the view that new geopolitical realities 
have 
brought regional factors to the fore. Our foreign policy in 
this field should therefore be marked by dynamic equilibrium. 
We view regional factors as extensions of nonregional factors 
of European and Atlantic security. We cannot respond to this 
situation with the haphazard and amateur enthusiasm of much of 
our foreign policy, over which we have already expressed our 
objections. The priorities given to chance opportunities have 
detracted from the work of Albanian diplomacy, and brought a 
kind of chill in relations with Europe, a chill that cannot be 
hidden by spectacular scenes at airports and numbers of 
handshakes. 
  Relations with neighboring countries also constitute a 
priority that can never be neglected, and we must therefore 
continually be making efforts to ensure we are always friends 
with these countries, bringing problems out into the open and 
solving them, but above all not allowing the creation of new 
problems that cool relations. 
  The political conditions in the region are not those of four 
or five years ago. The war, the unprecedented violence of the 
Serbian chauvinists in Bosnia and other areas of the former 
Yugoslavia, and the grim terror against the Albanians in Kosova 
include ingredients that could lead to this war spreading. This 
would be fatal to the peoples of the Balkans. We therefore 
support every effort, within our beyond the Balkans, to avert 
this. 
  In this tense situation in the region, the PSSh repeats its 
stand in support of our brothers in Kosova, in their own 
territories in the former Yugoslavia, and in the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia. We clearly hold fast to the idea that 
respect for the principle of that borders cannot be changed by 
force does not conflict with the recognition of the rights of 
people to self-determination. The PSSh thinks that there is an 
urgent need today to find new ways for the peoples of the 
Balkans to live together in peace and to work for prosperity and 
democracy, not allowing antagonisms to be created among them 
through the exploitation of differences in economic levels, or 
national, religious, linguistic, and cultural differences, etc. 
We think that an independent Kosova free from Serbian 
occupation would not only realize aspirations of the people of 
Kosova and be an important step toward solving our national 
question, but would also be a factor of peace and stability in 
the region. 
  Despite the serious conditions now prevailing in the 
Balkans, 
the PSSh repeats its familiar stand that Albanian diplomacy 
should take realistic and tangible steps with clear initiatives 
to reactivate bilateral and multilateral Balkan cooperation in 
political, economic, and cultural fields, in technical and 
academic cooperation, etc. The PSSh powerfully supports and 
will devote all its energies to encouraging dialogue, mutual 
understanding, and cooperation among the peoples of the region, 
in the belief that interdependency and peaceful coexistence 
constitute a contemporary framework for guaranteeing national 
independence and identity. The problems of the Balkans must be 
solved first of all by the peoples of the Balkan themselves, but 
must of course be viewed in close connection with European and 
world problems. Among other things, we favor acting on the 
initiative for all the progressive left-wing forces in the 
Balkans to sit down together "round one table." 
  At the same time, the PSSh declares itself against the 
creation of miniature alliances and the spirit of speculation 
and distrust that these create. Good bilateral relations should 
pave the way for the establishment of broad, multilateral 
cooperation in the region. 
  In this context, the PSSh long ago expressed its stand that 
relations with such neighboring countries as Greece and Italy 
must take priority in the region. We have always considered 
these countries as natural gateways for Albania's integration in 
Europe. However, unfortunately, a kind of undesirable chill has 
arisen in our relations with them. Diplomatic efforts in this 
field have been haphazard and dilettante. 
  We therefore wish that the Albanian state would undertake a 
clear strategy in relation to our neighbor Greece, especially 
now that there is a Socialist government there and we are 
familiar with the predisposition and readiness of Pasok 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement] to normalize relations, to 
achieve cooperation and good- neighborliness, and to legalize 
Albanian emigrants working in Greece. We support the readiness 
of Greek diplomacy to view more realistically both the concept 
of Europe and the Cam problem. 
  We have been and will remain committed in our efforts and 
stands on respecting and defending all the rights of the Greek 
minority in Albania, recognized by the CSCE documents. 
  The PSSh appreciates Greece's assumption in her turn of the 
EU chairmanship, and believes that she will play a significant 
role in Albania's integration in civilized Europe. The Albanian 
state, too, must be more active in this. 
  The Albanian people are grateful to friendly Italy for the 
help that it has given and for its generosity in welcoming 
thousands of young Albanian men and women. However, we cannot 
agree with the Albanian Government's hasty and unargued 
standpoints toward Italy, which recently, in the absence of 
efforts to find a common language, have led to a cooling 
relations between our two countries, something that is 
unacceptable for the friendly feelings the Albanian people 
cherish for the Italian people. 
  We appreciate the need to strengthen relations with Turkey, 
for these are traditional relations with a friendly people that 
supported Albania with their own generous help at the start of 
democratic processes in the country. We similarly appreciate 
the need to make more tangible relations with Bulgaria, Romania, 
Croatia, and Slovenia, as Balkan countries. 
  We have desired and still desire good relations with the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, not only because we wish 
to see this country a factor of peace and stability in the 
region, but also because more than 800,000 Albanians live there. 
However, we have noticed some attitudes on the part of the 
Macedonian state that are not in the least realistic toward the 
fair demands of the Albanian population to enjoy the same rights 
and freedoms enjoyed by citizens of other nationalities. We 
cannot in any way agree with the statements of the highest 
officials of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
rejecting the Albanians as a state-forming element. In this 
direction, the PSSh has criticized the tolerant and often 
irresponsible attitudes of the Albanian Government, which has 
both been in a hurry when there was no need, and has kept silent 
when it should not have done. 
  We do not consider Albania's opening to the world to be 
complete solely with stable and friendly relations with the 
Balkan countries, Germany, France, Britain, the Scandinavian 
countries, etc., and with the United States, but also with 
Japan, China, Canada, the Russian Federation, the Arab 
countries, etc. The government's occasional welcome steps in 
this direction have either been inconsiderable or spectacular, 
without any clear strategy, and without vigor. 
  We do not see Albania's inclination toward Europe as the 
sole 
direction of our foreign policy. In this context, we Socialists 
have always appreciated relations with the United States. We 
have valued the standards of U.S. democracy and U.S. technical 
and professional assistance, which we would like to see grow and 
expand. 
  We repeat the belief that any role and any step in foreign 
policy is acceptable as long as it develops the concept of the 
independence, sovereignty, integrity, and freedom of the 
homeland, under conditions of interdependency. We favor the 
dignified integration of Albania in Europe and in all its 
political, economic, and military organisms. In this sense, we 
value and appreciate cooperation with NATO, especially within 
the framework of the Partnership for Peace initiated by U.S. 
President Clinton. 
  We see this as an important step toward more solid forms of 
integration in European processes and Euro-Atlantic security, 
which will also lead to commitments for our country to respect 
the principles of democracy and human rights and freedoms, an 
area in which we are still far from familiar international 
standards. 
  The PSSh thinks that to express a wish at a verbal level, as 
did the parliament, is not enough to join Partnership for Peace 
at the highest levels, because deserving and acquiring 
partnership with NATO will, as we know, require proposals, 
measures, and tangible commitments to be studied, coordinated, 
and supported by legislation. For these, in our view, the 
parliament must neither be left to one side or presented with a 
"fait accompli," making what it has to say a mere formality, as 
happens. 
  Comrades delegates, the PSSH is a force of the European 
left, 
committed to recognizing the traditions and characteristics of 
European social democracy, which has now created its own social- 
democratic profile. Its prestige is continually rising among 
the circle of the socialist and social-democratic parties of 
Europe. Since the party's First Congress in June 1992, it has 
not only consolidated its relations with its sister parties, but 
has further expanded them with the Spanish Socialist Party, the 
Democratic Party of the Left in Italy, and the social-democratic 
parties of the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, etc. Positive 
steps have also been taken in relations with the German Social 
Democratic Party. It is our task to promoted and consolidate 
these. 
  We appreciate the interest being shown and the help recently 
given to our party by the Socialist International Committee for 
Central and East Europe as an important step toward the PSSh's 
gradual integration in the Socialist International. While this 
is one of our objectives for the future, we repeat that we have 
never acted with the idea of affirming ourselves first abroad 
and then in Albania. We therefore see our integration in the 
Socialist International first of all as an ongoing duty toward 
democracy in Albania. 
  The new political, economic, and social settlement that we 
propose is the most tangible expression of this commitment to 
the democracy, social peace, and economic reform that Albania 
needs so badly. We are aware of the responsibilities and 
sacrifices required from us, and we therefore declare once again 
from the platform of this conference our readiness and 
dedication, and that of all the PSSh's many members and 
supporters. 
  Long live the PSSh! Long live the Albanian people!

<F P=106> [Article by Birger Hilstrom: "Massive Support for Albania"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Large Danish contributions are on the way for 
rebuilding Albania's health-care system and amount to the most 
extensive export ever of a Danish overall system. Foreign Aid 
Minister Helle Degn has a pool of 45 million kroner [6 million 
dollars] ready and is calling a meeting to decide on 
distribution of the funds. [passage omitted] 
  The 45 million kroner will be provided to the Albanians over 
the next three years, and Degn will invite Danish foreign aid 
organizations and a Danish consulting group, with EU [European 
Union] Parliament member Freddy Blak (Social Democrat) as 
chairman, to a meeting on 31 January to decide how the funds are 
to be distributed. 
  "Until now we have only granted humanitarian aid of between 
2 
and 4 million kroner, but the effort needs to be coordinated and 
targeted correctly," said Degn. "I think we must support the 
weakest, and this means orphaned children and the handicapped, 
and to set up an Albanian legal system." 
  The Albanian Government on Sunday [16 January], asked for 
Danish help in drawing up a comprehensive plan for taking care 
of the mentally handicapped of that poor country. A 
comprehensive plan for psychiatric and mental retardation care 
will be the largest Danish system export ever, amounting to 
hundreds of million [kroner], and the plan will include 
decentralizing from Tirana, training of Albanian personnel, and 
establishing of new housing through [the private] ASF Danish

  The Danish consulting group, which received a request for 
help from the Albanian Ministry of Health following an 
inspection of badly deteriorating hospitals, is gathering funds 
for the project from, among other sources, already appropriated 
EU loans. 
  "We have broad experience in the decentralizing of 
institutions for the develpmentally impaired, and the Albanians 
wanted our model," said former Director of Social Services 
Alfred Dam, who has just returned home from Albania and is in 
the process of drafting a report on the shocking conditions in 
Albanian institutions.

  [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev stated as follows in an 
interview for the Sofia Khorizont Radio Network today: 
  No basic reforms have been accomplished in Bulgaria as yet, 
hence it is superficial to talk about recommunization as long as 
we have not restored private property and the land to their 
original owners, as long as we have not achieved a certain stage 
in privatization, and as long as the restitution has not been 
completed. The term recommunization has a meaning only if 
applied to the return of cadres from the old nomenklatura to the 
organs of state power, he pointed out. 
  The opposition is not behaving properly, according to 
President Zhelev. It could have overcome bitterness and mutual 
insults by restoring the old majority of the people who won the 
last elections and who should once more take over the executive 
power in order to promote the reforms. Elections under the 
current circumstances are likely to involve the risk of 
uncertain results, the president stressed. 
  President Zhelev sees the Union of Democratic Forces as a 
democratic coalition rallying the democratic, antitotalitarian, 
and non-communist forces, namely all those who are really called 
upon to carry out the reforms in Bulgaria. 
  This is what determines the future and fate of our country, 
President Zhelev stated at the end of his interview for the 
Khorizont Radio Network.

<F P=106> [Report by Radka Petrova: "U.S. Diplomats Are Forming </F>
Turkish Axis Between Us and Greece"] 
  [Text] The visit by two U.S. diplomats to Kurdzhali and 
Krumovgrad last week, which was represented to the media and the 
public as a routine visit, was in fact connected with fulfilling 
a strategic task of drawing the Turks of the eastern Rhodopes 
closer to the Muslim community in northern Greece, excellently 
informed sources claim. An independent Greek source adds that 
he noticed unusual activity by Greek special services in the 
Greek provinces of Thrace and Rhodopes precisely at the time of 
the diplomatic visit to the eastern Rhodopes by Thomas Price, 
deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, and Second 
Secretary John Kunstadter. 
  As is well-known, Greece has good reasons for its fears 
regarding the attempts to draw together the Muslims on both 
sides of the Bulgarian-Greek border. According to circles close 
to the Greek cabinet, this is the main reason for their 
unwillingness to open up the Makaza border crossing point. 
  According to experts, the U.S. position concerning drawing 
together the two Muslim lobbies on either side of the border 
aims to hold Greece in check because of its stubborn stance 
regarding Macedonia. This supposedly is to be achieved by 
insinuating that in the eastern Rhodopes and Thrace only a spark 
is needed to ignite a new Bosnia. When asked if they were 
checking on the existence of such a possibility during their 
visit to Kurdzhali, diplomats John Kunstadter and Thomas Price 
denied such an insinuation with amazement. However, according 
to someone who took part in the closed talks with the DPS 
[Movement for Rights and Freedoms], this was precisely the 
problem that worried the emissaries of Ambassador Montgomery. 
Serious observers of this problem are firm in their view that 
there is no doubt that the Americans are mediating in trying to 
bring together the two Muslim lobbies of the eastern Rhodopes 
and western Thrace. The number of illegal visits by two Greek 
parliamentary deputies, the Muslims Ahmed Saduk and Ahmed 
Faikoglu, to the former Kurdzhali Okrug during the last election 
campaign in Bulgaria allegedly formed only part of the plan that 
had been hatched up by strategists in Washington to draw the two 
Muslim communities together. Ahmed Saduk is known to have 
claimed that the Muslims in northern Greece are Turks. 
According to Greek sources, in northern Greece the Muslims 
number between 100,000 and 120,000. Ankara considers that about 
300,000 Muslims inhabit this region. Greek lawyers recall that, 
before he became a member of the previous Greek Parliament, an 
investigation was mounted against Ahmed Saduk on suspicion of 
fomenting nationalist enmity. 
  According to sources close to the U.S. Embassy, certain 
diplomats are supposed to have quite seriously discussed the 
possibility of the DPS becoming a model for the Muslims of 
northern Greece. The Muslims there were recognized as a 
community by the 1923 Lausanne Conference, but do not possess 
anything like the rights now enjoyed by the Turks in Bulgaria. 
This is a very difficult task, because the Greek Constitution 
forbids the existence of ethnic parties, and in Greece it is 
impossible even for Slavonic-speaking Greek citizens to form a 
party. According to REUTER, infuriated Greeks were reported to 
have hurled stones at a Turkish parliamentary delegation in 
Xanthe in early February. It is alleged that the Turkish 
deputies also held talks with the Muslim community in the town 
about them forging closer links with their brothers in the 
neighboring countries. 
  Sources in northern Greece claim that U.S. radars are still 
controlling the airspace there, and they point to such equipment 
mounted in Maria and other nearby villages. Furthermore, it is 
known that all the financial aid for the mosques in the eastern 
Rhodopes and western Thrace, declared to consist of donations 
from Islamic organizations, really comes from U.S. banks.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Viktor Valentinov: "Our Politicians Forget </F>
the Difference Between NATO Partners and NATO Members"] 
  [Text] Bulgaria was the eighth country to sign the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] Program, after Romania, Poland,, and 
the Ukraine, but before the Czech Republic and Albania. People 
at NATO headquarters praised our enthusiasm, but did not promise 
that we would soon become full members. 
  At the same time people in the West are more and more 
frequently launching the thesis that NATO's expansion to the 
East is likely to obliterate the organization's image. It would 
become a confederation rallying too many different interests, 
which would make it similar to the fable of the eagle, the crab, 
and the fish, each of which was trying to pull in a different 
direction. 
  Bulgaria actually consented to partnership after Moscow and 
Washington declared that NATO should gradually expand. Our 
politicians, however, do not seem prepared to imagine what our 
role within NATO is likely to be, while the signature under the 
program, which has no definite form for the time being, might 
also have some surprise in store. Clinton's proposal has not 
yet been discussed by Congress, which might propose some 
corrections to the president's views. Everything shows that 
even people in the White House have no clear idea about what 
NATO partnership should actually mean. 
  The number two at the State Department, Talbott, recently 
said that the PFP should develop as a buffer between Russia and 
Western Europe in the event Moscow becomes aggressive. Others 
among Clinton's advisers see it as a step toward a collective 
security system, without heeding Yeltsin's warning that former 
Warsaw Pact members should not be admitted to NATO. 
  Our statesmen do not seem to be concerned about the lack of 
clarity regarding partnership with NATO. They seem not to 
realize that President Zhelev's signature under the program is 
only the first, but not the last step toward our future 
association with NATO. After the brilliant expose on the reasons 
for our future association with NATO which was submitted in 
Brussels and made an excellent impression, it is high time to 
say how we imagine the future. 
  The Poles, for example, declared that they do not intend to 
pay for the implementation of the initiative. This question did 
not seem to concern us Bulgarians. Our politicians claim that 
the rearmament of our troops according to NATO standards, would 
not disastrously affect our military budget, but no arguments 
and figures were submitted in this respect. 
  Bulgarian politicians reached some kind of consensus as 
regards the necessity of accepting NATO's partnership offer, but 
should they not have reflected on our country's future strategy 
within the organization? 
  A wait-and-see policy might have achieved some success in 
the 
past, but it can hardly guarantee a place in the sun for us. 
The other four countries from Central Europe are treated with 
greater benevolence. They are eager to join NATO as full 
members without standing in line for the PFP. It is not very 
likely that people in Brussels are going to like them less, 
because they only half-heatedly supported the idea, and 
demonstratively sent lower-level delegations to sign the 
document. 
  According to NATO, the PFP signatory countries should decide 
for themselves to what extent they wish to be associated with 
NATO. Bulgaria has not responded to this remark, so far. Our 
politicians do not even mention the fact. 
  If we would like to have our share of the pie, would it not 
be better to declare our intentions unmistakably, rather than 
waiting for the others to assign us our place? 
  This is so, because in spite of Brussels' vehement 
protestations in denying the existence of two speeds in progress 
toward NATO -- one for the Visegrad four, and the other for the 
remaining countries -- we should not forget that war is being 
waged in our neighborhood and that precisely the guarantee for 
our national security was our "leitmotif" in opting for NATO 
partnership.

<F P=106> [Plamen Kulinski commentary: "Beware the Fire"] </F>
  [Text] Despite the sharp criticism of Athens' decision to 
close the port of Thessaloniki for goods from and for Greece, 
the Greek Government decided to sharpen its punitive measures. 
Furthermore, Greece has even threatened that it will prevent 
other neighboring states from helping the former Yugoslav 
republic. Indeed, Athens even wanted Bulgaria to join its 
punitive measures. 
  Greece's desire to force Skopje to accept its conditions is 
understandable. One can also understand the Papandreou 
government's efforts to please radical nationalists, who accuse 
him of feebleness toward the former Yugoslav republic. However, 
why should other states that have good relations with Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] be involved 
in all this? The answer might be that the end justifies the 
means. Greece, however, seems to forget that one means of 
resolving problems is dialogue. Nevertheless, it appears that 
the dialogue will not be resumed soon, because Skopje has made 
resuming the dialogue with Greece conditional on the lifting of 
the embargo. 
  Until then, as was the case with last year's blockade of the 
oil barges in Thessaloniki, Sofia will try to alleviate 
Macedonia's economic problems. Sofia will do this regardless of 
Athens' displeasure. After all, Greece still cannot forgive 
Bulgaria for being the first state to recognize Macedonia's 
independence. Naturally, Greece has the right to try to 
incorporate Bulgaria in its plans. On the other hand, Sofia 
also has the right to refuse to participate in those plans. 
Having been burned by fire in past because of other people's 
sins, however, Sofia should beware the new fire.

<F P=106> [Commentary by KONTINENT Belgrade correspondent Momchilo </F>
Stoyanovich: "Why Has Yugoslavia Not Yet Recognized Macedonia?"] 
  [Text] With the U.S. recognition of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Russia's decision 
to send its ambassador to Skopje in early March, in practice all 
the leading countries in the world have confirmed the status of 
the Macedonian state. Before the beginning of 1994, Macedonia 
was recognized by Germany, France, Britain, and other European 
states, which hastened to take this step before Greece assumed 
the EU presidency. 
  The Foreign Ministry in Skopje reports that so far 27 states 
have established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, although 
the documents and communications materials of only 11 states 
officially refer to "the Republic of Macedonia." The remainder, 
including the United States, use the term "The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia," under which the United Nations admitted 
Macedonia as a member. 
  Bearing in mind that, except for Greece, Macedonia has been 
recognized by all the Balkan states (including all the other 
former Yugoslav republics,) the question why the FRY has still 
not recognized Macedonia remains open. Little is said openly 
about this issue, but the fact remains that to date no meeting 
has taken place between a Macedonian and a Serb at which the 
southern neighbor has failed to ask his northern brother the 
reason for his continued delay in recognizing Macedonia's 
independence. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the man with most 
influence in Yugoslav politics, has not omitted to say at his 
meetings with Macedonian representatives that Serbia has no 
claims against its southern neighbor and that nothing prevents 
Belgrade from recognizing Macedonia, and yet in practice this 
does not happen. 
  It is natural for Yugoslavia to say that even its own status 
is not yet settled, because the United Nations is keeping this 
issue open. Since spring last year, Yugoslavia has not been a 
full member of the United Nations; it was not expelled from the 
organization, but it is not entitled to take part in meetings of 
the UN General Assembly. However, the true reason relates to 
Greece, which demonstrates very good friendly relations toward 
the Serbs and always defends Yugoslavia's interests in the 
international arena. Furthermore, as a member of the EU, Greece 
has much stronger influence in Europe than Macedonia, whose 
status has still not been determined. Of course, one should not 
gloss over the fact that Macedonia has also failed so far to 
recognize the FRY, which was formed from the two former Yugoslav 
republic of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  It is evident that there are enough reasons for Belgrade to 
delay recognizing Macedonia. Accordingly, Yugoslavia will be in 
no hurry to do so, at least until there is an improvement in the 
relations between Skopje and Athens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians; Arpad Pasza, chairman of the 
Democratic Community of Hungarians in Croatia; and Bela Marko, 
chairman of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania; by 
Jozsef Botlik; place and date not given: "Vital Issues Over the 
Border"] 
  [Text] Last weekend, the leaders of the Hungarian 
organizations from beyond the border were in Budapest and were 
met by Prime Minister Peter Boross. We interviewed some 
participants of the talks on the results of the meeting and on 
the situation of the various Hungarian national communities. 
<H3>  Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Union of 
Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK]: We Want Autonomy! </H3>
  [Botlik] What were the results of the Budapest meeting for 
you? 
  [Agoston] I raised two issues at the meeting, one in 
connection with the Balladur plan. I explained that, if any of 
the region's governments signed it in its current form, the 
political goals set out by the organizations of the Hungarian 
national communities over the border would in fact become 
impossible to achieve. We insist that an agreement like this 
also has to contain the autonomy concept that we drew up. The 
issue of aid was the other topic. In recent years, the 
government of the mother country has also given significant 
financial support to the Hungarian national communities over the 
border. I asked the prime minister -- as help given to the 
national minorities is internationally legitimate -- to help 
maintain our institutional system, and to support our efforts 
aimed at implementing our autonomy concept. This would be very 
important because, certain phenomena in connection with the 
financial aid we have received did not help this. 
  [Botlik] The psycho-terror against the some 400,000 
Hungarians and the forceful military mobilizations seem recently 
to have eased off. Does the dialogue that began between the 
VMDK and the Serbian government have a role in this? 
  [Agoston] We formulated our autonomy concept two years ago, 
at a time when the war was in full swing and the forceful 
mobilizations were daily events, and we had to suffer a tough 
war propaganda. We started from the premise that it is also in 
the interest of the Serbian state -- including its parties -- 
that the now open and unresolved situation of the Vojvodina 
Hungarians is settled. We were certain that sooner or later, 
international circumstances will change to benefit our efforts. 
In recent months, I also put my talks with Serbian President 
Milosevic into this context. As a matter of fact, the meeting 
was requested by Milosevic. I raised the personal autonomy of 
the Hungarians and that the establishment of an administrative 
district with Hungarian majority should begin to be set up in 
north Backa or the northern part of the Banat. We would like to 
achieve all this gradually. If the Serbian government backs 
down from the agreement then we will inform the Hungarian and 
the international public about this. 
  [Botlik] What does personal autonomy mean? 
  [Agoston] We intend to make progress in three areas. In 
education, we would like to establish a Hungarian schooling 
system, in culture, we would like to take over the leadership of 
institutions and associations and their assets (mainly 
buildings), and we would like to establish an independent 
Hungarian information system (press, radio, television). All 
these would be directed by the personal autonomy's council that 
will be established on a multi- party basis. We will probably 
initiate elections for this in October. If the promises 
received during the talks with President Milosevic come true 
then we will be able to set up the Vojvodina Hungarian press and 
publishing house and the editorial group of the independent 
Hungarian television and radio. We can start setting up the 
Hungarian schooling system, and the council of the personal 
autonomy can take over certain functions in the area of culture. 
  [Botlik] At the December elections, five representatives of 
the VMDK were elected into the Serbian Parliament. From the 
results it seems that they might be the decisive factors.... 
  [Agoston] Unfortunately, this is the situation in Parliament 
where the socialists have 123 of the 250 seats and the 
opposition has the rest. The opposition is a rather mixed 
political group because the VMDK and Seselj's radical party are 
together in it although they are not at all in the same camp in 
reality. The opposition is divided, therefore, the socialists 
have to prepare for an unstable government and they will again 
have to call elections after some time. In this situation, our 
view is that the VMDK's representatives will not vote for any 
such parliamentary decision which would make them clash with 
half of the Serbian political palette. 
<H3>  Arpad Pasza, Chairman of the Democratic Community of 
Hungarians in Croatia [HMDK]: We Pay Attention to the Scattered 
Hungarian Groups </H3>
  [Botlik] Out of the organizations of Hungarians over the 
border, the HMDK is the youngest, it is barely two years old. A 
large section of the areas inhabited by Hungarians -- the 
Dravaszog [Drava river area] and Slavonia -- is under Serbian 
occupation at the moment and a significant proportion of the 
population has escaped from these places. How can you organize 
yourselves in this situation? 
  [Pasza] We consider the organization of the Hungarians 
living in scattered areas as our main task. For example, there 
is a significant diaspora -- mainly intelligentsia -- in the 
Croatian capital Zagreb which can still be stopped from being 
assimilated. A kindergarten group will be started for their 
children in March. Some 1,200 Hungarians are living in the 
Tengermellek, they speak their mother tongue but, unfortunately, 
their children can only speak Croatian. At the beginning of the 
year, 164 people formed the HMDK's local organizations in the 
former Hungarian spa Abbazia now Opatija. They have grand plans 
and they are also expecting a cultural performance from Hungary. 
We will next form organizations in the area of Belovar and then 
along the Sava River in Slavon-Brod. 

<H3>    Bela Marko, Chairman of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania: We Also Want To Become Economically 
Strong </H3>
  [Marko] Contrary to certain media reactions, we also 
considered this meeting natural because it has to be openly and 
consistently admitted that the Hungarian organizations operating 
in various countries of the Carpathian basin regularly exchange 
their experiences. All Hungarian national communities over the 
border are living in special situations but their problems are 
often similar and, most certainly, this why we came to almost 
identical conclusions as to the solutions. In our view, the 
introduction of various forms of autonomy leads to the 
reassuring settlement of the situation of Hungarian national 
communities over the border. As we consider ourselves as 
organic part of the Hungarian nation, we expect the Hungarian 
Government's political support in our endeavors and that care 
for the Hungarians living outside the country's boundaries will 
remain an organic and inseparable part of its foreign policy. 
  [Botlik] In the past years in Europe, a number of proposals 
have been made to set up international norms which -- it seems 
-- will reassuringly settle the situation of national minority 
and ethnic communities.... 
  [Marko] The Balladur plan that is now called the European 
Stability Agreement is one of these proposals that apply to the 
East European region or a section of it. Its original version 
contained several positive elements for national minorities but 
most of these were removed from the draft through the amendments 
in 1993. This plan would only offer good solutions if, in the 
process of settlement, the affected national communities and 
governments also held talks and the views of the national 
communities were taken into consideration. The latter was 
emphasized by the ethnic Hungarian leaders at the Budapest 
meeting. Our links with the Hungarian government are not only 
of a political nature. We have already received considerable 
budget support for rebuilding our educational and cultural 
institutional system. The mother country will continue to be 
completely open about doing this in the future, too. 
  [Botlik] What are the most important tasks in improving the 
situation of the more than 2 million strong Hungarian national 
community in Romania and Transylvania? 
  [Marko] The priorities we laid down four years ago are still 
valid. Unfortunately, the Hungarian Bolyai University of 
Sciences still has not been able to restart its operation, 
therefore, our education system continues to be incomplete. We 
are trying to substitute this with civic social institutions, 
foundations, associations, unions, and folk high schools, and 
there are also very remarkable church initiatives. We are 
trying to use all legal frameworks and expand the possibilities 
of Hungarian education to overcome the difficulties and the 
acute shortage of teachers. As we often said it in our 
statements, the economy is just as important for us, and we 
think that we have to do much more than we have done in the past 
to help the Hungarian national community strengthen financially. 
Through this, people's serious subsistence problems can be 
eased, emigration can be reduced, and the general mood can be 
improved. This is especially important because an economically 
strong national community is less exposed to the state power. 
We have to act with more determination in the future because an 
anti-Hungarian discriminative process can also be seen in the 
privatizations.

  [Text] On his return to Targu Jiu, Nicolae Mihu, leader of 
the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation, told our 
correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu that he is totally disappointed 
with the negotiations that were conducted in Bucharest last 
Friday and Saturday [18-19 February]. In spite of all that, he 
is optimistically looking forward to the arrival in Gorj County 
tomorrow of the governmental inquiry commission scheduled to 
investigate irregularities in the activity of the Brown Coal 
Public Corporation, which might lead to the strike being ended. 
Otherwise, Mr. Nicolae Mihu said, the coordinating council of 
the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation intends to continue 
the strike action in the mining units and to explain to the 
miners that they should no longer go to Targu Jiu, as Miron 
Cosma demanded from them last Friday night.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Blackmailing of Ion Iliescu"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] and 
the Greater Romania Party [PRM] issued statements to the extent 
that they are freezing the negotiations with the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] on forming a coalition of the 
red pentagonal [five party ruling coalition of PDSR, PSM, PRM, 
the Romanian National Unity Party-PUNR, and the Agrarian 
Democratic Party of Romania-PDAR]. In a more explicit manner 
(PSM) and a more discreet one (PRM), the two members of the 
majority coalition let it be understood that they are ready to 
question their further backing of the current government in 
Parliament. Despite the fact that the two statements are issued 
by different persons, they are quite similar. In fact, the 
similarity is so striking, that it becomes obvious that we are 
dealing here with a concerted action of the two parties, or 
better said of the two outstanding Ceausescu apologists in the 
respective political groupings: [PSM Vice President] Adrian 
Paunescu for the PSM and [PRM President] Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
for the PRM. Both texts are dominated by a lyrical style. In 
this respect, they are not so much official statements, as 
elegies. At least PRM's letter, through its size and sighs, is 
reminiscent of Alecu Russo's "Song to Romania." As far as both 
PSM and PRM are concerned, the two statements are a good 
opportunity for a little demagoguery. In the case of PSM, it is 
slightly more temperate. It is quite likely that the text 
written by Adrian Paunescu was retouched by the pragmatic 
politician Tudor Mohora [PSM vice president]. However, PSM's 
letter reaches some unheard of peaks of electoral demagoguery. 
The party leadership does not limit itself to stating that it is 
freezing the negotiations with the PDSR; it also feels the need 
to present, under signature, a picture of the current Romanian 
society that smacks of the kind of proletarian cultism that even 
Ana Pauker and Iosif Chisinevschi [post-World War II Stalinist 
leaders of Romania] would have been ashamed of. The letter 
talks about old people scavenging through garbage cans for food, 
while the rich are dancing and partying at will. It is obvious 
that the initiator and author of the letter forgets that the 
paupers he weeps for include the peasants of Butimanu village, 
whose land was taken away from them by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. 
Likewise, Corneliu Vadim Tudor ignores the fact that he himself 
is one of the newly rich, who are spending their time moving 
from one binge to another. If it could talk, the rooms of 
"Select" restaurant [patronized by PRM officials] would have a 
lot to say in this respect. 
  The two statements also have the same goal in common. Both 
the PSM and PRM criticize the PDSR and President Ion Iliescu 
because the latter do not take steps against certain people who 
are considered as deadly enemies of the two parties. From the 
PSM letter we learn that an agreement has been reached with the 
PSM to replace [Defense Minister] General Niculae Spiroiu. If 
we take into account a previous article by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, 
from which we learn that Adrian Paunescu has asked the minister 
of national defense not to draft his son for military service, 
we immediately realize why a whole party is trying so hard to 
overthrow Niculae Spiroiu. The minister of national defense has 
pissed off Adrian Paunescu because he did not agree to do the 
PSM vice president this service. Something that Adrian Paunescu 
was not prepared to tolerate, particularly since the minister of 
defense during Ceausescu's reign had acceded to his request not 
to draft him in the army. Mind you, this happened at a time 
when even Nicu Ceausescu was forced to do his military service. 
In its turn, PRM is very mad at Ion Iliescu because he did not 
immediately order the arrest of Niculae Spiroiu, Petre Roman 
[president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front], 
Traian Basescu [former minister of transport and deputy of the 
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)], and Traian 
Chebeleu [Ion Iliescu's spokesman]. Not because the latter were 
guilty of something, but because they dared to contradict 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor. We are obviously dealing here with an 
ordinary attempt to blackmail Ion Iliescu. As I said, Adrian 
Paunescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor are behind the two statements. 
Two profiteers of the Ceausescu regime, who in the previous 
system have become accustomed to having all their absurd whims 
satisfied, including the wishes to topple various public people 
only because they had at one point had the temerity to stand up 
to them. The two statements are a new proof of the huge 
proportions to which certain Ceausescu apologists were blown up 
in these trouble times.

  [Text] The Hague, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Macedonian Foreign 
Minister Stevo Crvenkovski stressed here Tuesday [22 February] 
that his country was prepared to hold negotiations with Greece 
on all aspects of embargo-tainted bilateral relations. 
  The offer, repeating a similar one made Monday, came hours 
after the European Commission sent a letter to Athens demanding 
an explanation for the controversial trade blockade it imposed 
last week against the Former Yugoslav Republic. Crvenkoski said 
Skopje had never called for an end to negotiations with Athens 
and was "ready to continue them at any time." 
  Crvenkoski, who is on a two-day official visit to the 
Netherlands, said his country was ready to talk over "all 
aspects of bilateral relations" to try to normalise links. 
"Nothing can be ruled out," he added. 
  The EC, currently headed by Greece in the revolving 
six-month 
presidency, is using a mixture of threats and offers of 
mediation to get Athens to abandon its hard-line policy, which 
poses an unprecedented problem for the 12-country union. 
  Tuesday's letter started a procedure which could end with 
the 
executive Commission taking Athens to the European Court of 
Justice. 
  The letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, 
signed 
by Commission President Jacques Delors, expressed "serious 
concern about the legality of the measures taken by the Greek 
Government" and asked it to indicate what measures it would take 
to resolve the situation. 
  Athens last week blocked all trade to Macedonia [the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] through the 
northeastern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the 
country's imports including oil, and subsequently tightened the 
blockade to include frontier posts. 
  Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual 
provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims 
that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek 
province of the same name. 
  Most of Greece's European Community partners recognised 
Macedonia before Greece took over the EC presidency in January.

  [Text] Skopje, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A European Union delegation 
headed by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van der Broek arrived here 
Wednesday to mediate a dispute sparked after Greece slapped a 
trade blockade on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  Van der Broek was to meet with Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov before heading to Athens where he was to try to 
persuade Greek officials to lift their eight-day blockade 
against the former Yugoslav republic. 
  Greece's partners in the 12-member European Union have 
threatened to take Athens before the European Court of Justice 
unless the dispute is resolved. 
  Athens announced on February 16 that it was blocking all 
trade to Macedonia through the northeastern Greek port of 
Salonika, which handles most of the country's imports including 
oil. 
  Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual 
provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims 
that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek 
province of the same name. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said Wednesday that 
Athens wishes to have good relations with Macedonia but the 
latter must accept the "logical" demands made by the Greek 
Government.
