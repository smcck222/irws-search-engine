  [Text] At the Greek border point Evzoni, on the 
Macedonian-Greek border, numerous trucks still remain blocked by 
the Greek authorities, due to the trade embargo. 
  For already the fifth day, cargo vehicles from Macedonia 
[The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], but also from a 
number of European Union member states, are waiting to exit 
Greece. The measure introduced by the Greek Government have 
grounded vehicles transporting a range of goods. 
  What will happen to them will be known after the European 
Union meeting, as there are no official explanations from the 
Greek side, which only adds to the indignation of the drivers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Damovski: "Serbian Political </F>
Branch Office in Macedonia"] 
  [Text] After a brief "consolidation of its ranks," the new 
leadership of the Democratic Party of Serbs [DPS] in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], finally 
came out in public at a news conference for the Macedonian media 
(the first one was organized only for reporters of the press of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). And all of a sudden, in 
conformity with a political beginning aimed at impressing its 
membership that it is "resolute in the struggle for the rights 
of the disadvantaged Serbs in Macedonia," we heard accusations 
and threats from the new DPS leadership. 
  At the news conference held two days ago by the DPS leaders 
there was an overwhelming wish to be provocative, to express 
hatred for the country where they live and work (except for 
party president Dragisa Miletic, who works in Pristina). The 
Serbian media and the DPS leaders in Macedonia are consistent in 
using the temporary name of Macedonia in the United Nations. 
For them, the only legitimate president of the Serbian people 
everywhere is Slobodan Milosevic. In the event of war on the 
territory of Macedonia the DPS would call for the defense of 
only Serbian property and the orthodox brothers "who deserve 
it." Moreover, in accordance with its ambition to be the only 
legitimate representative of the interests of the Serbian 
national minority in Macedonia, the DPS has already studied the 
possible reaction of the Serbs in the country to possible NATO 
air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- attacks against the U.S. 
troops in the state. "The problem of reintroducing the Serbs 
and Montenegrins in the Constitution is burning slowly, but it 
could easily become a conflagration that could consume all of 
us." This was the first threat conveyed by the DPS to the 
Macedonian public. The second went like this: "We shall wait a 
while longer, and then the people will have to decide what 
happens then." Once again in the name of the people, one of the 
DPS hawks Stojan Trajkovic said: "Any use of the territory for 
intervention in former Bosnia-Herzegovina will be lethal for the 
FYR Macedonia." 
  Well-known threats, well-known propositions and the twisting 
of facts... but in the spirit of the chosen recipe of the policy 
of our northern neighbor -- Serbia. There was a short-lived 
shift of the party's policy to take account of the actual 
situation in the country where this political subject is 
registered, and then the activities resulted in personnel 
changes and shifts in the party's course toward northern 
political orientations. The previous DPS leadership succeeded 
in recognizing the peril of that orientation and changed its 
course and behavior in relation to the Macedonian authorities. 
The new leadership is again at the beginning of the road that 
repeatedly coincides, not by chance, with the new settlements of 
the Balkan situation. Whenever a settlement seemed near, one of 
the main roles was always played by the political leadership of 
Serbia which, despite the public manifestations of the DPS, 
apparently plays an important role in all that. The aim, once 
again, is very transparent and is to be expected from that type 
of politician -- apprentices. The Greek blockade has nothing to 
do with them, nor does the wish to destabilize Macedonia. For 
them Macedonia is the FYR Macedonia, but parallel with that, 
there is the strong wish to introduce Serbs and Montenegrins to 
the constitution of a state by the name of the Republic of 
Macedonia (although it is not yet clear whether as a national 
minority, a nationality, or certainly, as a people). For them, 
the fact that there are 300 U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means 
that Macedonia is "a U.S. protectorate and its puppet state." 
  All this would be welcome in moments of appropriate 
assistance to orthodox brothers in the "south Vardar regional 
unit" and in the reestablishment of the "interrupted orthodox 
vertical axis." 
  No matter where they may be on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia the "emotional Serbian people" are sensitive to 
injustice. The political leaders therefore have no choice. 
Until then, the provocations and irritations of everybody's 
emotions remain the main political strategy of these political 
branch offices.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Zbigniew Maria Wlosowicz, Poland's </F>
permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, by 
Sylwester Walczak; place and date not given: "Poland Supports 
Idea of Establishing a UN Army; Painful Burden of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina Drama"] 
  [Excerpts] [Walczak] What is your assessment of the 
results achieved by the first part of the 48th Session of the UN 
Assembly? What were the most important decisions that were made? 
  [Wlosowicz] If it were not for the painful burden of the 
drama of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the current session could be 
regarded as peaceful. An atmosphere of cooperation prevailed, 
even though a lot of emotions were stirred up by the 
negotiations on establishing the post of a high commissioner for 
human rights. There was even a point when reaching compromise 
on this controversial issue seemed impossible. And yet 
agreement was reached, which is another proof of ideological 
differences being less and less of an obstacle in the UN's 
functioning. Initiating a debate on reforms of the Security 
Council was another significant part of the session--for the 
first time, a general debate on the issue took place. 
  A unanimous lifting of economic sanctions against South 
Africa, with the hope of a permanent breaking with the apartheid 
phenomenon--that was a historical event. 
  From Poland's perspective, what is important is the fact 
that 
the concept of "countries of economies in a transitional period" 
obtained recognition in the UN vocabulary. We have initiated 
the idea. Until recently, Poland was classified as a developed 
country. That was perhaps nice but it was also impractical 
because it placed the country beyond the scope of assistance 
programs from which developing countries benefit. The 
recognition by the UN of the existence of a group of countries 
with economies in a transitional period, creates a much more 
advantageous situation for us. [passage omitted] 
  [Walczak] What is the fate of the initiative to establish a 
UN Center for Human Rights in East and Central Europe, which 
would be headquartered in Warsaw? 
  [Wlosowicz] The initiative was submitted by [former] Foreign 
Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski during a general debate in 
October of last year. The Foreign Ministry is working on coming 
up with a specific formula for the planned center, which could 
then be proposed to the international community. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Walczak] Some proposals have emerged that aimed at 
extending the list of the Security Council's permanent members, 
to also include Germany and Japan. Is there anyone to oppose 
that? Who are the other candidates? 
  [Wlosowicz] Indeed, even though the concerned countries 
themselves are acting with restraint, there are ever more views 
being raised to the effect that Germany and Japan, due to their 
political and economic positions, should be included in the 
Security Council as its permanent members. Practically 
speaking, no one is putting that in question anymore, and a 
consensus on that issue is emerging. 
  Yet the opening up of the Security Council to new members 
gives rise to another problem: Who else should be included? 
All regions would like to see their representatives as the 
Security Council's permanent members. Separate from that, 
proposals are being voiced to extend the Security Council to the 
level of 20-25 members. Poland does not oppose changes, 
generally speaking, but its view is that the interest of the 
countries of East and Central Europe should also be taken into 
account in the process of restructuring the Security Council. 
Debate on this issue is just beginning, and no one actually has 
a rigid position on it. [passage omitted] 
  [Walczak] What is your position on the proposal to 
establish a 10,000-strong UN army? The initiative was submitted 
by a commission set up by the U.S. Congress, whose goal is to 
examine possible ways of reforming the UN. Is the proposal 
realistic? Perhaps what would be more realistic is the 
establishment by the individual countries of special units of 
rapid deployment that would be ready for action immediately once 
a signal from the UN came in. What is Poland's position on that 
issue? 
  [Wlosowicz] Poland supports the idea of establishing forces 
that would be at the disposal of the secretary general. The 
shape these forces will take and the way they will function are 
the subject of proceedings of a team that has been established 
especially for that purpose and that also includes a Polish 
staff military officer. Eighty countries, including Poland, 
expressed their readiness to form units to participate in such 
forces. Right now, the biggest problem is not so much a lack of 
volunteers to participate in permanent UN forces as reservations 
being made by many countries concerning the secretary general's 
discretion applied in each case regarding whether the countries' 
units should be deployed. That could place a serious limitation 
on the efficiency of future permanent UN forces. On the other 
hand, the countries' concern for their own troops is 
understandable. 
  [Walczak] Is a change of the peacekeeping operations' 
formula possible without close participation by the United 
States? As is well known, the Americans do not participate in 
operations by the "Blue Helmets" because they follow the rule 
that U.S. soldiers cannot serve under a foreign commander (the 
U.S. troops in Somalia act outside of the structure of UN 
forces). During his speech at the General Assembly, President 
Bill Clinton stated that future peacekeeping operations will 
have to meet some strictly defined criteria in order for the 
Americans to participate in them. Doesn't that mean that the 
United States is unwilling to take part in peacekeeping 
operations? 
  [Wlosowicz] We are witnessing increased involvement by the 
United States not only in direct participation but also in an 
active formulation of a new concept of "peacekeeping." This 
process was initiated as early as during the last period of the 
previous [U.S.] administration. Right now, we are witnessing 
many U.S. initiatives, including informal ones, like the 
"contact group for peacekeeping operations," which discussed 
some practical aspects of those initiatives. 
  We should keep in mind that the United States will always be 
interested in peacekeeping operations. That is because 
practically one-third of the expenditures associated with each 
of those operations comes from U.S. taxpayers. Therefore, 
President Clinton's statement should be perceived mainly as an 
expression of concern about the operations' goal and 
effectiveness, and only secondarily as a need by the UN to 
fulfill formal requirements enabling U.S. troops to participate 
in peacekeeping operations. 
  [Walczak] The permanent representation you have been in 
charge of for a year now is famous for its significant political 
and cultural activity, also beyond the UN. How do you manage to 
take care of all of the ingredients of this responsible job? 
  [Wlosowicz] I perceive my mission in very broad terms, and 
that is also the way I perform it. We must keep in mind that we 
continue to be at the stage of creating a new image of Poland 
abroad. So I use every possible opportunity to contribute to 
that goal. The UN is firmly placed in the realities of U.S. 
political, economic, and cultural life, and that is why I 
frequently take part in other forums. Apart form that, the 
United States is also a country with a huge and influential 
group of people of Polish origin. There is never too much 
contact with them.

  [Text] Warsaw, 18 February--On 18 February, three linked 
Sejm commissions--administration and internal affairs, 
agriculture and the food economy, and town and country 
planning--unanimously adopted the report of the internal affairs 
minister on the implementation of the law of 24 March 1992 on 
the acquisition of property by foreigners. 
  According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], the 
number of applications presented and permits granted--in 
particular the total quantity of land--gives no cause for social 
concern. In 1990, the permits for the purchase of land related 
to 398 hectares, in 1991 to 534 hectares, and in 1992 to 705 
hectares. In the view of representatives of the Internal 
Affairs Ministry, the law allows "in principle for the securing 
of the interests of the Polish Republic." 
  In 1992, there ensued an increase in the number of 
applications for the granting of permits for the purchase of 
immovable assets by foreigners. There were 1,940 applications 
received (1,573 in 1991). A treasury fee is charged for the 
issuance of a permit, and the state Treasury altogether received 
the joint sum of 10.6 billion zlotys on this account. Two years 
ago, the MSW issued a total of 112 refusals to grant a permit 
for the purchase of immovable assets in Poland (31 in 1991). 
  As was reported, the largest number of permits was issued to 
foreigners from the FRG, the former USSR, Sweden, and the United 
States. Among the companies with foreign capital participation, 
the greatest number of permits was issued to enterprises with 
the participation of capital from Germany, the Netherlands, 
Austria, the United States, and Italy. Foreigners most 
willingly buy land situated in the Opole, Gdansk, Katowice, and 
Warsaw Voivodships.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today the Sejm rejected the presidential 
constitutional proposals. The president's press spokesman, 
Andrzej Drzycimski, acknowledged this to be a conflict between 
the party-dominated parliament and the president, who wanted to 
make it possible for all political forces and citizens to have a 
real role in the discussion on the Constitution. Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Oleksy addressed the statement by Andrzej Drzycimski 
during a news conference: 
  [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not think Poland needs any new 
conflict at the top, and Poles expect good cooperation from all 
of the highest bodies in authority in the state, a good mutual 
understanding of the matters that are most important for Poland, 
and not conflicts, collisions, rancor, and resentment. I wish 
to express a deep conviction that this sort of judgement 
expressed in the name of the president is an emotional judgement 
in association with the decision of parliament, and that it will 
not cast a shadow on the hitherto good cooperation between the 
president and the Sejm. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said in Czestochowa 
that Poland did not need a war at the top. This was his comment 
on the conflict between the president and parliament caused by 
the Sejm's rejection of Lech Walesa's proposal concerning the 
procedure of passing the Constitution. 
  [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not accept that a war at the 
top has started. I am opposed to this. I think that the 
president, whose spokesman's statement in a way sent a signal 
about such war, will think as I do and will make efforts to 
achieve harmonious cooperation between parliament and the 
president. Because, I stress, Poland does not need a war at the 
top. There have already been too many and they have spoiled too 
much. Poland needs reconciliation and common understanding in 
order to resolve problems of millions of people. [passage

  [Text] Michal Strak, the head of the Council of Ministers 
office, commenting on Lech Walesa's strong reaction to the 
Sejm's rejection of the presential draft laws regarding the 
so-called citizens' initiative on the Constitution, said that 
the president's officials had prepared this initiative badly and 
no one from the Belweder had discussed the draft with the Polish 
Peasant Party's parliamentary floor group. 
  Strak was speaking at a news conference in Gdansk. Earlier, 
Minister Strak held a meeting with students--members of the 
Political Ideas Club [Klub Mysli Politycznej]. During this 
meeting, he said, among other things, that his favorite hero was 
General Kutuzov, who, he said, slept during political and 
wartime debates but always woke up at the right moment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, minister and chief of the </F>
Office of the Council of Ministers, URM, by Malgorzata Subotic; 
place and date not given: "Spectacle for a Connoisseur"] 
  [Text] [Subotic] What actually happened to have caused 
this sharp kind of conflict after 100 days of what would seem on 
the surface a harmonious functioning of the coalition? 
  [Strak] I would put it another way: The fact that so far, on 
the surface, these conflicts were not visible means we are 
ruling the country in a responsible manner. Being in power is 
not about taking the advice of your neighbor with every conflict 
that might occur. 
  [Subotic] But the matter has already happened.... 
  [Strak] And it is done with. It is over now. 
  [Subotic] Exactly. Do you expect a counterattack on the part 
of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]? 
  [Strak] There was no attack in the first place, so there 
will be no counterattack. Some differences became visible, but 
to those who were watching the arrangement from the inside, it 
was no big surprise. First, it was wrong to assume at the 
beginning of the Cabinet's term that this will be a coalition 
where everything will go very smoothly, or that the slogan 
"Let's love each other" will be the coalition's leading slogan. 
This coalition consists of two independent political bodies. 
Each of them has its own history, its own problems, and its own 
political foundations. So there can naturally occur 
divergences, but I think the will to act together is stronger 
than those divergences. A coalition is a kind of contract. 
  [Subotic] But was there not a breach of this contract in the 
"Kawalec-Borowski case" [former Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec 
who was dismissed, and former Finance Minister Borowski who 
resigned]? 
  [Strak] The outcome demonstrates that there is agreement 
over such a solution. 
  [Subotic] And what kind of solution is that? 
  [Strak] We are waiting for a candidate for the post of 
deputy prime minister and finance minister. 
  [Subotic] Does it mean it will be just one person? 
  [Strak] That is up to the SLD. 
  [Subotic] You said one could have expected from the 
beginning that there would emerge differences between the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD.... 
  [Strak] The differences that emerged were not only between 
the PSL and the SLD but also within each of the two structures. 
That is a new element compared to the Sejm of the previous 
term. Back then, the main emotions were associated with 
interparty relationships. Right now, the focus of the emotions 
is being shifted "inside." We were aware from the beginning 
that the government's biggest problems would not be with Sejm 
deputy clubs or opposition parties, because they are definitely 
weaker, but with its own basis of support. 
  [Subotic] Meaning? 
  [Strak] It will be much harder for us than for our 
predecessors to come to agreement within the coalition. 
  [Subotic] What is the essence of the heterogeneity within 
the PSL? 
  [Strak] The PSL's situation is perhaps better than that of 
the SLD, even though there can occur different assessments of 
our policies vis-a-vis rural areas. Theoretically, it is 
possible to have a view that we are not doing enough for those 
areas. But other people in turn say we are doing too much. 
There is nothing wrong with having such differences of opinion. 
The only question is: How are these differences eliminated? 
Does it not happen in a way that would endanger the cabinet's 
stability? 
  [Subotic] From that standpoint, what is your assessment of 
the manner in which the coalition crisis was terminated? 
  [Strak] The coalition's stability remained unshaken, and, 
from that standpoint, one can say that the parties' leaderships 
demonstrated sufficient effectiveness. 
  [Subotic] Who demonstrated greater, as you put it, 
effectiveness? 
  [Strak] I would not make any distinctions. We put an end to 
the conflict together. 
  [Subotic] So there are no winners or losers? 
  [Strak] That is right, there are not. The interpretations 
that appeared in newspapers were written by people who are on 
the outside. It is their right to think this or that, but it is 
the governing arrangement that comes out as the only and common 
winner--it continues to function. If it were to collapse, that 
would be a common defeat. 
  [Subotic] Do you really believe, in accordance with what a 
joint communique had declared, that the governing PSL-SLD 
coalition is destined to last four years? 
  [Strak] You know, there are many people who would like us to 
last that long. If one assumes that the arrangement is not 
fixed but that it is going to undergo various 
convulsions--meaning that there will be thunder coming from the 
volcano but the volcano will not erupt--it is possible to 
maintain the arrangement for four years. Flexibility is 
indispensable. 
  [Subotic] What could prevent this four-year scenario from 
materializing? 
  [Strak] A sudden outbreak of social discontent. 
  [Subotic] On the basis of research and analyses conducted by 
the government, can it be concluded that such an outbreak is 
very likely? 
  [Strak] Not right now. We will rather witness some local 
conflicts and ones limited to specific groups. 
  [Subotic] Perhaps you have an idea for an alternative 
governing coalition with the PSL's participation? 
  [Strak] Theoretically speaking, other coalitions are 
possible. But, from a realistic standpoint, there are no 
alternative solutions for the nearest future. This lack of 
other solutions should last about four years. Incidentally 
speaking, it is my observation that society is no longer 
interested in politics per se. What it wants is normalcy and 
peace, not spectacles. After the four years during which the 
nation suffered various setbacks, what society wants right now 
is that those whom it had elected be in power for some time to 
come. And if they rule efficiently, they will be reelected. 
  [Subotic] Yet you did show precisely this kind of political 
spectacle for several days. 
  [Strak] I had meetings with Sejm deputies during this, as 
you put it, spectacle. What is interesting is that not a single 
question about it was asked. So it was a spectacle for a very 
small group of connoisseurs. Politics is a bit like an 
automobile: You get interested in how it works only when it 
begins to break down. 
  [Subotic] And this particular automobile, to use your 
metaphor, has not yet begun to break down? 
  [Strak] Perhaps something was escaping from the exhaust pipe 
with too much noise. But I think society had a feeling that 
everything that was happening did not present a danger of the 
vehicle coming to a halt. 
  [Subotic] You did not fear even for a moment that the 
coalition would collapse? 
  [Strak] Not even for a moment. It is like in a marriage: 
Even if you have an argument with your husband, that does not 
mean you will immediately want to get a divorce. 
  [Subotic] "Getting rid of Strak" was one of the SLD's 
preconditions during the conflict. Can the SLD have something 
against you? 
  [Strak] You should ask it about that. 
  [Subotic] My question was: Can the SLD "have something 
against you"? 
  [Strak] I cannot be the judge in my own case. 
  [Subotic] What is actually the story with local governors 
[wojewodowie]? 
  [Strak] All of the local governors that replaced the 
previous ones were approved of in a double way: by both the PSL 
and the SLD, except for one case. At this point, there are 
indeed some more new local governors coming from the PSL. 
  [Subotic] So far, you have dismissed 19 local governors. 
How many more of them do you intend to replace? 
  [Strak] In accordance with the rules of the game, one does 
not disclose one's plans. An old and experienced politician 
once told me that you should not utter a word until the decision 
is "officially in." 
  [Subotic] With regard to the issue of local governors, why 
do you succumb to local party organizations, primarily the PSL? 
  [Strak] It would be hard to call it succumbing. Perhaps I 
have a better understanding than others of a need that has 
emerged after the most recent elections: For the whole 
arrangement to function efficiently, what is needed is 
harmonious cooperation among the government, local governors, 
and political power centers in voivodships [administrative 
units]. If the harmony can be introduced without replacing a 
local governor, I am very satisfied. But if it is not possible 
to avoid a replacement, then to maintain the disharmony for some 
time period would be bad for everyone. Parliamentary democracy 
has its own rules: One cannot limit the functioning of parties 
only to the central level. After all, these parties have their 
own structures, which means also their own interests, at the 
level of voivodships. 
  [Subotic] So they must be given prizes? 
  [Strak] It is not an issue of prizes but one of realistic 
participation in ruling the country. 
  [Subotic] So you see no danger whatsoever of local party 
structures really determining who should be appointed voivode? 
  [Strak] It is too early to talk about it or to disclose 
details of decisions that are being made. But to say that local 
party agencies determine everything is an oversimplification. 
There have been a great many such oversimplifications. But it 
is a fact that we have granted the local structures the right to 
come up with their candidates for the posts of voivodes. 
  [Subotic] Has it ever happened that someone was appointed 
voivode than what the local structures "came up with"? 
  [Strak] Yes, it has. 
  [Subotic] When was that? 
  [Strak] I do not want to go into that, but I can guarantee 
you that it really has happened. And, from among the 
more-than-10 newly appointed local governors, practically only 
one failed to obtain a positive opinion from local 
self-governments. Even though we have allowed our party 
authorities throughout voivodships to influence the process of 
appointing local governors, it turned out that they are 
sufficiently good candidates to have gained the support of local 
self-governments. I should add that majorities within these 
local self-governments are, after all, composed of supporters of 
other political parties. 
  [Subotic] You once said: Seeing the way Solidarity is in 
power, I am convinced the time will come for the PSL. 
  [Strak] As early as in 1989, when the revolution was just 
beginning, during a meeting with activists for the United 
Peasant Party, someone asked the question of whether the party 
will manage to defend itself. I replied then that it is not 
possible for a social group as large as peasants not to come up 
with their own political representation. A need for the PSL was 
widely felt. All that was left after that was the issue of 
political efficiency. 
  [Subotic] But why did the others who wanted to lead the 
peasant movement fail--for instance, Gabriel Janowski and Jozef 
Slisz? 
  [Strak] We simply proved better. They were not capable of 
adopting down-to-earth positions: They talked too much and they 
were not doing enough. 
  [Subotic] Let us return to the coalition issues. Does Sejm 
Deputy Pek express the PSL's position on privatization well? 
  [Strak] Sejm Deputy Pek is the chairman of the Sejm 
Ownership Transformations Commission; he has access to materials 
that he studies and analyzes. 
  [Subotic] But you did not answer my question. 
  [Strak] I think there is no need to identify the PSL's 
position with that of Sejm Deputy Pek. By the same token, one 
could ask a question on whether measures undertaken by me 
regarding local governors reflect the PSL's position well. 
  [Subotic] Do they? 
  [Strak] There is definitely a correlation, even though there 
is no unanimity, strictly speaking. If you talked to my 
colleagues, I am sure you would hear as many positive 
assessments as critical ones of what I do. 
  [Subotic] But isn't it the case that the negative views 
prevail? 
  [Strak] Perhaps they do, but not as much as to manifest 
themselves in organizational measures. 
  [Subotic] How would you comment on the view that you are 
Pawlak's Wachowski? 
  [Strak] All I can do is have a laugh at that.

  [Text] The government, which today discussed the strike 
situation, has called on Solidarity to negotiate social 
guarantees for employees threatened by unemployment. At the 
same time, the Council of Ministers emphasized that the draft 
budget, which is soon to be approved by the Sejm, cannot be 
changed. A complete freeze on energy price rises is also 
impossible. 
  [Reporter Marek Kupis] Industry Minister Marek Pol said the 
government agreed with Solidarity's basic demand for an increase 
in real pay. He added that the strike in the mining and steel 
industries, announced by Solidarity, could weaken the economic 
position of these enterprises. 
  [Marek Pol] "This could very strongly affect the weak 
economy 
of the mining sector. That is apart from the issue of energy 
security of the state. We all depend on energy; we all depend 
on coal. This could very strongly affect the entire Polish 
industry and what all employees at all enterprises are going to 
feel." 
  [Kupis] Labor Minister Leszek Miller has called on the trade 
unionists to hold talks and halt strike actions. 
  [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] "If the Solidarity trade 
unionists decide to discuss the housing reform program, social 
benefits, problems of unemployment, or other issues that are 
vital for thousands of Polish families, I can confirm again that 
there is an open place at the negotiating table." 
  [Kupis] According to Public Opinion Research Center 
research, 
in September one Pole in four thought that the situation in the 
country was going in the right direction. In November, there 
were 20 percent more optimists. But in February the level of 
optimism fell below that of September. 
  [Miller] "Well, the honeymoon is slowly coming to an end. I 
am thinking of good relations with the government and an influx 
of public expectations. This, as far as I remember, applies to 
every government team. And now the dull daily life begins." 
  [Kupis] Ministers maintain that the government will now have 
to prove that the election slogans about an economic policy with 
a human face were not merely empty promises.

<F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Lentowicz: "Unwanted Immigrant May Fly </F>
Away"] 
  [Text] Internal Affairs Minister Andrzej Milczanowski 
announces that as early as March we will try to send back the 
first "cumbersome" foreigners by plane. In line with the 
ministry's estimates, there would be at least 1,000 unwanted 
immigrants. "We know where they are, what they are doing, what 
their origin is; after all, this is what the police is for," 
says Longin Beirzanek, a high-ranking officer at the Main 
Headquarters. "It is theoretically possible to start a 
deportation action," he adds; "however, it would have to be 
precisely coordinated by the police, the voivodship 
administration, and the border troops. Otherwise, we might see 
a situation which has already taken place in Gdansk; there were 
talks with a group of Romanian Gypsies, living in the city 
refuse dump; travel documentation was prepared, and even medical 
tests were made. However, the next day the Romanians 
disappeared--they most probably went to a neighboring voivodship. 
  "We still do not have an efficient system for the 
deportation 
of unwanted foreigners," reiterates Tomasz Kozlowski, director 
of the Office for Migration and Refugees in the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. The director is not even going to suggest 
that foreigners threaten to cause some kind of an apocalyptical 
catastrophe in Poland; he says, however, that every country must 
have an effective method of disposing of foreigners who do not 
respect the Polish law, for instance. However, the truth is 
that voivodes are rarely able to fully implement their own 
decisions concerning deportations. Kozlowski argues: "Certainly 
no one in the Polish Republic is going to plan any mass 
deportations; this is an absurd idea; all the same, the 
authorities must not be so helpless." 
  The police have forwarded nearly 40 deportation motions to 
the Zielona Gora voivode; in almost all cases, administrative 
visas were placed in the passports which obliged their owners to 
leave Poland by the shortest route. No one knows which routes 
those persons chose. Only six foreigners were escorted by a 
convoy: four to Okecie airport, two to the eastern border. In 
all, the expeditions cost 49 million zlotys. 
  In order to avoid such expenditures, the police in Zielona 
Gora increased supervision over foreigners arriving in the areas 
close to the border. Whenever a more numerous group appears, 
the functionaries immediately check their documents and 
scrupulously implement registration regulations. "No one can 
accuse us of persecuting anyone; however, after such a 
reception, the guests do not usually stay long," assures Wiktor 
Szopski of the Voivodship Police Headquarters, who is the author 
of this method. He suggested, however, that this danger not be 
exaggerated. In the Zielona Gora Voivodship, which is located 
on the immigration route, there are not more than tens of 
so-called cumbersome foreigners. Last year guests from abroad 
committed 116 offenses here, of which at least 30 percent were 
road offenses. In these statistics first are the Ukrainians, 
followed by the Germans. "This is really not much," say 
Szopski. The Szczecin voivode issued 120 administrative visas 
last year; he already deported 18 foreigners. According to the 
voivode's spokesperson Maria Bartczak, the problem has not 
reached a level which would be alarming to the voivode. Lublin 
Police Spokesperson Andrzej Przemyski is not as optimistic. 
According to him, the present deportation procedure is 
unacceptable: Within 48 hours the entire case must be completed, 
even though it takes a lot of time to merely establish the 
identity of the detained person; it is common for them to 
destroy their documents. The police in Lublin has already 
prepared its own deportation arrest location (there will be 20 
such places all over Poland); however, it is not certain whether 
this arrest location will be used: some provisions of the 1991 
Law on Foreigners have been queried by the Constitutional 
Tribunal; it did not agree that the state administration be 
given the right to send people to closed places. The verdict of 
the judges of the Constitutional Tribunal was then confirmed by 
the Sejm; now we must wait for deputies to meet their commitment 
and amend the law soon. The amendment bills aim at 
strengthening the supervision over the cases of detainment 
related to deportation, by giving the right of supervision to 
the prosecutors' offices. 
  Only when the new law is passed will we be able to think 
about establishing a center where deported foreigners--with 
their families--would be able to wait until the procedure is 
completed; in line with the agreement on readmission, signed by 
Poland, this procedure allows for appropriate international 
agreements. Longin Bierzanek believes that it would be best if 
such a center were located in the center of Poland, near Warsaw, 
where it is only a short distance to the airport at Okecie and 
to the interested embassies. 
  Last year voivodes made over 1,000 decision on deporting 
foreigners; only 617 unwanted foreigners were escorted by 
convoys to the border. According to police estimates, it would 
not be unfounded to deport from Poland at least 2,000 most 
cumbersome Gypsies, among whom many cases of tuberculosis were 
detected, and just as many foreigners from the east, who make 
deals conflicting with the Polish law. "If the Romanians were 
sent with escort to their homeland, they would not survive the 
winter there," protest Poles in the committees for defending 
Gypsies in Poznan.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The UN came "very, 
very close" to ordering air power against warring parties in 
Bosnia Tuesday [22 February] after five UN soldiers were wounded 
when a mortar shell struck their tank, a senior UNPROFOR 
official said here. 
  General Jean Cot, commander of the United Nations Protection 
Force in ex-Yugoslavia, told journalists that "it is only 
because there was no absolute means of determining the origin of 
the shell that it was not possible to use the (North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation) air force." 
  An official at UNPROFOR headquarters here told AFP that "we 
came very, very close to using air power." [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian 0900 GMT 23 February reports the 
following situation in the republic: 
  "Powerful assaults by the chetnik and ustasha criminals on 
the free Maglaj territory have been going on since 0730 [0630 
GMT] this morning," Hajrudin Sermic, the correspondent from 
Maglaj, reports. "In the southern sector of defense, the 
chetnik and ustasha forces have been attempting a tank-infantry 
breakthrough in the region of [words indistinct]; northward in 
Plane, the chetniks are attacking from several directions. 
Several hundred artillery shells have been fired, but the 
knights of the 201st Brigade would not be taken by surprise. 
They adamantly repelled the attack, although new waves of 
attacks continue." 
  Civilian targets in the town and suburbs have also been 
exposed to intensive destruction by scores of tank and howitzer 
shells, as well as volley fire from mortar batteries. After 
extensive preparations and concentration of manpower lasting 
several days, a new, powerful offensive on Maglaj definitely 
began this morning. The commander of the criminal chetnik army 
Stankovic cries: "This is the beginning of the end for Maglaj 
and Mt. Ozren." So Sermic concludes his dispatch. 
  "Sporadic but powerful shelling of the defense lines of the 
free Brcko territory continues," reports Hamiz Deronjic, the 
correspondent for that area. "The enemy directed the fiercest 
mortar attacks yesterday and overnight at defenders' positions 
in the central part of the front and on the Kladje-Djukici line. 
A recoiless gun has opened fire on Djukici on several 
occasions. The chetnik guns situated in Potocari pounded 
central parts of Brcko's defense with [word indistinct] shells. 
More overflights of the enemy helicopters have been registered 
in the air corridor above Brcko over the last 24 hours."

  [Text] Horrendous attacks of the chetnik-ustasha forces 
along the entire separating line on the Maglaj front are 
intensifying by the hour. The chetniks and ustashas are 
receiving reinforcements from Zepce, Doboj, Prnjavor, and Mt. 
Ozren. This are definitely the most powerful attacks so far 
with only one goal -- to conquer Maglaj. 
  The fighters of the 201st [Hill] Brigade have halted their 
further advances toward the town. An appeal by the Maglaj War 
Presidency and the Command of the 201st Hill Brigade of the 
Bosnia- Herzegovina Army to the residents that they immediately 
and urgently place themselves on the rim of the town and prevent 
the enemy from capturing Maglaj has borne fruit. Volunteers, 
representatives of the civilian authorities, more than 50 
mothers, and even wounded soldiers are reporting to participate 
in the crucial battle for Maglaj. They could not be prevented 
in this even by the hundreds of artillery shells fired at the 
town and several dozens of civilian casualties. The Maglaj is 
being defended heroically from the heart for who knows how long.

  [Text] The press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
advises that the presence of the Russian arms has been 
increasing on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields. Beside some 
modified dated types of arms, some very modern arms have been 
arriving on this battlefield recently. At the end of January, a 
convoy consisting of eight trailers sent from Russia crossed 
onto Bosnia-Herzegovina territory near Raca, carrying arms for 
the needs of the aggressor's chetnik army. The trailers 
contained Elipton bombs -- most likely the arms that 
Zhirinovskiy referred to during his visit to the so-called 
Srpska republic, alleging that this was the new secret weapon of 
great destructive power -- a surface-to-air missile of unknown 
type, and antiaircraft guns of Russian manufacture. 
  When the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started in April 1992, 
the 
former Yugoslav Peoples' Army disposed of three missile 
surface-to- air systems, namely: SA-2 [Guideline], SA-3 [GOA], 
and SA-6 [Gainful]. We have received confirmation from several 
sources that the aggressor has strengthened its antiaircraft 
defense over Bosnia-Herzegovina considerably and introduced 
missile systems that not even the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army 
had before the war. All these systems are of Russian 
manufacture, namely: SA-8 [Gecko], SA-9 [Gaskin], and SA-14 
[NATO code name not known]. The SA-13 (Gopher] and SA-11 
[Gadfly] also form part of the aggressor's antiaircraft defense. 
These systems are supported from the territory of the so-called 
Yugoslavia by SA-12 [Gladiator] missiles. 
  A new missile antiaircraft system has appeared on Mount 
Bjelasnica and Mount Igman last year that was not identified. 
  The presence of a giant (Cumen) 240-mm caliber mortar, whose 
bombs weight 130 kg, has been observed at several places 
throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefield. The (Cumen) 
fires destructive chemical and nuclear bombs, which means that 
it does not use classic mortar grenades. Its barrel is 5.5 m 
long and its range is 9.5 kilometers. The giant weapon weighs 4 
tonnes. This mortar was also spotted in positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  Bearing in mind the number of destroyed tanks on this 
battlefield and the number of tanks held by the army of the 
so-called Srpska republic, it is evident that their hardware is 
regularly replenished. Tanks that had earlier not even formed 
part of the armament of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, for 
example, T-72 tanks, have appeared on this battlefield on 
several occasions. These tanks, which carried the colors, the 
markings, and the numbers of the Russian Army have also taken 
part in some of the battles, the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports. 
  Together with these arms, large contingents of men have been 
arriving who are servicing them and training members of the 
chetnik artillery units. It is also well known that contingents 
of fully armed and equipped mercenaries are arriving on the 
territory of the so-called Srpska republic at regular intervals. 
They are not stopped on the Russian border, nor are their 
equipment and arms seized, the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports.

  [Text] Novi Sad, Feb 22 (TANJUG) -- Aleksa Buha, the 
foreign minister of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS), said on 
Tuesday that the talks on reopening the airport in the Moslem 
enclave of Tuzla should shortly begin and that this had already 
been discussed with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin in Sarajevo. 
  "However, the conditions for reopening the airport cannot be 
those proposed by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe," because 
"his scenario for RS is unacceptable," Buha told Novi Sad radio. 
  Juppe has said that the west would even use force to reopen 
the Tuzla airport and threatened the Bosnian Serbs with NATO air 
strikes if they oppose this. 
  "Isn't the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum sufficient 
warning to Mr. Juppe," Buha asked. 
  NATO threatened to launch air strikes against the warring 
sides in Sarajevo unless they withdraw their heavy artillery 
around Sarajevo to 20 km or place them under U.N. control but, 
in practice, these threats were directed against the local Serbs 
only. 
  However, the Bosnian Serbs started pulling out their heavy 
weaponry from around Sarajevo on Friday only at the initiative 
of Moscow and after it guaranteed to deploy its U.N. troops 
along the separation line with the Moslems. 
  The Bosnian Serb Republic agrees to reopen the Tuzla airport 
only if it receives guarantees that it will not be used to 
supply the Moslems with arms.

Sarajevo with Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, 
Aleksa Buha, the Serb Republic's (RS) foreign minister, told 
Novi Sad radio today. 
  "However, the opening of Tuzla airport will be permitted 
under the conditions somewhat different from those proposed by 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, for his scenario is 
unacceptable for the RS. The French foreign minister has 
clearly indicated the West would like to apply the Sarajevo 
recipe, in the form of a NATO ultimatum, in the case of Tuzla 
airport. Was the experience of the Sarajevo ultimatum not 
sufficient for Mr Juppe?", Buha said.

  [Text] The chetnik shelling of the region around Tuzla is 
continuing. Last night and all today the Mt. Majevica chetniks 
have been pounding Vukovije and Dubrave with heavy artillery. 
They are firing the shells from the area of Poljanice on Mt. 
Majevica, and they have destroyed or badly damaged some dozen 
houses in Vukovije and Dubrave. It is obvious that the 
criminals from Mt. Majevica are showing that they are ready to 
fire at [Tuzla's] Dubrave Airport, which the world wants to open. 
  The general alarm has been sounded three times in Tuzla, and 
it is still in force. 
  Everything that has been happening around Tuzla these days 
shows that the decisions of the international community that 
Tuzla become a protected area are for the chetniks only a dead 
letter.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The international community 
has tolerated massive violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in Bosnia-Hercegovina, according 
to a strongly-worded United Nations report released Tuesday. 
  "The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in particular in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have once again proved that human rights only 
play a secondary role in the context of international politics," 
the latest report by the UN Human Rights Commission's special 
rapporteur commented. 
  Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the former Polish prime minister who has 
been compiling reports on former Yugoslavia since August 1992, 
said humanitarian efforts had not compensated for what he termed 
"political inertia" and called for the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) to be allowed to intervene more actively. 
  "A number of formal steps which have been undertaken may be 
considered as a substitute or excuse for political inertia.... 
The enormous efforts and sacrifices of the field officers of 
the various international agencies have not compensated for that 
policy," he argued. 
  "Such a policy undermines some of the most fundamental 
principles upon which international law and the system of human 
rights protection have been built," he concluded. 
  Mazowiecki acknowledged that he had not been able to achieve 
his main objectives of offering effective assistance to victims 
and of reducing the massive scale of the violations of human 
rights and urged that UNPROFOR be given a more active mandate. 
  "UNPROFOR forces have not been effectively empowered to 
intervene to protect against human rights violations as they 
occur and have been forced to observe passively many serious 
breaches of international humanitarian law owing to the 
inadequacy of their mandate and resources." 
  He particularly accused Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats of 
exploiting humanitarian aid "as an element in a political game." 
  Although aid continues to get through by road, there are 
frequently massive delays at Bosnian Serb checkpoints, he noted. 
  He also denounced the plan for Bosnia put forward last 
September by the international mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg 
(UN) and Lord Owen (European Community), saying the proposals 
for partition represented "an absolute repudiation" of his most 
basic recommendations. 
  Mazowiecki, who published five reports last year, emphasised 
that "this warning has been ignored by the international 
community" and that all this time, ethnic cleansing has 
continued without any respite.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
correspondent Roger Horne in Washington on 22 February; 
Silajdzic speaks in English with superimposed German translation 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Horne] I am very glad to welcome the Bosnian prime 
minister here at N-TV. Dr. Silajdic, are you, after the talks 
you have held here in Washington today, and after the expiry of 
the ultimatum, more optimistic? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, the American involvement in this initiative 
gives us hope. We believe that Bosnia is a global issue. It 
must be viewed globally by the international community and, as 
far as that international community is concerned, the United 
States plays a leading role. We therefore believe that we are 
closer to a solution than before. 
  [Horne] How do you see the Russian involvement? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, I think they have tried to come in rather 
late to remain there in that theater. They were undoubtedly 
much more committed to the Serb side than we had expected. They 
are therefore lacking in objectivity in some cases, it has to be 
said. 
  [Horne] Are you nevertheless not very disappointed over the 
fact that NATO and the UN needed nearly 23 months for the 
ultimatum and that so many people had to die in the meantime? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, we have expressed our opinion about that. 
We think that whatever is lost in Bosnia also applies to the 
rest of the world. Much is at stake here -- democracy, human 
rights, humanity, in short, civilization. We believe it is time 
to state: better late than never. This applies to those forces 
in Bosnia that are fighting for democracy and against aggressive 
nationalism, which stand for order and do not embody chaos and 
dictatorship. We expected the world to help us fight this evil, 
but as I already said: better late than never. 
  [Horne] But, nevertheless, what are your expectations now? 
The fighting continues, heavy weapons encircle Tuzla, Bihac, 
Srebrenica, and Mostar? 
  [Silajdzic] We expect a peace settlement, a comprehensive 
peace settlement that would ultimately make it possible to 
withdraw those heavy weapons from the encircled towns in Bosnia. 
But the main issue is the establishment of a permanent peace, 
not an unjust, but a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
latter cannot consist in moving guns 20 km away, for Sarajevo 
and other towns remain besieged. The point is to establish 
peace without rewarding aggression and genocide. I stress this 
once again most strongly, for this is important, as we will 
otherwise serve as an example for future adventurers and petty 
dictatorships. 
  [Horne] Are you at all capable of still trusting people like 
Milosevic and Karadzic, or do you believe that only force can 
bring a peace agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] Trust people like them? I think they only 
recognize force, just like any classroom bully who understands 
only force. That is why we think that this NATO decision has 
made it quite clear that force works. 
  [Horne] Talking about force, did you receive any guarantees 
from the U.S. Government as far as the deployment of ground 
troops operating under the UN flag is concerned? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, within the implementation, yes. Because a 
serious implementation of the peace plan is not possible without 
international guarantees. I believe that the international 
community has much at stake in Bosnia. The implementation has 
to take place with full NATO support. The UN, more or less by 
decree, guarantees the status quo. It is neutral, whatever that 
means. This has proven counterproductive so far. For this 
reason we have to change the situation in Bosnia and other parts 
of Europe. What counts is the credible threat of force: that is 
now proved to be working. 
  [Horne] You have problems not just with the Bosnian Serbs 
but 
also with the Croats. There are efforts at present aimed at 
bringing the both of you back to the negotiating table together 
with the objective of creating a bloc against the Serbs. This 
has already been attempted, although in vain. 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, you're right. Why didn't it work? Because 
there was a basic assumption of the division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between the Serbs and Croats. This made 
agreement impossible, and the concept has to be changed 
entirely. This is not 1939, when Bosnia was divided between 
these two. There must be a very serious attempt to reconsider 
this concept and to accept the fact that Bosnia is not a 
territory for grabs, but a state and must be dealt with that way. 
  [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, what do expect in the 
humanitarian sector from Europe now, and more precisely from 
Germany? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have to continue that and 
I'm afraid that we are facing a dramatic humanitarian crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't want to be the welfare recipient, 
the international welfare recipient here. But we must consider 
that, because it is the guilt of the European nations that 
things happened this way. We had an arms embargo, we could not 
defend ourselves, so now they must have a welfare state on their 
hands. We will try to get out of this situation as soon as 
possible. As for Germany, they have taken care of a lot of our 
own people and we do appreciate that fact. 
  [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, many thanks and best wishes for 
the people in your country.

<F P=106> [Report by Omer Vatric from Mostar] </F>
  [Excerpt] Is peace closer to Mostar after Sarajevo? To 
judge by the frequent visits by international representatives, 
one would say that better days are ahead for Mostar. There is 
less and less firing in the city, and the talks on establishing 
an EC [European Community] administration over Mostar have been 
stepped up. 
  Last night (Albert Benabu), UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
head for civilian affairs, held talks with members of the Mostar 
War Presidency, while today they held two hours of talks with 
(Fernando Sanchez Rau), head of the Spanish mission, and (Morris 
Mono), head of the French mission. Smajl Kvaric and Alija 
Alikadic, representatives of the Mostar authorities, stressed 
that the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Mostar supported the 
efforts of the EC to establish an EC administration over Mostar, 
but under certain conditions, which they had detailed last night 
in a written reply to General (Bo Pelvas), special envoy of Mr. 
Stoltenberg. 
  These conditions are as follows: Mostar has to be an open 
city, and it cannot be a part of the Croatian republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, nor its capital; conditions have to be created for 
the return of the refugees and displaced people; in order for 
talks to continue with the Croatian side under international 
auspices, free entry of all humanitarian convoys has to be 
guaranteed, electricity has to be supplied to the eastern part 
of the city -- which has been without electricity for eight 
months -- water has to be restored, the Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo 
humanitarian corridor has to be opened, medical evacuation of 
the seriously wounded from the city has to be allowed, [word 
indistinct] hospitals, medical and civilian premises have to be 
respected, and all prisoners have to be released. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by D. Pejak: "The General Laughs at Rumors About </F>
Resignation"] 
  [Text] Jahorina, Feb -- General Ratko Mladic, commander of 
the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, has not 
appeared in public for some time. This has caused all sorts of 
speculation. Along the right bank of the Drina, "the well 
informed" were even saying that Mladic had resigned. In a 
conversation with our correspondent on Mt. Jahorina [near 
Sarajevo] recently, the general first laughed at that and then 
explained the reasons for his absence: 
  "I was not there because I was busy with obligations at the 
front. In this situation, I do not want to be very much present 
in public, because in this way, people get used to individuals. 
And there are some personalities who possess more authority, so 
let us rather have them in the public eye. I am doing my job as 
well as my knowledge, capabilities, abilities allow, together 
with my associates. What matters is that there are some evident 
results of this," Mladic said. 
  Replying to the observation that the term "withdrawal" is 
very much present in this war, Mladic said the following: 
  "Withdrawal has never brought luck to anybody. We have to 
free ourselves from the Serb syndrome that by withdrawing in 
1915 and 1916, we achieved our aims. I am not saying that this 
was right or wrong. However, in that war there were some sort 
of tactics and `stop-go' strategies. They experienced a 
disaster. One should only compare a withdrawal with this 
`stop-go' strategy and draw a conclusion. It is clear what 
should be done: One should only look straight ahead and walk 
straight on and up. I do not know what withdrawal means. 
Withdrawal can take place in a way at a moment when the war 
chaos in the regions of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
former Yugoslavia is settled by political means, when the 
hatchets are buried by those people who have dug them out and 
have set off to attack the Serbian people, when they withdraw 
their declaration of war on the Serbian people, when they 
express a real wish for peace and put their signature to it. 
Only then can we return our weapons to our barracks and get 
ready in case a new holocaust befalls the Serbian people."

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Feb (TANJUG) -- Two radars for the 
detection of the location of artillery fire have been flown to 
Sarajevo airport, TANJUG learned today from Belgrade UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] headquarters. 
  The radars will "cover" Mt. Igman and the territory 
northeast 
and southeast of Sarajevo and will be able to locate the 
positions from which the cease-fire is violated, it is learned 
at the Belgrade UNPROFOR headquarters. 
  UNPROFOR radio reports that after a long period of tension a 
certain sense of relief is felt today in Sarajevo and that 
General Michael Rose has said that the warring parties in the 
former Yugoslav Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] have placed 268 
artillery pieces under the "blue helmet's" control at nine 
locations.

  [Excerpts] The State Chamber today determined the funds 
for education and defense, which form integral parts of the 1994 
budget. Amendments to the Citizenship Law have been passed, too. 
Vesna Burnik reports: 
  [Begin Burnik recording] [passage omitted] Let us now 
concentrate on the most important decisions of today which will 
also have political consequences. 
  The funds for education are known -- 27.5 billion tolars 
will 
be spent over the next six years on educational buildings, 
improvement of computer literacy, textbooks, school food, and 
foreign languages. [passage omitted] 
  The State Chamber has irrevocably ruled that not more than 
76.6 billion tolars will be spent on investments in defense over 
the next 10 years. It was also decided that the Defense 
Ministry will be allowed to spend a maximum of 8.8. billion 
tolars per year. This decision was supported by present 
deputies of the United List, the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
Democratic Party, and the Ecological Party, who also opposed the 
government proposal of defense funds which would amount to 
slightly less than 85 billion tolars that will be mostly spent 
over five years. The government coalition has again split on 
this issue, as the Christian Democrats and Jansa's Social 
Democrats voted in favor of the government proposal and against 
the lower sum. [end recording]

  [Text] Following the vote on defense funding, [Defense 
Minister] Janez Jansa in his function as president of the Social 
Democratic Party sent an open letter to Dr. Janez Drnovsek, 
prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDS], in which he points out the violation of the principles 
and provisions of the coalition agreement. 
  In the letter he informs Dr. Drnovsek that during his visit 
to the South African Republic, LDS deputy Janez Kopac announced 
his opposition to the government amendment that increased the 
so-called Defense Tolar, and that defense funds have been capped 
by 6 billion tolars, which allowed the budget to remain within 
the limits outlined in the budget memorandum. 
  Jansa warns that the Social Democratic Party, besides some 
social demands, also made its support for the budget conditional 
on the passing of government amendments. The parliamentary 
decision -- enclosed with the letter is a computer printout of 
the vote -- in his words directly influences state's safety, 
social development, and the pace of drawing closer to the 
European Union and NATO. 
  On behalf of the Social Democratic Party, Jansa therefore 
asks Drnovsek whether the coalition agreement is still valid, 
that is to say, whether the LDS will propose changes. He also 
asks whether the coalition will withdraw the 1994 budget 
proposal and start a new coordination round or whether the 
entire procedure was merely a farce aimed at reducing defense 
funds as much as possible. He also asks Drnovsek about future 
measures to secure at least relatively normal functioning of the 
coalition. At the same time Jansa asks him to convene a meeting 
of all the coalition partner leaders as soon as possible.

Opatija, resisted this. For this reason the trawl was dropped 
into the sea and the boat was taken to Piran by force. 
  The policemen decided to impound the Croatian ship and 
prosecute the captain. The Croatian fishing boat probably 
trawled for the first time as there was no catch on the deck. 
  This morning a Piran magistrate judge levied a 70,000-tolar 
fine upon Vincekovic, which he refused to pay. The boat is thus 
still anchored in Piran Bay. 
  This incident, the second this year, took place on exactly 
the same spot as the incident from a month ago that was deemed 
hushed up. Namely, on that occasion policemen released the 
offender; however, on this occasion they acted in accordance 
with the Fishing Law.

  [Excerpts] Zagreb, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A French unit of the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is to be deployed Wednesday around a 
bridge on the border between Croatia and Bosnia blocked by about 
100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week, UNPROFOR said here. 
Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and 
Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting 
tension at the site. 
  About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over 
the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned 
by Nepalese troops on Friday. The bridge links the Croatian 
town of Stara Gradiska and the Bosnian town of Bosanska Gradiska. 
  The UN secretary general's special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi viewed the Serbs' seizure of the bridge as 
"unacceptable" and was exploring "various ways" to end the 
stand-off, UNPROFOR said in a statement. [passage omitted] 
  UNPROFOR meanwhile reported "repeated attempts" Tuesday to 
shell the strategic Maslenica Bridge in southern Croatia, 
without saying which side was responsible. It said this 
constituted "one of the most serious violations" of the 
ceasefire concluded in mid-December by the Croatian Army and 
secessionist Serbs. 
  Croatian media Wednesday accused secessionists from Krajina 
of having bombed the Meslenica area Tuesday, wounding two people. 
  The Maslenica bridge, which the Croatian Army recaptured 
from 
Serb secessionists during an offensive in January 1993, is vital 
to Croatia because it links the ex-Yugoslav republic's northern 
and southern parts.

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- The government of the 
republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] today lodged a protest with the 
Zagreb-based UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command because 
UNPROFOR lined up combat and technical equipment at its disposal 
along the Okucani-Sava bridge road near Stara Gradiska, whose 
barrels are directed toward the bridge, ISKRA [official Krajina 
news agency] reported this evening. 
  The Krajina Government demands that UNPROFOR withdraw all 
combat equipment within 24 hours, upon receipt of this demand, 
ISKRA reports. 
  To this effect, a meeting between representatives of the 
Krajina government and UNPROFOR should have been held today -- 
but UNPROFOR representatives informed through mediators that 
they would not be coming due to fears for their personal safety. 
  The RSK Government considers the failure of UNPROFOR 
representatives to show up as extremely frivolous, and the 
reasons stated as suspicious and provocative, the Krajina 
Government protest says, adding that the demonstration of force 
by UNPROFOR causes a feeling of fear among the Krajina 
population living on the territory of western Slavonia. The 
people of Krajina know well where the danger comes from and 
expect UNPROFOR to be deployed there, not on a bridge that 
connects the Serb people, the protest says in conclusion.

  [Text] The political department of the Croatian Army's 
operational zone of Split has reported that the Serbs repeatedly 
attacked Croatian Army's positions in the Zadar hinterland 
today. At around 1200, they fired several mortar shells on Kasic 
and Lakici. Between 1300 and 1420, they fired around 10 
artillery shells on the Maslenica area. At the same time they 
also fired on Novigrad. 
  The Croatian Army has protested to the UN Protection Force 
over these Serb attacks, the strongest in the last three months.

<F P=106> [Article by Miodrag Dundjerovic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 22 (TANJUG) -- Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman who has, "through a third party", apologized to 
the Jews for having minimized the number of their victims in the 
Second World War, could have shown a similar gesture of good 
will towards the Serbs, too, because he had grossly falsified 
the data also on their pogrom in the same historical period. 
  "Serbs and Jews like to have lots of dead," said Tudjman and 
in line with this thesis he stated the figures on their 
persecutions, adjusting them to the current "home policy". 
  The ustashi, Croatian fascists, whose symbols have been 
adopted by the new Croatian authorities, during the Second World 
War killed about one million Serbs, Jews and Romanies on the 
soil of the then Nazi puppet "independent state of Croatia" 
(NDH). 
  Tudjman's apology has been purely a formal letter 
communicated "through a third party" in Washington last Monday 
to representatives of a few Jewish organizations. 
  Not only that it was long overdue and not sent to all 
addresses, but it was also obvious that Tudjman's letter had 
been prepared for daily political requirements. 
  The apology was written at the point when the announced 
sanctions against Zagreb were being prepared and when the 
deadline set by NATO to withdraw Croatia's regular army troops 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina was expiring. The apology proved to be 
"a success" as there were no sanctions, nor have the Croatian 
regular army troops pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In his letter, Tudjman repented of having expressed a doubt, 
in his book "Wastelands of Historical Reality," that six million 
Jews had been killed during the Nazi holocaust in the Second 
World War . 
  As a historian, Tudjman asserted that "no more" than 900,000 
Jews were killed in the Second World War. 
  Tudjman stated in his apology that he had written a 
"scientific" book while he was a political convict (is it a 
justification) and that (only now) he understands the 
"detriment" of some chapters in his book. 
  Tudjman is the author of the allegations that about 30,000 
people had been killed in the ustashi death camp of Jasenovac on 
the soil of the "independent state of Croatia" (NDH). Tudjman 
communicated this "knowledge" in 1991, on the occasion of the 
50th anniversary of the NDH. 
  According to reliable data, in the Jasenovac concentration 
camp, Croatian fascists had killed 700,000 Serbs. 
  According to Jewish sources, 20,000 Jews had been killed in 
Jasenovac and according to Romanies' sources, about 80,000 
Romanies were killed in this camp. 
  Tudjman arrived at the figure on the victims in Jasenovac on 
the basis of the Nazi documents issued in the days of the Third 
Reich -- the German state responsible for the crimes against 
humanity. 
  But, if he had consistently adhered to all German documents, 
he could have easily found the data by the German commander for 
the southeast, Lt.-Gen. Alexander Lehr who stated the figure of 
400,000 Serbs killed in the NDH territory in April 1943. 
  Tudjman could have also found a statement by Edmund Gleiz 
von 
Horsten, who, from the reports received from Jasenovac had 
inferred that the "number of the slaughtered Serbs was 750,000." 
  Finally, in order for the apology to be really sincere and 
taken as well-intentioned, Tudjman should have shown by his 
deeds that he had given up state symbols and state policy of the 
Nazi NDH. 
  The continuity of the NDH has not been interrupted even 
today 
as may be confirmed by international organizations' data saying 
that 300,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia and 10,000 
Serb houses destroyed in the latest war.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stastny: "According to the Chairman of the </F>
Czech Union of Freedom Fighters, the Final Compensation Must Be 
Paid by Germany"] 
  [Text] Czech Union of Freedom Fighters [CSBS] Chairman 
Jakub Cermin yesterday expressed the union's point of view on 
compensation for former political prisoners during the Nazi era. 
  The CSBS agrees with compensation in advance from the Czech 
Republic's funds; however, it thinks that the Federal Republic 
of Germany should pay the final compensation. It emphasizes that 
the matter must be dealt with quickly in view of the advanced 
age of the resistance fighters. Representatives from the CSBS 
and the Association of Freed Political Prisoners have stated 
that the sums proposed do not correspond to the sums paid in 
other countries (5,000 German marks per person per year of 
imprisonment). At present, this concerns some 8,200 people. It 
is a fundamental issue of international relations. "We are still 
the only state that has not been compensated," said Union Deputy 
Chairman Jan Paroutek. 
  In 1973, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany 
was willing to pay compensation to Czech political prisoners 
according to the same principles as for other European 
countries. Its goodwill, however, did not meet with a proper 
response because the German side insisted on payment in German 
marks targeted on individuals, while our government demanded an 
overall sum that it would distribute in accordance with its own 
rules. The German Government did not accede to this solution. 
Association of Domestic Resistance Chairman Slavomir Klaban has 
briefed reporters on an open letter to the chairman of the Czech 
Republic Supreme Court in which he called upon Otakar Motejl to 
resign immediately. In March 1970, Motejl rescinded the 
acquittal of nine citizens sentenced in a political trial in 
1954 for alleged treason.

  [Text] The Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] rejects the 
attempts to change the Constitution of the Czech Republic that 
were made earlier this week at the meeting of the Chamber of 
Deputies. ODA Deputy Chairman Daniel Kroupa spoke about this 
today. 
  [Begin Kroupa recording] The ODA rejects these attacks 
against our Constitution and considers it fundamental to ask if 
all parties voting for the Constitution feel committed to defend 
it against attacks by extremist forces. We think that the 
attempt to remove the Senate from the Constitution and 
incorporate into it elements of direct democracy are aimed at 
creating favorable conditions for these extremist forces taking 
power. 
  In this respect, I wish to comment on the matter of 
referenda. You all know well that the ODA has consistently 
opposed this institution, pointing out that it disturbs our 
constitutional balance of power. Just now, when our parliament 
is debating the proposal of introducing referenda into our 
Constitution, in Slovakia the referendum might be used to take 
away the citizens' right to elect. This in fact is the substance 
of Mr. Meciar's proposal to strip disobedient deputies of their 
mandate by means of a referendum. It is an almost classical 
illustration of how direct democracy can be used as an 
instrument to liquidate democracy as such. [end recording]

  [Text] Prague--The HTT Group company, the manufacturer of 
the Tamara passive radar, has registered an unsuccessful attempt 
at industrial espionage, Ludek Stodulka, vice president of the 
company, told MLADA FRONTA DNES. Tamara is a state-of-the-art 
air defense system, which, according to experts, can uncover 
even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth bomber. 
  The attempt to obtain secret information on the production 
of 
Tamara was supposedly made by a certain Czech arms company. 
Stodulka did not specify which company it was, nor did he reveal 
any details about the espionage attempt. He did indicate, 
however, that the arms company wanted to gain access to 
information about Tamara by offering jobs to three key HTT Group 
employees. 
  Ludek Stodulka also said that this unnamed company, in 
cooperation with foreign competitors, rendered it impossible for 
the HTT Group company to export Tamara, which can fetch up to 
$17 million, to one Persian Gulf country. The competitors 
supposedly thwarted the long-planned deal, which was to have 
been the first export of Tamara since 1992, by spreading false 
information about the radar's abilities.

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radoje Kontic, prime 
minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who returned 
from New York today, said at a news conference at the Federation 
Palace [in Belgrade] that his visit to New York was useful and 
essentially achieved its objectives. 
  Speaking about numerous meetings he had in New York, among 
them with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and with 
ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states and 
other prominent UN figures, the Yugoslav prime minister 
emphasized the efforts Yugoslavia was making for a peaceful 
resolution of the Yugoslav crisis. 
  Prime Minister Kontic received support for the Yugoslav 
position -- that the planned NATO military action in Sarajevo 
could threaten the peace process in Bosnia and bring about an 
escalation of the crisis -- during his talks with the Brazilian 
ambassador, who is also the president of the UN Sanctions 
Committee, the Nigerian ambassador, and in his numerous talks 
with representatives of influential UN members such as Japan, 
India, EU countries, and with well-known journalists. 
  Calling for a more aggressive and organized approach by our 
country in attempts to break through the information blockade, 
Kontic appealed for a stronger offensive by the Yugoslav media 
in presenting the truth about Yugoslavia and about our country's 
humanitarian needs caused by the vast numbers of refugees of all 
nationalities who had found refuge here. Only our reintegration 
into the United Nations can make a full contribution toward 
peace in the Balkans, Kontic stressed. 
  With the exception of the official representatives of the 
American administration, who he did not meet, most of the 
officials with whom he held talks showed understanding and 
willingness for the lifting, that is softening, of the sanctions 
against our country, Kontic said. Sanctions were described as 
counterproductive and inhuman, as an expression of the 
international community's inability to influence the resolution 
of the crisis through political means. 
  The first concrete result of my visit to New York, Kontic 
said, will emerge in the humanitarian sphere. Due to the 
hitherto lack of knowledge about humanitarian needs of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Under Secretary James Grant 
promised aid for Yugoslav children to the tune of several 
million dollars. While waiting for the sanctions to be lifted, 
Yugoslavia will, more easily than before, be able to secure raw 
materials for medicines, about which Prime Minister Kontic spoke 
with Butrus-Ghali, among other things. 
  At his news conference, Kontic expressed pleasure for the 
timely deployment of UN peace forces on positions around 
Sarajevo from where the Serbs withdrew, thus preventing the 
escalation of the conflict. He described the NATO ultimatum as: 
Knocking on an open door, because back on 6 February Bosnian 
Serbs and UN Secretary General's envoy Yasushi Akashi reached an 
agreement on the withdrawal of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo 
and an agreement on that was later reached by Bosnian Serbs and 
Muslims. 
  Speaking about a meeting with IMF representatives, Kontic 
said that this international institution did not change its 
attitude toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but 
underscored the need to maintain constant contacts with the IMF 
because of this institution's importance for Yugoslavia's 
economic recovery and development. 
  The Yugoslav prime minister positively assessed his talks 
with representatives of our emigrants in the United States, who 
displayed significant interest in providing help for the 
stabilization program.

  [Text] Belgrade, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Federal Foreign 
Ministry today presented a demarche to the representative of the 
Albanian Embassy against the Albanian Government's decision to 
allow the stationing of U.S. spy planes in Albania and Albania's 
readiness to place its airports, sea ports, and other facilities 
at the disposal of NATO forces for possible military 
intervention in the region. 
  According to the ministry, the Albanian diplomat was 
informed 
about the Yugoslav Government's deep concern and was told that 
such moves on the part of the Albanian Government were 
aggravating tensions in the region and presented a threat to the 
security of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The Albanian Government was demanded to re-examine its 
decision on the stationing of U.S. spy planes and placing its 
territory at NATO's disposal, in the interest of peace, 
stability, and the normalization of Yugoslav-Albanian ties.

  [Text] Geneva, February 18 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of 
Belgrade doctors have warned representatives of international 
humanitarian organizations during a several days long visit to 
Geneva about the alarming effects of the United Nations (U.N.) 
sanctions on the health of the population and the over 700,000 
refugees in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The doctors on Friday ended a visit to humanitarian 
organizations which operate within the U.N. system. Speaking at 
a press conference in Geneva, they underscored that the most 
elementary medicines and conditions for treating patients were 
lacking in hospitals in Yugoslavia because of the sanctions. 
  Head of Belgrade's neuro-psychiatry hospital Prvoslav 
Markovic warned that the admission of mental patients had 
increased four times in the past six months, and that, because 
of the sanctions, the genocidal conditions in the hospital wards 
were more devastating than the atom bomb which dropped on 
Hiroshima. 
  Dusan Velimirovic said that since the U.N. embargo was 
imposed, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had become a country 
with the biggest number of coronary seizures in the world 
because mortality in these cases had risen to 50 percent of all 
mortality rates. 
  Post-operative infections at the children's clinic in 
Belgrade have increased by 20-30 percent because there are no 
antibiotics, Dusan Scepmvic warned. 
  As a result of the shortage of cytostatics, the mortality of 
children with tumors has increased 40 percent, and operations 
are performed selectively, depending on the stages of the 
cancerous disease, Scepanovic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with the head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, </F>
Vuk Draskovic, by Sibylle Hamann in Belgrade; date not given: 
"`Extend Example of Sarajevo!'"] 
  [Text] [Hamann] You say that you would rather go to 
Sarajevo than to Pale, the center of the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Draskovic] My people are not only situated on the hills 
around Sarajevo, but are also living in the city. Since the 
beginning of the war there have always been more Serbs in 
Sarajevo than around the city -- and they suffer more. This is 
the wrong place and the wrong time to side with the Bosnian 
Serbs demonstratively. 
  [Hamann] Do Bosnia's Serbs no longer deserve any support 
from Belgrade? 
  [Draskovic] By destroying Sarajevo, Karadzic has destroyed 
Serb tradition. He does not represent the Serb nation, merely 
an extremist minority. I belong to a great nation; it is my 
duty to defend the honor of the Serbs. But the propaganda is in 
the hands of the extremists. 
  [Hamann] Is peace in Bosnia possible as long as Milosevic is 
president of Serbia? 
  [Draskovic] Do not be surprised if Milosevic and (Croatian 
President) Tudjman present themselves as peacemakers now. This 
is not logical, this is not honest -- but this is politics. I 
am worried that the world might forget that the key to peace 
lies in Bosnia itself. The international community has the duty 
to extend the example of Sarajevo to all of Bosnia, until the 
ultimate aim, disarmament down to the knives, has been achieved. 
This would require 50,000 UN soldiers. 
  [Hamann] What would the effect on Serbia be? 
  [Draskovic] After disarmament in Bosnia, the democrats in 
Serbia and Croatia will grow wings. New people will be in power 
here overnight. 
  [Hamann] But people are hardly prepared to bring the regime 
down. 
  [Draskovic] How could they? The sanctions have not harmed 
Milosevic, but me. Of my supporters, 300,000 have fled Serbia. 
If the West wants to support democratization, it will have to 
lift the embargo.

  [Text] Tirana, February 19 (ATA) -- "Our views are similar 
with Macedonian ones but the relations are conditioned by the 
Albanian factor in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] and by the respecting of the Albanians rights there," 
said yesterday the Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi at the 
press conference he held with his Macedonian counterpart. 
  The Macedonia foreign minister Crvenkovski considered as 
successful and a good example the meetings he had with the 
Albanian high officials. "We are for a close cooperation with 
Albania and all the other neighbours realising the democratic 
principle of the non-intervention into the domestic affairs," 
Mr. Crvenkovski said adding that his government is also for 
respecting of the human rights and for the relations building 
based on the European and international standards. 
  The Macedonian foreign minister said we discussed with the 
Albanian side some economic projects of the common interest 
about the international situation and for the eventual 
consequences our two countries may have by the grave situation 
in region. "We had a fruitful meeting and we desire these 
meetings be as often as possible," Mr. Crvenkovski said. 
  Asked about the U.S. State Department report on the human 
rights in Macedonia, Mr. Crvenkovski said he didn't know 
anything about that report. We observe, said Mr. Crvenkovski, 
the principle which says that all citizens in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are equal having all the rights 
and it is of the state interest that all of them be pleased to 
their state and accept it as their own. I think, Mr. 
Crvenkovski said, all the problems can not be solved within a 
year but the great steps the Macedonian state has done can not 
be rejected. 
  Answering to a question in regard with the closing of the 
Salonica port, Mr. Crvenkovski said "from the Albanian side we 
have a full support and we appreciate this very much." But, 
however this blockade makes the transport difficult. This is a 
means of pressure that will not be accepted from the 
international community. 
  Minister Serreqi, answering a question about the possibility 
of the aggravation of the relations with Greece because of 
giving FYROM port facilities, said that "the fact that the 
Albanian Government offer not only port facilities, but 
facilities for all the goods circulation in the interest of 
Macedonia as an answer to the one- sided approach attended and 
declared from the Greek Government, one day after the visit of 
the Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias to Belgrade, is an evidence 
of the will for relations of good neighbourhood with Macedonia 
and an evidence of the independence of the foreign policy of 
Albania. "I was surprised from the decision of the Greek 
Government because during the visit and the meeting in Athens, 
in the talking with Mr. Papoulias, he told me that the time has 
come to reconsider the approach of Greece toward Macedonia in a 
quite different sense from the decision taken by them. I 
believe that even my colleague and the Macedonian Government 
should appreciate this support given from Albania. 
  Answering the question of a journalist concerned on an 
article published in the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT about 
the ill- treatment of the Albanians who ask passports of 
identity, necessary for the future census of the population, the 
Macedonian minister said that this problem has no relations with 
the census of the population and that the Macedonian state is 
for its performance according to the world standards. 
  Answering the question "cause any trouble to the Macedonian 
Government some cases of the killing of Albanians in FYROM" Mr. 
Crvenkovski said that he doesn't know cases of the abuse of the 
human rights till the killings, at least during the period he 
has been minister. 
  Considering the representation of the Albanians in the 
Macedonian institutions, Mr. Crvenkovski said that during a year 
and a half, the representation of the Albanians in the political 
life of Macedonia is going over the possibilities of the organs 
of power there. 
  Considering the Albanian approach toward the acceptation of 
Macedonia in CSCE, Mr. Serreqi said that it will depend from the 
treatment of the Albanians living there. Calling the Albanian 
factor as very important for the relations between the two 
countries, Minister Serreqi said that something has been done 
for the rights of the Albanians in FYROM, but there are 
possibilities to do more. 
  The question "Which is the Macedonian approach to the Kosova 
question," Mr. Crvenkovski said that "our approach toward Kosova 
question is that it should be resolved through dialogue, it is 
impossible to find a solution for it through other ways."

  [Text] Budapest, 22 February (MTI) -- Four parties -- the 
agrarian Federation, the Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ), 
the Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party), and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) -- signed an agreement on 
Tuesday [22 February] to set up a liberal election coalition, as 
preparation for the May elections. 
  The sides agreed that parties whose candidates cannot enter 
the second round because they received insufficient votes would 
support the candidate of the four parties to the agreement who 
won the most votes in the first round. 
  Inasmuch as candidates of several parties from those signing 
the agreement reach the second round, the number of votes cast 
for the candidates of the signatory parties will determine who 
will step down in favor of another candidate. 
  The parties will ensure that details of the agreement and 
the 
rules for stepping down be approved by their candidates.

  [Text] The president's press and information office has 
just issued a report on President Berisha's meeting with the 
Macedonian foreign minister. 
  Albania is interested in stability in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], President Berisha said 
at this meeting today. Albania is of the opinion that respect 
for all the rights of the Albanian population there is a 
condition for stability. Thus, the census and the opening of 
the Pedagogical School will be important steps in this 
direction. On the other hand, Berisha invites Albanian 
political forces to work for the stability of Macedonia, as this 
is in their interest, as well as that of the Albanian nation and 
the whole region. 
  President Berisha said that by exchanging greetings with 
President Gligorov, I want to assure you that Albania is ready 
to cooperate with you to increase the spirit of understanding 
and cooperation and establish them on sound bases. To overcome 
the blockade difficulties, Albania offers it all port and 
transport facilities and hopes that the conflicts between 
Macedonia and Greece can be overcome through dialogue. 
  Macedonian Foreign Minister Crvenkovski said that, by 
conveying President Gligorov's greetings to President Berisha, 
he would like to express the deep gratitude of our government 
for the support that Albania has given to Macedonia. We thank 
you for the facilities that you are creating for us at these 
difficult moments of the blockade. He again stressed his 
government's desire to strengthen cooperation with Albania. 
  Macedonian Foreign Minister Crvenkovski has ended his trip 
to 
our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent </F>
Smallholders Party, by Lorinc Szendrei in Budapest; date not 
given: "The Smallholders Will Not Again Yield Precedence to 
Others -- Jozsef Torgyan on Being Qualified as Extremist, 
Trustworthiness, and the Constitutionality of the Government"] 
  [Excerpts] Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party -- MIEP] and Jozsef Torgyan will hold a 
rally on 20 February in the Budapest Sports Hall. Is the right 
wing the next to join forces after the liberals' agreement and 
the left wing bloc? A straight answer is not yet forthcoming. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Szendrei] Why are you appearing in a joint meeting with 
Istvan Csurka with whom you have had many debates? It seems 
that, after the former internal and external allies of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were expelled from paradise, 
they now have found each other. 
  [Torgyan] I do not have 2.1 million forints to give a 
massive 
speech in the Budapest Sports Hall. This is why I accepted 
someone else's invitation. Rather than Csurka, it was Ferenc 
Morvai, leader of the Citizens' Interest Protection 
Organization, who invited me. You can see that I am also talking 
to you, but we cannot at all be accused of having the same 
political platform. 
  [Szendrei] You know that an interview is different from a 
demonstrative political rally. I do not believe that you would 
also jointly appear with Viktor Orban [chairman of the 
Federation of Young Democrats] at an event. The electors 
consider all jointly held speeches to be political gestures. To 
be naive: Is the meeting of the smallholders and the MIEP 
really the result of a purely financial constraint, without any 
intention to cooperate? 
  [Torgyan] In politics, it is impossible to use the same 
categoric notions as in mathematics for example. Therefore, the 
rally organized for 20 February has to be accepted as it is. 
Nothing needs to be added. For a politician, there can be no 
greater honor than to talk in front of crowd that is as large as 
possible. As far as I know, there are 12,000 seats in the 
Sports Hall, but the experts will set up loudspeakers in the 
corridors and then as many as 100,000 people will be able to 
hear us. [passage omitted] 
  [Szendrei] Whatever way we look at it, Csurka and his party 
are on the right of the Hungarian political spectrum at the 
moment. Many people say that the slightly left-wing pre-war 
smallholders party may shift to the far right under Torgyan's 
leadership. 
  [Szendrei] You are using completely different terms from 
what would be appropriate. Before the war, the smallholders 
party was indeed a left-wing party -- compared with [governor] 
Horthy's right-wing views. However, right after 1945, we were 
to the right of communism. Therefore, there is no point in 
qualifying us or other parties in this way. [passage omitted] 
We are not extremists. I repeat that we will not meet Csurka, 
it is only our host that we have common. I will face the 
challenge. We can assess our abilities in rhetoric. 
  [Szendrei] I must admit that, even now, you do not give in 
very easily. 
  [Torgyan] Thank you. Therefore, I have to enter into this 
dialogue, just as I do not decline dialogue with other 
politicians. This is also part of political culture but we do 
not have any plans to do with Csurka. [passage omitted] 
  [Szendrei] You are also said to have betrayed the coalition. 
A government has to be formed after the elections. How certain 
can the contenders be that you would be a reliable partner? 
  [Torgyan] I do not think reliability should be approached 
from this angle. We made a coalition agreement [in 1990, at the 
previous elections] which, contrary to rumors, was in writing. 
It was the MDF that violated it. This is the reason we 
criticized the top leadership. We had a serious debate with 
[former prime minister] Jozsef Antall because he did not fulfill 
the agreement. This was his way of repaying the fact that, in 
the second round, we had withdrawn our candidates in many places 
in the MDF's favor. Without us, the MDF would not have doubled 
its votes in the second round. 
  [Szendrei] In other words, it was the smallholders who 
helped the MDF come to government and Torgyan helped Antall come 
to power? 
  [Torgyan] This is it, precisely. Returning to gratefulness: 
On the night it came to power, the MDF made a secret pact. I 
returned home after midnight and was told that a couple had been 
looking for me. I later realized that these were [then MDF 
deputies] Imre Konya and Katalin Kutrucz. At that time, they 
had already signed the agreement with the Alliance of Free 
Democrats. This is what they were going to tell me. They had 
made a pact with the opposition behind our backs. Therefore, it 
is only us who can raise the issue of reliability. 
  [Szendrei] In other words, the smallholders generously 
allowed the MDF to win. This time, they will not offer this to 
anyone, rather, they are certain that they will win the 
elections.... 
  [Torgyan] That is correct. No one can yet tell the size of 
the victory. I think it is possible that the smallholders will 
have an astonishingly big victory. The population is so bitter 
and they have so much faith in us that even this is possible. 
If we win the elections at whatever proportion, then it will 
not be us who has to look for partners. Rather, the partners 
will be seeking us because people do not like to be left out of 
power. There are not many Jozsef Torgyans in the world, and I 
have never been running after ministerial office. [sentence as 
published] 
  [Szendrei] Are you so self-assured or humble? 
  [Torgyan] I said that we were deceived in the coalition, 
because we had been promised a change of regime, a big clean-up 
from top to bottom, the return of landed property, and so on. 
They did not fulfill these promises, and so there was nothing 
to agree about with those in power. On the contrary! After 
this, let me ask if those in power who implement a completely 
different program from what they had promised in their election 
program are constitutional. 
  [Szendrei] Do you question the government's 
constitutionality? 
  [Torgyan] Election fraud can never be seen as a 
constitutional procedure anywhere. And this is what the 
government has done through its politics. 
  [Szendrei] Where do you, as a jurist, find a paragraph in 
the Constitution on this? 
  [Torgyan] That is a different question. What I question is 
an issue of constitutionality, rather than a political issue. 
The basic principles of this could be laid down in the 
Constitution. I think that even a referendum is possible on 
this issue. Therefore, I restate that this government is in 
power contrary to the Constitution because it has deceived the 
electors. If they had said that "the cleaning up means that we 
will take money from your pockets, we will have dealings with 
the communists, and we will participate in the communists's 
preservation of power and assets," and they had received the 
votes after this, then I would not at all object. In that case, 
they would be ruling lawfully. 
<H5>  Capitalist Communists </H5>
  [Szendrei] We can read the public opinion polls and hear the 
views of politicians and the public that the left wing is 
becoming stronger. What will the smallholders party do after a 
left-wing victory? 
  [Torgyan] This danger does not exist. People who have 
listened to what I said can see that the communists had been 
speaking up against the curse of private property until they 
relieved society from this curse. They made themselves into 
owners. The former party chiefs would be foolish to return to 
their party positions. 
  [Szendrei] What kind of government would you consider to be 
a strong government in the coming four years? 
  [Torgyan] We have to start from our program. People cannot 
bear the insecurity of existence, the level of the loss of 
assets, and the obvious anguish of unemployment. A government 
that is able to make fundamental changes will be a strong 
government. 
  [Szendrei] Therefore, in your view, the smallholders party 
will win the elections. As the party's chairman, you may even 
become prime minister. Do you think that you are the most 
suitable person to be prime minister? 
  [Torgyan] Not at all. However, it is a fact that I am the 
only politician who can mobilize really large masses. In other 
parties, there are not any charismatic people who are accepted 
by the people.

  [Text] Negotiations between representatives of the 
Ministry of Industry and the delegation of the Lignitul [Brown 
Coal] Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu Jiu resumed at the 
ministry's headquarters this morning, with the only issue still 
pending being the consent of the Industry Ministry to suspend 
the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public 
Corporation for the duration of investigations that are going to 
be conducted by a ministerial inquiry commission. 
  At approximately 1215 the negotiations broke off with the 
intent to resume an hour later. Meanwhile, the trade union 
delegation went to the Bucharest headquarters of Romania's 
Mining Trade Union Confederation. At 1400 correspondents 
waiting for the resumption of talks at the Ministry of Industry 
were asked to go to the headquarters of Romania's Mining Trade 
Union Confederation, where Mr. Dumitru Leonte, vice president of 
the confederation, said that since the delegation did not have 
the mandate to sign the protocol in the drafted form, it 
renounced to negotiate any further and left for Targu Jiu to 
present the document and discuss it with the other trade union 
leaders. 
  A commission of the Ministry of Industry is expected to 
arrive in Targu Jiu next Monday, 21 February, to investigate -- 
in the light of repeated demands made in this respect by the 
miners -- the activity of the management board of the Brown Coal 
Public Corporation. Mr. Dumitru Leonte emphasized that the 
commission should include experts of the control bodies of the 
Ministry of Industry, the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry 
of Labor and Social Security, and the Ministry of Finance. He 
ruled out the presence in the inquiry commission of any member 
of the management board of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public 
Corporation, our correspondent Catalin Trandafir reports. 
  At the request of the correspondents, a news conference was 
held at the headquarters of the Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public 
Corporation, with the participation of Messrs. Gheorghe 
Marculescu, prefect of Gorj County; Radu Mironovici, general 
manager of the aforementioned public corporation; Colonel 
Constantin Codica, chief of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj 
County; and Gorj Deputy Nicolae Mischie. 
  After a presentation of last week's events, following the 
strike launched by the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of 
Targu Jiu, the speakers pointed to the illegal nature of that 
labor action and emphasized that in the coming days, a 
governmental commission will begin its inquiry into accusations 
brought against the management board of the public corporation, 
while representatives of the Court of Public Accounts will 
conduct their own inquiry. We are open to any kind of checks, 
General Manager Radu Mironovici said. Answering the 
correspondents' questions, he gave details about the 
relationship between the trade unions and the public 
corporation. On the other hand, the management board of the 
Targu Jiu Brown Coal Public Corporation will conduct its own 
inquiry into damages caused by the strikers over the past five 
days of labor action and will take steps to recover these 
damages and punish the guilty ones. 
  The head of the Police Inspectorate of Gorj County again 
emphasized the illegal nature of the strike and said that the 
leaders of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation of Targu 
Jiu have been penally punished in the past for violating the 
law. He said that legal steps had been initiated against Miron 
Cosma, who will be sued for serious abuse [ultraj] after the 
indictment is finalized by the Targu Jiu Prosecuting Magistracy 
and forwarded to the appropriate court, our correspondent Titus 
Stoichitoiu reports.

  [Text] Krakow, 22 Feb--Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev started a two-day working visit to Poland on 22 
February. The Russian foreign minister met Andrzej Olechowski 
in Krakow. Both politicians signed an intergovernment 
Polish-Russian agreement "on graves and sites of remembrance of 
victims of wars and repressions." 
  The foreign ministers began their meeting with private 
talks, 
during which bilateral relations and issues of European security 
were discussed. Later, during plenary talks between delegations 
of the two states' foreign ministries, new forms of economic and 
cultural cooperation between Poland and Russia were examined. 
  After the talks, the ministers signed an agreement in which 
both sides have undertaken, among other things, to finance 
protection on their territories of sites commemorating the death 
and martyrdom of citizens of the other state. 
  During the signing ceremony, Minister Olechowski emphasized 
that reconciliation and friendship between the Polish and 
Russian peoples has become possible through mutual respect for 
the victims that both peoples suffered from the two totalitarian 
systems that raged in the 20th century. "In this spirit, the 
Polish people respect and protect the graves of the hundreds of 
thousands of Russian soldiers who fell and rest on our soil," 
said the head of the Polish Foreign Ministry, adding that the 
agreement confirmed the will to permanently respect the resting 
places of victims of wars. 
  Kozyrev emphasized that the agreement was an expression of 
respect for historical truth and the memory of those who gave 
their lives in the struggle for freedom. 
  The Russian diplomat handed over to Minister Olechowski 
photocopies of hitherto secret archival documents from the 
period of the [1794] Kosciuszko Insurrection and the Targowica 
Confederacy, including correspondence between Empress Catherine 
II and Count Ignacy Potocki. 
  Commenting on the private talks, Kozyrev told journalists 
that in these they had raised "in private, confidentially and 
with mutual understanding," issues of European security and 
cooperation with NATO. 
  The Russian minister said that at present we should 
concentrate on "Partnership for Peace," while NATO membership 
for new states is only one option. "Perhaps Russia too will join 
NATO, but perhaps there are other options for fashioning a 
security mechanism, including dialogue in the forums of the 
existing political organizations," Kozyrev added. 
  Olechowski emphasized that perhaps in the future there will 
be no NATO, or perhaps both Poland and Russia will be members of 
the North Atlantic Pact. "These are options that would suit us 
best," said the Polish foreign minister, adding, "if it is not 
going to be possible to build a Europe without divisions, 
`Partnership' could lead to only some countries joining NATO." 
  "I would like a democratic and affluent Russia to be one of 
the pillars of security and economic cooperation in the future 
Europe," Olechowski said, adding that this could be furthered by 
Europe's opening to comprehensive economic cooperation with 
Russia. 
  The Russian foreign minister emphasized that he does not 
want 
the countries of East-Central Europe to be viewed as a 
battlefield for spheres of influence. He added that Poland is 
now an active participant in international politics. According 
to Kozyrev, in light of this, one could not say that Poland 
finds itself in a political vacuum. 
  Referring to the plenary proceedings, Kozyrev said that the 
Polish side put forward a number of interesting proposals 
concerning economic and cultural cooperation. He also stated 
that the Krakow proceedings brought closer the implementation of 
agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Poland last year. 
  "Polish-Russian relations are very good; they merely lack 
friendly everyday substance," Olechowski noted. He added that 
Poland and Russia, being neighbors, cannot be enemies. On the 
other hand, they must be partners even if they do not want to 
be. "The point is that now we want to travel the road from 
partnership to friendship, and the Poles intend to do this 
quickly," Olechowski added. 
  Before meeting Minister Olechowski, the Russian foreign 
minister viewed exhibits of the State Art Collection at Wawel 
castle and visited the Wawel Cathedral. Asked by journalists 
about Polish-Russian cultural links, he said, "Our cultures have 
never been separated from each other, and this gives me hope. 
Culture is the spiritual basis on which we could build the 
future and good-neighborly relations and develop partnership." 
  Stanislaw Ciosek, Polish Republic ambassador to Russia, told 
a PAP journalist that the Krakow meeting was important for both 
sides because it could contribute to "breaking through the 
temporary cooling down in relations." According to Ciosek, a 
breakthrough in Polish-Russian relations will not depend on a 
single act but will take place gradually. 
  Ciosek emphasized that it would be easier to attain a 
political breakthrough rather than an economic one, which "costs 
a lot and has to be costed," while, for it to occur, there must 
be first and foremost meetings between the heads of governments, 
economics ministers, and industrialists.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 23 (AFP) -- Two contingents of UN troops 
have been placed on alert after Serb forces overpowered 
peacekeepers to seize a bridge linking Croatia and Bosnia, the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said here Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Around 100 armed Serb soldiers and police took control of 
the 
bridge on the River Sava Friday, overpowering a United Nations 
control post manned by Nepalese troops. 
  Two battalions of Jordanian UN troops and part of a 
contingent of Argentinian peacekeepers in north-central Croatia 
were placed on alert, said UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig. 
  UNPROFOR commander in Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, 
threatened Saturday to order the use of force to regain control 
of the bridge linking Stara Gradiska, Croatia, and the Bosnian 
town of Bosanska Gradiska. 
  UNPROFOR deputy commander, John MacInnis, travelled to the 
region Tuesday to prepare a report on the situation for Yasushi 
Akashi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special 
representative in ex-Yugoslavia, said Nerzig. 
  A high-ranking UNPROFOR officer told AFP Saturday that, if 
the Serbs from the self-declared Serbian republic of Croatia 
(Krajina) refused to withdraw, the UN was in a position to 
"exert armed pressure on them, encircle them and block their 
movements." 
  Western military sources here said the Krajina Serbs could 
have been supported by Serbian forces from northern Bosnia in 
seizing the bridge. 
  The Croatian Serb agency ISKRA reported the takeover by a 
unit of Krajina's "special police" Friday.

<F P=106> [Article by Berthold Kohler: "According to Prague's Head of </F>
Government Klaus, a Solution to the Sudeten German Problem Is 
Now Possible"] 
  [Text] Prague, 20 February--German-Czech relations are not 
at their best. The hope that both countries would quickly get 
closer to each other on the path of reconciliation after the 
conclusion of the friendship and neighborhood treaty two years 
ago has not been fulfilled. Rather, stagnation seems to have 
become the main quality of mutual relations. In particular, the 
unsolved issues from the time of the war and the immediate 
postwar period have proved to be a constant strain on the 
political atmosphere between Prague and Bonn. These include 
compensation for the Czech victims of Nazism, but also the 
"Sudeten German problem": the insistence of the Germans driven 
out of Bohemia and Moravia on their "right to their home." 
  However, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus does "not" assess 
current German-Czech relations as being "as poor as various 
commentators" in Prague. He does not see "anything dramatic" in 
the bilateral relations, Klaus says in an interview with this 
newspaper: "Czech-German relations are as they are. One cannot 
improve them artificially, but one should not worsen them 
artificially, either." 
  Klaus points out that there are hundreds of thousands of 
contacts between Germans and Czechs everyday. These contacts at 
the "micro level" are the "meat and blood" of the relations, and 
they are excellent. The "network of microrelations" today is a 
hundred times larger than two years ago and a thousand times 
larger than five years ago. Therefore, he does not see a 
deterioration of relations--"quite the contrary." Contacts 
between institutions and governments are not the most important 
thing, the head of the Prague Government says. At this level, 
the Sudeten German problem has repeatedly caused displeasure on 
both sides. The demands of the more than 3 million expellees for 
a right to return and the return of their property, which Prague 
had nationalized without compensation after the war, have been 
categorically rejected by the Czech Government so far. Even 
talks about this matter were refused. Most recently, Czech 
Parliament President Uhde categorically refused any kind of 
discussion on this matter during his visit to Bonn, thus 
offending his host, Bundestag President Suessmuth. 
  The Czech prime minister said that the Sudeten German 
problem 
is an "unfortunate complication" that has been inherited. "For 
us, it is quite clear: We cannot solve all of our inherited 
problems right now. Various inheritances are constants of our 
life, and solving the problems that arose from the situation 
during the first days after World War II is part of that. 
Unfortunately, we cannot accept the undermining of these 
constants." However, for the first time, Klaus indicated an 
alternative that might offer a way out of the stalemate. As the 
head of government says, in the Czech Republic, individual 
rights have priority over collective rights, and that also 
applies to looking back into the past. "This is a principle of 
our interpretation of life and reality." He, Klaus, is quite 
sure that there will not be any solution for the "collective of 
the Sudeten Germans": "Such a solution does not exist for me, 
and therefore it is quite unnecessary to look for one. However, 
I am quite sure that this problem can be solved at the 
individual level. At this level, I do not see any problems for 
the Sudeten Germans." 
  The head of government says that for him this is a "new 
concept," the interpretation of which he first must develop 
further for himself. "The terminology is completely new, and 
this terminology can lead somewhere. The way out of the 
stalemate is an individual solution, not a collective one. This 
is a change in paradigms." However, this also means that the 
Prague Government will continue to stick to its "no to 
collective discussions" (with representatives of the expellees). 
  In Klaus's view, compensation for the Czech victims of 
Nazism 
is "certainly the German side's problem." His government is 
dealing with the short-term question of how much is to be given 
to the victims as a preliminary advance from the state budget as 
long as they do not get anything from Germany. As an economist 
and politician, he understands very well Germany's domestic 
difficulties in the election year, "at this stage of economic 
development and in view of high unemployment." Therefore, he 
does not expect anyone in Germany to be powerful enough at the 
moment to tackle the issue of compensation. 
  Klaus says that the same principle as for the restitution of 
Jewish property or the restitution of church property must be 
applied to compensation for the victims of the war: "We can only 
attempt to alleviate the consequences of injustice that someone 
has suffered." This is a rational and pragmatic concept "that 
is acceptable for all of us." One must not understand the sums 
that have been cited "as an objective yardstick of injustice." 
As regards church property, his government is looking for a 
mutually acceptable solution. The (coalition) partners must, 
however, accept that "we cannot turn the world back to 24 
February 1948. I cannot find a solution under the flag of the 
restitution of property," the prime minister said. 
  The 53-year-old chairman of the Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS), 
unchallenged in heading the opinion polls, denies that there is 
animosity toward the German neighbor. In his country, he has 
never, not even over the past decades, "seen, heard, or found" 
animosity toward Germany. Still, recently, it was a small 
surprise for him to hear that the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, 
"a jewel of national pride," has a German as chief director. He 
was taken aback a bit when he heard that. "However, the term 
`animosity' really falls into a different category." Of course, 
Klaus says, matters are different when speaking about fear or 
fears of Germany. However, it is quite normal that the smaller 
entity is a bit afraid of the larger one. Still, this is not an 
aggressive attitude toward the Germans. "I do not expect 
anything bad from Germany," the prime minister said. 
  Klaus does not care to heed warning voices, stemming mainly 
from historians' circles, saying that the people in Bohemia and 
Moravia know too little about the multifaceted nature of their 
German neighbors. He is certain that the Czechs know more about 
the Germans than 90 percent of the world's nations about their 
respective neighbors. "Most certainly, our knowledge of German 
history, literature, and current affairs is qualitatively much 
better than German knowledge about the Czech Republic," Klaus 
says. He states that demands for an institute for "German 
studies" are "lobbyism." 
  Klaus also rejects the accusation that he is against 
border-crossing cooperation. The Czech Government is for a 
maximum of border-crossing cooperation as long as it takes place 
at the "micro level--that is, the individual, companies, towns, 
and communities." Prague is not against it when two border towns 
jointly organize their sewer system. "I have said a hundred 
times: Fine, do that, more quickly and better than today." 
However, he is not a friend of regional cooperation. "Regions 
are something unnatural for us. I always say that we must enter 
Europe as a whole country and not as the European region of 
Egrensis, the European region of Neisse, or the European region 
of the Bohemian Forest." 
  Klaus says that, after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, 
his country is "slowly but zealously" searching for its 
identity. It is still at the beginning of a process that must be 
gone through and cannot be anticipated with analytical 
definitions. The foreign policy goals of the Czech Republic, on 
the other hand, are completely clear. "We belong and have always 
belonged to the Central European area, not to the East European 
area or even to the Balkans." Conclusion are drawn from that, 
such as the desire to join all important European institutions. 
  Desirous of becoming a member of the European Union (EU) 
and, 
at the same time, being one of the most prominent critics of 
European "excess bureaucratization"--Klaus does not see any 
contradiction in that. These are two sides of the same coin. The 
Czechs have fears that are linked to their past: "We know what 
integration in a community with a capital that is 2,000 km away 
means. There are very few opportunities to change things when 
nonelected bureaucrats sit and have great power." He, Klaus, 
"certainly does not" compare "the absolute aspects of the EU 
with Soviet hegemony. However, from the structural viewpoint, 
there are various things there that I can compare." Recently, 
he agreed with the president of the European Parliament that the 
ratio of nonelected officials within the EU must be changed for 
the benefit of elected officials. 
  The Czech prime minister also energetically defends himself 
against the accusation, primarily from Poland, that Prague 
refuses cooperation with the other Central European states. 
Indeed, Klaus does not like to use the term "Visegrad" (the 
informal association of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia): "We speak ofCEFTA (the planned Central European Free 
Trade Association)." It is the Czechs who are pushing this 
project ahead and who have problems pulling the others along. 
The members of the Visegrad Group as well as Germany and Austria 
are natural partners, with whom one wants to have the best 
conceivable relations. 
  And what about Slovakia? Is the relationship with Bratislava 
already considered "business as usual" by Prague, or is there 
still a "special relationship"? "A bit of both," the Czech 
prime minister says. Thus, the dissolution of the common state 
is already so far in the past for the Czechs that he, Klaus, has 
forgotten to mention it abroad several times. On the other hand, 
he regrets the negative developments in Slovakia. At the moment, 
there is no one in Slovak politics strong enough to overcome the 
instability there. Unfortunately, one must still wait for a 
solution to the crisis in Bratislava. In other fields, too, 
Klaus, who is married to a Slovak, crosses his fingers to the 
former "brothers": for the Olympic ice hockey game--as long as 
they do not play against the Czechs, one may assume.

  [Text] [Announcer] Albanian President Sali Berisha signed 
the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative in Brussels today. 
First he met NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. For more 
details, we go over to a telephone report by Aida Shehu. 
  [Shehu] The participants in the meeting expressed a common 
concern over the situation in the Balkan region and noted that 
the attention of the international community is concentrated on 
Bosnia at a time when it is evident that the problem of Kosova 
is a key problem, and that without resolving it there can be no 
solution to the regional crisis. The participants also 
expressed concern over the division of Bosnia because, it was 
said, this division favors the aggressor and creates premises to 
set up new states through force. 
  The meeting also focused on the increasing expansion of the 
relations between Albania and NATO, as represented by the 
signing of the PFP initiative. 
  The Woerner-Berisha meeting lasted for about 30 minutes. In 
the presence of the North Atlantic Council, President Berisha 
gave a speech before signing the PFP agreement. After 
expressing his thanks to the North Atlantic Alliance for the 
invitation to our country to cooperate as a partner, Berisha 
stressed that he was confident that the decision to further 
cooperation with the former communist European countries taken 
at the NATO summit in January this year constitutes a historic 
step in the life of our continent and the whole international 
community. NATO is now the only military alliance in our part 
of the world that, because of its moral values and military 
potential, has the indisputable responsibility for peace, 
security, and European stability. NATO is today the only great 
hope to cure Europe and the international community from the 
Bosnian (?penitent) syndrome. 
  President Berisha later stressed that as a country fully 
interested in stable peace in the region, we should stress that 
in the last 20 months developments at the military level, 
together with the many defeats of the negotiations, clearly 
testify that dividing Bosnia is a hopeless option to end the war 
and establish peace, and that the time may have come to replace 
it with another option that respects the principles of 
preserving Bosnia's integrity, the right of the people to return 
to their centuries-long hearths, and does not reward the 
aggressor. President Berisha said that though the defense of 
these principles seems difficult at first sight, he thought that 
this was the only way to establish peace and that it was many 
times more productive than the acceptance and implementation of 
contrary principles. 
  President Berisha reminded those present that one of the 
great knots of the present Balkan crisis is undoubtedly the 
problem of Kosova. There should be no solution to the Balkan 
crisis without solving the Kosova issue. That is why Berisha 
asked them that this question, which could at any moment trigger 
a Balkan war, be accorded the proper gravity and the dimensions 
that it possesses. For this reason, he said, I consider it very 
important to link the sanctions on Serbia to the situation 
created by Serbia in Kosova, to dispatch UN monitors to the 
province, and to exert pressure on Serbia so as to start 
negotiations with the legitimate representatives of this 
province within the framework of the Geneva conference, as well 
as to make a clear inventory for the return of all the violently 
seized institutions and to solve its status by respecting the 
human and national rights of 2 million Albanians who live in 
their ancient territories. 
  President of the Republic of Albania Sali Berisha signed the 
PFP agreement at 1045 in the presence of the North Atlantic 
Council members.

<F P=106> [R.T., B.S., I.A. report: "Two Leaderships, Two Parties"] </F>
  [Text] Tetovo, Feb [dateline as published] -- The second 
early congress of the Party of Democratic Prosperity [PDP] was 
held in the hall of the Tetovo House of Culture. There were 
arguments and disagreements at the start of the meeting over the 
status of the congress delegates. One side demanded that only 
those elected by branches and subbranches during the recent 
elections should be delegates. The other side demanded that all 
those falling under the definition of Article 37 of the PDP 
Statute could be delegates. According to this article, delegates 
elected by the branches and subbranches, members of the PDP 
Presidium, members of the PDP Central Assembly, members of the 
PDP Supvervisory Council, and deputies and ministers 
representing the PDP in the parliament and Macedonian Government 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can be 
congress delegates with full voting rights. After the congress 
participants voted for a working presidium and also to override 
the PDP Statute, thus denying votes to deputies, the members of 
the government and a section of the delegates demonstratively 
left the meeting. The delegation of the Kosovo Democratic 
alliance, consisting of Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, and 
Edita Tahiri, also left the meeting. The congress continued its 
proceedings with those remaining in the hall, which, according 
to the new rules, were only delegates elected by branches and 
subbranches and the chairmen of branches in Macedonia and in the 
diaspora, but who formed a quorum. 
<H5>  The Party's Degeneration </H5>
  After the congress's working groups and commissions were 
elected, the greetings telegram to the congress from Kosova 
Prime Minister Bujar Bukoshi was read out. Dritan Shehu, 
general secretary of the Albanian Democratic Party, greeted the 
congress, calling it very important for the Albanians in 
Macedonia and a contribution to realizing human rights on the 
basis of the Helsinki Charter and the documents of the CSCE and 
to maintaining peace and stability in Macedonia, the Balkans, 
and the world. Dritan Shehu said in his speech, among other 
things, that a free vote is one that decides who is elected and 
where. Aleksander Xinho greeted the congress for the Albanian 
Republican Party, and said that it is important for the party to 
emerge strengthened from this congress and that he felt himself 
obliged to help the congress to proceed smoothly. 
  Muhamet Bicaj, Kosova education minister, said that the only 
people to emerge disappointed from this congress will be those 
who want the PDP's destruction. There are no Albanians who want 
this party weaker. On the contrary, they want it to be 
strengthened. The Albanians must cultivate pluralism and broad 
hearts, because narrowmindedness is a damaging handicap. Milaim 
Fejziu, chairman of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights 
and Freedoms; Erdogan Sarac, chairman of the Turkish Democratic 
Party, the cardiologist Jusuf Rexhepi, and the actor Xhevat 
Limani also greeted the congress. 
  Menduh Thaci, chairman of the PDP's Tetovo branch, presented 
the report on the party's work between the two congresses, and 
said among other things that the PDP was formed as part of a 
campaign of many years' resistance to inequality, assimilation, 
and repression, and as part of the successful efforts of 
patriots to raise the national and political awareness of the 
Albanians of these parts. By confronting the challenge of the 
rites of passage of the political system, despite all the 
visible and invisible traps, the PDP has passed the first test 
of democracy. I congratulate it on its success in the 
multiparty elections, in which it won 22 parliamentary seats in 
the Macedonian parliament, creating the opportunity for 
institutionalized political activity on the basis of its 
program. It is possible for a political party to reduce the 
scope of its interests to a ridiculous and absurd minimum, 
because of dogmatism, organization, ignorance, nepotism, 
careerism, personal or group interests, or mistaken judgments 
and alliances. The work of a political party is assessed by 
results, in other words by the maximilization of the interests 
of the people, social stratum, or nation that it represents. 
One might ask whether the PDP has done this. If we analyze the 
internal situation, the Albanians today cannot influence 
organizational matters of the state structure and their own 
position in the system. The communes exercise ceremonial 
functions, while the albanians have the status of a minority 
under the Constitutions. Their position in the parliament cannot 
be considered to be independent, because they are an appendix to 
another political party, with which they entered a coalition 
without a platform, something which is considered a strategic 
mistake. 
  In Macedonian foreign policy, the Albanians do not even 
figure as a factor requiring consultation. The Albanian 
language media are a mixture of official reports, kitsch, and 
disinformation. The situation is similar in other fields of 
life: in the economy, security, culture, sport, entertainment, 
etc. The degeneration of a project, a movement, or a party 
begins when general interests are seen as personal or group 
interests. There are many who assert that the PDP has fallen 
victim to such a decline. 
  The PDP has called an early congress to demonstrate the 
moral 
and political strength of the PDP and the Albanians for speedy 
regeneration. We hope this will be a congress of fast renewal, 
Menduh Thaci said in conclusion. 
  A debate lasting many hours then followed, offering 
different 
comments and proposals about the PDP's future policy. The 
congress elected a 55-member Central Assembly, and this Central 
Assembly, in a closed session, elected a 14-member presidium 
from among its ranks. Arber Xhaferi was elected PDP chairman, 
Nexhibe Delloshi, Menduh Thaci, and Shazim Mehmeti were elected 
deputy chairmen, and Sefedin Duka was elected secretary. The 
Assembly elected a nine- member Supervisory Council. 
  The congress ended its proceedings after midnight, at 0220. 
<H5>  The Other Congress </H5>
  The members of the congress who demanded respect for the 
statute as the PDP's basic document, after leaving the hall 
where the congress was being held, organized their own early PDP 
congress in the hall of the Tetovo Communal Assembly. After 
verifying the status of participants and electing a presidium 
and working groups, Ilir Luma, member of the Central Assembly, 
presented the report on the work of the PDP between the two 
congresses. Among other things, the report stressed the 
successes achieved by the party in the period under review and 
the realization of the Albanians' demands for sovereignty and 
equality. The report emphasized the successes in the 
parliamentary elections, in building the coalition government, 
in cooperation with other Albanian parties in the former 
Yugoslavia, in building a common strategy for action, and in 
affirming the Albanian cause in the international arena. The 
report also stressed the weaknesses that have harmed the party 
and led to a loss of influence among the people. These involved 
shortcomings of organization and coordination, and failures to 
harmonize standpoints between the party and the parliamentary 
group, to always present a united front on the international 
scene, and to respect agreements, program documents, etc. For 
this reason, it became necessary to hold this early congress, so 
that we my achieve our programmed goals with new people who 
enjoy the trust of the membership. 
  On the basis of a vote, the congress confirmed the mandates 
of the PDP Central Assembly, 37 of whose 55 members were 
present. The congress elected eleven members of a 15-member 
presidium (two seats were left for Gostivar, one for Kumanovo, 
and one for Struga, which will send delegates later). The 
Central Assembly elected Dr. Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of 
the Macedonian parliament, as PDP chairman, and Naser Zymberi as 
secretary, while two deputy chairmen are to be elected later. 
  The congress ended its proceedings at 2300. This congress 
did not approve a new program and statute, because those used 
hitherto remain in force. 
  Despite all the hopes and wishes that the PDP's crisis would 
be overcome and that this party would remain united as the main 
force defending the sovereignty, identity, and political will of 
the Albanians in Macedonia, this did not happen, and the PDP 
Second Congress will go down in history as a congress of 
division. The PDP split definitively into two currents, into 
two large sections, and a bitter struggle between the two is 
expected over which will represent the continuity and inherit 
the legality and legitimacy of the PDP. It is certain that this 
will weaken the political strength of the Albanians as a people 
in Macedonia, that the Albanians will not be able to produce 
joint candidates in the local and Macedonian parties will 
exploit this disarray.

  [Text] The Central Executive Bureau of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] held a meeting yesterday, 
which was also attended by the PDSR parliamentary groups, during 
which it adopted a declaration expressing the stance of that 
party regarding the open letter addressed to President Ion 
Iliescu by the leadership of the Greater Romania Party [PRM]. 
  After answering in detail all the issues raised in the 
letter, the declaration emphasizes that the PDSR has no other 
choice but take note of the fact that the PRM decided to suspend 
negotiations with the government party, a decision that was made 
by the PRM leadership, and therefore the responsibility for this 
act, as well as its consequences, lies exclusively with the nine 
members of the PRM Steering Committee. The declaration then 
says, quote, as a matter of fact, given the tone of the PRM 
leadership's letter, it is unlikely that we should find a basis 
for further dialogue, unquote. 
  The declaration concludes by expressing the hope that the 
members of the PRM will understand the stance of the PDSR as, in 
the past, PDSR and PRM deputies and senators had identical or 
similar positions regarding a number of draft bills. The 
declaration reassures those parliamentarians, as well as the 
other members of the PRM that the PDSR remains open to dialogue, 
but solely if the leaders of the PRM will show proof of their 
responsibility, of the fact that they are prepared to adopt 
sensible stances, and that they are really preoccupied by the 
real problems of the country in the current transition period.

<F P=106> [Text of "Letter From the Democratic Party in Response to </F>
the Invitation to Dialogue From the Social Democracy Party of 
Romania: The Country's Situation Is Much Too Serious for 
Discussions in General Terms"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Mr. Oliviu Gherman: The Democratic Party [PD] 
considers constant, frank, and direct dialogue as one of the 
principles of its policy as well as a condition for a sound and 
effective democratic life. We have repeatedly and publicly said 
that if civilized, principled, and constructive dialogue between 
the political forces and within the democratic institutions of 
the state governed by law does not exist, then differences turn 
into disputes, while disputes are transferred to the street to 
be solved with the help of violent means characteristic of the 
street. Within such a context, the PD -- by itself or together 
with other parties of the current opposition -- has repeatedly 
invited you to discuss our country's real problems and to 
jointly contribute to their solution. This is the spirit in 
which in October 1992 we participated in negotiations preceding 
the formation of the Vacaroiu government, in which we adopted 
the PD Declaration of 14 September 1993, edited the PD letter of 
3 January 1994 regarding the possibility of concluding a 
National Pact, and signed the joint declaration of the PD and 
the parliamentary parties of the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR] of 14 January 1994, which was addressed to the 
president of the republic. Numerous other communiques and 
public statements by the PD always reaffirmed its readiness for 
dialogue in general and for dialogue with the Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR] as the political formation that is 
currently holding the relative majority of parliamentary 
mandates in particular. 
  Thus, it was with hope that we welcomed your letter of 4 
February 1994, whereby you informed us about the offer of 
beginning official discussions between the PD and the PDSR. 
Unfortunately, your party's readiness is flagrantly at variance 
with all the concrete actions taken by this party, which are 
often full of hostility toward the PD and disloyalty toward the 
principles of a genuine democratic life. 
  Despite this contradiction, consistent with our own 
proposals 
for dialogue, we are ready to begin the discussions you mention 
in your letter and to rid our minds of all suspicion. 
  On the other hand, we believe that our country's situation 
is 
much too serious and decisive to conduct discussions in general 
terms as your suggest. 
  What we need today are not generalities, but specific 
solutions as a result of our courageous and responsible exchange 
of ideas, an exchange without any grudge, falseness, and 
preconceived ideas. Consequently, we propose -- as, in fact, you 
do -- that the agenda include the following points: 
  1. Identifying concrete ways and means to immediately begin 
tripartite PDSR-CDR-PD negotiations to conclude a National Pact 
like the one proposed by the PD in the open letter addressed to 
President Ion Iliescu on 3 January 1994 and to form a new 
government; 
  2. Deciding on actions aimed at restructuring the current 
parliamentary majority and setting up, on this basis, a new 
government that is able to take our economy out of the crisis, 
put an end to the daily needs and suffering of our citizens, and 
reestablish our country's credibility abroad, and that enjoys 
strong political support in the process of implementing its 
reform program by a credible, stable, and solid majority made up 
of the PDSR (34 percent of parliamentary mandates), the CDR (33 
percent of the parliamentary mandates), and the PD (14 percent 
of the parliamentary mandates); 
  3. The phenomenon of extremism in Romania's political arena; 
measures to isolate extremist pressure groups and preventing 
their access to the levers of power; 
  4. Guaranteeing genuine autonomy for local administration 
and working out tangible measures to stop any kind of political, 
government pressure on the administrative authorities emerged 
from the last local elections. 
  Given the importance of the subjects proposed and the 
extremely urgent need to solve them, we believe that the 
delegations that are going to represent our parties have to be 
made up of people with political experience and decisionmaking 
ability; they have to be invested with full powers to be able to 
make prompt decisions. In this sense, the PD has empowered the 
political department to set up the following delegation: Adrian 
Severin, PD vice president; Victor Babiuc, PD secretary; Eugen 
Dijmarescu, PD secretary; Bogdan Niculescu-Duvaz, PD secretary; 
Cristian Radulescu, PD secretary; and Ilie Stefan, PD deputy. 
  We propose that the first meeting take place on 18 February 
1994, at 1000 [0800 GMT] at PD Headquarters in Aleea Modrogan 
No. 1, Bucharest. 
  Looking forward to this desired dialogue, please accept the 
expression of our most distinguished sentiments. 
  President Petre Roman 
  14 February 1994

<F P=106> [Cristian Rautu report: "The Accusations Are Gross </F>
Inventions"] 
  [Text] "Beginning with a personal request, Mr. Vadim Tudor 
[senator and president of the Greater Romania Party -- PRM] has 
reached the point of a political war. I am an active military 
man, I am enjoined by the Constitution not to get involved in 
politics and I do not even intend to do that. Therefore, this 
war is waged unilaterally, without an adversary. All I can do 
is clarify things for the public, through decent means that are 
specific to the army. The accusations against me are gross 
inventions." This is a statement made by the minister of 
national defense, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, and was 
caused by the "war" being waged against the leadership of the 
Ministry of National Defense by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
through the pages of ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA. 
  Certainly it is unpleasant that such a stage has been 
reached. In similar situations, the prime minister of a Western 
government would have supported or dismissed one of the members 
of the government that he is heading, depending on whether the 
respective person had been accused without justification or had 
been accused on the basis of fact. Mr. Spiroiu chose a 
dignified way, rejecting point by point all the accusations 
against him. The Military Prosecuting Magistracy's 
investigation of the "Kent" affair has established that the 
renting of the storage rooms that belonged to the Autonomous 
Public Corporation "Romtechnica" (which is not subordinated to 
the Ministry of National Defense) was legal, the only violations 
resulted from customs tax evasion by Lebanese citizen Nassar 
Elias, who used fake stamps. The military cadres who are guilty 
of negligence, through which customs evasion could have been 
committed, have been removed from their positions and turned 
over to the appropriate legal authorities. The money 
representing the damage to the Romanian state was recovered 
entirely and Nassar Elias, after being arrested, paid a 
substantial penalty. The Lebanese citizen was able to benefit 
from the respective facilities because he was the brother of the 
person who represented Romania's best client, covering 95 
percent of the "special" trade that any arms producing country 
practices. 
  The Ministry of National Defense leadership was also accused 
of reducing the country's combat capability, whereas Romania did 
nothing except reducing combat technology in accordance with the 
provisions of the programs established under international 
treaties approved in the parliament. The minister of defense 
also denied those accusations regarding the import of tanks from 
Israel. On the contrary, our country exports tanks, and Romania 
has not imported anything from Israel except special technology 
required for the modernization of MIG-21s in Bacau, and it seems 
that Israel is the country that will purchase the Romanian 
IAR-109 that is currently being tested. The army's supply of 
equipment is ensured 74 percent by the national defense 
industry, which guarantees to fulfill export orders and provide 
products intended for civilian use. Mr. Spiroiu affirmed that 
he could not possibly damage the prestige of the army through an 
argument with Vadim Tudor at various district Tribunals, and 
therefore, he preferred the action that he has currently chosen. 
The only effect of Vadim's attacks was that, as was said at the 
news conference, "nobody in the Military Command reads ROMANIA 
MARE anymore." 
  Regarding the Partnership for Peace, Mr. Spiroiu said that 
Romania derives no advantage whatever from being the first to 
sign the document. There follows now the drafting of the 
presentation documents (a stage finalized by the Ministry of 
National Defense) after which, in the second half of this year, 
the partnership "contract" will be signed. Certainly, the whole 
nation is concerned about what is currently happening in the 
former Yugoslavia. Eventually, a NATO intervention seems 
imminent. In this case, it is well known that international 
accords provide that, in the event of an intervention of NATO 
troops in a certain country the neighbors of that country should 
not become involved. The National Defense Ministry leadership 
believes that in case of Sarajevo one should take into 
consideration only political-diplomatic solutions. 
  Romania has signed seven international military accords. As 
was stated at the news conference, another accord with Spain 
will be signed in Madrid in March. Mr. Spiroiu said that 
relations with Russia have continued uninterrupted. An accord 
with that country was missed twice. Once after the Moscow coup 
and the second time because of demonstrations in front of the 
Russian Embassy in Bucharest, where the Russian defense minister 
was expected. "An accord that is similar to the ones signed 
with the Netherlands and Spain will soon be concluded also with 
Russia," Mr.Spiroiu affirmed. 
  The restructuring process and the reform in the army also 
depend on the speed of implementation of the army law, the law 
on the status of conscripts, and people employed on a contract 
basis, as well as of four other specific laws. General Spiroiu 
claimed that structures similar to NATO will be achieved, that 
is, highly mobile units that would participate in actions under 
the aegis of the United Nations and CSCE. 
  Referring to a documentary broadcast on 30 December 1993 [on 
Marshal Antonescu's execution], the defense minister said that 
he did not know about it, although he is a government member and 
the respective documentary was produced by the government 
studios. As is known, the rehabilitation of General Antonescu 
provoked a certain reaction from Moses Rosen [chief rabbi of the 
Jewish Community of Romania], a reaction to which the minister 
of national defense did not respond because the military 
historians will do it and they will soon publish four volumes of 
documents referring to that troubled period in Romania's history. 
  It is worth mentioning that the Romanian Army contributed 
numerous documents to the Holocaust Museum in New York [city as 
published].

  [Text] The Army Higher Military Council met at the 
headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense today. A faxed 
communique from the Higher Military Council of the Romanian Army 
stresses that the meeting examined the attacks contained in the 
press communiques of the leadership of the Greater Romania Party 
[PRM] and in the slanderous and insulting articles published in 
the magazines owned by Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor -- ROMANIA MARE 
and POLITICA -- against generals and high-ranking officers in 
the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense, including 
the minister of defense. The speakers reported on the real 
situation in various spheres of military activity, about which 
these publications made denigrating allegations. The Higher 
Military Council considers those accusations totally groundless 
and an unprecedented act of political pressure aimed at 
hampering the implementation of the principles of reform in the 
military as well as the development of normal activities in the 
army. 
  The Higher Military Council also expresses its trust in the 
ministry's leadership and in the military cadres unjustly 
insulted and accused, the communique mentions among other things. 
  The Army Higher Military Council assures Romania's 
president, 
the other democratic institutions of the state, and the 
country's citizens that the army will remain an element of 
stability and support for the democratic progress of Romanian 
society, while persisting in continuing its own process of 
restructuring and modernization, despite all the inherent or 
artificially created hardships because of irresponsible actions 
-- the faxed communique from the Army Higher Military Council 
points out in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Adrian Halpert article: "In an Open Letter Adrian Nastase </F>
Assures Traian Chebeleu of His Support in Facing C.V. Tudor's 
`Objectionable' Attacks"] 
  [Text] "Esteemed Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, I would like 
to reassure you on this occasion too, of the affection I nurture 
for you. It is my duty to say this now, at a moment when your 
life and the work carried out by you are denigrated publicly in 
an abominable manner," reads the open letter that Adrian 
Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies, sent to Traian 
Chebeleu, the spokesman of President Ion Iliescu. 
  Without spelling out the name C.V. Tudor -- or of the 
magazine ROMANIA MARE, for that matter -- Adrian Nastase 
vehemently disapproved of the calumnies published in the 
aforementioned weekly about the presidency's spokesman: "You 
will always be above such calumny which, as far as you are 
concerned, will never be approved or believed." 
  In conclusion of the document sent to Traian Chebeleu, 
Adrian 
Nastase mentions: "I choose this way to write to you because I 
also wish to sound the alarm signal that has not been heard for 
a long time. Without suggesting actions that would limit the 
rights and the power of the press, I believe that it is 
necessary for the newspaper guild to display an ethical and 
concrete solidarity that should isolate and eliminate from the 
journalistic world the filthy attack -- no matter in what paper 
it is published -- that is multiplied on the rotary printing 
press."

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "From Antigone to Traian Chebeleu"] </F>
  [Text] After a silence that was called by a Bucharest 
newspaper unexplainable, Traian Chebeleu answered Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor's attacks. I do not want to stress the almost nine-page 
long text in which the Presidency's spokesman Traian Chebeleu 
finally fulfills one of his presumed duties: to be a man. 
However, I would like to remark that, after a quick glance at 
the text, I felt a certain exaggeration of the situation. 
Traian Chebeleu takes Corneliu Vadim Tudor's attack as a real 
classical tragedy. The ambassador appears before the broad 
public with a more disheveled face than Antigone. At one point, 
he reaches a stage when he apologizes to his family, relatives, 
and to his female and male colleagues with whom he used to work 
together. It is clear that he is moved by the flow of insults 
and calumnies that fell on his head. We would sympathize with 
him, cry together with him, and blow each other's noses, if the 
following problem did not crop up. For over two years several 
public figures in today's Romania, among them myself, have been 
defamed week after week by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. This 
pocket-size Zhirinovskiy however is the creation of President 
Ion Iliescu. Thanks to the president he revived from the 
political and journalistic death to which the 1989 revolution 
condemned him. Thanks to Ion Iliescu he won in the elections. 
Thanks to Ion Iliescu the legal bodies have not given justice 
to any of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's victims. Not even in the case 
that is crying to heaven through its clarity, namely the case of 
the former prosecutor general, Gheorghe Robu. How can the legal 
bodies start acting against Corneliu Vadim Tudor when he is the 
leader of a party that is allied with Ion Iliescu?! All this 
time, President Ion Iliescu has not made one single move that 
might indicate a break with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Ion Iliescu 
was happily rubbing his hands every time the PRM [Greater 
Romania Party] leader was slandering his political adversaries. 
He accepted that the PRM senator should jump to his help with 
his journalistic filth every time a journalist or a politician 
dared to remark that the president also makes mistakes 
sometimes. This discreet complicity gave Corneliu Vadim Tudor 
the enthusiasm to do what he wants in political life and in the 
field of journalism. And now, when the wave of filth is turning 
against his collaborators, the president, through Traian 
Chebeleu, shows signs of unrest. Thus, no matter how much our 
souls would wish to deplore the presidency's spokesman, we can 
say nothing else except that his tragic posture is ridiculous. 
Just as ridiculous as the letter of solidarity addressed to 
Chebeleu by Adrian Nastase. As far as I know, Adrian Nastase is 
the leader of a party [PDSR -- Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] that is allied with the PRM. He was, until recently, 
in close unity of ideas and feelings with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. 
Now, when one of the president's men is attacked, he sends that 
person a letter of solidarity. We would have expected something 
else from the man called Adrian Nastase. For example, we would 
have expected the radical move of a political breakup with the 
PRM. However, such a move involves certain risks, for example 
to lose the support granted to the PDSR by the PRM. How can 
Adrian Nastase assume such a risk? It is much more comfortable 
and cozy to send a letter of solidarity to Traian Chebeleu. I 
would have not written about the answer of the Presidency's 
spokesman if, in the end of his humdrum, he had not referred to 
my person and to the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI publication. Suddenly, 
sliding into the tricky field of psychology, Mr. Traian Chebeleu 
assumes that I have a spiritual impulse. Namely, that allegedly 
I have reproduced "with an undisguised pleasure" the insults and 
objectionable expressions used by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in the 
several hundred thousand issues of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily. 
Traian Chebeleu is just as poor a psychologist as a politician. 
The president's spokesman did not understand anything of our 
journalistic action. If the insult "oral sex" had been 
formulated by just any journalist, I would not have noticed it. 
As I have often mentioned in the columns of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, 
the incredible insult belongs not to any journalist but a 
political figure, namely the leader of a party, moreover, who, 
through the goodwill of the PDSR, is also secretary of the 
Senate. More than that, taking into consideration the 
negotiations of the PDSR with its left-oriented allies, starting 
1 March this person might become a minister. Both through the 
information published, as well as through my editorials I have 
drawn attention to the fact that we are facing an incredible 
case of degradation of Romanian political life. We have not 
simply reproduced Corneliu Vadim Tudor's despicable words, but 
published an information about an unusual event. Through this 
fact we warned not only about the hole into which Romanian 
political life might fall, but also about the idiotic things 
that Corneliu Vadim Tudor might commit once he gets to power.

  [Text] Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI], visited the counties of Dolj and 
Gorj a few days ago to replace the chiefs of the SRI in those 
counties. The tour is continuing. 
  Virgil Magureanu yesterday replaced the SRI director in 
Valcea, the official reason being the inefficient use of state 
funds. Sources close to the SRI leadership have informed us that 
in the coming days Virgil Magureanu will visit the counties of 
Braila and Galati for the same purpose: to replace the chiefs 
of the SRI in these two counties. 
  It is worth mentioning that the five chiefs of SRI branches 
are joined by a further two such chiefs, who were replaced in 
the counties of Neamt and Vaslui a few weeks ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry State Secretary Janos </F>
Martonyi by Jozsef Martin; place and date not given: "Janos 
Martonyi's Statement Before Peter Boross's French Visit -- Our 
Relations With Paris Are Constantly Improving"] 
  [Excerpts] "Throughout history, our relations with France 
have never been as good as now," said Foreign Ministry State 
Secretary Janos Martonyi who recently held bilateral 
consultations in Paris. We asked him on this occasion, shortly 
before Prime Minister Peter Boross's official visit to Paris, to 
assess our relations with France. 
  [Martin] How do relations with France fit into the system of 
Hungarian foreign politics? 
  [Martonyi] We continue to see French relations as a cardinal 
element of Hungary's foreign relations. I could also phrase it 
this way: Paris has two dimensions from Budapest's point of 
view, one is bilateral relations, and the other is that France 
is one of the determining factors in our Europe policy. 
  As for bilateral relations, it has been said many times 
that, 
throughout history, Hungarian-French relations have never been 
as good as now. And these relations are constantly improving. 
Consulting with the general secretary of the Foreign Ministry a 
few days ago, we established that our views are identical on 
most issues, although some differences of approach exist on 
certain issues. 
  Therefore, in my view, we cannot do much more in the area of 
bilateral relations, except encouraging more capital investment 
by French investors, and we try to improve domestic conditions 
for this. We continue to try to strengthen the French presence 
in Hungary from the economic, financial, trade, cultural, 
political, and psychological points of view equally. I believe 
that there is also much improvement in the public view in our 
societies: The French image in Hungary has never been as good 
as now, and I trust that Hungary's image is also good in France, 
apart from some minor disturbing factors. However, the latter 
apply to all Central Eastern Europe, not specifically to 
Hungary. [passage omitted] 
  [Martin] For many decades, Hungary was not France's chosen 
state in Central Eastern Europe. Bucharest was France's number 
one partner. Can you see any change in this area? 
  [Martonyi] In my view, Hungarian-French relations have gone 
through a qualitative improvement in the past three to four 
years. We have never made it our goal to improve these relations 
to the detriment of other countries. To the contrary, in our 
view, French politics that are much more balanced than in the 
past can contribute with increasing efficiency in resolving our 
problems. We saw this in the Balladur plan from the first 
moment, this is why we still support this proposal. In other 
words, we do not want to improve our relations with France by 
worsening relations with others, and I do not even wish to 
evaluate the way Paris assesses the current situation in Romania 
and the most recent change of government in Bucharest. Our 
interest is that views on Central Europe generally improve. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Martin] From the implementation of the Balladur plan, 
Hungarian diplomacy expects the improvement of the life of 
national minorities living in the neighboring countries. 
However, it seems that a number of Western European countries 
and institutions would prefer to step back in granting national 
minority rights. Is there a danger that a document will again 
be prepared that is not adhered to? 
  [Martonyi] Risks do exist, but we can exclude the 
possibility of the situation becoming worse after an initiative 
like this. We have to seize all opportunities, in the Council 
of Europe and in other places. We trust that, even if slowly 
and with difficulties, progress can be made: This is Hungarian 
diplomacy's basic strategic goal. We need to be very 
industrious. As regards the final outcome of the European Union 
plan that is launched from the French prime minister's proposal, 
I might be more optimistic than the average European. In my 
view, this is a correct idea that wants to make up for a 
deficiency and it can take us closer to the solution. Naturally, 
if the necessary willingness to cooperate is completely missing 
from the participants, there is a risk that we will not be able 
to make any progress. However, this cannot mean that we will 
not try. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The Hungarian Government's controversial 
decision to incorporate the army's high command into the Defense 
Ministry was an unexpected development, indicated journalist 
Akos Tomory in the 22 January issue of the weekly HETI 
VILAGGAZDASAG (HVG). Tomory said that the merger was announced 
in January, shortly after the National Assembly passed the new 
defense law by a vast majority, because the government wanted to 
"strike while the iron is hot" and take full advantage of the 
stipulation in the new law that gives the defense minister the 
authority "to develop the high command of the army." Although 
the law does not specifically call for the merger, the 
government's view, Tomory said, was that the "six-party 
consensus" on the law--forged during two years of difficult 
interparty negotiations--provides a broad-based mandate for the 
reorganization. The move is the latest "in a series of 
successes," Tomory said, for the political leadership of the 
Defense Ministry, which took an active part in negotiating the 
defense law and managed to "reach a consensus with the military 
policy experts of the parliamentary parties without having to 
give in" on key points relating to the authority of the Defense 
Ministry. 
  The government's plan, according to statements made to HVG 
by 
Rudolf Joo, administrative state secretary in the Defense 
Ministry, calls for two major divisions within the Defense 
Ministry: a "civil service-state administration department, 
which is headed by the administrative state secretary," and a 
separate "department consisting of the officers of the ex-army 
command." The latter, according to Joo, will be headed by the 
highest-ranking officer, who will have the rank of state 
secretary and will be subordinate to the defense minister. Thus, 
Tomory commented, "two parallel hierarchies seem to be 
developing within the Defense Ministry, which will have a 
civilian character by virtue of the fact that the minister of 
defense holds the two halves together." 
  The article reports that in some quarters the plan has been 
received with considerable skepticism. The government's goal of 
"ending parallel commands" and "strengthening civilian control 
over the military" could be "self-defeating," critics claim, 
because it creates the "danger" that "the ministry will be 
militarized." In fact, Tomory reported, according to some 
military "experts" who "do not wish to be named," it is not even 
clear "which organization is being incorporated into the other 
one." Moreover, in the opinion of these critics, the plan to 
have two separate organizational departments within the Defense 
Ministry will be difficult to work out in practice. "At the 
moment, it is not even possible to know what kind of subordinate 
and supervisory relations might develop between the 
civil-service civilian employees and those transferred from the 
military command." It appears that "one-half to two-thirds of 
the employees of the new Ministry of Defense (presently 320 
employees work in the Ministry of Defense while 800 work at Army 
Headquarters) would stick out of the usual ministerial 
hierarchy." 
  While the restructuring details are unclear, it is certain 
that the merger enables the government to get rid of high-level 
holdovers from the communist-era military command. The 
government has already announced, Tomory reported, that the 
present commander of the army, Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, 
will be retired as soon as he reaches the minimum retirement age 
of 55 this month--thus ending the controversy that erupted two 
years ago over whether or not the government has the right to 
fire him. According to State Secretary Joo, Tomory reported, one 
proof of the "correctness" of the merger is that it facilitates 
the personnel changes that the former communists want to avoid. 
The Hungarian Socialist Party--which is a successor of the 
formerly ruling communist party and which has a chance of 
winning the May election--is the one party that wants military 
leadership changes to take place "only after the next election," 
Joo asserted.

  [Excerpts] Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the

short visit to Bratislava. [passage omitted] 
  President Michal Kovac received Yevgeniy Primakov in the 
afternoon. He briefed the Russian guest about the fact that the 
Slovak intelligence service has concluded an agreement with the 
counterintelligence service of the Russian Federation. The 
agreement concerns above all the exchange of employees in charge 
of contacts between the two services. The Slovak intelligence 
service keeps similar contacts with other intelligence services. 
  Presidential spokesman Anton Bodis told us that during talks 
the view was voiced that our cooperation will not be used 
against third countries. 
  After the talks we asked Yevgeniy Primakov to comment on the 
latest information concerning the fact that Russian spying 
activities had been uncovered in the United States. 
  [Begin Primakov recording in Russian, fading to Slovak 
translation] On this subject I can only say that I heard this 
information only after my arrival here. I have no knowledge of 
those names, I have never heard them, so it is obvious that I 
cannot tell you anything before my return to Moscow. [end

  [Text] Today in Bratislava, Augustin Marian Husak, deputy 
speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, received 
in the parliamentary building Yevgeniy Primakov, director of the 
Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation. 
(Tatyana Samolis), Yevgeniy Primakov's spokeswoman, stressed 
that talks on cooperation between Russian and Slovak 
intelligence services were in no case aimed against third 
countries. She described the fight against international crime 
as forming the priority area of cooperation. At the same time, 
she denied that the talks had any connection with the present 
political situation in Slovakia, one of the reasons being that 
the visit was prepared some time ago. Later, our editor Ivan 
Samel interviewed Augustin Marian Huska about the content of the 
discussion: 
  [Begin recording] [Huska] The main concern of the discussion 
was to ensure that such a delicate area as the area of mutual 
relations in the field of information, the provision of 
confidential information, and the like assumes a level 
corresponding to that existing in democratic countries. We 
talked about the geopolitical situation of Slovakia and Russia. 
We expressed our desire that we no longer support the polarity 
that existed in the world previously. 
  [Samel] You talked about geopolitical interests. Did you 
also hear any negative comments concerning possible Slovakia's 
entry into NATO? 
  [Huska] We made it on the whole quite clear that there was 
in 
the Slovak National Council a majority will to achieve 
integration in European economic and defense structures. Our 
guest did not voice any objections to it. 
  [Samel] Did you talk only about cooperation between the 
intelligence services at a political level, or were 
consultations on the fight against drugs and similar matters 
also discussed? 
  [Huska] One could say that topic formed the biggest part of 
the problem where cooperation is needed most. We both have 
recognized that we are not professional enough to conduct the 
fight against organized international crime. 
  [Samel] Did you also talk about some questions concerning 
the 
internal political situation in this country, and did this visit 
have any connection with this situation? 
  [Huska] We talked about these matters only marginally in the 
sense that stability is very fragile or, to put it better, that 
the political situation both in this country and in Russia is 
unstable and that what we are endeavoring to achieve in Slovakia 
is to create a consensus among political parties and movements 
so that the interest of the state becomes a category that is not 
subject to contention between individual political forces. 
  [Samel] Do you not regard it as dangerous to a certain 
degree 
to establish certain contacts at this delicate level precisely 
in the situation of instability, and here I have in mind 
instability in Russia? 
  [Huska] The problem lies simply in whether we should wait 
until various sections of Russian or Chechen mafias establish 
themselves in this country. 
  [Samel] That is clear from our viewpoint, but what was the 
interest on the Russian side? 
  [Huska] To check to what extent parliamentary bodies 
indentify themselves with the overall trend towards the 
elimination of polarization in Europe, with the overall trend 
towards Europe drawing closer together, and towards the 
protection of state interests. The notion about the 
inviolability of frontiers made by both sides was very 
important. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Lubo Rabay in Beijing: "Asian Opportunity"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Slovak delegation made 
use of the 16-hour flight to Beijing with stopovers in Moscow 
and Tashkent for working meetings with representatives of Russia 
and Uzbekistan. As Prime Minister Meciar confirmed to us later 
on the plane, the talks with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Y. F. 
Yarov concerned, above all, the issue of reducing Slovakia's 
trade deficit with Russia, which amounts to approximately 30 
billion [Slovak korunas]. "In the course of 1993 we had 
prepared 26 legal documents in the interest of a new quality of 
cooperation between Russia and Slovakia. The time has finally 
come to apply them in practice," Vladimir Meciar stressed. 
  The talks at Moscow airport also concerned privatization 
plans and, in particular, further cooperation in nuclear 
engineering. "The Russians are ready to accept payment in kind 
for nuclear fuel and they will also accept spent fuel from us," 
Vladimir Meciar specified in reply to a question from PRAVDA. 
"The issue of Russian participation in the completion of the 
Mochovce nuclear power station remains disputed. While the 
first and the second unit are 90 percent complete, the question 
of the other two units remains open. The Russians' interest in 
further participation in the Slovak nuclear program was 
emphasized in exceptionally strong terms. They offered us an 
interest-free loan of $100 million." 
  In view of the known fact that French and German partners 
are 
to participate in the completion of the first two units of the 
Mochovce nuclear power station, which is to be covered by a 
credit of 1.3 billion German marks, we asked how the nuclear 
safety of the other two units should be dealt with, under this 
Russian proposal. "The technology of the power station would be 
Russian but the safety equipment would be from Siemens. This 
would be interesting for the Russian side because they would 
then be able to use this model in building and rebuilding their 
own nuclear power stations." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Fourth installment of "Report on the Fulfillment of Tasks </F>
of the Slovak Republic's Foreign Policy," delivered by Slovak 
Foreign Minister Moravcik to parliament in Bratislava on 2 
February: "Slovakia in the World (IV)"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  2.1 Relations With Neighbors </H5>
  One of the most important tasks in the bilateral sphere and 
in foreign policy, in general, was the formation and maintenance 
of good relations with neighboring countries. Although our 
cooperation has been gradually acquiring an international 
character, the Czech Republic remained our most important 
partner. The tendency to standardize our mutual relations and 
gradually eliminate the specific features is gaining in strength 
particularly on the Czech side. Certain international 
appearances, however, of the Czech Republic in support of the 
Slovak Republic can be classified as signs of good cooperation. 
  The volume of mutual trade indicates a halt in the original 
decline that followed the partition of the federation. A better 
and broader utilization of the customs union could favorably 
affect the speed and quality of the incorporation into the 
Western integration structures. The Treaty on a Temporary 
License To Conduct Business for Natural and Legal Persons Who 
Conduct Business on the Territory of the Other Republic of the 
Former Federation After 31 December 1993 was added at the end of 
the year to the complex of the treaties signed with the Czech 
Republic so far. On the whole, the division of the property of 
the former federation (98 percent completed) can also be rated 
favorably, although the most recent problems are not getting 
solved as fast as desired. 
  The talks on an umbrella agreement regarding the border 
regime between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic have 
progressed slowly because of the difference in approach to this 
issue by the two parties. The problem of setting the amount of 
administrative fees has been solved, however, for the 
applications by citizens for permanent or long-term residence on 
the territory of the other republic. 
  To designate the common border, a Slovak-Czech demarcation 
commission has been established, which managed to define 
successfully the international border between the Slovak 
Republic and the Czech Republic. The last four questionable 
instances in this area are currently being solved. 
  The mutual cultural ties are very close; albeit, the 
reduction of the information flow and the mutual communication 
threatens their firmness. Because Slovakia wishes to continue 
presenting its culture to the citizens of the Czech Republic and 
reinforce the spiritual identity of the expatriate community, 
fundamental steps were taken to initiate the work of a Slovak 
Cultural Center in Prague beginning on 1 January 1994. 
  During the year, several working meetings of representatives 
of the two states at all levels took place, including three 
meetings of the presidents. 
  Despite all endeavors and conciliatory measures by the 
Slovak 
Republic, the mutual mistrust and tense atmosphere in relations 
with the Hungarian Republic could not be overcome. This is 
indicated especially by the approach taken by the Hungarian 
side, which was clearly dictated by the effort to challenge the 
credibility of Slovakia at international forums, the emphasis 
put on the problem of the rights of the Hungarian ethnic 
minority by the unnecessary dramatization of some less 
considerate unpremeditated steps by the Slovak side (the removal 
of signs, for instance), and the fueling of the irredentist 
tendencies of some representatives of the Hungarian parties in 
Slovakia. Hungarian diplomacy used international forums to 
complicate the starting position of Slovakia (CSCE, Council of 
Europe, Central European Initiative), and this stand adversely 
marked the entire development of mutual relations. 
  The decidedly negative interpretation of the construction of 
the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project was successfully vanquished, 
however, and depoliticized by submitting the conflict for 
decision by the International Court of Justice at The Hague. 
The reliability of the arguments by the Hungarian Republic has 
diminished recently as regards the need for the reinforcement of 
the defense and the status of the Hungarian ethnic minorities in 
the neighboring countries--that is, also in Slovakia. 
  Because of the aforementioned tension in mutual relations, 
no 
official highest-level meetings have taken place this year, 
except for some brief meetings of the prime ministers and 
foreign ministers at multilateral forums and the participation 
of our supreme representatives at the funeral of the deceased 
Hungarian Prime Minister J. Antall. 
  The basis for mutual relations with the Polish Republic is a 
good neighborhood without any open problems and joint efforts to 
integrate into the West European structures. Nonetheless, not 
all activities have been conducted according to the expectations 
of both parties, as the Polish partners reckon with a more 
active part on our side. The volume of trade declined, which is 
a result of the restructuring of both economies and also the 
absence of treaties in the economic sphere. A recovery in this 
area should be helped by the opening of new border crossings 
according to the schedule approved by the government in October. 
  A certain revival in our relations can be expected in the 
near future because treaties are ready on cross-border 
cooperation, the small border contact, and we are preparing the 
opening of a Slovak institute in Warsaw. The activity in other 
sectors leaves something to be desired. 
  Of the Polish officials, President Walesa visited Slovakia 
with the Polish foreign minister on the occasion of the 
inauguration of the president. Deputy Prime Minister R. Kovac 
visited Poland. 
  The development of relations with Austria continued its 
favorable trend. Contacts have been vitalized at all levels and 
in all areas because, from the very beginning, the Slovak 
diplomacy has been aware of the specific character of 
cooperation with this country, which is our only neighbor with a 
developed market economy and democratioc traditions, and a 
future member of the European Union. The foreign political 
importance of Austria increased also by many countries 
accrediting their ambassadors to the Slovak Republic in Vienna 
because many foreign observers and journalists also operate from 
there. Moreover, Vienna is the seat of numerous international 
organizations. 
  The official visits by the Slovak prime minister to Austria 
and the Austrian federal president and the foreign minister to 
the Slovak Republic helped in the quest for possibilities of 
cooperation, as did the participation of Slovak officials at the 
international undertakings in Vienna (UN Human Rights 
Conference, Council of Europe Summit, and so forth). 
International ties have also developed briskly, and this was 
reflected in the signing of numerous treaties on cooperation. 
  Austria has become the largest foreign investor in Slovakia 
and the third-largest business partner, but Slovakia has not 
managed to eliminate the mutual trade deficit. The interchange 
between the infrastructures of the two countries has also 
progressed at a slow pace. The feeling of an environmental 
threat to Austria on the part of Slovakia, to which some 
ambiguous statements from our side contributed, remains an open 
question. The problems with filling the post of Slovak 
ambassador to Austria also had an adverse effect on our mutual 
relations. 
  The specific feature of our relations with Ukraine lies in 
the fact that ties were established between two new states with 
a similar state-forming process and political and economic 
problems. In the course of 1993, practically all spheres of 
political, economic, and cultural life became active as the 
appropriate treaties were drafted. The Treaty on Good 
Neighborliness, Friendly Relations, and Cooperation merits 
special mention, as do the treaties on problems concerning the 
state border, including the readmission treaty, and several 
ministerial treaties. 
  We have managed neither to settle the matter of permeability 
of the state border with Ukraine nor to process a concept of new 
border crossings. The border problems have been further 
complicated by the disaster on the Uh River. 
  The Slovak president visited Kiev, and numerous meetings 
took 
place between Cabinet members and their Ukrainian partners. 
<H5>  2.2 Relations With the European Union </H5>
  Another priority of foreign policy of the Slovak Republic 
has 
been and remains the integration into the West European 
political, economic, and security structures. We have advanced 
on the road to this objective by signing the European 
(Association) Treaty on the association of the Slovak Republic 
with the European Union in October 1993. For this reason, we 
have paid extraordinary attention also to the establishment of 
good bilateral relations with individual countries of the 
European Twelve. 
  The relations with our former neighbor, the FRG, maintained 
their somewhat privileged nature. 
  A material framework of the bilateral relations is formed by 
the Treaty on Good Neighborliness and Cooperation Between the 
Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the FRG, on the basis of 
which an actualization--that is, signing of additional 
treaties--is being discussed. 
  The most significant contact actions have probably been the 
visit by the Slovak president to the FRG, the meeting between 
the foreign ministers, and numerous meetings and talks between 
other ministers. Closer ties have also been formed between the 
parliaments of the two countries. 
  The ties between the Slovak Republic and the individual 
Bundeslaender have been developing well, particularly with 
Bavaria, where the cooperation of individual sectors is further 
advanced within the framework of the Slovak-Bavarian working 
team. The visit by Slovak Prime Minister Meciar to Munich, 
where he also met with Bavarian Prime Minister E. Stoiber, 
confirmed the solid basis for such cooperation. Recently, we 
have registered an increased interest in the Slovak Republic on 
the part of other FRG laender as demonstrated by the visits of 
delegations from Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia 
to Bratislava. 
  In the second half of the year, the interest of the FRG in 
cooperation with the Slovak Republic in the economic sphere 
appreciably increased. This is also corroborated by the 
establishment of a German economic mission in Bratislava and a 
branch office of the Kreditny ustav pre obnovu a rozvoj [Credit 
Institute for Reconstruction and Development] at the FRG Embassy 
in Bratislava. In October 1993, the FRG assumed second place in 
the volume of investment in the Slovak economy and is the 
second-largest trade partner of the Slovak Republic. There was 
very active communication on the level of the business sphere. 
  The compensation to Slovak citizens, former 
concentration-camp prisoners, remains an open question. The 
German side holds a relatively reserved stand and points out the 
complex internal political economic situation. Similarly, the 
question of employment of Slovak citizens working on contract in 
the FRG must be resolved, while an increase to numbers 
comparable with other Visegrad Four countries could not be 
attained so far. 
  During the short time of the existence of an independent 
representation office of the Slovak Republic, we have succeeded 
in building an efficient representation and a wide network of 
contacts. Nonetheless, the appointment of a Slovak ambassador to 
the FRG has not yet been resolved. This state of affairs is 
perceived adversely by the German side, and, to a certain 
degree, it refutes the attained results. 
  The level of mutual relations with France rose after the 
emergence of the Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993. That is 
testified to by the extensive contact activity by members of the 
Slovak Government. The fundamental objective of Slovak foreign 
policy concerning France in 1993 was the use of the potential of 
the declared French political support for the endeavors of 
Slovakia to integrate into the European integration structures 
in the admission into the Council of Europe, the signing of the 
European Treaty on Association of the Slovak Republic with the 
European Union, and the development of high-level bilateral 
contacts. 
  France does not see any difference in the readiness of the 
Visegrad Four countries to join NATO and the Western European 
Union, but for now it will not support their membership in these 
structures. 
  Regarding the Slovak Republic, France points out the 
uncertain political and economic situation, ambiguities in 
legislation, obfuscated privatization, and unsolved problems in 
the sphere of minority policy. 
  In this context, it must be pointed out that the French 
partners are not quite clear about the "rules of the game"; the 
cooperation rules have not been defined, and they feel that they 
are not treated as equals. Following the official visits by 
then Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Minister Delegate for 
European Affairs Alain Lamassoure to the Slovak Republic, and 
the official visit by the Slovak foreign minister to France in 
1993, the Slovak Foreign Ministry plans for 1994 a meeting of 
presidents and prime ministers of the two countries. 
  Parliamentary cooperation has developed between individual 
sectors--interior, defense, education (Treaty on Cooperation in 
the Area of Youth, Physical Education, and Sport was signed on 1 
November 1993), and others. 
  Despite the cutback in the sphere of technical assistance, 
several projects have been realized in the Slovak Republic in 
1993, particularly in the spheres of education, culture, 
environmental protection, agriculture, and public administration. 
  There are no unsolved issues in the sphere of bilateral 
relations between Great Britain and Slovakia. A significant 
stimulus for the development of the relationship was the visit 
by the prime minister to London on 8 March 1993. He met with 
British Prime Minister John Major; Michael Heseltine, British 
president of the Board of Trade; EBRD [European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development] President Jacques Attali; and 
representatives of the Confederation of British Industry. Other 
significant contacts include the visit by Archibald Hamilton, 
minister of state for armed forces, to the Slovak Republic, and 
several meetings between other ministers. 
  From the political point of view, Great Britain is an 
important partner as a member of the European structures the 
Slovak Republic is interested in joining (European Union, NATO, 
Western European Union). The interests of Britain differ in 
certain instances from those of other members of these groupings 
and often coincide with the interests of the Slovak Republic 
(for example, expansion of the European Union membership, 
liberalization of trade). 
  The assistance provided by Great Britain through the 
Know-How 
fund in many spheres of public administration is considerable. 
  The image of Slovakia in the UK has somewhat improved during 
the year. Although the not-very-good economic situation is 
still pointed out, and the domestic political situation is not 
characterized as stable, the membership of Slovakia in 
international organizations, to which the country was admitted 
during 1993, has been emphasized all the time more frequently. 
  The significant official visits by our top-ranking 
representatives to Belgium confirmed our endeavors to integrate 
into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. There was the 
visit by the Slovak president on the occasion of the funeral of 
King Baudouin I and the meetings during his visit to NATO, the 
meeting between the Slovak prime minister and his Belgian 
counterpart, and the talks between the Slovak foreign minister 
and his Belgian counterpart. There were ties established also 
between individual ministers. 
  Relations between the two countries can be described as 
problem-free. 
  The development of relations with Luxembourg took a similar 
course. Although the intensity of contacts was not very high, a 
visit by the heir to the throne, Prince Henri, to the Slovak 
Republic took place, and a working visit to Luxembourg by the 
Slovak prime minister. Various important economic and business 
contacts were established on these occasions. 
  After 1 January 1993, contacts with the Netherlands 
generally 
amplified, as witnessed by the official visit by Dutch Foreign 
Minister Kooijmans to the Slovak Republic, which created the 
framework for further development of mutual cooperation. 
Certain favorable shifts in Dutch public opinion regarding the 
Slovak Republic were registered. The Slovak Republic used 
within the framework of the PSO [expansion unknown] bilateral 
noninvestment aid in the amount of 3 million Dutch guilders. 
  The activities of the Foreign Ministry were aimed in the 
relationship with Greece at forming prerequisites for an actual 
support for Slovak endeavors to integrate quickly into the 
European structures with respect to the Greek chairmanship of 
the European Union beginning on 1 January 1994. These questions 
and bilateral relations were on the agenda of the meeting of 
foreign ministers of the two countries in Athens in June. 
  In the course of 1993, fundamental ties were established to 
Spain. Except for the meeting between foreign ministers at the 
48th UN General Assembly, however, no significant contacts took 
place, and the present level of mutual relations is not 
satisfactory. Cooperation in the economic sphere is 
characterized by passivity on both sides and negligible interest 
in developing actual contacts, while such an intensification 
could be interesting for us because of the experience of Spain 
with a transformation of the economy. Contractual relations are 
also stagnating. A certain improvement could be detected in the 
contacts between the Ministries of the Economy, Education and 
Science, and Culture. 
  Our relations with Portugal can be characterized in a 
similar 
manner, despite a certain promise of an improvement by 
occasional highest-level meetings at multilateral forums: a 
meeting between the presidents in Washington, the prime 
ministers in Vienna, and the foreign ministers at the UN in New 
York. A favorable impulse was the visit by the Portuguese state 
secretary of trade to the Slovak Republic. He reported an 
interest of Portuguese enterprises in privatization. 
  Bilateral relations with Ireland have not developed. 
<H3>  2.3 Relations With Other States in Europe, North America, 
and the Commonwealth of Independent States </H3>
  In relations with other countries in Europe, Slovak 
diplomacy 
supported the endeavors for furthering possibilities of contacts 
in both political and economic spheres. In some countries, we 
wanted to create the appropriate framework for launching a 
dialogue and creating opportunities for the expansion of 
contacts in the future. Thus, cooperation was launched with 
Turkey, Cyprus, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], the Baltic states, and the Scandinavian 
countries. In some instances, high-level meetings have already 
taken place. 
  In relations with our traditional partners, we have tried 
to maintain the position of the Slovak Republic, and, if 
possible, use it for mutual support on the international scene. 
All aspects of contacts have been developed with Slovenia, with 
which we are tied by considerable common political and economic 
interests, and with Romania, where a significant progress was 
recorded in our mutual relations, including highest-level 
meetings. As a result of the domestic political situation, our 
contacts with Bulgaria somewhat stagnated. 
  Our relations with the Holy See have improved after our 
president's official visit to the Vatican, and the meeting 
between the Slovak prime minister with the state secretary of 
the Holy See, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. We have also established 
diplomatic ties with the Sovereign Order of Knights of Malta and 
the Republic of San Marino. 
  The contacts with Switzerland are developing similarly well. 
We have established contacts in the economic sphere, 
parliamentary cooperation, and cooperation on the level of towns 
and communities. The representatives of the Slovak Republic and 
Switzerland met unofficially during the World Economic Forum in 
Davos, and the Economic Forum in Crans Montana, attended by the 
Slovak prime minister and several ministers. Slovak Prime 
Minister Meciar met on this occasion with Swiss President Ogli. 
  Regarding the position of both North American states in the 
world political, economic, and security relations, we have 
considered the relations with them a priority. Foreign policy 
of the Slovak Republic toward the United States of America was 
built on the fact that although Slovakia is one of the successor 
states to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, it is perceived 
as a new entity that must establish itself on the international 
political, security, and economic scene. The second factor 
affecting contacts with the United States was the influence of 
the United States on the present arrangement of the world and 
its decisive position within the framework of numerous 
international organizations and institutions, which the Slovak 
Republic wants to join, or whose support it would like to gain 
(United Nations, NATO, IMF, World Bank, etc.). This corresponds 
to the frequency of visits by World Bank representatives in the 
course of the year. The Slovak president visited the United 
States on the occasion of the opening of the Holocaust Museum, 
the Slovak prime minister visited there, and so did the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic chairman (three times), the 
Slovak foreign minister on the occasion of the admission of 
Slovakia to the United Nations and at the 48th UN General 
Assembly, and four other ministerial visits. 
  The interest of the U.S. side focused on the sphere of 
economic assistance and cooperation with the Slovak Republic. 
The most important visits from the United States can be 
considered the mixed delegation of the Department of Defense and 
the Department of State headed by Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense Slocombe, whose members were able to acquaint themselves 
with the orientation of the Slovak Republic in the sphere of 
security policy and the orientation of the Army of the Slovak 
Republic towards a compatibility of the army systems with the 
NATO structures, and the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export and the IMF expert team missions. 
  The relations with the United States are regulated by some 
30 
treaties, of which 11 have been signed since November 1989. 
  Because of the position of the Slovak Republic as a new 
entity, in addition to the economic indicators, the United 
States is also interested in the protection of human rights 
here, freedom of speech, and minority rights. Despite positive 
signals from the U.S. representatives towards the Slovak 
Republic, in the political sphere, the exceptions in the 
assessment of the sphere of the protection of human rights and 
minorities, media policy, and the privatization process could 
not be completely eliminated (see the CSCE Commission report to 
the U.S. Congress). 
  There are also great reserves in the sphere of cooperation 
with individual states of the United States, where only the 
framework treaty with Maryland facilitates a broader economic 
cooperation than the current one. 
  A problem of the Slovak Republic from this point of view 
is, in particular, the lack of coordination of information flows 
abroad. The latent apprehensions about the development of 
democracy in the Slovak Republic are contributed to also by some 
statements and measures by the highest representatives of the 
Slovak Republic in the sphere of human rights and media policy. 
  Despite the status of Canada in the world, the Slovak 
Republic's relations with this country at the highest level, as 
well as relations with the Canadian representative mission, 
which is based in Prague, have been only sporadic. That was 
due, in particular, to the perception of the Slovak Republic as 
the destroyer of the common state and to the drawing of 
parallels with the efforts of Quebec to gain independence within 
the framework of the Canadian federation. 
  The Slovak Republic is perceived in Canada as a politically 
integral part of the group of Visegrad Four, though one that is 
economically weaker, and one responds with understanding to the 
efforts of the Slovak Republic to become integrated into West 
European structures. 
  In May 1993 the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), the 
most important Canadian economic organization guaranteeing 
Canadian exporters' credits, included the Slovak Republic among 
high-risk countries and refused to provide guarantees, thereby 
virtually halting trade exchange. This suspension [of export 
credit guarantees] has jeopardized the implementation of many 
projects. This EDC attitude changed only at the beginning of 
November, following the September 1993 visit by a delegation of 
Slovak bankers headed by the governor of the Slovak National 
Bank. In 1994 it is therefore possible to expect a revival of 
economic relations and the provision of credits by Canadian 
banks. 
  Cooperation at the level of government departments should be 
based on a clear definition of the Slovak Republic's priorities 
not only vis-a-vis Canada as a whole, but also vis-a-vis 
Canadian provinces, many of which assume a more active approach 
than federal bodies. 
  The following contacts took place in the course of 1993: the 
Slovak Republic was visited by Otto Jelinek, minister of 
national revenue, and several government ministers and Ivan 
Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic, paid a visit to Canada. 
  In view of the political and economic situation of the 
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS], 
Slovak foreign policy approached relations with them 
pragmatically, with emphasis on the development of mutually 
advantageous economic and trade relations and the effort to 
recover some of our claims in these countries. 
  Proceeding from the new conditions in the two countries, the 
Slovak Republic was building relations with the Russian 
Federation on the basis of equal partnership. On the whole, we 
have succeeded in following up on the positive aspects in 
historical relations between the two nations. 
  The fundamental aim in building new relations with the 
Russian Federation was to secure, above all, economic and trade 
relations, which had been greatly disrupted in the preceding 
period. Meeting this target was immensely difficult, due to the 
exceedingly complicated domestic political, economic, and 
socioeconomic situation in Russia. In spite of this, we have 
succeeded in activating mutual relations and raising their 
quality so that these relations can be characterized as good 
partnership in all areas. Economic relations, in particular, 
have been raised to a good level. 
  A number of contacts was realized in the course of 1993. 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Bratislava, in particular, 
was an event that should become an important factor for the 
further development of mutual relations. The Treaty of Friendly 
Relations and Cooperation was signed during the visit. 
  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar paid important visits to 
Moscow in March and in August 1993, which were devoted mainly to 
questions of economic cooperation. The Agreement on Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation between the Governments of the 
Slovak Republic and the Russian Federation and the Memorandum on 
Questions of Slovak-Russian Trade and Economic Cooperation were 
signed in 1993. Following up on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's 
visits, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation O. 
Lobov and Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov paid visits to the 
Slovak Republic. 
  Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic Jozef 
Moravcik paid a visit to the Russian Federation in March 1993, 
as a member of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's delegation, and 
this visit was reciprocated by the visit of Andrey Kozyrev, 
minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, to 
Bratislava. 
  Mutual working visits by other ministers of the two 
countries 
were important. 
  With regard to relations with other CIS republics, no 
activities were developed at the highest level and at 
ministerial level and no visits at these levels were carried 
out. In 1994 it is necessary to reckon with the development of 
activities with, in particular, Belarus, Tajikistan, and 
Kazakhstan.

document. V. Stevko, vice president of the Confederation of

by the agreement because its council placed it under a different 
obligation. "Unfortunately, at the time of negotiations, when

very difficult to speak about new talks," Stevko said,

<F P=106> [Zeljko Mandic report] </F>
  [Text] Since last night Western Slavonija has been cut off 
from the rest of the world. During the course of the night 
members of the peace forces blocked key positions on the 
Okucani-Gradiska upon Sava road with armored personnel carriers 
and infantry, preventing pedestrians and vehicles from passing 
through, thus bringing the crisis that has emerged near the Sava 
bridge to its most extreme stage, one that threatens to become 
an open clash between the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and 
the Serbian people of Western Slavonija. 
  At this moment are 10 UN armored personnel carriers on the 
highway, near a place called Dubovacki Nadloznjak. When asked 
who ordered the latest show of force, sadly not the only one, 
the UNPROFOR members replied that this was the order of the 
peacekeepers' supreme command. 
  Let us recap, UNPROFOR command yesterday issued an ultimatum 
to the Krajina police to surrender control of the bridge on the 
Sava River that links the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and 
the Serbian region of Western Slavonija with the Srpska republic 
to the UN forces. This deadline expires today. 
  The RSK government's ultimatum was that the members of the 
Jordanian, Nepalese, and Argentinian Battalions must withdraw 
their men and military hardware from the Okucani-Gradiska upon 
Sava road within 24 hours and this deadline expired at 1900 
[1800 GMT] yesterday. 
  This latest action of violence by the Blue Berets has only 
complicated the already critical situation in Western Slavonija 
that has emerged in connection with control over the bridge on 
the Sava River linking Stara Gradiska and Gradiska upon Sava, 
which threatens to escalate and may result in clashes. 
  For the time being, we have not observed a concentration of 
new troops from other UN Protected Areas [UNPA] in the region, 
beside those who regrouped from some parts in UNPA Sector West. 
It has been learned, however, that there have been indications 
that the existing UNPROFOR troops in the crisis zone of Western 
Slavonija could be strengthened by additional forces.

<F P=106> [Phone-in interview with Mate Cranic, Croatian deputy prime </F>
minister and minister of foreign affairs, by unidentifed 
correspondent, from Geneva; from the "Picture vs Picture" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening, Mr. Granic. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Correspondent] Could you briefly summarize the strenuous 
day 
that you have had today. Shall we start with your Bonn meeting? 
  [Granic] Maybe it is necessary to say that the day before, 
President Tudjman decided to inform some of the most important 
and influential European countries about our policy and problems 
that we faced during the negotiations in this very sensitive 
phase of the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
search for a lasting peace. The Bonn meeting passed in a 
friendly atmosphere in the course of which we informed Minister 
Kinkel about our standpoints in detail and also about all the 
problems that exist at the moment in our negotiations with the 
Muslim side. I think that they showed full understanding for 
our stands. 
  [Correspondent] After that, you left for Rome where you had 
talks with your counterpart, Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta,. 
  [Granic] Right. Ten days ago, I paid an official visit to 
Italy. At that time, we discussed not only bilateral relations 
in detail, but also the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
reintegration of UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system. 
I briefed Minister Andreatta about all the problems and 
difficulties of this phase of negotiations, but also about the 
successes. As you already know, as it has most probably been 
made public, General Roso and General Delic have signed a 
cease-fire agreement. On the other hand, we have had intensive 
talks on finding a permanent peace between the Muslims and 
Croats and permanent solutions within Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of 
course, between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. 
Likewise, we got several interesting suggestions, we believe 
that Italy will be able to considerably influence the position 
of the United States at this moment. 
  [Correspondent] Maybe it will be interesting to hear some 
details of the Vatican talks with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran. 
  [Granic] As you know, I also paid a visit to the Holy See 
where I was received by the holy father. I had long talks with 
Cardinal Sodano and Monsignor Tauran about all problems, 
particularly about all the humanitarian problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the suffering of the population, and also 
about political solutions. On that occasion, we received 
several very useful suggestions, and I conveyed some messages 
from President Tudjman to the holy father. That was a very 
useful and friendly meeting. At this moment, permanent 
communication with the Vatican is very important to us. 
  [Correspondent] My colleague, Jozo Curic, told me earlier on 
the phone that you had a phone conversation with your Austrian 
counterpart, Foreign Minister Alois Mock. 
  [Granic] Minister Mock is a great friend of Croatia, but 
also 
of the Muslim side. This is very favorable in this phase of 
negotiations. He was interested in obtaining first-hand 
information about the current situation. Of course, he is 
constantly ready to help both sides, and I think he will be able 
to offer considerable help in this phase of negotiations. 
  [Correspondent] Can you give us an overall assessment of all 
these meetings today. Actually, what have the commentaries on 
the latest Russian initiatives, and the stepped-up U.S. 
involvement in this area been like? 
  [Granic] Globally speaking, there have been positive 
assessments of America's heightened interest in restoring 
permanent peace and, of course, reaching a lasting solution 
between the Croats and Muslims. But on the other hand, in all 
the meetings our hosts expressed understanding for the stands of 
the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] And in conclusion, please tell us about your 
participation in the session of the Commission for Human Rights 
in Geneva tomorrow. What are you going to speak about? 
  [Granic] I will speak about the observance of human rights 
in 
the Republic of Croatia and openly about problems that we have 
faced over the past three years, about missing persons, about 
all the problems of war and suffering, and also openly about all 
other problems in connection with human rights, about the 
protection of human rights. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for replying 
to our call despite the strenuous day that you have had. 
  [Granic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [HINA report on Tudjman's letter to Kent Shiner, president </F>
of B'nai B'rith: "I Greatly Admire the Jewish People"] 
  [Text] Zagreb (HINA) -- We are releasing a translation of 
the letter from President of the Republic of Croatia Franjo 
Tudjman to Kent Schiner, president of the largest Jewish 
organization in the world, B'nai B'rith. 
  Kresimir Cosic, minister plenipotentiary at the Croatian 
Embassy in the United States, delivered President Tudjman's 
letter to Mr. Kent Schiner on 14 February at the Croatian 
Embassy. The letter reads as follows: 
  Dear Mr. Schiner, 
  In the early 1980's, I wrote an extensive dissertation on 
the 
history of evil and violence entitled The Enormity of 
Historical Reality. At the time, I could not publish my 
work, for I was a political prisoner and I criticized the 
authorities. Only when former Yugoslavia started to 
disintegrate, when the communist society fell apart, when new 
democracies were founded and republics gained independence -- 
only then could I publish that work, this time as the president 
of the first internationally recognized Republic of Croatia. 
  Since it was first published in 1989, The Enormity of 
Historical Reality triggered strong and, unfortunately, 
negative reactions by some members of the international Jewish 
community. I was deeply hurt by those reactions and they made 
me reexamine my statements and reevaluate parts of the book in 
which I quoted documents and personal views of some writers or 
of people who participated in those events. 
  Since The Enormity of Historical Reality was 
published, about four years ago, I had the opportunity or, 
better yet, I have been trying to get to know, as thoroughly as 
possible, and become involved in the Croatian and international 
Jewish community, in order to gain an insight into its needs, 
culture, and history, its hopes and fears. That lasting contact 
broadened my horizons and I now know much more than I did years 
ago when I was writing the book as a persecuted dissident. I 
greatly admire the Jewish people, their strength and fight for 
independence and freedom, which equals that of the Croatian 
people. Especially regarding our developing relations and my 
increasingly better understanding of the Jewish people, I 
appreciate the harm that certain parts of the book could cause 
and the misunderstanding it could cause. I would, therefore, 
like to offer my apology, both as the president of the new, 
independent state that wants to develop a solid and lasting 
friendship with the Jewish people, but also as a man who wants 
to contribute to that by means of this apology. Consequently, I 
have decided to delete those controversial parts from my book, 
which is soon to be published in English. This particularly 
refers to wording that I now consider inappropriate, whether 
because it indicates a lack of sensibility, because it is based 
on sources that were later proved unreliable, or because their 
overall impression arouses prejudice against the Jewish people, 
and that has never been my intention. I shall continue to take 
into account the needs of the Croatian Jewish community and work 
toward a better understanding of the Jewish communities and the 
Republic of Croatia, as I have been doing since I was elected 
president of the Republic of Croatia.

<F P=106> [Drazen Vukov-Colic commentary: "The U.S. Diplomatic </F>
Renaissance"] 
  [Text] They could hardly wait for it in Moscow, the 
Europeans are delighted, and the conflicting sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must finally realize that, in this bloody 
game, not everything can remain the same after all. This is a 
short summary of the main reactions to the U.S. "diplomatic 
renaissance," without which no progress could be expected, 
regardless of the outcome of the Western military ultimatum. 
Discussions and negotiations should be held both before and 
after the bombs, and these possible bombs have also been taken 
out of the last diplomatic safe: The Serbs are expected to make 
the most concessions, and, after sanctions, they had to be 
threatened with the largest stick. "Everybody agreed that the 
final end to this war must be agreed upon at the negotiating 
table," stated Peter Tarnoff, Warren Cristopher's assistant for 
political issues, who, along with envoy Charles Redman, is, on 
the U.S. side, in charge of a new gathering of the Western 
allies and the restoration of the Bosnian negotiations. 
  Madelaine Albright talked of this as the main message of the 
NATO ultimatum at the Security Council, in the evident attempt 
to appease the Russians and encourage the Serbs who support a 
peaceful solution. What is it that is real and new, since 
everything sounds so familiar? Washington and Europe have 
finally agreed upon a joint approach, and once the White House 
gets into something with someone else, it has to lead. In this 
list of immediate tasks, Europe and Moscow had to give up the 
idea that a larger carrot (suspension of the sanctions) could 
curb the Serb appetites, and Washington agreed -- at least 
ostensibly -- to press its Muslim proteges. They must finally 
be satisfied with "reasonable demands," instead of constantly 
making the list of their wishes longer. Charles Redman 
therefore quickly went to Sarajevo, so that it could be firmly 
determined once and for all what kind of Bosnia and how much 
Bosnia for themselves the Muslims support. Immediately 
following these talks, the Serbs and Croats will be offered a 
kind of final menu that will not be based on the blackmailing 
principle of "take it or leave it," but would nevertheless be 
something that it is almost impossible to refuse, since "they 
would have to realize" -- says Tarnoff -- "that behind 
everything this time lies the unity and the common purpose of 
Europe and the United States." 
  What about Croatia? Even Peter Tarnoff admits that 
Washington and Brussels have yet to agree upon a common approach 
to this issue. Germany has reappeared on the stage as the 
illegitimate foster parent of its naughty foundling, which it 
long ago sent into punishment, but still opposes someone else 
slapping it. In all this, Bonn can also expect new headaches at 
the constant diplomatic carousel that, in the Croatian public, 
turns Klaus Kinkel into a torturer at one moment and a savior at 
another. In a somewhat more extensive answer to the question of 
what this unachieved joint Western policy toward Croatia could 
look like, Tarnoff answered cautiously, but still threateningly: 
"We are aware of the need to resolve the issue of the Krajinas, 
and we know that Croatia is playing a very important role in the 
final (Bosnian) agreement. Croatia can profit a lot from the 
agreement, taking into account its economic situation resulting 
from a great number of war refugees. However, if it is not 
capable of playing a useful role, it could be put under 
pressure." 
  Everything Mario Nobilo said at the Security Council was 
based on the attempt to make the world see that Croatia is more 
yielding, peacemaking, and prepared for all negotiations. 
Certain "elements" of the Croatian Army will be withdrawn. 
Zagreb and Sarajevo jointly signed the request for the 
international control of their borders, and soon a real 
Croat-Muslim ceasefire can be expected. The Sarajevo Ambassador 
Muhamed Sacirbey did not attack Zagreb at the Security Council 
(he and Nobilo are even friends), which should show that it is 
easier to breathe after Mate Boban. However, at the same time 
all the media talk of great military successes of the HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council], and some foreign sources claim that 
the Croat forces -- aided by "elements" of the Croatian Army -- 
had started an unprecedented attack at Gornji Vakuf. Each 
negotiation is thus first announced at the frontlines by 
suicidal attempts to secure as strong territorial maps as 
possible for the negotiating table, and in that case even Mario 
Nobilo is not able to conceal the terrible reality by 
well-formulated papers. Many will say that Peter Tarnoff spoke 
in an unusually mild way about Croatia, but the best informed 
still know that because of these attempts to retrieve at least 
part of what was so irresponsibly lost in central Bosnia, Zagreb 
could be forced to sacrifice part of the so crucial sea as early 
as the following day. Because, with the Americans, everything 
is both easier and more difficult at the same time.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Zvizdic: "Changes at the Head of the Embassy </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina?"] 
  [Text] We have learned from a reliable source that Bisera 
Turkovic, the first ambassador of Bosnia-Herzegovina to Croatia, 
will probably not hold that office any longer. It is claimed at 
the Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb that Ambassador 
Turkovic "has left for a holiday abroad, which will last for 
several weeks," but it is not stated why she left. 
  It seems that her successor is already known. It could be 
Mr. Neven Kulenovic, who is already the charge d'affairs at the 
Embassy of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb. 
  According to the information that we have, it seems that 
Ambassador Turkovic has left for Australia after returning from 
Sarajevo several days ago. We have also learned that Mrs. 
Turkovic came to Zagreb directly from Australia on 25 March 1993 
in order to present her credentials to the Croatian president. 
  It can hardly be believed that this is not a feigned journey 
because there is no justification for the absence of the 
ambassador at a moment when important things are going on in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and when negotiations between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia are starting. 
  It is difficult to predict whether the dismissal of 
Ambassador Turkovic will influence Bosnia-Herzegovina policy 
toward Croatia. We have learned, however, that the Sarajevo 
leadership has on several occasions blamed the ambassador for 
her alleged inactivity in diplomatic communications and her lack 
of initiative. 
  Bisera Turkovic was born in Sisak [Croatia], where she lived 
until the age of 18. Then she moved to Zagreb where she 
graduated from Law School. After that she practiced as a lawyer 
in Sarajevo. In the trial against the Sarajevo intellectuals in 
1984 she was mentioned as one of the participants, and she left 
Yugoslavia that same year. She lived in Australia and completed 
her post-graduate studies of criminology there. She returned to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in March 1992, two months before the war 
started, and stayed in Sarajevo until the autumn of 1992. She 
was an activist in the Party of Democratic Action. She has 
three children.

  [Text] Krakow, 23 February -- In Krakow on Tuesday, Polish 
and Russian Foreign Ministers Andrzej and Andrey Kozyrev took 
part in the inaugural session of the Polish-Russian conference 
organized by the foundation of the Center for the Development of 
Democracy. The conference is being held under the slogan: 
"Towards New Partnership." 
  In his inaugural speech, Minister Olechowski put forward a 
new concept for cooperation with Russia, which he called 
"Partnership for Transformation." In his opinion such 
cooperation would lead to the achievement by the two states of 
"their proper place among the developed democratic countries." 
Olechowski emphasized that the essential feature of 
Polish-Russian partnership should be better use of traditional 
trade links in order to fill the gap that has arisen after the 
disappearance of the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance]. 
  The Polish foreign minister pointed out that Poland and 
Russia should support each other in creating a modern trade law 
compatible with international standardsm, and they should set up 
a system of preferential treatment for bilateral trade, as well 
as cooperate in developing banking and transport services. 
Olechowski said that Poland had already prepared a plan for an 
Eastern European Trade Initiative that would coordinate such 
cooperation. 
  The minister added that it was necessary to create a data 
bank of information on investment capabilities of companies in 
the two countries and to organize investment promotions and set 
up capital links between the companies that in the past used to 
cooperate within the CEMA. 
  Olechowski emphasized that the stabilization of the 
situation 
in Central and Eastern Europe would be a condition for joining 
the community of democratic countries. He expressed the hope 
that the participation of Poland and Russia in the Partnership 
for Peace program would facilitate the process. In his opinion, 
regional and bilateral cooperation in many areas, which should 
be conducted as two sovereign states, would also facilitate 
stabilization in the region. 
  "We need partnership with Russia, Ukraine, and other 
neighbors in order to make an ambitious contribution to Europe 
-- Europe, which is both diversified and unified -- and with the 
aim of taking our proper place in it," Olechowski said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ryszard Malik: "Each One Persisted With His </F>
Own Ideas"] 
  [Text] In Krakow no breakthrough was achieved simply 
because such a breakthrough was not possible. It would have 
been naive to link the working visit of Andrey Kozyrev with a 
hope to "open a new chapter" in Polish-Russian relations, as was 
done by some Polish observers after the speech by Andrzej 
Olechowski in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Therefore, 
Kozyrev did not take us aback when on Wednesday [23 February] on 
the forum of the conference "In the Direction of a New 
Partnership," he presented rather vague principles for an 
all-European partnership and not a concrete vision of the 
Russian policy toward the states of Central-Eastern Europe, 
including Poland. 
  In recent years, Poland has not taken advantage of the 
opportunity to change its geopolitical location by incorporating 
our country into the already existing European security 
structure. Now it is probably too late for that. After its 
unexpected success in Bosnia, when it presented its large 
potential by blocking the NATO action, Russia is even more 
reluctant to agree that a state located near its western border 
be a member of this organization. The visit of Minister Kozyrev 
to the Visegrad Group states (except Slovakia) was paid at a 
special moment: the moment of reconstructing the superpower 
position of Russia. What could be done by a minister of such a 
superpower, the position of which was not negated by anyone? 
Kozyrev had to act just as he acted. He had to behave like a 
professional diplomat, a friendly interlocutor, but also like a 
strong partner that no one can impose anything on. 
  The Krakow meetings of both ministers, which, incidentally, 
were held in a good atmosphere, explained at least one thing: 
each party perceives the construction of a new all-European 
security structure differently. This, however, is no obstacle 
to developing bilateral relations, especially economic contacts. 
In this respect the heads of the Russian and Polish diplomacies 
were in agreement.

<F P=106> [Statement by Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, </F>
from the "Strictly Public" military program; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] We are planning on a number of strictly 
military measures, the magnitude of which -- it is true -- will 
not be very large, but there is a rational reason for that: We 
will accumulate the indispensable experiences at the level of a 
platoon or a company, and then the conclusions that will be 
drawn from those experiences will bring positive results in the 
course of preparing subsequent training which would then be 
broadened, including participation by larger types of units or 
even tactical units. At the same time of course -- that is less 
expensive -- command and staff exercises will be taking place, 
and also joint training, and computer-simulated war and 
political games. I hope these measures, which are very 
significant -- I hope we will manage to implement these measures 
since they do not require as huge expenditures as in the case, 
for instance, of an exchange or participation in maneuvers 
abroad by an entire brigade or division -- that is out of the 
question for this year. 
  The most urgent need for Europe -- and not just Europe -- is 
the issue of establishing efficient peacekeeping forces. Poland 
has had considerable experience in that regard; it has a 
well-prepared center for training troops for peacekeeping 
missions. Quite an intensive exchange is already going on in 
that area, and I think that direction should definitely be 
maintained, while taking advantage of experiences of, for 
instance, the Dutch, Great Britain, or other countries that are 
involved in such peacekeeping missions. But that is not the 
whole of the offer, and the path of getting closer to European 
structures and to NATO should also consist of many other types 
of measures. The biggest problem is introducing NATO's 
technical standards into our Army, with particular emphasis paid 
to communications as the Army's nerve -- that problem should be 
resolved as a priority. A few other problems should also be 
resolved immediately after that. There exists such a plan in 
the Army -- it has been prepared. But what we do not quite 
know, is how to finance these investments which -- there is no 
getting away from that -- are very expensive. [passage omitted] 
  As for right now, I can see no alternative whatsoever. 
Simply put, the Partnership for Peace initiative constitutes a 
realistic way to build continental or even Euro-Atlantic 
security structures -- after all, NATO also includes the United 
States. Right now, there is the problem of to what extent and 
how willingly the other European countries will decide to get 
involved in the initiative, I mean in particular those countries 
not included in the Visegrad Group.

<F P=106> [Article by P.Ml. on telephone interview with Tadeusz </F>
Mazowiecki, UN Human Rights Commission special rapporteur in the 
former Yugoslavia, in Warsaw on 22 February: "Human Rights: 
Mazowiecki Condemns International Inertia"] 
  [Text] "The decisions made with regard to Sarajevo have 
seriously changed the situation on the ground in the former 
Yugoslavia. Indeed, I had intended to abandon my mission. In 
view of recent events, however, I think that my resignation 
would not be appropriate or even clearly understood or correctly 
interpreted at the very time when, for the first time, decisive 
action had just been taken in Bosnia." 
  LE SOIR, which in an exclusive interview on 25 May 1993 
announced the intention of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Polish 
prime minister, special rapporteur of the Human Rights 
Commission in the former Yugoslavia, to abandon his mission, 
questioned him again by telephone in Warsaw before the 
publication of his latest report in Geneva next Monday. 
  However, although Mr. Mazowiecki is wondering about the 
appropriateness of his departure given the new circumstances 
created by the ultimatum in Sarajevo, he has not changed his 
opinion and continues to accuse the international community of 
"inertia" faced with the "large-scale violations" of human 
rights in Bosnia. 
  "The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, prove that human rights only occupy a 
secondary place on the international political stage," the 
former Polish prime minister writes. A number of "official 
measures which have been taken can be regarded as a substitute 
or an excuse for the international community's political 
inertia," he said. The special rapporteur then admitted that he 
had been unable to achieve his main objectives which were "to 
provide assistance to the victims and reduce the massive scale 
of human rights violations." 
  It was in August 1992 that the UN Human Rights Commission 
gave Mr. Mazowiecki the task of drawing up periodic reports on 
the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Mazowiecki, who has 
already published five reports last year, still thinks that all 
his warnings have been "ignored by the international community." 
Meanwhile, the policy of "ethnic cleansing," started by the 
Bosnian Serbs has been "continued without respite," he explained. 
  Last May, Mr. Mazowiecki was extremely critical of the 
international community. "Pontius Pilate's gesture does not 
suit me," the first prime minister of postcommunist Poland told 
us at the time. He is waiting for the meeting in Geneva next 
Monday before making a decision. The fact remains that he is 
wondering, as he told us on Tuesday evening, "whether the 
international community will be capable of continuing decisive 
action in the defense of human rights in the former Yugoslavia. 
Withdrawal or UN control of the heavy weapons around Sarajevo 
does not solve the terrible problems which stem from the serious 
human rights violations in Sarajevo and elsewhere. I hope, but 
unfortunately without having any certainty, that the Sarajevo 
action will be a turning-point and that equally decisive actions 
will also be taken elsewhere."

<F P=106> [Report by M.N.: "Polish-Lithuanian Treaty Negotiated; </F>
Without Zeligowski"] 
  [Text] "An agreement has been reached on the 
Polish-Lithuanian treaty. The fifth round of talks, which took 
place on Tuesday [22 February], ended the negotiations," Iwo 
Byczewski, deputy foreign affairs minister of the Polish 
Republic, and his Lithuanian counterpart Vladislavas Domarkas 
announced on 22 February. 
  Both parties reached a compromise on the controversial issue 
concerning the evaluation of past Polish-Lithuanian relations. 
According to the negotiators, the treaty will not include any 
dates or references to historic figures. The problem, of 
course, was about the so-called rebellion of General Zeligowski 
and the invasion of Vilnius, which the Lithuanians wanted 
condemned during the negotiations which lasted more than 12 
months. Poland firmly rejected these demands and argued that 
the evaluation of the past should be left to historians. It was 
eventually decided that a few general sentences concerning the 
past would be written in the preamble to the treaty. 
  Characterizing the wording of the preamble, Deputy Minister 
Byczewski said that it was stated there that "both nations had 
easier and more difficult times in their history. The point is 
that good conclusions be drawn from this bad past for a good 
future." 
  Lithuania is currently the only neighboring country with 
which Poland has not signed a treaty. "The treaty, which was 
agreed to yesterday, might be signed as soon as March, during 
President Lech Walesa's visit to Vilnius," say the Lithuanians. 
The visit of the president to Lithuania has recently been 
discussed in the talks between Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski, 
Walesa's envoy, and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
However, the information on the visit has not yet been 
confirmed by the President's Chancellery.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Two Constitutions Will Be </F>
Drafted; President for Himself, the Parliament for Itself"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [22 February] the president stopped 
cooperating with the parliament in the creation of the 
constitution. He recalled his representative Lech Falandysz from 
the Constitutional Committee, and withdrew his constitution 
bill, which was drafted during the term of the previous 
parliament. He wants to draft a new constitution along with 
"social forces" and he does not intend to submit it in the 
parliament," we were told by President's Spokesman Andrzej 
Drzycimski. 
  "The president would really like to be reelected and so he 
thought that he might treat the Constitution as game factor in 
the fight for reelection," Aleksander Kwasniewski, head of the 
Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, commented on 
the decisions of the president. 
  "As for the Constitution, it was the parliament, not me, who 
rejected the possibility of cooperation. I tried to cooperate," 
declared Lech Walesa in his statement for the Polish Press 
Agency [PAP]. 
  In line with the 1992 Law on the Procedures for Preparation 
and Passing of the Constitution, the president may prepare his 
own constitution bill, independently of the parliament; however, 
he must submit it in the National Assembly by 9 May. 
  President's spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski told us on Tuesday 
that the president would not forward the constitution bill, 
prepared with the participation of the people, to the parliament. 
<H5>  ``He Will Embark on a Campaign </H5>
  for the bill. Political life will show which bill -- the one 
prepared by the parliament or the one prepared by the president 
-- is stronger. The point is that it should be recalled that 
the creator of all laws is the nation,'' said Drzycimski. 
  In his 23 February statement for PAP, the president said 
that 
he would not deprive the parliament of the right to work on the 
constitution. "I have always thought, and I will still think 
that the verdict of democracy (election results) should be 
honored and respected. However, I will not submit to conditions 
that are unfavorable and defective. Nonetheless, all of us must 
submit to democracy." 
  He also said that the adoption of the basic law a little 
later may favorably affect the quality of this law. By taking 
part in its creation, the nation will understand "what is going 
on." 
  Walesa explained that he had recalled his representative 
from 
the Constitutional Committee... 
<H5>  Because the Sejm Rejected </H5>
  on Friday his legislative initiative, which granted groups 
of 
100,000 people the right to submit their own constitution bills; 
according to this proposal, if the nation does not approve of 
the bill passed by the National Assembly in a referendum, the 
parliament is dissolved. 
  Lech Walesa declares that he will no longer hold talks with 
the parliament on the constitution or take part in its creation. 
  However, the law on the procedures for passing the 
constitution imposes concrete duties on the president. Once the 
constitution has been adopted by the National Assembly, the 
president has 60 days to submit a proposal with amendments to 
it. His amendments are then adopted by the definite majority of 
the votes; another condition is that at least 50 percent of the 
overall number of the National Assembly members are present. 
Then the president would have 14 days to order a referendum on 
the Constitution. It must be held no later than four months 
after it was ordered. Lech Walesa will have to do all these 
things, regardless of the declared refusal to cooperate with the 
parliament in the creation of the constitution. The members of 
the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms did not withdraw from 
the Constitutional Committee. Therefore, Lech Walesa will be 
able to follow its work indirectly. Lech Falandysz, who has 
been recalled, had the right to submit motions, but he did not 
take part in the ballots.

  [Text] The National Assembly Constitutional Commission is 
examining the list of institutions and organizations whose 
representatives will take part in the work on the constitution. 
  [Reporter] Aleksander Kwasniewski, the Constitutional 
Commission chairman, said that yesterday's decision by the 
president to withdraw both his representative and his 
constitutional draft from the Constitutional Commission was in 
breach of law. According to the law [of 1991 on the procedure 
of preparing and adopting the constitution] it is the 
representatives of the president, the government, and the 
Constitutional Tribunal who should take part in the meetings of 
the commission. They all have the right to file motions. This 
is more of a duty than a right. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski said that using the Constitution as 
means to achieve an aim, irrespective of whether the objective 
is to compete for the presidential post, or to improve the image 
of the first man in the country, is wrong. 
  On the other hand, Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the Democratic 
Union [UD] parliamentary floor group, said that he had noticed 
that also the government coalition, the coalition parliamentary 
majority, used the Constitution as a means to an end. Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki said that the Constitutional Commission Chairman, 
Aleksander Kwasniewski himself, had brought about the escalation 
of the conflict by saying, for example on the radio yesterday, 
that President Walesa could be facing a trial by the State 
Tribunal. Tadeusz Mazowiecki pointed out that the rejection by 
the Sejm on Friday [18 February] of the president's 
constitutional draft had been done in a manner openly arrogant, 
ostentatious, and contemptuous to President Walesa. 
  Deputy Jerzy Gwizdz from the Non-Party Bloc for Supporting 
Reforms [BBWR] put forward a motion that the commission's 
proceedings be discontinued. He was supported by Leszek 
Moczulski from the Confederation for an Independent Poland 
[KPN].

  [Text] [Announcer] President Lech Walesa has said in Riga 
that he sees no point in future cooperation with the Sejm and is 
not going to talk with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy about the 
conflict originating from the rejection of presidential 
constitutional proposals by the Sejm. Asked about his position 
on Aleksander Kwasniewski's statement that the president had no 
right to withdraw his representative from the Constitutional 
Commission, Lech Walesa said: 
  [Walesa] "If postcommunists and Kwasniewski were to have the 
real power, his idol Stalin would surely lock me up for that." 
  [Announcer] Lech Walesa said that he is ready to talk with 
the Sejm speaker about issues which have prospects for being 
resolved. 
  [Walesa] "The president has to talk and will talk with the 
speaker on issues which have prospects for being resolved. 
Nothing can be done on this issue of constitutional conflict, 
unless the speaker secures different voting." 
  [Announcer] President Walesa probably will not visit the 
Sejm 
building again. 
  [Walesa] "As I have noticed, there is no point, and I think 
that we are going to have ever fewer things in common."

<F P=106> [Report by PAD: "`S' on Strikes"] </F>
  [Text] On Thursday [24 February] "Solidarity" will 
organize at least two-hour-long strikes in the area of the Lower 
Silesian, Western, and Eastern District Directorate of State 
Railroads. Strike readiness has been reported by 18 regions and 
branches of the trade union. Similar action in [Upper] Silesia 
and in the energy-fuel industry is to be expected after 1 March. 
  Strikes of railroads workers, most probably between 0500 
[0400 GMT] and 0700 [0600 GMT], will be coordinated by the 
Protest Action Headquarters. "The railroads workers have their 
own demands; however, this is also the protest of the entire 
trade union due to the fact that the government has not 
responded to our demands," said "Solidarity" Spokesman Piotr 
Zak. "The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] has given 
the government until 1 March to guarantee the implementation of 
the demands. Following this date, escalation of strikes should 
be expected," said Zak. On Tuesday [22 February], after many 
hours of discussions, the KK Presidium decided not to reveal the 
strike scenario. Zak merely said that preparations are under 
way for a major action. "I will not call this a nationwide 
strike; however, the readiness to stage a strike very quickly 
has been reported by seven branches and 11 regions," revealed 
the union's spokesman. KK Secretary Stanislaw Alot believes 
that the problem is not whether to strike, but when to strike. 
"Our protest is supposed to force a change in the 1994 budget 
bill," recalls Alot. Other demands of the union are: curbing 
the energy price increase, giving property to citizens, passing 
a law on collective agreements by the Sejm, respecting the 
principle of representativeness of the organizations of 
employees and employers, changing the fiscal policy to a policy 
favoring families, abandoning the concept of "a different tax on 
excessive wage increases" [popiwek]. "Solidarity" also demands 
that all the negotiated decisions in the "Pact on Enterprise" be 
implemented. 
  "The statements of some representatives of the government 
coalition suggest that the Sejm may adopt the budget of the 
state before 7 March. If this should happen, we will organize 
firm action earlier," stated Alot. 
  Despite earlier statements, "Solidarity" authorities did not 
set the date of the strike in Silesia and in the fuel-energy 
industry. The representatives of the latter reported strike 
readiness on 7 March. Relevant decisions will have been made by 
the end of February. 
  Observers emphasize that the 24 February strikes of the 
railroads workers will be a test for rank-and-file unionists and 
only after the strikes will the "Solidarity" authorities be able 
to evaluate the force that they can count on. 
  According to unofficial sources, in recent days "Solidarity" 
has received several informal offers of talks with high-ranking 
representatives of the Belveder.

<F P=106> [By Jasmina Mironski] </F>
  [Text] Skopje, Feb 23 (AFP) -- Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] said Wednesday it would 
be willing to return to the negotiating table to end an economic 
blockade imposed against it by Athens over a name dispute 
between the two countries. 
  Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov's office said after he 
met 
with a delegation from the European Union that the talks could 
be held "under the auspices of the United Nations and with the 
help of the European Union." 
  The EU delegation headed by European Commissioner for 
Foreign 
Relations Hans van den Broek was to relay the Macedonian offer 
to Greek authorities who broke off negotiations on the dispute 
last October. 
  Van den Broek said he would meet Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias later Wednesday and Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou the following day. He hinted that he may 
then return to Skopje for further discussions. 
  Van den Broek stressed that it was essential to end the 
dispute between the two countries to avoid an escalation of the 
conflict, which has irked Greece's EU partners who have 
threatened to haul Athens before the European Court of Justice. 
  "Both sides are aware they they are living in a dangerous 
part of the world," van den Broek said. "And good neighboring 
relations between Athens and Skopje are a prerequisite to 
prevent an escalation in the region." 
  Greece announced on February 16 that it was blocking all 
trade to Macedonia through the northern Greek port of Salonika, 
which handles most of the country's imports including oil. 
  Athens justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual 
provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and by 
claiming that the former Yugoslav republic has territorial 
ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name. 
  Earlier Wednesday Papoulias said that Athens wishes to have 
good relations with its neighbor but the latter must accept the 
"logical" demands made by the Greek Government. 
  The demands call for "Skopje", the name Athens uses to 
designate Macedonia, to stop "hostile propaganda" against 
Greece, to remove from its national flag a sun symbol that 
reflects the ancient Greek dynasty of Macedonia and to remove a 
constitutional clause calling for the liberation of Macedonia. 
  Meanwhile, Belgium Wednesday, in an apparent affront to 
Athens over the seemingly endless dispute, recognized The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the provisional name given it 
pending a resolution of the conflict. 
  Six other EU countries recognised Macedonia before Greece 
took over the Union's revolving six-month presidency in January.

compromise on the name issue, regardless of the latest trading 
embargo enforced by Athens. It is obvious that the word "not" 
is omitted after the word "Macedonia," without which the 
sentence makes no logical sense. Crvenkovski had explicitly 
stated in The Hague that Macedonia is ready to continue the 
negotiations with Greece, regardless of the Greek trading 
blockade imposed on Macedonia, the Foreign Ministry underlined.

  Owing to the restrictive policies and the increased supply

  [Text] [Announcer] We begin this news bulletin with a 
report from Zagreb where a cease-fire agreement was signed today 
between representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. 
  [Reporter] The agreement on the cessation of combat 
activities between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO will 
go into effect on 25 February at 1200. This is stipulated by the 
agreement signed in Zagreb this evening after six hours of 
negotiations by the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
and the HVO, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso. 
  The agreement precludes all offensive operations and 
envisages the cessation of combat activities in all combat 
zones. UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units are to be deployed 
along the separation lines in all the combat zones. Heavy 
artillery is to be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or 
withdrawn to a minimal distance from the front line -- mortar 
launchers to a 10-km distance and tanks and heavy guns to a 
20-km distance. A joint commission, presided over by UNPROFOR, 
will be formed beforehand, on the 25th, when the cease-fire goes 
into effect. The commission will be based in Kiseljak and its 
task will be to resolve disputed issues through UNPROFOR's 
mediation. 
  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, declared that 
this evening's agreement was historic and that it will bring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina closer to a final peace. 
  [Presenter] We will acquaint you with this peace agreement 
in 
its entirety in continuation of our program. According to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center in Zagreb, the two 
delegations agreed the following: 
  The cease-fire, which includes an immediate and absolute 
cessation of hostilities, comes into effect at 1200 on 25 
February of this year and envisages the following: 
  -- There will be no further offensive activities or attacks; 
  -- All forms of propaganda spread by each side against the 
other will cease; 
  -- The separation lines and positions must remain as they 
were at the aforementioned time; 
  -- UNPROFOR will be deployed in sensitive areas and at key 
locations in order to monitor the observance of the cease-fire 
agreement; 
  -- All heavy weapons over 12.7 caliber shall either be 
placed 
under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn to a minimal distance 
from the separation lines by 1200 on 7 March -- mortar launchers 
to a distance of 10 km and tanks and artillery to a distance of 
20 km; 
  -- A mixed commission presided over by UNPROFOR is to be 
formed to tackle the problems listed in the appendix which is an 
integral part of this agreement. The commission will be formed 
on 25 February 1994 in Kiseljak; 
  -- The agreement also envisages measures to be implemented 
according to their order of priority: the opening of roads for 
the passage of humanitarian aid and UNPROFOR convoys, the 
passage of commercial and civilian traffic, especially, but not 
exclusively, between the following towns: Zenica-Stari Vitez, 
Mostar-Jablanica-Konjic-Sarajevo, Kiseljak-Vares, and 
Kiseljak-Bilalovac-Busovaca. Only the checkpoints on these roads 
will be controlled by UNPROFOR, although both sides will be 
permitted to man them as well; 
  -- The disbanding of internment camps, the release of POW's 
and the exchange of bodies with the help of international 
organizations such as the International Red Cross; 
  -- The unhindered and regular distribution of humanitarian 
aid by the UNHCR, including heating fuel for domestic 
consumption as well as the steady supply of water, electricity, 
and gas; 
  All the above-mentioned measures are to be taken with the 
aim 
of bringing living conditions of the population of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina back to normal. This agreement in no way 
prejudges political discussions or accords that could possibly 
take place or be reached in future. 
  It was also agreed that monthly, or more frequent, 
high-level 
meetings should take place between Generals Roso, Delic, and 
Rose, or their representatives in case they are prevented from 
attending. 
  The signing of the agreement was attended by the UN 
secretary 
general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UNPROFOR 
commanders, Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation insisted in the talks on 
the withdrawal of regular Croatian troops from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was rejected by General Roso who 
denied the presence of such forces on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This was a report on the agreement signed by Generals Rasim 
Delic and Ante Roso in Zagreb today, which we received from the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 February carries 
within its regular seven-minute newscast several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  A report by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army read by correspondent Sead Curtovic 
speaks about "the activity of the Serbian aggressor in the 
protected zone of Sarajevo despite the NATO ultimatum" and says 
that "since last evening, the chetniks have violated the truce 
on several occasions, mostly provocations with infantry weapons. 
Late last night, a fragmentation mortar bomb was launched from 
chetnik positions at Bacici onto the Brijesce district. This 
morning, a [word indistinct] mortar has been in operation at 
Blekin Potok." 
  Hajrudin Sermic reports from Maglaj about the "great tragedy 
that occurred in Maglaj at about 1900 [1800 GMT]" when "a direct 
hit from a howitzer shell on a humanitarian institution, a 
health center, killed five people; 16 people were seriously 
wounded, most of them crippled. The casualties were the medical 
staff, ambulance drivers, nurses, and patients who were waiting 
for help to be administered." Finally, Sermic reports that "as 
of 0700 this morning, battles resumed unabated announcing 
another, even more difficult and bloody day. All defense lines 
have been attacked with the same ferocity, but the situation is 
worst in the region of Plane, Krsno Polje, and Lijesnica." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports about "the Serb aggressor planning a 
long and exhausting offensive on the Bihac region, confirmed by 
last night and today's 19th day of incessant attacks on this 
part of the republic. Howitzer, tanks, all kinds of mortars, 
Zis and Bofors weapons, and antiaircraft weapons have the entire 
night pounded the defenders positions at the Grabez section of 
the front, as well as the Hasin Vrh and Grmusko-Srbljanski 
heights. Moreover, the chetniks continued the systematic 
destruction of the suburbs of the Bihac and Cazin communes, as 
well as the free section of the (?Bosanska Krupa) territory. 
Along the dividing lines with the remnants of the paramilitary 
formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous region, 
provocations and activities of extremist groups were registered 
in all sectors last night."

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- UN General Sir Michael 
Rose said Wednesday that close air support of UN soldiers under 
attack remained an option in Bosnia despite NATO's failure to 
use warplanes to defend Swedish troops. 
  Five Swedish soldiers of the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) were wounded when their convoy of armored personal 
carriers was attacked Tuesday near Ribnica in northern Bosnia. 
  NATO jets were dispatched to defend them but could not 
determine exactly whom to fire on since the mortar attack had 
come from a front line between Moslems and Serbs, UN officials 
said. 
  Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, said in a statement read 
by his spokesman Wednesday: "Although the aircraft were not used 
in the final event it should be made clear to avoid any future 
misunderstanding or incident that when UNPROFOR convoys or 
personnel are engaged by any armed element they will be given 
the authority to engage targets. This may include the use of 
air." 
  The statement said Rose had written to both Serb and Moslem 
commanders "to emphasize that his troops continue to exercise 
freedom of movement throughout Bosnia. He has also reminded 
both sides that UNPROFOR is here to help the people of this 
country and that his troops are not here as combatants." 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said it was not the first 
time 
NATO planes had moved in for close air support. 
  An officer on the staff of the overall UN commander for the 
former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, said NATO jets were 
near Ribnica and quickly at the confrontation site. But he said 
that in the 100-metre (yard) zone in which they isolated the 
source of fire, there were both Moslem and Serb positions. 
  Cot told AFP that since this would have been the first 
actual 
close air support firing by NATO planes: "We have no right to 
make a mistake. Imagine the catastrophe if we had bombed the 
wrong side." 
  Aikman denied reports that Rose had in fact called for air 
strikes and was overruled by Cot. He said this was "totally not 
the case." He said none of the injuries to the Swedes was 
"life-threatening."

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, 23 Feb (TANJUG)--Major General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, chief of staff of the main headquarters of the 
Srpska republic army, told TANJUG today that the Serb side had 
not opened fire on members of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] 
Swedish unit yesterday. 
  "According to coordinates given by Gen. Angus Ramsey, 
UNPROFOR's chief of staff for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is 
clear that this attack launched from antiaircraft weapons could 
have not been launched by the Srpska republic army," Milovanovic 
said. 
  UNPROFOR said that the attack took place at the village of 
Ribnica (coordinates 9010), four kms northeast of Kakanj; the 
nearest Serb position is 22 kms as the crow flies, he stressed. 
  "Despite indisputable facts, Gen. Ramsey threatened on 
several occasions last night and yesterday that he would 
personally authorize NATO air strikes on Serbs," Gen. 
Milovanovic said. 
  However, he added, Gen. Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR 
in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, reacted adequately and demanded a 
detailed investigation of yesterday's incident. 
  "I am certain that the investigation will confirm that the 
Serb side did not fire on the Swedes," Milovanovic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Jovan Divjak by Vanna Vannuccini; </F>
place and date not given: "`Serb Guns Still in Position'"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo -- Jovan Divjak is the Bosnian Army's 
second-in-command. A Serb from Belgrade and a former general in 
the Yugoslav Army, he opted for the Bosnian side because he 
shares the principles of tolerance and multiethnicity that 
Bosnia and Serbia have always supported. 
  [Vannuccini] General Divjak, a few days ago you were 
pessimistic. How do you judge the situation now? 
  [Divjak] I was not pessimistic. I was realistic. The 
interests of Russia, Europe, and the United States intersect in 
Bosnia. The international community's main fear is that the 
conflict will spread. As for Sarajevo, very little has changed, 
because the city is still surrounded, though people are no 
longer dying as before. 
  [Vannuccini] From the military viewpoint, are you satisfied 
with the withdrawal of the Serbian weapons? 
  [Divjak] Not at all. They have not withdrawn, or placed 
under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision, even 60 
percent of those that they had. UNPROFOR said this morning that 
it was "surprised" to discover some 60 placements that it had 
not seen before. The Serbs had 100 tanks around Sarajevo, and 
they have withdrawn 30 of them. 
  [Vannuccini] But, General, it was you who signed the 
agreement with Serbian Commander Mladic at the airport. 
  [Divjak] This is what happened: On the evening of 8 February 
UNPROFOR's commander in Bosnia, General Rose, asked us for an 
urgent meeting. He assured us that the Serbs had accepted all 
the conditions set by UNPROFOR, from the truce to the withdrawal 
of heavy weapons or their supervision by the blue helmets. 
Since I realized that the general was acting in accordance with 
the British Government's policy, I told Rose that I would prefer 
to await NATO's decision before meeting with Mladic at the 
airport. But Rose went to President Izetbegovic and put 
pressure on him for us to attend. The meeting at the airport 
lasted 15 minutes. There was nothing on paper, so each side can 
interpret the agreement however it pleases. The fact is that 
UNPROFOR tried to create political solutions on the ground in 
order to implement the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. It is Bosnia's 
ill fortune that in order to keep the Serbs happy UNPROFOR 
places Bosnia on the same level as the aggressors. 
  [Vannuccini] Are you afraid that the Serbs could take back 
their weapons? 
  [Divjak] The Serbs have around Sarajevo 12,000 men who are 
still fully armed. We have 45,000, but we have only one weapon 
for every three soldiers. And the Serbian artillery can hit 
Sarajevo from over 20 km away. They have rockets that have a 
range of 70 km. Our only real guarantee is NATO's ultimatum.

<F P=106> [By Michael Adler] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A senior Bosnian general 
charged here Wednesday that Serb forces have failed to withdraw 
a third of their heavy guns from Sarajevo. The comments by 
General Jovan Divjak, second in command of the mainly Moslem 
Bosnian army, came as UN officials said significant amounts of 
artillery remain despite the expiration Monday of NATO's 
ultimatum to pull out heavy weapons or face air strikes. 
  "UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) played a trick on the 
Bosnian 
government and Bosnian army," Divjak told AFP. UNPROFOR troops 
monitoring the situation say Serbs besieging Sarajevo have 
honored the ultimatum. 
  "Even at this moment the Bosnian Serbs have not withdrawn 
all 
their weaponry," he said. He estimated the amount left at from 
30 to 35 percent of what was aimed at Sarajevo before the 
ultimatum. Divjak charged that half of the guns deployed were 
simply taken to other fronts, namely battlegrounds in Olovo, 30 
kilometres (18 miles) north of Sarajevo, and Bihac in northwest 
Bosnia. 
  Serb soldiers in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza were "begging 
our soldiers to open fire on them so that they could return fire 
and not be withdrawn from Sarajevo front lines and sent to 
Olovo," Divjak said. 
  He stressed that Sarajevo was "still besieged" by 12,000 
well-armed Serb soldiers. Moslem defenders number 45,000. Only 
12,000 of these are armed but still less well than the Serbs, 
Divjak added. 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman 
presented reporters Wednesday with a long list of weapons sites 
still being investigated. Aikman said there was a "surprising" 
amount of Serb heavy weaponry left in "every location 
imaginable" around Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of 
these positions are in deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he 
said. He said some artillery was literally "frozen in position" 
and could not be pulled out until there was a thaw. 
  But he said this did not mean Serb troops were not complying 
with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no longer being shelled. 
  UNPROFOR has said the Serbs have handed in over 260 weapons 
while the number for the Moslems is over 45.

  [Text] Pale, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 23 (AFP) -- Three 
Bosnian Serb units who resisted putting their heavy arms under 
UN control in the Sarajevo region for three days finally 
withdrew the weapons on orders of their headquarters, a Bosnian 
Serb general said Wednesday. 
  Dusan Kovacevic, the Bosnian Serbs' "defense minister," told 
AFP the problem was resolved peacefully late Tuesday at Osijek, 
near Ilidza, a western suburb of the Bosnian capital, after the 
units received orders from their military headquarters. 
  "These arms were withdrawn deep into our territory, not to 
any particular destination, and will not be used at any point 
along the front unless the Moslems (Moslem-led Bosnian 
government forces) launch a general offensive against the 
Serbs," the general said. 
  He denied reports in Sarajevo that the Serbs had moved the 
arms toward the Olovo front, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of 
Sarajevo, where fierce clashes broke out between Serbs and 
Moslems in November and December. 
  Journalists who witnessed the settlement said the soldiers 
had refused to turn in their weapons unless UN peacekeepers 
deployed along the front line. 
  The confrontation began Sunday, in the run-up to the 
expiration of a NATO-imposed deadline to Bosnian Serbs to 
withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo or put them under UN 
control by midnight GMT, or face air strikes. 
  The recalcitrant units were based at Ilidza, Grbavica, the 
only part of central Sarajevo under Serb control, and in the 
northern part of the front lines.

  [Text] UN helicopters, which have been overflying the 
hills around Sarajevo for the past 48 hours, have discovered 66 
sites occupied by the Serbian aggressor's heavy artillery. The 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] patrols on the ground have 
discovered another 55 similar sites. Frozen guns and howitzers 
are located in many of these sites, and several days will be 
needed to haul them away. 
  According to UNPROFOR representative Colonel Bill Aikman, 
another 12 sites with Serbian artillery have still not been 
placed under control, although this should have been 
accomplished before the expiration of the deadline in the night 
from Sunday to Monday. Colonel Aikman said that two incidents 
with Karadzic's Serbs had occurred yesterday. The Serbs came to 
two sites and demanded that they be allowed to haul away the 
heavy artillery. After the UNPROFOR soldiers had refused to 
allow them to do so, they withdrew without causing further 
problems.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- [passage omitted] NATO 
declared the heavy guns withdrawal a success last Monday, the 
day strikes against artillery were to begin. But [UNPROFOR 
spokesman] Aikman presented reporters Wednesday with a long list 
of weapons sites still being investigated. He also said a 
reported mortar attack in Sarajevo Tuesday was under 
investigation. 
  Aikman said there was a "surprising" amount of Serb heavy 
weapons still left in "every location imaginable" around 
Sarajevo. The problem was that "a lot of these positions are in 
deep snow, ice, in rugged terrain," he said. He said some 
artillery was literally "frozen in position" and could not be 
pulled out until there was a thaw. 
  But he said this did not mean Serb troops besieging Sarajevo 
were not complying with the ultimatum since Sarajevo was no 
longer being shelled. 
  Air reconnaissance, including helicopters, had over the past 
48 hours found 66 sites. Twelve of these were non-weapons, 42 
turned out to be either abandoned or non-weapons sites, at one 
there was an inoperable weapon, one was still to be verified and 
10 of the sites were taken over by UN troops. 
  UN ground patrols were dealing with 55 sites, of which 23 
were abandoned or non-weapons, two had inoperable weapons, four 
had weapons which patrols would have to neutralize, nine were 
taken over by UNPROFOR, eight were large collection centers and 
nine were yet to be verified. This left a total of 12 sites 
where weapons were still to be checked, Aikman said. 
  He also said Serb soldiers had come to two of the weapons 
collection sites asking to retrieve the artillery they had 
surrendered in order to take it out of the 20-kilometres 
(12-mile) exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital. 
  He said they came in vehicles to load up the guns but were 
turned back by UN soldiers. There was no violence. He 
identified one site as at Krivoglavci, just northwest of 
Sarajevo, but did not name the second site. 
  Aikman also said UNPROFOR was investigating a reported 
mortar 
shelling of Sarajevo. The Bosnian Army said an 82-mm mortar 
shell hit the Brekin Potok neighborhood in northeast Sarajevo at 
about 9 PM (0800 GMT) [times as received] Tuesday. Aikman said 
that if confirmed this attack on the front-line that runs in and 
around the city "would cause some action (by UNPROFOR or NATO) 
but what action it would be I don't know." 
  Meanwhile, there was fighting in another Bosnian hotspot, 
Tuzla. Aikman said nine shells fell there, two very close to the 
airfield that NATO has said is to be opened to humanitarian 
flights on March 7. Serb forces and Serbia oppose reopening 
this airport. 
  In Zagreb, UNPROFOR said a French UN unit was to be deployed 
Wednesday around a bridge on the border between Croatia and 
Bosnia blocked by about 100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week. 
  Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and 
Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting 
tension at the site. 
  About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over 
the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned 
by Nepalese troops on Friday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 23 Feb (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic vice 
president Biljana Plavsic told SRNA [Bosnian Serb news agency] 
that if the Serbs succumbed to NATO's ultimatum-like demands for 
the opening of Tuzla airport, such pressure would turn into a 
common practice of snatching the remaining Serb territories in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to her, the Serbs should condition the opening of 
Tuzla airport for humanitarian needs on the closure of land 
corridors bound for that town, which are now functioning 
perfectly well. 
  She added that the Serbs have aready paid a high price for 
conceding Sarajevo airport to the United Nations; this 
particularly refers to the transport of wounded Serbs, who now 
need three and a half hours to reach hospital instead of 30 
minutes as was the case before.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) does not expect to reopen the Serb-besieged Tuzla 
airport for relief flights before March 18, rather than March 7 
as stated earlier, an UNPROFOR official said Wednesday. 
  An aide to UNPROFOR chief General Jean Cot said the March 7 
date, given on Sunday by the UN chief of peacekeeping 
operations, Kofi Annan, "only relates to the arrival of the UN 
first troops" from the Nordic Battalion at the airport. 
  A full handover of the airport in northeastern Bosnia to the 
UN peacekeepers "is not expected until March 17, and the first 
flight on March 18 at the earliest," he said. 
  "We have not made this timetable public, as it is still not 
final," he continued. "There could be further delays for a 
number of reasons, for example if we run into difficulties 
getting supplies. If that happens, public opinion will be quick 
to complain about the lack of political will." 
  Earlier Tuesday, General Cot told reporters that Annan 
"should speak to me before making statements. Give us a bit of 
time." 
  The strategic Tuzla airport, which lies in a Moslem-led 
Bosnian enclave, has been closed since May 1992 by Serb 
shelling. The Nordic Battalion of 1,000 Swedish and Danish 
troops has been working for three months on a plan to reopen the 
airport.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Ratko 
Mladic, chief of staff of the army of the republic of Srpska, 
said today that the opening of Tuzla airport can only be 
discussed in conjunction with the opening of airports in the 
Srpska republic. He added that the West is trying to deny the 
Serbs their right to self-defense. "They passed their resolution 
to ban flights, even for pregnant women and wounded and 
exhausted people. They do not even think of opening Serb 
airports, although they want to open Tuzla airport, through 
which they would send vast quantities of weapons, ammunition, 
and mercenaries to the Muslims," he said in an interview to 
KRAJISKI VOJNIK. 
  "We are going to discuss Tuzla airport bilaterally as well 
as 
with representatives of the international community in the 
context of making Banja Luka airport and other airports in the 
Srpska republic operational," is his categorical message in the 
interview which the magazine of the 1st Krajina Corps will 
publish toward the end of this week. 
  In his words, the West "will do many things although they do 
not need Tuzla airport since they are already successfully using 
the airport in Ancona, Frankfurt, and so forth. Every day and 
night they are airdropping everything the Muslims need. They 
are delivering the same things through all kinds of convoys." 
  In Mladic's opinion, the West will take advantage of the 
fabricated problem of Tuzla airport in order to bring pressure 
to bear on Serb policies, the Serb people, and their army. 
  "The West is implementing its plan for dismantling the 
former 
Yugoslavia and crushing the resistance of our people in various 
ways, devised in protracted wars in Africa, Asia, and other 
continents." 
  Mladic is of the opinion that the West believes in its own 
mission of arranging the world in line with its criteria. If 
what they have done thus far is anything to go by, we can expect 
new threats, he said. 
  Asked about the NATO ultimatum, he said that there is a 
great 
deal of manipulation surrounding this word: "At a meeting with 
General Jean Cot I saw NATO's decision. It does not mention the 
word ultimatum. Nor is it addressed to the Serb side alone ... 
NATO had no reason to take such decisions or to issue ultimata 
to the Serb side because the Serb people have not declared war 
on anyone, because the Serb people are conducting this war in 
the same way they conducted previous wars -- following a 
declaration of war by our previous neighbors under the 
conductor's baton of their sponsors among the ranks of German 
and Islamic countries." 
  "I believe that the West has not `learned a lesson from its 
disgrace' in saying that a state that was a founding member of 
the United Nations no longer exists and that its external 
borders are no longer valid, which denies the Serb people's 
right to have its own state, although it had a state long before 
those who are now deciding our fate." 
  Speaking about having placed the Serb artillery under UN 
control, General Mladic stressed that the Serb side has again 
displayed a maximum of understanding to find a solution to the 
crisis in a peaceful way within the UN Security Council. 
  "... Our weapons will be under UN control, which does not 
mean that we will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will 
defend ourselves with all means at our disposal and ... the 
guarantee of our survival is not someone's will, but our force 
and our unity." 
  Asked whether NATO air strikes against Muslim and Croat 
positions are possible, Mladic replied he does not think so, 
because "they cannot strike against their satellites." 
  "They are their extended arm," he said. "Muslims and Croats 
were trained in their countries and are carrying out their tasks 
in the Balkans. It is true that they started fighting between 
themselves, but the West will calm them down in another way. 
They have other trump cards for them." 
  Mladic assessed the deployment of Russian UN troops in 
Sarajevo as "a significant event in the international political 
arena," saying that a major power is rightly at the center of 
developments. 
  The presence of the regular Croatian Army in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is worrying and the situation cannot be 
resolved until these forces are withdrawn outside the borders of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. 
  "By pursuing the disastrous Croatian Democratic Community 
policy and by resurrecting the ustasha movement on the territory 
of former Croatia, the Croats brought the Serb people into an 
unenviable position by attacking them. But neither are the 
Croat people in a better position, because on the territory of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina they live in 14 separate enclaves, 
forced to fight," General Mladic concluded.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 23 February carries in 
its regular 32-minute newscast the following reports updating 
the fighting in the republic. 
  Doboj correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic reports on the 
situation in the 7-South Operative Group operational zone and 
says that ``the chetniks are still fiercely attacking Maglaj and 
the surrounding villages. They are using tanks, artillery, and 
infantry weapons. [Words indistinct] the town center, but also 
the civilian residential areas in the Maglaj area. The defense 
positions at (?Bijela Foca), Jovici, Krsno Polje, Pazarici, and 
Nekolj are being targeted. However, the defenders of the 201st 
Chivalrous Brigade are successfully repelling all the attacks. 
The fighting is still in progress as I file this report. 
  "The enemy this morning resumed fierce attacks on the Doboj 
front. He attacked the defense lines from the agricultural 
cooperative Putnikovo Brdo to (?Karus). The members of the 203d 
Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosna are successfully repelling the 
attacks, while the members of the Croatian Defense Council 110th 
Glorious Usora Brigade are repelling the enemy attacks at 
Raskrsce and (?Svaline) which began in the afternoon hours. The 
Tesanj area is also exposed to fierce enemy attacks. The town 
itself was shelled this morning, and the defense lines in the 
region of Bandera, Plandiste, and [name indistinct] have also 
been attacked." 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "there is 
not a single inch of territory on the forward defense lines 
running from the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and 
Grabez to the barracks on Grabez that was not hit by at least 
one shell. Since the morning hours, Bihac and its outskirts are 
being destroyed by howitzers, mortars, multiple rocket 
launchers, and Bofors. The material damage is immense and there 
is a significant number of casualties." He says that the 
members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps have today 
stopped fresh chetnik attacks at Grabez and Hasin Vrh, which 
were directly supported from the area of the so-called Serbian 
autonomous province of Krajina. "In addition to this," says 
Sadikovic, "provocations intensified on the demarcation lines 
with the remains of the para-army of the so-called Kladusa 
autonomy. According to the Velika Kladusa War Presidency, all 
those who in any way supported the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were 
arrested." 
  The studio announcer says that "at 1050 [0950 GMT] the 
ustashas from Kiseljak launched a fierce artillery attack at 
Fojnica." 
  Dino Polic reports on the situation there and says that "the 
ustasha criminals from the area of Trilj, [name indistinct], 
emptied a multiple rocket launcher round of ammunition, 
comprised of 12 107-mm shells, on the town. The consequences of 
this cowardly shelling are several lightly and seriously injured 
citizens, two of whom are Croats. The material damage is 
immense."

Operations Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 
  [Text] The enemy started tank-infantry attacks in the 
valleys of the rivers Bosna, Usora, and Spreca. Since this 
morning Maglaj and the surrounding area have been in the most 
serious situation. Namely, from several directions the aggressor 
has been using all available weapons in attacks on defense 
positions of the Maglaj defenders, the town center, and the 
surrounding area. This is actually the fiercest chetnik attack 
on the town since the beginning of the war. The enemy initiated 
these forceful attacks from Mt. Ozren, Brankovici, and Novi 
Seher. 
  The enemy has also been attacking free Doboj territories 
from 
several directions since this morning. From Mt. Ozren and all 
other strongholds the enemy has attempted a breakthrough at the 
river mouth [usce] near Doboj. The chetniks are also attacking 
free Tesanj territories, where the defense positions in [word 
indistinct] Kosa have been targeted from the direction of 
Vidkovac. 
  Members of the 110th Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council 
in Usora have also been defending their positions bravely this 
morning, as the chetniks have attempted breakthroughs in the 
region of Bandera. 
  There is no peace on free Teslic territories, where the 
defense positions of Teslic defenders and civilian settlements 
have been attacked.

<F P=106> [Report by Smajl Terzic from Tesanj] </F>
  [Text] The last 24 hours in the operational zone of the 
7th South Operative Group have been the worst since the start of 
the [Serb] enemy offensive. The aggressor has continuously 
pounded civilian targets in Tesanj, Maglaj, Sije, Mravici, 
Matuzici, Jelah, Kalosevic, and Miljanovci. The shells have 
killed over 20 civilians, and wounded about 100 innocent people. 
  The entire 30-kilometer-long defense line has been pounded 
with hundreds of shells, but the worst situation was in the 
operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade in the region 
of Plana, Lijesnica, and (Nekoli), and in the operational zones 
of the 203d Glorious Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosnia, the 110th 
Glorious Brigade HVO Usora, and on the southern sector of the 
the 200th Chivalrous Brigade in the region of Kraljevo Brdo, 
Bandera, and Borik. 
  Let us add at the end of this report that today it is eight 
months that this region has been besieged, this region where 
people are dying of hunger and deprivation. We appeal to all 
who can and want to help these suffering people to send in food 
and medicine.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 23 February carries in 
its regular 31-minute newscast two reports updating the 
situation on the Maglaj and Gornji Vakuf fronts. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the 
coordinated chetnik and Croatian Defense Council soldiers' 
attacks at Maglaj continue unabated in the evening hours. After 
the infantry attacks were repelled, constant bombardment of the 
civilian population and defense lines from howitzers, tanks, and 
mortars resumed. This is one of the hardest days of the war on 
the Maglaj front, yet it is just the beginning of a large-scale 
and long-term offensive. This is confirmed by the constant 
influx of chetnik reinforcements from Modrica, Doboj, Banjluka, 
and the concentration of tanks in (?Tulnica), Medjici, and 
Brankovci. The soldiers and the people of Maglaj are resolved 
to defend their town and they will fight to the end." 
  Gornji Vakuf correspondent Atif Agic reports that "sudden 
shelling from mortars and tanks was registered in the village of 
Privora in the vicinity of Gornji Vakuf, and it was accompanied 
by constant antiaircraft gun, antiaircraft machine gun, and 
sniper fire. Of course, the Gornji Vakuf town center was not 
spared. It was shelled from 60-mm and 82-mm mortars. The 
ustashas also shelled the residential buildings in the village 
of Purici with recoilless guns and mortars. The defense lines 
are stable."

  [Text] The aggressor continued his barbaric attacks at the 
free Kalesija territory yesterday and last night. About 200 most 
destructive projectiles were fired and there was fire from 
tanks, howitzers, mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, and 
antiaircraft guns. All chetnik strongholds were in operation and 
the targets were, apart from the defense lines, Tuzla airport 
and the settlements of Vukovije, Medjas, Kalesija Center, and 
Zukici. There was huge material damage, particularly on family 
and economic buildings, and the town industrial zone has been 
almost razed. 
  The aggressor is continuing his fierce artillery attacks as 
I 
report. The defenders are energetically responding and virtual 
artillery duels are being carried out.

<F P=106> [Article by G.R.: "The Dangers of Low Flight"] </F>
  [Text] The Western military alliance has still not given 
the signal for the end of danger in Bosnia, and the people in 
the military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs are aware of this. 
During the past week they have been warning that "attacks 
against our positions will not pay off for the possible 
aggressor." The prevalent opinion in the Srpska republic army 
is that in case of an attack, every tenth "steel bird" in a 
squadron comprising 60 to 70 planes would not return to base. 
  If the NATO planes overflying Serbian positions as part of 
the "Deny Flight" operation were given the order to unload their 
deadly cargo, they would have to descend to an altitude of 20,00 
meters due to the fog and snow in the Sarajevo area, at which 
point they would become an easy target for the Serbian artillery 
and various antiaircraft defense systems. The Srpska republic 
army currently has in its possession 20-mm, 23-mm, 30-mm 
(Praga), 40-mm (Bofors), and 57-mm antiaircraft guns. The 
"Bofors" are the most precise ones, because they have a laser 
rangefinder device combined with an "Erickson" radar. 
  The missile batteries are comprised of SA-2 missile systems 
with an 18 km vertical, and a 50 km horizontal range; SA-3 
missile systems with a 15 km vertical, and a 25 km horizontal 
range; SA-6 missile systems with an 18 km vertical and 60 km 
horizontal range; and SA-9 missile systems with a 5 km vertical, 
and 7 km horizontal range. The SA-6 and SA-9 missiles can be 
maneuvered. In addition to this, the popular Arrows (SA-7), 
Russian "Needles," and the U.S. portable systems, the well-known 
"Stingers," are stationed in around 100 significant buildings in 
the Srpska republic. Owing to sensitivity to electronic 
jamming, the missile systems are combined with guns and portable 
antiaircraft projectiles [as published]. 
  Antiaircraft guns cannot be electronically jammed, 
therefore, 
these weapons, when properly masked and entrenched, could pose a 
significant threat to the low-flying NATO planes piloted by 
Englishmen, Turks, Frenchmen, Americans.... According to 
certain information, NATO pilots already have some 200 targets 
in the Srpska republic marked on their maps which would be 
bombed in case an order to launch air strikes were issued. The 
Western military alliance's threats are, according to the latest 
information, still topical. That is why the public is still 
speculating what would happen if the Bosnian Serbs were to take 
UN Protection Force troops as hostages in the event of air 
strikes. According to Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup 
Ganic, if this situation were to arise, the NATO planes 
(Falcons, Tornadoes, Mirages....) would bomb military targets in 
Serbia, bridges, and the Banja Luka suburbs. 
  Luckily, NATO did not have to go through with this "baptism 
of fire," but its planes continue to "slash" the skies over 
Bosnia. The United Nations is planning to open Tuzla airport for 
traffic on 7 March. According to UN information, this operation 
again envisages the participation of the Western military 
alliance's planes.

  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel General Ratko Mladic, commander 
in chief of the Srpska republic army, today inspected Srpska 
republic army units in the 1st Krajina Corps' operational zone. 
In a talk with reporters, General Mladic commented on the 
latest events in Sarajevo following NATO's ultimatum to the 
Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around the city. A 
report by our correspondent Dragan Stekic:. 
  [Stekic] General Mladic visited the fighters and officers of 
the 1st Krajina Corps in the course of his regular tour. 
Accompanied by the commander of this corps, Lieutenant Colonel 
General Momir Talic, the commander in chief inspected a number 
of units on Mount Ozren and the Doboj and Teslic fronts, and 
expressed satisfaction at the morale of the fighters and their 
resolve to defend the borders of the Srpska republic and counter 
any threats to Serb territories. 
  In a brief meeting with reporters, General Mladic commented 
on the latest developments on the fronts around Sarajevo and the 
placing of Serb heavy artillery under the supervision of the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]: 
  [begin recording] [Mladic] We have displayed the maximum 
understanding this time to peacefully resolve the war drama on 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has never even crossed our minds to 
leave the people in the lurch and at the mercy of our enemy's 
whims. What they and their sponsors had in store for us became 
evident in the past stages of this war. Therefore, our weapons 
will be supervised by UN forces, which does not mean that we 
will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will defend ourselves 
with all available means. The guarantee for our survival is our 
might and our unity, not anybody's will. 
  [Stekic] UNPROFOR's Russian troops are now deployed along 
the 
separation lines. Are they enough of a guarantee for the 
maintenance of the truce in this area? 
  [Mladic] If I were to judge, I would describe this as a 
major 
international development. I believe that a great world power 
has every right to be in the focus of events in this region in 
these difficult times. I think that the presence of Russian 
troops in the role of peacekeepers will significantly contribute 
to the equal treatment of all sides in the conflict in future, 
in contrast to the international community's present one-sided 
approach to our enemies -- the Muslims and the Croats and their 
armies -- and the maximum logistical support and media coverage 
they are receiving. 
  [Stekic] In your view, is there a possibility NATO might 
strike against Muslim and Croat positions? 
  [Mladic] [Chuckles] Hardly. They would never strike against 
their satellites. They [Muslims and Croats] belong to them. 
They have been preparing for war in their countries, they are 
toeing their line, obeying their orders. They are their 
extended hand in the Balkans. Why would they pound them? True, 
they have been at each other's throats, but they [NATO] know how 
to keep them in line. They have ways of dealing with them if 
things get out of hand. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 23 (TANJUG) -- Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will, according to their leader Alija 
Izetbegovic, demand that following the arrival of the Russian 
peace-keepers troops from other countries come and join UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force]. 
  "If the Russians can come, then why should not the Turks 
also 
come," Izetbegovic said in the Vrijeme Ratno program of the 
Moslem television in Sarajevo. 
  Four hundred Russian peace-keeping troops have been in the 
Sarajevo area since Sunday. 
  The Russian peace-keepers came on the basis of an agreement 
between Bosnian Serbs and Moscow in order to secure ceasefire 
following the withdrawal of heavy artillery of the Bosnian Serb 
republic agreed on February 9 with UNPROFOR and the Moslem side. 
  Commenting the arrival of the Russian peace-keepers, 
Izetbegovic said he "trusts them as much as he does (trust) 
UNPROFOR." 
  Izetbegovic said the Moslems have accepted the arrangement 
for Sarajevo because it "has already been agreed it (Sarajevo) 
will be placed under U.N. administration" and that this formula 
will be applied to Mostar, the site of Moslem-Croat fighting in 
southwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to him, the Moslem government will, when other 
towns are concerned, "think twice whether it will accept the 
formula since it could freeze the actual situation in the field."

  [Text] Here is a news item that has just arrived. 
President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija 
Izetbegovic today held a telephone conversation with Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel. The Turkish president conveyed to 
President Izetbegovic his country's readiness to send Turkish 
troops as a part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] to help 
carry out the peace mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In reply to 
a question about the possible application of the Sarajevo model 
to other cities, Izetbegovic said that this model was acceptable 
with certain alterations which envisage the consistent 
implementation of Resolutions 824 and 836, which oblige the 
aggressor's side to place heavy weaponry under UNPROFOR control.

  [Text] Belgrade, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- President of the Srpska 
republic Radovan Karadzic today called on UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to use his influence on the Security Council and 
prevent the adoption of a resolution on UN administration of 
Sarajevo before details on that issue have been agreed upon at 
the Geneva peace negotiations on Bosnia. At the same time the 
Bosnian Serb leader appealed to Butrus-Ghali to speed up these 
negotiations. 
  In a letter to Butrus-Ghali, a copy of which was forwarded 
to 
TANJUG today, Karadzic recalls that the Bosnian Muslims refused 
to talk about the UN administration of Sarajevo at the last 
round of Geneva talks. Therefore, according to him, the Serb 
side believes that the UN Security Council resolution ought not 
to precede negotiations on that issue in Geneva. "Otherwise, a 
solution which would be unacceptable for any one side could 
create obstacles for the peace process." 
  Karadzic said that "the peace process in Sarajevo is 
proceeding according to plan," and that the Sarajevo model, if 
successfully applied in the future, could serve as a useful 
model for other parts of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "The cease-fire which is currently in force has been the 
most 
successful of all those agreed in Sarajevo," the president of 
the Srpska republic concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic by </F>
Robert Hochner in the Vienna studio on 22 February -- live; 
Kresevljakovic speaks in Serbo-Croatian with simultaneous German 
translation] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Good evening. Mr. Mayor, what do you 
feel when you see Russian troops in your city? What do you 
think the role of Russia could be in pacifying Bosnia? 
  [Kresevljakovic] In my own name, I can only say that I do 
not see the Russian troops in Sarajevo in a very favorable light 
because they have undoubtedly been on the side of the aggressor 
over the past 22 months. It would be interesting to see what 
the situation would be like if soldiers from Afghanistan would 
have marched into Pale. 
  [Hochner] The NATO ultimatum is two days old now, the 
cease-fire in your city is holding. How are the people? Has 
anything changed in the city's supply situation over the past 
few days? Has it improved at all? 
  [Kresevljakovic] Yes, it has become somewhat easier, because 
you could not defend yourself against the shells. But the 
danger of snipers remains. I think that not much has changed 
about the blockade of the city. We are being supplied by air 
lifts, but this is not enough, neither for supplies, nor as far 
as the city infrastructure and transportation in the city are 
concerned. 
  [Hochner] Following the NATO ultimatum, the Serbs have 
withdrawn their heavy weapons. Do you think that the Serbs will 
also open access to your city and end the siege as easily? Or 
do you think that NATO air strikes will be necessary to achieve 
this? 
  [Kresevljakovic] This will depend on the kind of pressure. 
If the pressure is as efficient as this time, I think that they 
will also open the access roads. 
  [Hochner] Judging by your experience with NATO, do you think 
that this could be a model for ending the siege in the other 
cities held by the Muslims -- Tuzla, Srebrenica, Gorazde? 
  [Kresevljakovic] This is one of the ways. But this solution 
would also have adverse effects. By the way the situation is 
currently developing in Sarajevo, I see a danger that the city 
might be divided once there are no more grenades. We might get 
a new Nicosia or Berlin. I think this would be a catastrophe 
for Europe and the whole world, because they would have had a 
direct role in this partition. If there is any city in the 
world for which a partition is unnatural, then it is Sarajevo. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Mayor, one last question: The war in and 
around your city has been going on for 22 months. Has anything 
changed in the cohabitation of Muslims, Croats, and Serbs? Or 
do you think that these three groups can go on living together 
in the city once the war is over? 
  [Kresevljakovic] I would like to explain this by way of an 
example. My cabinet, which has four members, still includes two 
Serbs. And they know just as well what happens in the city as I 
do. This means they know a lot. But they are very loyal. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Mayor, I thank you very much for coming and 
wish you and the people of Sarajevo all the best. 
  [Kresevljakovic] Thank you, Mr. Hochner.

  [Excerpt] It is almost totally quiet in Mostar today, while 
Muslim forces have continued with strong provocations and 
artillery attacks in central Bosnia. A new defense minister of 
Herceg-Bosna was appointed at the first session of the 
Presidential Council, the body which took over all duties of the 
president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Zdenko Vranjes 
reporting for Croatian radio. 
  [Vranjes] Vladimir Soljic has been appointed new defense 
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Former Minister 
Perica Jukic will remain one of the deputy prime ministers. 
Zeljko Obradovic has also been appointed new minister for land 
management and construction. 
  At the session in Mostar the Presidential Council decided to 
form an expert group to solve the Mostar situation. The group 
will nominate a team to take part in negotiations within the 
framework defined by the conclusions drawn up at the session of 
the Chamber of Deputies in Livno, whereby Mostar is the capital 
of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. The Council accepted in 
principle the UN peace forces' request for their command for the 
southwestern sector to be stationed in the territory of 
Herceg-Bosna. 
  Presidential Council President Kresimir Zubak informed 
Council members about the course of the peace negotiations in 
Geneva and Frankfurt. Zubak had the following to say on the 
results of the latest Muslim-Croat agreements on a confederation 
of the Croat and Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina with the 
Republic of Croatia: 
  [Begin Zubak recording] We agreed on several issues. First, 
we agree that it is possible, and perhaps even desirable for the 
interests of both peoples, to organize Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
union of the Croat and Muslim -- that is, Bosniak Muslims -- 
nations. We agree on that. We agree that we can organize that 
union, which will meet the rights and interests of both nations. 
We also agree that the state union should be formed as a 
composite state union. These are the principles. 
  We analyzed the principles in greater detail, but we have 
not 
yet reached accord on certain issues. Therefore, it is too 
early to speak about these things. But an important step is 
that both sides have decided that such a union is possible, that 
it is in the interests of both nations, that it must have a 
special relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and that the 
union must be set up so as to respect the national criterion in 
the internal organization of the state. That means that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would be reorganized on the principle that 
there will be two or more federal units that will be set up by 
honoring first of all the national criterion as one of the 
criteria. [end recording] 
  [Vranjes] The command of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
Vitez Brigade today reported that until 0400 last night, the 
Muslim army had shelled the center of the town of Vitez and all 
surrounding areas using mortar and howitzer shells of various 
calibers. The shelling of Vitez by the Muslim army this morning 
is only the continuation of yesterday's shelling when three 
civilians were wounded, including a five-year-old girl who 
luckily sustained only slight wounds. The shelling caused huge 
material damage to residential and industrial facilities.

  [Text] Petrovac, 23 Feb (TANJUG) -- According to the media 
in Velika Kladusa, members of the 5th Corps of the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army [loyal to Izetbegovic] have launched 
fierce attacks on positions held by the army of the autonomous 
province of Western Bosnia [loyal to Fikret Abdic] along the 
entire demarcation line. 
  According to both Velika Kladusa and Bihac, the fiercest 
clashes today took place in Trzacke Rastele and Pecigrad. 
Neither side has mentioned casualty tolls or changes in the 
frontlines. 
  Muslim radio in Bihac has appealed on several occasions 
today 
to supporters of Fikret Abdic to lay down their arms and place 
themselves at the disposal of the 5th Corps of Izetbegovic's 
army to defend the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Milan Slezak; </F>
place and date not given: "Apropos Gateways, Freedom, and 
Tolerance"] 
  [Text] [Slezak] Mr. President, you and Minister Zieleniec 
referred in Bangkok to our republic's endeavor to become the 
gateway to a unified Central European market for Thailand. Do 
you think that we have done enough to ensure that the door 
hanging in this gateway does not have squeaky hinges? And, do 
you think that our neighbors will willingly entrust us with the 
mandate of chief doorkeeper? 
  [Havel] The idea of a gateway was expressed during our 
meeting with the Thai prime minister. It was put forward by our 
side, and the prime minister and the finance minister welcomed 
it very much. 
  In my opinion, at the international level, it means nothing 
more than creating mutually favorable conditions for the 
economic presence of various companies and banks in Prague. 
And, as soon as the Thai companies become established in our 
country, they will then -- understandably -- be able to 
infiltrate the market around us, in this case, CEFTA (Central 
European Free Trade Zone -- LIDOVE NOVINY note). It will then 
depend not so much on the governments, but on contacts between 
individual economic entities. 
  For example, when a bank wants to establish a branch in 
Central Europe, it hesitates and wonders whether it should do so 
in Vienna, Prague, Warsaw, or elsewhere. If we create a 
favorable climate by means of beneficial political and 
legislative conditions, it will locate its new branch in our 
country and we will become its base for the whole of the 
surrounding region. 
  The same applies vice versa for our potential presence in 
Thailand, a country that is, for various reasons, most 
propitious for this purpose. This could mean a starting point 
for activity in other countries or -- as the case may be -- a 
starting point for triangular operations in which the Czech 
Republic and Thailand conduct business together in third 
countries. 
  It is definitely not perceived as a contractual system 
involving several countries where this or that country will 
represent other countries. 
  [Slezak] You are returning from Asia. Journalists and 
political scientists who deal with Asia from India to Japan are 
now arguing about whether the economic boom will necessarily 
lead the countries of this region to a point where they will 
have to adopt a Western-type political model. That is: Not 
just a parliamentary democracy, often characterized by local 
customs and foibles, but also emphasis on human rights. Some 
experts maintain that the attempts to graft something 
considerably different onto a cultural environment which has 
been evolving for a thousand years cannot succeed, and if it 
does, then only for a short time. It seems that the Thai 
example has confirmed the opposite theory.... 
  [Havel] That is a subject that is indeed being much 
discussed -- not only among European or U.S. observers, but also 
among the politicians of that region. The Thai prime minister, 
for example, is of the opinion that the development of human 
rights and the development of the economy should -- and must -- 
go hand-in-hand. He was the inspiration behind the Bangkok 
Conference, which was devoted to this very idea. Other leaders 
allude to their specific traditions and say that first it is 
necessary to achieve a certain standard of living, a certain 
economic development, and only then is it possible -- as the 
case may be -- to intensify democracy and enhance respect for 
human rights. 
  I will not presume to judge the issue. But, something in me 
-- most likely instinctively -- tells me that it is perhaps 
impossible for a flourishing economy to endure and enjoy good 
prospects without political freedoms. The market, which is 
based on the free activity of free economic entities, has its 
own particular freedom. Under conditions that curb political 
freedom, this freedom will begin to seem restricted. On the 
other hand, the market and the free game of market forces can 
only exist if there are rules that are respected by everyone. 
This means, respect for rights. 
  It is hard to say, but I am more inclined toward the view 
that, although democracy has taken hold in these countries with 
greater difficulty than it did throughout the Euro-American 
world, it must and will -- despite this -- accompany the 
economic development of these countries. It is true that, in 
its early stages, economic development progressed here under the 
conditions of an authoritarian system. However, that does not 
seem to me to be possible forever. 
  I think that the integrative efforts being made here, as in 
Europe, will also move in this direction. That is, apart from 
rules for a freer exchange of goods and similar economic 
measures, a kind of political requirement has always been set: 
The more advanced countries in this sphere may exert a little 
pressure on those who, within the framework of the integrative 
grouping, are less advanced. 
  [Slezak] Mr. President, in Varanasi, which you visited last 
week, there once lived a poet and a mystic called Kabir, who 
merged elements of Hinduism and Islam in his work and who 
advocated love and tolerance toward God and people. There are 
many such examples in Indian history. Nevertheless, the brutal 
religious pogroms in India present a sharp contrast to the 
remarkable tolerance in the philosophical sphere. These pogroms 
return again and again. A tiny spark is enough and years-long 
coexistence in peace and harmony is forgotten in an instant. 
  When you were awarded the Indira Ghandi Prize, you spoke 
about the prospects for coexistence among various cultures. It 
seems to me that it will be a very long time yet before the 
individual cultural spheres come together and that more than one 
tiny "Indian- type" spark will be ignited. It also seems to me 
that you are a far greater optimist in this respect. 
  [Havel] In India and Thailand I made two speeches in which 
I outlined my views on the outlook for today's world and also on 
what I consider to be a better alternative, an alternative 
providing the only guarantee that the world will be able to 
confront the terrible dangers facing it. The fact that I 
outlined the better alternative did not mean that I ruled out 
the possibility that the worse one could occur. Of course, this 
may happen. But it would have catastrophic consequences for the 
whole world. 
  It is true that this ambiguous tradition belongs to Indian 
culture. On the one hand, an ecumenical ideal -- to put it 
simply -- manifests itself there again and again, an ideal of 
conciliation and peaceful coexistence. The most celebrated 
exponent of this ideal in the modern era was Ghandi, who 
reconciled Hindus with Moslems.... 
  [Slezak] ....and carried in his pack both the Bhagavadgita 
and the Koran.... 
  [Havel] Yes, yes. 
  On the other hand, religious conflicts are manifesting 
themselves there again and again. The disintegration of British 
India into Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India was caused by the 
inability to coexist. We still see the disastrous consequences 
of this division today -- in Kashmir, the Punjab, and elsewhere. 
We also saw it in Calcutta. 
  There are two currents contending with each other in this 
region -- and also in another form in Europe. After all, there 
is again a kind of race between the integrative efforts based on 
the ideal of civic coexistence and the newly awakening 
nationalism. This is not only happening in the postcommunist 
world, but also in the Western world. 
  The fact is -- and I also said this in my speech in Bangkok 
-- that there is some universalist idea in the very foundations 
of all religions; no hostility is enshrined there against anyone 
who believes in another god. I spoke about this once in Egypt 
with President Mubarak who said quite sternly that Islamic 
fundamentalism is a betrayal of Islam and that it is at variance 
with all of its original ideals. 
  When all is said and done, we can also see it in 
Christianity. Fortunately, many centuries have passed since that 
time -- but terrible genocides were once also perpetrated under 
the banner of Christianity. 
  [Slezak] I am thinking about other such strange 
associations: The brutal medieval Japanese samurai took delight 
in Buddhism and it did not bother them in the least that this 
benign doctrine forbids the killing of all live beings, 
including -- naturally -- people.... 
  Since we have moved onto Buddhism: A man -- and especially a 
very busy man -- often desires the peace and quiet of cloistered 
seclusion. Do you feel this way? If the answer is yes, would 
you choose any of the Buddhist monasteries we visited recently 
for your contemplation? 
  [Havel] My respect for various cultures and their specific 
traditions and environments does not stretch so far that I would 
feel the need to adapt to them and turn into someone else. When 
I want to be alone and think, I am happiest at Hradecek [his 
country cottage in East Bohemia]. 
  [Slezak] Do you remember what in India and Thailand most 
surprised you? What most amused you and most disappointed you? 
  [Havel] What surprised me? I was surprised, for example, by 
the immense interest, warmth, and kindness with which I and our 
entire delegation were received both in India and Thailand. Let 
us try to picture this the other way round. Let us imagine that 
the representative of a small, 10-million strong South Asian 
state -- a state about which half of our citizens know nothing 
or even where it is -- comes to our country. I really find it 
hard to imagine that he would be received with such respect and 
such interest, not only by the politicians, but also by the 
public. I knew that these are people who respect their guests. 
But the level of hospitality really surprised me. 
  I cannot say what amused me, because I could cause a 
political incident. 
  And what....? 
  [Slezak] Disappointed you. 
  [Havel] What disappointed me... (a 10-second pause; the 
president is deep in thought) Nothing! 
  [Slezak] Mr. President, thank you for the interview. 
(The interview was recorded on board the flight from Thailand 
to Prague. The president looked tired, but he made no reference 
at all to his rib injury during the 25-minute interview.)

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister of </F>
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Mirjana Jevtic in 
Belgrade on 23 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Jevtic] Mr. Sainovic, you spent over a year as 
Serbia's prime minister. During that time the new stabilization 
program has been implemented. How would you comment on the fact 
that Mr. Mirko Marjanovic will take up your job? 
  [Sainovic] Briefly, I can express great satisfaction that a 
man with such experience and such results in the economy -- 
which Mr. Marjanovic has behind him -- will be in a position to 
form a government of national unity in the Republic of Serbia. 
I am convinced that the program will be in safe hands -- to put 
it that way -- in the Republic of Serbia and that it will 
certainly produce results. 
  [Jevtic] You are going from the Serbian Government to the 
Federal Government as deputy prime minister with a very concrete 
and special task. You will be the coordinator of the entire 
program for the reconstruction of the monetary system and the 
recovery of our economy. What are your exact tasks? 
  [Sainovic] I am deeply aware of the significant 
responsibility for the realization of the program and the 
coordination of all the subjects that participate in its 
realization. The program is not only of the Federal Government, 
because the National Bank and the Payment Operations Services 
also participate in it. Both republics, the economy, and the 
association of all these subjects for a synchronized operation 
is a very important task, and that will be the essence of my 
everyday work. I am convinced that all the subjects involved in 
this will simply justify the huge confidence that the people 
already have in the new dinar and this program, and that this 
confidence is in effect the measure of my responsibility.

  [Marjanovic] My first step will be to form a government of 
national unity, as the president clearly said. In order to do 
that, we have to conduct consultations with the party leaders to 
find the experts who will bear the burden of the entire program 
for the recovery of Serbia. 
  It is also well known that several strategic moments have 
been envisaged earlier, and we will keep them in mind in the 
implementation of this program. These are the struggle for 
peace, the struggle for the economic recovery of the country, 
and the struggle for a stable and legal state, within which we 
will also keep in mind the fight against crime. 
  As for the program itself, I believe that it has been 
accepted in a way in the country, by the public, and I think 
that this program has been devised by our best experts. It is 
not a one-party program, it is not marked by any color. 
Everything that has been done so far on the realization of the 
program has yielded positive results. There are some problems 
but we will deal with those. So, when all is said and done, I 
will face the assembly as the prime minister elect with a clear 
program and measures for the implementation of this program. 
  [Petrovic] The government of national unity will be 
comprised of experts, expert economists. 
  [Marjanovic] Yes, we will try and find the people who are 
the best in their line of work.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Milovan Drecun] </F>
  [Text] The airports in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Mostar are of 
strategic and tactical importance for NATO. One of the most 
important operative-strategic directions from central Europe to 
the Adriatic Sea goes from Subotica-Novi 
Sad-Zupanja-Tuzla-Sarajevo-Mostar-Port of Ploce. That was also 
one of the most important and sensitive directions for the 
defense of the former Yugoslavia. That direction is not only 
the shortest but also allows great possibilities for high-speed 
advancement from central Europe toward the sea and vice versa. 
The most important part of the defense along this direction is 
in the wider region of Tuzla, which is a significant mining and 
industrial center in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Gornje 
Dubrave airport was built by the former Yugoslav People's Army 
in order to provide effective support for ground troops. 
  That direction is still very important not only for NATO but 
also for the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. The presence 
of 1,350 members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], who 
have Leopard tanks, in the Tuzla enclave shows that, due to NATO 
interests, UNPROFOR wants to concentrate military potential in 
that region, primarily for military purposes. It is obvious that 
the Gornje Dubrave airport is meant to be opened for NATO needs 
since it has a better location than the airport in Sarajevo, 
which is in a valley and frequently engulfed in fog, and the one 
in Mostar, which is rather far from the FRY. 
  The central location of the Dubrave airport enables an 
effective control of the air space not only over the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also over the FRY, and enables the 
effective control of the crossings over the Drina River. Also, 
the use of the UNPROFOR ground forces, or the Muslim formations 
in that region, for a possible spring offensive -- which the 
Muslims have been announcing -- could completely cut off 
Semberija from the Bosnian Krajina and the republic of Serbian 
Krajina, that is, it could cut off the corridor. 
  The airports in Tuzla, Sarajevo, and Mostar are very 
important for safeguarding air communications, with which U.S. 
and West European forces for fast intervention could be 
transported into the regions of protruding deployment of forces 
[as heard] in Albania and Macedonia, where the forces for quick 
intervention in crisis spots are based. 
  The announced opening of the Gornje Dubrave airport has 
justifiably caused suspicions among the Serb leadership, and not 
only because of the possible arming of the Muslims but also 
because of possible military operations on the ground aimed at 
cutting off the largest part of the Srpska republic and the 
republic of Serbian Krajina from the FRY.

  [Text] The Albanian villages in Vushtrri commune have long 
been placed under strict police control. Reports confirm that 
the people in these villages live under conditions of complete 
siege, and that in every moment they are subject to checks and 
maltreatment by the Serbian police that this time do not 
hesitate to beat, raid, and arrest Albanians in the streets and 
everywhere they are. 
  Reports from Vushtrri inform that during the last two 
months, 
the Serbian police raided and harassed more than 60 Albanian 
families in Shtanoc in Poshtem village. Raids and massive 
harassments have been conducted in Zhilivol village. Last week, 
under the pretext of searching for arms, the Serbian police 
raided 13 families in Kacibek village in Podujeve. The police 
terror continues to escalate.

  [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs Geza Jeszenszky has 
reported to the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly 
on the situation of Hungarians living beyond the border and on 
the Hungarian Government policy regarding the minorities. 
Karoly Levai reports. 
  [Levai] It is not true that the stance of the Hungarian 
Government has become more radical regarding the issue of the 
Hungarian minorities beyond the border, Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky said. He added that they had always laid equal 
emphasis on the establishment of good neighborly relations and 
the assertion of rights of the Hungarian minorities living in 
the neighboring countries. Neither of these two issues should 
be given preference, said the foreign minister. According to 
him, there are not any problems in those countries where the 
Hungarian minority is not significant or where minority rights 
are granted. It is true, however, that there are countries 
where the situation of the Hungarian minority is changing 
unfavorably. Thus, for example, our reservations concerning 
Slovakia's admission to the Council of Europe unfortunately seem 
to be vindicated, the foreign minister said, adding that the 
situation of the Hungarian minority there depended on the Slovak 
domestic policy. Geza Jeszenszky, however, did not wish to 
express his opinion on it. He said: the ideal solution would be 
if minority rights were regulated legally in every country, just 
like us. Until then, the handling of these issues in a way 
which satisfies both sides, should be helped by the 
establishment of mixed committees.

<F P=106> ["Sz.P."-signed interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur, </F>
chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum; place and date not 
given: "The Party Is Not in Danger of Falling Apart"] 
  [Text] The left wing thinks in terms of internationalism 
and ignores national values. Therefore, in the event there is a 
left-wing turn, the cause of the survival of Hungarians could be 
endangered, Lajos Fur, elected new chairman of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] on 19 February, told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He 
said that he represents the MDF as chairman while he continues 
to tour the country. He added that, in the event of an 
unexpected election defeat, it will not be him who will have to 
draw the conclusions regarding himself. However, the MDF is not 
expecting this, Fur confirmed. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was almost a year ago when, with dramatic 
words, you resigned from your position as the MDF's 
administrative chairman and from party politics. What made your 
relatively quick and spectacular return possible? 
  [Fur] In October 1993, I began to visit the MDF's local 
organizations throughout the country because I had realized that 
there was no time to waste. I realized we would have to fight a 
very hard battle at the next elections if we wanted to achieve 
good results. In the meantime, the emotions that had been upset 
in the MDF settled down. We need to be very active because the 
stakes are very high. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As the offices of party chairman and 
managing director are going to coexist, who is it who actually 
leads the MDF? 
  [Fur] Sandor Lezsak and I do it together. We do not have 
very different personalities. Lezsak will run the party's 
affairs, he is the organizing and operational person, and I will 
represent the party. I will carry on doing what I have already 
been doing, namely touring the country and talking. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is the MDF threatened by the same factor 
that is typical of collective parties? The various tendencies 
are also represented by other parties that attract the 
supporters of these ideas with clearer appearance: This can 
lead to segmentation. 
  [Fur] At the moment in Hungary, all parties are threatened 
by this, as far as I can judge the parliamentary political 
forces. However, after the past, very painful and damaging 
conflicts, now, in these months, the MDF is not threatened by 
segmentation. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In a recent interview you mentioned that, in 
the second round of the 1990 elections, the MDF's success was 
partly due to the votes gained from the Hungarian Socialist 
Party's [MSZP] supporters. Do you see any chance that, during 
the campaign, you will regain the support of some of the 
socialist sympathizers whose number has significantly increased? 
  [Fur] In the current situation, I doubt that the MDF will be 
able to do this. In my view, there is no chance of this just 
now. This base was not actually so big in 1990. Instead, the 
large mass of people who have not decided whether to vote at all 
are worth more attention. The MDF will have to win over this 
group of people. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Much was said about the left wing at your 
National Meeting. During the MDF's campaign, what arguments 
will you use to convince the public about the reality of the 
left-wing danger? 
  [Fur] Three major issues have to be decided and the left- 
wing's victory would threaten these: The continuation of "clean 
democracy" might be halted and diverted sideways. It is also 
possible to create dictatorship from democracy, and not only 
through a coup. The bourgeois type social order and economic 
structure could be seriously endangered. I would like to remind 
people that MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn and Socialist International 
Chairman Pierre Mauroy clearly said so in their joint statement: 
They want democratic socialism. I do not at all care what this 
socialism is described as, whether flourishing, democratic, or 
existing, it is still the same thing. There are only slight 
differences but, as far as the essence is concerned, differences 
do not exist in left-wing thinking. However, in this case, the 
bourgeois transformation would be diverted. The third and most 
critical viewpoint is that the left wing, because it makes the 
social issues absolute, thinks in terms of internationalism, and 
therefore it disregards national issues, ignores them, and does 
not see them as important. Consequently, the issue of the 
survival of Hungarians is at stake. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any possibility of a coalition or 
any kind of cooperation with the Hungarian Justice and Life 
Party [MIEP]? 
  [Fur] At the moment, there is no chance of this at all. In 
MAGYAR FORUM, we seem to be the main enemy, the MDF is attacked 
week after week by the MIEP. This being the case, how could we 
even begin to think about a coalition? 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In the event of an election defeat, what 
conclusions would you draw in connection with yourself and your 
office as party chairman? 
  [Fur] Nothing regarding myself, other people will do that 
for me. From the MDF's point of view, it would mean that it 
would have to prepare for the next elections and would have to 
draw conclusions from the work that had negative results. 
However, I am almost certain that we will not have to face 
problems like this.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Parties Do Not Share Lajos </F>
Fur's Prognosis -- The Left Wing Is Not Afraid of Itself"] 
  [Text] As we know, at its National Meeting last weekend 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] formulated its program for 
the 1994 elections and elected new officers. It was announced 
on 20 February that [Defense Minister] Lajos Fur had been 
elected party chairman. At the end of the National Meeting, Fur 
said in his closing speech that the competition will be decided 
between the left-wing bloc and national Christian forces. What 
is at stake is nothing other than whether the development of 
democracy will continue. He warned that the left-wing danger 
must not be underestimated. We asked various politicians to 
comment on this issue. 
  For the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP], General 
Secretary Istvan Podkoniczky said that they do not consider this 
fear justified because, in their view, a left-wing bloc does not 
exist. Although, he immediately added, in balanced politics, 
the left wing has a role in the same way as the right wing does. 
It is quite certain that "the continuation of pure democracy" 
is not possible without social justice, solidarity, and equality 
of opportunity. Social and even economic difficulties can be 
increased if these three important elements are ignored. 
Regarding the emphatic section of the MDF's election program 
urging the preservation and improvement of public security, the 
MSZDP's view is that crime can be reduced mainly through social 
measures rather than with a strong police. 
  Left and right wings are obsolete notions, as people do not 
divide themselves into sides; the Independent Smallholders Party 
[FKGP] does not think in these terms, either: It wishes to be 
the party of the Hungarian people, a modern European people's 
party, Mrs. Agnes G. Nagy, deputy chairman of the party, said at 
a news conference in Kaposvar, where Somogy county's Smallholder 
candidates were introduced. 
  According to Tamas Deutsch, deputy chairman of the 
Federation 
of Young Democrats [Fidesz], Lajos Fur's statement that the 
elections will be decided between the left-wing bloc and 
national Christian forces only indicates that the MDF's new 
chairman values his party's election chances highly. In the 
Fidesz's view, the MDF and the current coalition will obtain 
less support at the elections than in 1990. However, it is far 
from true that only the current coalition can call itself a 
national force because it is difficult to dispute that other 
parties, including the Fidesz, are nationally committed. 
  According to Zoltan Gal, parliamentary group leader of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the speeches at the MDF's 
National Meeting indicate that a right-wing populist is the 
party's new chairman, while, in this peculiar division of labor, 
Prime Minister Peter Boross strengthens the MDF's pragmatic 
image. The National Meeting confirmed the MSZP's expectations: 
The MDF cannot boast about its performance over the past four 
years, and so it is trying to push the problems of the present 
into the past and to blend the MSZP with the past, the former 
interior minister thought. 
  Bela Csepe, parliamentary group leader of the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP], said that the parliamentary 
group had sent a greetings telegram to Lajos Fur on the occasion 
of his election. This greeting indicates that the parliamentary 
group does not consider the functions of MDF chairman and 
defense minister irreconcilable. (In an MTI statement on 20 
February, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga said that at a time 
when it is completely uncertain how the south Slav events will 
end, the same person cannot hold the positions of party chairman 
and defense minister.) 
  According to Attila Karoly Soos, deputy of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Lajos Fur is dreaming if he thinks that 
only the left wing can be the opponent of the current right-wing 
parties. A strong liberal center is also present on the 
political scene and this group will also have a say in forming 
the next government coalition. 
  Pal Dragon, deputy of the United Smallholders Party, said 
that he agrees with Lajos Fur's statement. In his view, this 
coalition has managed to lay the foundations of a democracy that 
is able to function. With this, the Hungarian Government has 
achieved a unique performance in Europe that no one else can 
boast about. "I am proud that the United Smallholders Party, 
the former Group of 36, has preserved its original principles 
and fought throughout the four years together with the MDF."

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "There Would Not Be a Cleanup"] </F>
  [Text] The foreign policy strategies of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] can be brought into harmony but further consultations 
are needed on certain issues, the two parties' representatives 
announced after their foreign policy consultations on 22 
February. 
  As [Fidesz deputy] Jozsef Szajer and [SZDSZ deputy] Istvan 
Szent-Ivanyi said, at the meeting they had mainly discussed 
European affairs and security problems, and exchanged their 
views on what kind of foreign affairs structure the two parties 
would form if they both came to government. There is no dispute 
about the country's orientation between the two liberal parties, 
they said; both organizations consider early European Union [EU] 
and NATO membership their fundamental goal. In connection with 
this, the participants of the meeting thought that the Hungarian 
Socialist Party's [MSZP] NATO policy is not unequivocal but, 
according to Szajer, downright "confusing." The Fidesz would 
not consider it a campaign measure if the government submitted a 
formal request for EU membership in the coming weeks. However, 
the SZDSZ considered it important to hold prior inter-party 
consultation on this issue. 
  The liberals find the establishment of a unified foreign 
affairs management desirable. Accordingly, they would wind up 
the Ministry of International Economic Relations, in spite of 
the fact that this would not mean budget savings in the short 
term. In their view, it is important that the diplomatic body 
develops in the direction of public service. If they come to 
power, the liberals envisage 10 to 15 appointments in the 
foreign affairs leadership and the same number in ambassadorial 
positions. They do not want to perform a political cleanup in 
the Foreign Ministry's staff; the professionalism and loyalty 
that can be expected from public service employees will be the 
basic criteria in assessing diplomats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Veer, administrative deputy chairman </F>
of the Republic Party, by Lilla Rist; place and date not given: 
"Before the Elections -- We Represent Economic Rationality -- 
The Republic Party's Administrative Deputy Chairman Says"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rist] Can we call the 
Republic Party [KP] a pragmatic party? 
  [Veer] It can certainly be called pragmatic although I did 
not want to use this term. In 1992, the KP defined itself as a 
pragmatic election party but, after this, many other parties in 
Hungary began to use this term. In the KP's case, pragmatism 
means that it is only prepared to make decisions in accordance 
with economic rationality, regardless of how this fits in with 
various people's ideological views. [passage omitted] 
  [Rist] The KP's program is trying to deal with the problems 
of almost all social strata and to make it attractive for 
everyone. Are you not worried that this effort will slip into 
demagogy? 
  [Veer] We have often been accused of this. In my view, 
demagogy means irresponsible promises. The KP would only be 
demagogic if it promised things it cannot fulfill. However, it 
is difficult to call it demagogic just because it is sensitive 
to social issues, because it emphasizes responsibility in this, 
too. 
  [Rist] The KP's program seems to have a strong economic 
policy line that intends mainly to favor the enterprises. 
  [Veer] Undoubtedly, putting the economy back on its feet is 
the most important thought in the KP's program. Its slogan 
states the same: Rather than the economy being for politics, 
politics must be for the economy. However, this does not mean 
that any values can be sacrificed for this. I am thinking of 
education, health care, and culture which are openly represented 
by the KP. The maintenance of these is an obligation, rather 
than generosity. In addition to supporting the entrepreneur, 
our enterprise-friendliness wishes to support the enterprising 
society by creating workplaces, through the market, abundance of 
goods, and by establishing a consumer society. The essence of 
our economic program is that, in addition to having to help the 
entrepreneurs, we also have to help the system from which an 
economy that is good for everyone can develop. 
  [Rist] Who do you see as your voters? 
  [Veer] The pensioners, the intelligentsia of the provinces, 
and Budapest's citizens. However, this is a very difficult 
question because the KP has not yet been tested. We think that 
we will also be able to take away provincial votes from the 
Hungarian Socialist Party through our agricultural program. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Rist] What are your views on the role and tasks of the 
state? 
  [Veer] The coalition has clearly been following an etatist 
policy which resulted in the establishment of a rather 
centralized state structure. According to the KP, naturally, 
the state must not deny its tasks and responsibilities. It 
should only withdraw from the economy to the extent that its 
functioning can be ensured. The conditions for this have to be 
established through laws and tax policy. The state cannot 
withdraw from construction of housing, youth policy, or the 
maintenance of sciences, but it need not direct the economy. 
However, it will only be possible to see in the future how long 
it takes to dismantle the etatist system without damaging the 
already established living conditions. Corruption, which is a 
result of the centralization, will have to be investigated by 
the justice organizations rather than the government. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] Knin, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- By deploying more than 
50 armored personnel carriers and approximately 1,500 soldiers 
around 0630 [0530 GMT] this morning UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] completely cordoned off all roads in western Slavonija 
bound for the Sava bridge between Stara Gradiska and [Bosanska] 
Gradiska. 
  In that way, as assistant minister of internal affairs of 
the 
republic of Serb Krajina, Nebojsa Pavkovic, told TANJUG, the 
western Slavonia area has been almost completely severed from 
the rest of the world and no longer has any connections with 
other Serb lands. 
  Members of the Krajina special police are still on the 
bridge 
and around it. Around 1100 [1000 GMT] this morning several 
hundred local citizens rallied in protest at the complete 
closure of all roads. 
  The special police units, as Pavkovic said, have been 
ordered 
to behave in such a way as not to provoke possible tension or 
conflict with the blue helmets. Because of the newly created 
situation, which has not shown any signs of normalization, a 
sharp protest has been lodged with UNPROFOR. 
  According to reports coming into the Krajina Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, members of the peacekeeping force today 
refused to let through a vehicle transporting bread to Okucani 
and there have been difficulties in organizing a funeral. In 
this respect UNPROFOR members yielded, but only after a long 
argument. 
  Talks between the Krajina authorities and UNPROFOR are 
expected to be held on the spot today in order to find a 
peaceful solution. 
  A delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina to these 
negotiations will be led by Vice President Branko Lubavac.

  [Text] Krakow, 23 Feb--In Krakow on Wednesday, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking at the Polish-Russian 
conference "Toward New Partnership," presented a Russian plan on 
Pan-European partnership. He said that the acceptance of new 
Eastern and Central European countries as NATO members would 
create new political barriers and would put Russia in the 
position of having to counteract the process, which would result 
in its isolation. 
  According to Kozyrev, Pan-European partnership should be 
based on cooperation within the CSCE, which has been taking 
place until now, and the CSCE should be transformed into an 
effective organization. The Russian foreign minister said that 
European military and political cooperation should be 
concentrated in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which 
should coordinate efforts by NATO, the European Union, the 
Council of Europe, the Western European Union, and the CIS. 
  Kozyrev emphasized the need to consolidate cooperation 
within 
the North Atlantic Council and pointed out the need to implement 
the Partnership for Peace program based on the principle of 
equality. According to the Russian minister, a network of 
bilateral agreements between states that are not NATO members 
should also be established as part of the Partnership program. 
In Kozyrev's opinion, this could initiate closer relations 
between the CIS and NATO. 
  The Russian foreign minister stressed that the Pan-European 
partnership plan would also incorporate security guarantees to 
be given to Eastern and Central European states by Russia and 
its Western European partners. He added that the acceptance of 
new Eastern and Central European states as NATO members could 
create new political barriers, which would put Russia in the 
position of having to counteract them and which would result in 
Russia's isolation. 
  Kozyrev added that closer economic cooperation should be 
established as part of the partnership program. He also pointed 
out the need to open Western markets to East European goods.

  [Excerpt] This evening, following lengthy talks, General 
Ante Roso, commander of the Croatian Defense Council, and 
General Rasim Delic, commander of the Muslim army, signed a 
peace agreement in the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
headquarters at Zagreb airport. Tihomir Vinkovic reports: 
  [Vinkovic] Following six hours of talks an agreement has 
been 
reached whereby both sides agree that the cease-fire will take 
effect at noon on 25 February. All future offensives or attacks 
are ruled out. All propaganda pitting one side against the 
other must come to an end. The lines of contact will remain as 
they are at the time that the cease-fire comes into effect. 
  UNPROFOR will be positioned in sensitive areas to safeguard 
the implementation of the cease-fire. All heavy weaponry will 
be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn from the lines 
of contact; mortars are to be moved 10 km away and and tanks and 
artillery 20 km away by noon on 7 March. 
  On 25 February a joint commission under UNPROFOR auspices 
will be set up in Kiseljak. This commission will work to solve 
points of dispute. 
  Following the signing of the agreement, General Ante Roso 
said: 
  [Roso] "A new time requires a new dialogue. I believe that 
this sums it up. As is written in the text, the cease-fire by 
noon of 25 February [sentence as heard]. It is laid down in a 
relatively detailed way. Further on, there is the technical 
part. I hope it will be realistically possible to implement what 
was signed today. Everything requires a period of time. Every 
beginning is the beginning of an end. Hence, this is a 
beginning. I believe that enough is said in my definition of 
this signature: a new time, new dialogue." 
  [Vinkovic] Rasim Delic said: 
  [Delic] "All this depends on the two of us, actually on 
those 
units and formations that are under our command. I think that 
the points stipulated in the agreement and principles from the 
annex to the agreement are of a nature that will enable the 
implementation of all this. Of course, all this is to be 
implemented on the ground, and hard work remains to be done. I 
think that by this we are creating conditions for our 
politicians to reach an agreement which, I hope, they are going 
to do soon. This should be speeded up. 
  "As regards soldiers, they are always ready to put into 
practice agreements aimed at the political resolution of the 
issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has been topical for such a 
long time." 
  [Vinkovic] The UN secretary general's special envoy Yasuhi 
Akashi, who attended the talks and witnessed the signing of the 
agreement in addition to UNPROFOR Generals Cot and Rose, called 
this moment an historical one. [passage omitted]

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Text]Translating material from the press of the Hungarian 
minorities in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Ukraine presents 
several difficulties. In the original text, cities and other 
geographic areas are called by their traditional Hungarian 
names, which are usually different from the official names used 
in the majority language. In addition, parties and organizations 
are often designated by unexpanded acronyms, and it is not even 
always clear whether these are derived from the Hungarian or 
from the majority language. Moreover, some designations are 
politically sensitive due to territorial disputes or historical 
considerations. 
  FBIS has adopted the following guidelines for handling such 
material. The guidelines assume that the translator has access 
to the bilingual list of place names published in Budapest: 
(MAGYAR NEVE? Hatarokon tuli helysegnev-szotar; Arany Lapok, 
1990). Since the Ukrainian section of the book gives the Russian 
form and is therefore obsolete, a partial Hungarian/Ukrainian 
list of place names is included below. In addition, lists of 
party and organization acronyms are provided. 
<H5>  I. Use of Bilingual Place Names and Acronyms </H5>
  Translations should give the majority-language form of place 
names and organizations that is approved by the Board of 
Geographic Names (BGN) gazetteer, because this is the 
internationally recognized form found on maps. At the same time, 
the source's use of the Hungarian should be indicated because it 
reflects the original material and may have political 
implications. The following guidelines address both requirements: 
  1. In the headline and subslug, use the majority language 
version of the place or organization (in the latter case, 
usually an acronym). 
  2. In the text, use whatever place name or acronym is used 
in 
the original. If this is in Hungarian, cross-reference the 
majority-language version in a bracketed editorial note on its 
first appearance in the item. 
  3. As is indicated by the above, the English acronym is not 
used. 
  Example: 
  Marko Interviewed at UDMR Conference in Oradea 
  Bucharest ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO in Hungarian 19 Jun 93 p 9 
  [Interview with Bela Marko, chairman of the Democratic Union 
of Hungarians in Romania, by Janos Szabo in Oradea; date not 
given: "Marko on Future Role of UDMR"] 
  [Text] Shortly after his arrival in Nagyvarad [Oradea], Bela 
Marko, president of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [RMDSZ--in Romanian, UDMR], gave an interview to our 
paper. 
  [Szabo] What do you expect the RMDSZ to achieve here in 
Nagyvarad? 
  [Marko] I hope that we can resolve some of the problems we 
encountered at last month's session in Kolozsvar [Cluj], where 
the Hungarian Smallholders Party of Romania [RMK--in Romanian, 
PMGMR].... 
<H5>  II. List of Acronyms </H5>
  The following lists are incomplete but include most of the 
acronyms used in the Hungarian minority press of these countries 
in 1993. When possible, both the Hungarian and majority-language 
acronyms are listed and cross-referenced because the minority 
press sometimes uses them interchangeably. NOTE: The 
translation of "szovetseg" and several similar words--translated 
variously as union, alliance, federation, and association--could 
not be standardized because of previously established variations 
in common usage.

the reference is to the original joint Slovak-Hungarian project, 
use Gabcikovo-Nagymaros in headlines and subslugs, retaining 
Bos-Nagymaros in the text. Treat the first occurrence in the 
text as follows: Bos [Gabcikovo]-Nagymaros. 
  Csallokoz = Velky Zitny Ostrov (Slovak) (area between the 
main Danube and its northern branch) 
  Csango = [Partly assimilated Hungarian minority in the 
Moldavian region of Romania] Untranslatable. Avoid in headlines. 
Unless the text provides a definition, put the above in brackets 
after the first occurrence in the text. 
  Delvidek (or delvidek) = ["Southern country"--southern 
Hungary until 1920, now northern Serbia and Croatia]. Do not 
translate. Use the original, putting the above in brackets after 
the first occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines. 
  Dunantul = [Hungary west of the Danube river] Do not 
translate as Transdanubia, because it may not be clear whether 
the region east or west of the Danube is meant. Use the 
original, putting the above in brackets after the first 
occurrence in the text. Avoid in headlines. Note that the suffix 
"tul" (beyond) indicates west of the Danube but east of the the 
Tisza (see below). 
  Felvidek (or felvidek) = ["Upper country"--northern Hungary 
until 1920, now Slovakia] Do not translate. Use the original, 
putting the above in brackets after the first occurrence in the 
text. Avoid in headlines. 
  Karpatalja = The area of Ukraine on the Western side of the 
Carpathian mountains. In headlines and subslugs, translate as 
"Transcarpathia," which reflects the Ukrainian term for the 
region. However, in the text, translate as Subcarpathia 
(reflecting the Hungarian original). After the first occurrence 
of Subcarpathia in the text, put [Ukraine's Transcarpathian 
region] in brackets. NOTE: When rendering the official 
majority-language form of a place name, use the Ukrainian form 
(rather than the Russian as previously in Soviet times). A 
transliterated list of common place names is appended. 
  Kiralyhagomelleki Reformatus Egyhaz = Kiralyhagomelleki 
[Pasul Craiului (Oradea)] Reformed Church District. NOTE: 
Put Romanian term in brackets after the first occurrence 
only. 
  Magyar = Hungarian 
  Always translate--do not use "Magyars," etc. When the text 
requires distinguishing between citizens of Hungary and 
Hungarians living in other countries, qualify as appropriate 
with a term in brackets: [minority] Hungarians; [ethnic] 
Hungarians; [emigre] Hungarians. 
  Magyarsag (1) = all Hungarians everywhere. 
  Example: A magyarsag erti Istvan kiralynak a. 
  All Hungarians everywhere understand King Stephen's. 
  Magyarsag (2) = being Hungarian; Hungarian identity.

(citizenship) 
  nemzeti kisebbseg = national minority 
  nemzetalkoto elemek = constituent elements of the nation 
  tarsnemzet = co-nation 
  Szekely = Szekler 
  Szekler is the appropriate English translation, but it is 
obscure. Therefore, avoid in headlines, and put the following in 
brackets after the first occurrence in the text: [sub-group of 
the Hungarian minority in the Transylvanian region of Romania]. 
  Tiszantul = [the region of Hungary east of the Tisza river] 
Do not translate. Use the original, putting the above in

<F P=106> [Genc Rodonj article: "The Second Democratic Prosperity </F>
Party Congress -- The Congress of Division"] 
  [Text] The early second congress of the Party of 
Democratic Prosperity [PDP] will be known from now on as the 
congress that split the largest Albanian party in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The party had 
been unable to survive for four years before the serious 
incidents recently seen within its ranks took place; because of 
the impossibility of finding a consensus between the factions, 
these events led to a final division, which will no doubt not 
have a good influence on the unity of the Albanians in this 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  The early second congress held a few days ago in Tetovo 
could 
not achieve its own objective. After initial disagreements over 
what were called unimportant issues, but which were in fact not 
insignificant, a number of delegates, deputies, and government 
members left the hall and held their own congress in another 
hall in Tetovo. Thus, two parallel congresses were held. It is 
worth mentioning that, after the walkout, Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr. 
Rexhep Gjergji, and Edita Tahiri, the representatives of the 
Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK], also left the congress where 
Menduh Thaci's supporters remained. 
  The origins of the division, like those of every split, go 
back a long way. One of the main factors was the weapons 
affairs, which Menduh Thaci's wing used to strike hard at the 
party leadership. The Albanian Democratic Party [PD] helped him 
in this attack, as did in particular the Albanian state media, 
which used the basest epithets for the PDP leadership, including 
even "quislings," "bootlickers," and "agents of Belgrade." 
Besides this, PD officials have several times taken part in 
events organized by Menduh Thaci's wing, to the extent that the 
Macedonian prime minister himself called this "interference in 
the Macedonian state's internal affairs." The more careful 
policy of the LDK contrasts with that of the Tirana PD. The LDK 
has tried to find ways to smooth over and settle the 
disagreements within the PDP. It is not significant that, 
whereas the LDK representatives not only did not greet the 
congress but left the hall, the PD representative Tritan Shehu 
remained to greet the congress of Menduh Thaci's wing. 
  In relation to the internal concerns of this party, Albanian 
Television has been unable to overcome its now familiar and 
persistent bias and objectively inform the public in Albania and 
via satellite in the diaspora about what is happening. This 
shows both its lack of independence and its total subordination 
to the ruling party in Albania. This was best shown by the 
introduction to the interview given by Tritan Shehu, PD delegate 
to the congress, in which the television journalist was not only 
unable to describe what had happened at the congress, but put 
himself in the position of a lackey, thus confusing the public 
even further. This is because media such as the newspaper 
RILINDJA reported that two congresses were held in Tetovo and 
two presidiums were elected, while Mr. Shehu asserted the 
opposite. In fact, one congress elected Arber Xhaferi as 
chairman, while that opposing Menduh Thaci's line, at which 
ministers and deputies were present, elected as chairman 
Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of the Macedonian Parliament. 
  The split in the PDP and the two parallel congresses have 
taken place at a time when the Albanians in Macedonia are facing 
two important events: First, the census, and second, next 
autumn's general elections. One asks whether the Albanians are 
better placed to cope with these events divided or united. How 
will the Albanians appear at the coming elections, and how many 
parties will represent them in solving their problems? Will 
they succeed in achieving as good a representation as hitherto 
in the Macedonian state authorities, or better? These questions 
arise because the political forces that hitherto produced most 
results in this field are now divided. However, there is 
another worry: What will be the future strategy of the 
Albanians in Macedonia? Will they participate in the Macedonian 
state as before or abandon all its structures? A seed sown 
today will of course bear fruit later, and this fruit may be to 
the benefit of the Albanians in Macedonia. In conclusion, we 
note that Mr. Arber Xhaferi, PDP chairman according to Menduh 
Thaci's line, began work immediately after his election by 
meeting journalists and the CSCE representative in Skopje. At 
his meeting with journalists immediately after the congress, he 
said, "I am assuming this post with great anxiety, because many 
political processes have been carried through in Macedonia, and 
they must now be reversed." One asks what political processes 
must be reversed, to what extent, and by when....

<F P=106> ["di. ann." interview with IMF Representative in Albania Wei </F>
Ding in Tirana; date not given: "How Albania Came First"] 
  [Text] Tirana -- "Albania is the country with the highest 
growth rate in Europe, and with inflation similar to Poland's. 
The country's growth is expected to continue." This was the 
sensational statement by IMF Director Michel Camdessus. Albania 
grew by almost 11 percent in 1993, with its program of economic 
reform, fast privatization especially in agriculture, and the 
liberalization of trade, prices, and currency exchange. "The 
agricultural sector grew fastest," IMF Representative in Albania 
Wei Ding told GAZETA SHQIPTARE. "This branch is also the 
largest single component in the GNP." 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What is the GNP in 1993 expected to be in 
absolute figures? 
  [Wei Ding] It is estimated that it will turn out to be 
approximately $1.1 billion. On the basis of a population of 3.3 
million this corresponds to an average income of about $330 per 
person in 1993. Construction grew fast at 31.5 percent, 
transportation at 13 percent, and trade, tourism, and services 
at 1.5 percent. The 10-percent decline in industrial production 
has influenced the final total, but it must be borne in mind 
that the growth of the GNP of a modern economy is not measured 
solely by manufacturing production. Added value in all forms, 
i.e. selling for more than you bought, counts as growth. Here, 
one must also count for example what peasants produce for their 
own consumption. 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will growth continue in 1994? 
  [Wei Ding] Growth will continue. It is planned to be about 
8 percent this year. We hope that industrial production will 
not continue to fall. Thus, Albania may be again be among the 
countries with the highest growth rates. 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What work will the IMF do in Albania in 
1994? 
  [Wei Ding] Our program is a continuation of last year's. 
It aims at technical assistance for the government in 
formulating its medium-term economic reform program. We also 
aim to mobilize international support for Albania. 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Inflation is expected to reach 20 percent 
in 1994. How will this figure affect the revival of the economy 
and foreign investments? 
  [Wei Ding] Albania's inflation figure was not very high in 
1993 either. The figure of 20 percent expected for 1994 
indicates economic stability, and will attract foreign 
investors. They will want their long-term interests to be met, 
that is to profit from their investments, which they can only do 
in a stable economy. 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] What do you think of the banking system 
in Albania? 
  [Wei Ding] In my experience, this is the most difficult 
sector to reform not only in Albania but in all the countries of 
the East, because this was the most old-fashioned sector. The 
banking system in Albania has not been divided into two levels, 
with the Central Bank and the merchant banks. We would also 
like there to be private secondary banks that would service 
various branches of the economy. This would also help the 
process of bank privatization. 
  [GAZETA SHQIPTARE] Will private banks be opened in Albania? 
  [Wei Ding] In fact you have one private bank, the 
Italo-Albanian Bank. Its example shows that improvements to 
this system cannot take place overnight, because they involve 
the customers, the staff, the management, and the banking 
infrastructure. Meanwhile, we must decide what will be the best 
privatization scheme, and work is being done on this in 
cooperation with the government. There are applications to open 
private banks from Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and 
Malaysia. I hope that Albanians too will have opened private 
banks by the end of this year. Perhaps some of these currency 
exchange bureaus will be turned into banks. There are still 
technical problems, such as the amount of starting capital that 
Albanian private banks must have. These matters are still under 
discussion.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Milan Hulik: "The Czech Nation Has Not Come </F>
To Terms With its Communist or Nazi Past"] 
  [Text] NATO does not want us. This issue is being 
discussed in our foreign and domestic policy. Let me be frank 
and leave no holds barred -- why should it want us? President 
Vaclav Havel has expressed his view on the appropriateness of 
our incorporation into Western Europe's defense structure. With 
all due respect for his views, formulated with the brilliant 
reasoning of a great stylist, I can only say that they were 
merely a manifestation of an intellectual reasoning with which 
it is impossible to disagree, but they have no practical effect. 
  However, it is impossible to look at Europe (and all the 
more 
so the whole world) only from the perspective of a country that 
in this century has hardly contributed to the defense of 
democracy, if we do not count the handful of very courageous 
people -- including the members of the small domestic resistance 
movement -- who, during the First and Second World Wars, fought 
alongside the Allies. The far greater part of the nation -- by 
its silent loyalty, its elbow grease, and its participation in 
demonstrations -- supported both the throne of the aged kaiser 
and the Reich's struggle against Bolshevism and Western 
plutocracy. The cottage-beerhouse "resistance" during the 
recent totalitarianism is within living memory: Again, a 
handful of dissidents and -- apart from them -- the nation. The 
former marched with their heads against the wall and the latter 
with their faces turned against the May Day platform. 
Incidentally, little force was needed to import communism into 
the Czechoslovak Republic; it is enough to read the proclamation 
"Forward, Not a Step Back" published in RUDE PRAVO immediately 
after 25 February 1948. The names that we find there take our 
breath away: These names had the same significance and same 
symbolism in the later struggle against communism as do the 
names we come across, for example, in the list of State Security 
collaborators. This is not an accusation, it is a statement of 
the fact that the human disposition is changeable, because it is 
made up of human experience and sometimes -- sadly -- of human 
ignorance. 
  They do not want us in NATO for several reasons, which can 
be 
divided roughly into three groups: 
  1. Technical-military reasons; 
  2. Psychological reasons; 
  3. Moral reasons. 
<H5>  Technical-Military Reasons </H5>
  Even for the Western states it would not -- in the current 
economic crisis -- be easy to finance the rearmament of the 
Czech Army, as some of our politicians are hoping. Some of our 
weapons are so obsolete that the term antediluvian comes to 
mind. The once state-of-the-art infantry weaponry, the core of 
which was formed by the type-57 assault rifle, is of a caliber 
that does not correspond to NATO's 5.56-mm ammunition. The 
electronic, radar, and radio-technical equipment does not 
correspond to the parameters for modern warfare and the 
obsolescence of the Air Force compared with the North Atlantic 
Alliance's air forces can be equated with the pre-war situation 
against the Luftwaffe. Our tanks, the main strike force of the 
armies in World War II, cannot -- even though they are the top 
of the range of a series of celebrated Soviet T-types -- compete 
with the German Leopard II's or the U.S. AM-I's. Assuming the 
financial burden of this rearmament is beyond the current 
ability of the Western economy and how our budget would take 
care of it, well, that is written in the stars. 
<H5>  Psychological Reasons </H5>
  Relying on the military power of a partner, a power that -- 
understandably -- does not only consist of the strength of its 
armaments and the size of its army, would be risky for the NATO 
forces. This partner has already capitulated without a fight 
several times, and that with a well-equipped army. It would be 
all the more risky in view of the fact that, not so long ago, 
the representatives of the new democratic regime in the velvet 
euphoria of their first appearance on the international scene 
suggested to Western statesmen that NATO be abolished as a 
reciprocal gesture for the abolition of the (disintegrating) 
Warsaw Pact. The army of a nation and state that has still not 
come to terms with its previous capitulations and has not 
accepted them internally cannot be a reliable ally. This nation 
has not come to terms not only with its communist past, but also 
with its Nazi past. 
  One phenomenon links these two pasts -- the weakness of the 
resistance or, at least, the resistance against the totalitarian 
regime! This is borne out by the fact that our domestic policy 
is today characterized by quarrels and disputes over whether the 
Czech Army should fight for "someone else's" interests. The 
strong left wing, and mainly its international communist 
militant part, are always trying to undermine any involvement by 
the Czech Army on the side of the Western democracies, which 
only yesterday were its mortal enemy. (It is possible to ask 
Comrade Ortman or Comrade Grebenicek if they still are today.) 
In our evaluation by the West, the meager psychological ability 
or inability to put up real resistance to violence and 
totalitarianism is -- perhaps -- our biggest failing. I can 
imagine what the outburst would be in parliament and the 
individual political parties (and, subsequently, among the 
public) if a request to dispatch our expeditionary force, for 
example, to Yugoslavia were to come up on the agenda. 

<H5>    Moral Reasons </H5>
  If what was written in CESKY DENIK about General Nekvasil, 
chief of the Czech Army General Staff, is true, then it is 
unnecessary to write more: We really have no business being in 
NATO. Here even Vaclav Havel's most effective reasoning loses 
its meaning. Even if it were not true, however, it is an 
incontestable fact that our generals studied in the USSR. There 
is no need to write that no one knows about the list of KGB 
agents. It would be illogical to ask the people now enthusing 
about democracy (for generals' and colonels' salaries, of 
course), people immersed in communist indoctrination, whose 
medal ribbons are overwhelmingly red and whose uniforms still 
glitter with stars, really to fight for this democracy or even 
fight for the democracy of Western countries. They are aware of 
this in the FRG, where former East German generals and colonels 
today command companies and squadrons as warrant officers and 
squadron leaders, if they are still in the army. 
  An army that, despite all the screenings and performance 
reviews, has not been able to purge itself and from which 
hundreds of young officers, the least affected by communist 
indoctrination (whom no one promoted or appointed to responsible 
posts in place of the "most orthodox") have resigned in 
disillusion cannot enjoy the confidence of NATO and cannot be 
its loyal partner -- all the more so in view of the fact that, 
long after the anti-communist revolution, this army was 
commanded by a general who had previously served as the 
nomenklatura supremo of the communist army and later as the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia's camp spokesman. 
  If our army is not to play the role of a fifth column in the 
future struggle for the interests of civilization and democracy, 
many things will still have to change not only in Europe and the 
Czech Republic, but -- first and foremost -- in its corps of 
commanders. The issue involves making sure that the slogan of a 
fallen Soviet soldier in World War II, written in blood where he 
fell, also applies to it: "There is nowhere to withdraw to, 
Moscow is behind us." Our army still has somewhere to withdraw 
to -- to its communist past or to its post-communist present.

proposal to dismiss him, presented to the president, and in view 
of the current political situation as well as the foreign 
political interests of the Slovak Republic, he considered it 
necessary to solve the personnel question of the minister of

departure would change Slovak foreign policy in principle 
because a change in political course would not be supported by 
parliament.

Television Director"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic, introduced Ivan 
Stadtrucker into the office of central director of Slovak 
Television yesterday. He paid tribute to his practical and 
theoretical experience and expressed the wish that television 
should have mainly the viewer in mind and should not act as a 
political truncheon. Jozef Darmo, chairman of the Slovak 
Television Council, voiced his conviction that under the 
management of Ivan Stadtrucker, television broadcasts will meet 
the tasks arising from the law and will be constructive, 
politically tolerant, and of a high cultural standard.

"Report on the Fulfillment of Tasks of the Slovak Republic's 
Foreign Policy" presented to the Slovak parliament on 2 
February: "Slovakia in the World"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  2.4 Relations With Asian Countries </H5>
  From the viewpoint of the foreign policy interests of the 
Slovak Republic, Asia constitutes an important region with a 
growing economic potential and rising international prestige. 
The dynamic economic development of countries associated in the 
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opens the way for the 
formation of a dominant center of world economy in this region 
in the near future. 
  The foreign policy of the Slovak Republic in 1993 proceeded 
from this realization. Its main objective was to establish 
prerequisites for the development and a higher level of 
Slovakia's bilateral relations with major Asian countries 
(Japan, PRC, India, Republic of Korea, and the ASEAN countries), 
with emphasis being placed on the creation of suitable 
conditions for the expansion of economic cooperation and the 
influx of capital investments to Slovakia. 
  The independent Slovak Republic is a new entity in the 
international arena, one that is unknown to many Asian 
countries. Therefore, our activities at various levels were also 
aimed at creating a truthful image of the Slovak Republic, its 
foreign policy, economic orientation, and internal development 
among representatives of the Asian countries. 
  The entrepreneurial circles of Asian countries need a 
political signal to launch their activities in another country. 
In the endeavor to improve the Slovak Republic's bilateral 
relations with individual Asian countries and promote the 
activity of their entrepreneurial circles in Slovakia, we made 
use of the opportunity to organize visits at the level of the 
minister of foreign affairs, the ministers of other government 
departments, and at the parliamentary level to the countries of 
primary interest, as well as visits by representatives of these 
countries to Slovakia. 
  The foreign affairs minister of the Slovak Republic visited 
the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Japan and the region of the 
Middle and Far East was also the destination of parliamentary 
delegations, the minister of economy, and representatives of 
financial, banking, and entrepreneurial circles. 
  Visits by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to the PRC and 
India 
are being prepared and should take place in 1994. 
  With a view to establishing suitable conditions for the 
expansion of economic cooperation and the influx of capital 
investments to Slovakia, we have been trying to update and 
complete the existing contractual basis, particularly in the 
sphere of agreements of economic nature (agreements on the 
protection and support of investments and on the prevention of 
double taxation). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiated 
with the Ministry of Finance, which acts as the coordinator of 
this type of agreements, the expeditious signing of these 
agreements with the Republic of Korea and Thailand. We are 
waiting for the Japanese side's response to our draft of an 
agreement on the support and protection of investments. A trade 
agreement with the PRC is ready to be signed. Cooperation with 
Australia developed in interaction with our expatriates [living 
in Australia]. 
  Some positive results have been achieved in relations with 
Japan, the country of the Slovak Republic's primary interest in 
the region: 
  -- the Slovak Republic was granted benefits under the 
General 
System of Customs Preferences (GSP) (April 1993), 
  -- an agreement was concluded on succession to the agreement 
on a $200 million loan in support of restructuring the economy 
of the former CSFR, of which $70 million are for the Slovak 
Republic (January 1993), 
  -- discussions took place on the provision of a Japanese 
government loan (of approximately $200 million) to finance the 
construction of ecologically compatible sources of heat and 
electricity for the Presov-Kosice area, as well as on a $33 
million loan in support of small and medium-sized businesses. 
It is expected that both loans will be granted, 
  -- cooperation between Japanese firms and Slovnaft 
Bratislava, Tesla Prievidza, and other companies in establishing 
joint ventures is developing. 
  A more effective realization of our plans in Asia would be 
aided by the completion of the network of the Slovak Republic's 
representative missions in the region, including the selection 
of high-quality staff and the appointment of ambassadors. 
  Overall, it is possible to state that the implementation of 
the Slovak Republic's foreign policy plans laid down for the 
Asian region in 1993 was successful, considering the 
possibilities available to us. The realized contacts with 
representatives of countries of our primary interest in the 
region, along with the general foreign political activities, 
contributed to the presentation of Slovakia as a stable and 
reliable partner, to the development of bilateral cooperation, 
to greater interest in Slovakia among Asian businessmen and 
investors, and, in a wider context, to reinforcing Slovakia's 
international prestige. Important political and economic 
contacts were established, including the export of special 
products to designated countries. 
  The present level of the Slovak Republic's bilateral 
relations with major Asian countries and their interest in 
Slovakia establish good prerequisites for their further 
development and diversification in 1994. 

<H5>    2.5 Relations with Middle Eastern and African States </H5>
  In the first half of 1993, main attention was paid to laying 
the foundations for a network of representative missions, 
establishing material and technical conditions for the operation 
of individual offices, and to the practical implementation of 
dividing the property of the former CSFR. We have succeeding in 
securing that our embassies are at least minimally staffed. In 
view of the economic potentials of the Slovak Republic, steps 
have been taken to establish representative missions in only the 
most important countries of the region. 
  In the political sphere, we have achieved diplomatic 
recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations with 
practically all Arab countries, with the exception of Saudi 
Arabia and Bahrain. Of the 46 states of sub-Saharan Africa, 18 
countries have recognized the Slovak Republic thus far, most of 
which are the more important countries of the region. 
  We have been developing relations with the countries of the 
Middle East and Africa in the context of the present foreign 
policy priorities and with a view to asserting our economic and 
commercial interests in this region. The realization of tasks 
associated with recovering the Slovak Republic's claims, which 
we register in a number of countries of this region, is in its 
initial stage. The Ministry of Finance is acting as the 
coordinator of this task. Several meetings of heads of 
government departments were held but it is necessary, in the 
interest of boosting our economic relations, to continue 
developing a regular political dialogue and to intensify 
contacts at government level. Toward the end of the year, we 
therefore prepared a visit by the minister of foreign affairs of 
the Slovak Republic to Israel, which will take place in January 
1994. We also regard as important the establishment of contacts 
with Egypt, which is one of the most influential states in the 
region and, at the same time, our traditional partner. 
Analogous agreements with other countries are in the 
preparatory stage and we are also establishing contacts in the 
sphere of culture and the arts. 
<H5>  2.6. Relations with the States of Latin America </H5>
  The Slovak Republic's entry into the awareness of the 
political and economic circles in the countries of Latin America 
was complicated, to a certain extent, by these circles' 
perception of the Slovak Republic as the initiator of the 
breakup of the CSFR and by the problems faced by the 
representative missions of the Slovak Republic in this region, 
particularly in the first months of the year, with regard to the 
competent presentation of the new statehood. The development of 
the Slovak Republic's relations with the countries of Latin 
America is also adversely influenced by the fact that there is 
no ambassador of the Slovak Republic operating at any 
representative mission of the Slovak Republic in Latin America 
or accredited to any country of Latin America. 
  One of the consequences of the tendency to concentrate all 
resources of the Slovak foreign service on the European region 
is the low level of diversification of our external relations. 
  It is possible to state that Slovak foreign political and 
commercial activities vis-a-vis Latin America as a whole, as 
well as vis-a-vis individual countries, have led to the 
establishment of basic contacts, which, in the period to come, 
could create realistic conditions for more intensive political, 
economic, and commercial cooperation. 
  The highest level of relations has been achieved in our 
relations with Mexico, a contribution to which was made by the 
visit paid by the minister of foreign affairs of the Slovak 
Republic to Mexico in October 1993. An honorary consulate in 
Guadalajara was opened on this occasion. 
  In the second half of the year, political dialogue with 
Brazil and Uruguay started to develop more dynamically. 
Bilateral activities have established realistic prerequisites 
for the realization of a visit by the minister of foreign 
affairs to these countries. Argentina and Chile have declared 
their interest in more intensive cooperation. The realization 
of a visit by the minister of foreign affairs of the Slovak 
Republic to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay would raise 
the qualitative level of the Slovak Republic's relations with 
the aforementioned countries and, consequently, with the entire 
territory of Latin America. 
  The opening of honorary consulates in Brazil and Argentina 
is 
in the final phase of preparations. Negotiations on the 
conclusion of trade agreements with Cuba and Brazil are about to 
be wound up. 
  The building of a network of the Slovak Republic's 
representative missions in Latin America has not been completed 
this year and a certain makeshift arrangement persists in this 
area. A possible further restriction of our diplomatic 
representation in the Latin American region would reduce the 
volume of our political activities and cause a decline of 
commercial and economic cooperation. 
<H5>  3. Cultural Activities Abroad </H5>
  Cultural activities abroad are presently one of the key 
elements in creating Slovakia's image in the world. Therefore, 
they should become an integral part of the strategy of asserting 
the foreign political interests of our state. 
  Following the division of the premises of CSFR 
representative missions and Cultural and Information Centers, a 
vacuum in the sphere of culture and information came about, 
which is felt also by institutions and citizens in the countries 
of their operation. It is expected of us that we follow up on 
the positive traditions of our cultural activities as soon as 
possible. Therefore, our efforts in 1993 were aimed, on the one 
hand, at establishing comprehensive relations in the spheres of 
education, science, and culture and, on the other, at reviving 
the activity of Slovak cultural centers. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has worked out a concept for building cultural 
centers abroad, which should be put into practice in the years 
to come. Four Slovak cultural centers were in operation in 1993 
-- in Budapest, Sofia, Warsaw, and Bucharest. The cultural 
center in Budapest, in particular, is an example of the active 
and positive influence of culture on bilateral relations, even 
in a tense political situation such as prevails in relations 
with Hungary. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been active in preparing 
cultural agreements with individual countries that show interest 
in such cooperation and in expanding the possibilities for 
cultural, educational, and scientific exchanges. With a number 
of countries (such as Spain, Greece, Republic of South Africa, 
some Arab states, and the states of Latin America), we have been 
developing more intensive relations in these areas than in the 
political or economic spheres. 
  Societies of friendship with Slovakia operate in a number of 
countries, which also contributes to mutual knowledge and 
understanding and helps establish a good atmosphere in mutual 
relations (this applies, for example, to the Scandinavian 
countries). 
<H5>  4. The International Legal Dimension of Foreign Policy </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Sphere of International Law </H5>
  The priority task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Slovak Republic in the sphere of international law in 1993 was 
to secure the process of the Slovak Republic's succession to 
contractual documents, to which the CSFR had been a party on 31 
December 1992. The basic condition of talks on the Slovak 
Republic's succession to bilateral international treaties was 
the attainment of agreement on which treaties would remain valid 
without modification, which would be modified, and which would 
expire without substitution. 
  Talks on succession to bilateral agreements have been wound 
up with Poland, Austria, Russia, Slovenia, Romania, Japan, 
Finland, and Norway. Talks with France, Canada, Switzerland, 
Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Luxembourg have been 
initiated. Talks with the FRG concerning the FRG's succession 
to treaties concluded by the former GDR are in a preparatory 
stage. 
  With regard to succession to multilateral contractual 
documents, succession to conventions concluded within the 
framework of the UN, UNESCO, the International Labor 
Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
International Organization for Intellectual Property, the The 
Hague Conference for International Private Law, as well as 
conventions in the sphere of international humanitarian law 
deposited in Switzerland has been comprehensively notified 
[notifikovana]. The Council of Europe has recognized a 
comprehensive succession to conventions concluded within the 
framework of this organization, the contracting party to which 
had been the CSFR. 
  The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, within the 
framework of its powers, has confirmed the Slovak Republic's 
succession to international documents concerning the claims and 
financial liabilities of the former CSFR. 
  Another task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Slovak 
Republic in 1993 was the preparation of bilateral political 
treaties with Italy, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia. All these 
treaties have been signed in the course of the year. The Treaty 
on Good Neighborly Relations and Friendly Cooperation between 
the Slovak Republic and Ukraine and the Treaty between the 
Slovak Republic and Italy on Friendship and Cooperation were 
ratified by the National Council of the Slovak Republic in 
November 1993. Prerequisites exist for all the aforesaid 
treaties to go into effect in 1994. 
  In the course of the year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Slovak Republic participated in the preparation of 
presidential and governmental contractual documents that were 
coordinated by other government departments. This concerns, in 
particular, the readmission agreements with Poland, Ukraine, and 
Romania [concerning the deportation of illegal immigrants], the 
treaty on state borders with Ukraine, treaties on the prevention 
of double taxation, on the support and protection of 
investments, and on trade and payments, treaties concerning road 
transport and aviation, and the like. In cooperation with other 
government departments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Slovak Republic also participated in the preparation of the 
Slovak Republic's accession to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping 
Convention, to the European Convention on Archaeological 
Heritage, to the European Charter on Sports, or to the European 
Convention Against Spectators' Improper Conduct at Sports 
Events. In cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic 
participated in the signing of the General Convention on 
Climatic Changes and the Convention on Biological Diversity. In 
the process of preparation of international treaties by other 
government departments, the International Law Section of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic attends to 
their formal legal aspect and to their conformity with the norms 
of international contractual law. 
  One serious issue to which Slovak diplomacy has been forced 
to pay increased attention from the first days of the Slovak 
Republic's independence, and to which it must still pay 
increased attention, are the problems concerning the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros system of hydroelectric power projects. The 
two sides have agreed to submit the dispute to the International 
Court of Justice, the United Nations' supreme judicial body. A 
special department for the International Court of Justice has 
been set up at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The conclusion 
of a special agreement was officially announced on 2 July 1993, 
which initiated the court proceedings. A team of highly 
experienced and distinguished foreign legal experts has been set 
up to defend the interests of the Slovak Republic in this legal 
suit. In spite of the ongoing court proceedings, the Slovak 
Republic allows for the possibility of the settlement of the 
dispute on the basis of a joint agreement. 
<H5>  4.2 Consular Sphere </H5>
  In the first year of existence of the independent Slovak 
Republic, basic attributes [atributy] were laid at the Consular 
Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak 
Republic for a professional consular service. Basic norms 
governing the execution of consular activities were drafted and 
finetuned in this period -- the Consular Order and procedures 
for its enactment, documents that are essential to secure a 
uniform execution of consular activities at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and at representative missions of the Slovak 
Republic abroad. 
  Based on the foreign policy interests of the Slovak 
Republic, 
the main principles and orientation of visa policy were drawn up 
in 1993 (and approved by Slovak Government resolution No. 732), 
on the basis of which proposals for the modification of visa 
relations with specific states were initiated in the course of 
the year. The proposals were submitted with a view to 
preserving good political and economic relations as well as in 
the interest of developing commercial activities with specific 
states. 
  Proposals for a modification of visa relations concerned the 
following states: South Korea, Israel, Iran, Chile, Argentina, 
Cyprus, Slovenia, Croatia, Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine, 
Lithuania, Estonia, Hungarian Republic, and Romania. 
Negotiations with some of these states have already been 
concluded, as a result of which new agreements on visa-free 
travel have been signed (Cyprus, Slovenia) or are expected to be 
signed in the near future (Croatia). Negotiations with the 
Hungarian Republic, Lithuania, and Estonia have also been 
concluded and proposals for the conclusion of agreements on 
visa-free travel have been submitted to the leadership of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government of the Slovak 
Republic for approval. Negotiations with the other states 
continue. 
  A document concerning the establishment of a network of 
honorary consulates of the Slovak Republic abroad was drawn up 
in 1993 and submitted to the Government of the Slovak Republic. 
Last year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak 
Republic started building this network, in particular, in 
advanced countries, as well as in third world countries where 
the Slovak Republic does not maintain a representative mission 
and where good prospects exist, in view of traditions and actual 
potentials, for the development of cooperation in trade, 
tourism, and other areas. In addition to the two previous 
honorary consulates (Calgary and Limassol), in 1993 an honorary 
consulate was established in Guadalajara (Mexico) and nine more 
honorary consulates have been approved: Hamburg, Bombay, 
Calcutta, Drammen, Alexandria, Mestre in Italy, Barcelona, 
Vaduz, and Port Said. These consulates have not yet commenced 
their activity because they still require the other side's 
approval. In the course of December, proposals for the 
establishment of additional honorary consulates were submitted 
(Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Reykjavik). 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic has 
on 
record specific candidates for the post of honorary consuls. 
The selection is made in cooperation with the relevant 
representative mission.

  [Text] 
<H5>  4.3 Sphere of Human Rights and Minorities </H5>
  In the very first months of its existence, the Slovak 
Republic avowed its allegiance to documents, by which the CSFR 
had been bound, and resolved the issue of continuity of its 
commitments by means of succession to international treaties 
dealing with human rights issues on UN premises. We accept the 
highest standard achieved, consisting in the right of the 
individual to submit a complaint against his own state for the 
violation of a right laid down in a contractual document 
(Optional Protocol to the Pact of Political and Civic Rights). 
  The most significant event of the year 1993 was the World 
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, which was attended by a 
delegation of the Slovak Republic headed by President Michal 
Kovac. The conference confirmed the principles of the 
universality and indivisibility of human rights. The Slovak 
Republic, like other democratic states, endorsed the idea of 
establishing the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights 
under the UN. The range of duties entrusted to the newly formed 
UN office will be highly important. The Slovak Republic will 
participate in the formulation of documents associated with this 
office. 
  The activity of the Slovak Republic in UN bodies rested in 
its participation in codifying work. The draft Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on Torture Prevention is being 
prepared at present. The participation of the Slovak Republic 
in the work of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and of the 
Third Committee of the UN General Assembly also plays an 
irreplaceable role. It is important from the viewpoint of 
making the Slovak Republic more visible on UN premises that the 
aforesaid Third Committee is chaired by a representative of the 
Slovak Republic. Improved cooperation with the UN and promotion 
of human rights are also expected from the [UN] Center for Human 
Rights [to be opened] in Bratislava. 
  In the course of the World Conference on Human Rights, a 
seminar was organized in Bratislava on the initiative of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, in 
cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic, 
on the role and tasks of national centers for human rights. The 
seminar was attended by delegates to the World Conference on 
Human Rights. 
  Of exceptional importance for the young Slovak Republic was 
its admission to the Council of Europe, the basic criterion of 
which is respect for human rights. A prerequisite for acquiring 
Council of Europe membership is the signing of the European 
Human Rights Convention, which, owing to its control mechanism, 
represents today the most progressive system of human rights 
protection. The Slovak Republic at the same time accepted the 
authority of the European Commission for Human Rights to receive 
complaints from individuals and the jurisdiction of the European 
Court for Human Rights. In connection with our Council of Europe 
membership, a number of new tasks has arisen -- the 
harmonization of the legal system of the Slovak Republic with 
the European Human Rights Convention and supplementary 
protocols, the gradual accession to conventions concluded on 
Council of Europe premises (of which there are about 150), and 
participation in codifying work (work is currently being wound 
up on the 11th supplementary protocol, which deals with the 
reform of the control mechanism). Another important task is to 
establish the office of the Slovak Republic's legal 
representative (agent) in proceedings before the European 
Commission and the European Court for Human Rights. In 
connection with these new tasks, the Slovak Republic adopted a 
specific timetable of work, which is being adhered to. The 
Slovak Republic also has its representatives in the European 
Commission and the European Court for Human Rights. 
  Another important international forum that is devoted to 
human rights and where the Slovak Republic presents its 
positions is the CSCE. Within the framework of CSCE seminars on 
the human dimension, the Slovak Republic took an active part in 
discussions and exchanges of views with the aim of providing an 
accurate picture of the state of human rights observance in the 
Slovak Republic. Continuation in this active participation 
should forestall in the future the dissemination of evaluations, 
based on unverified facts, such as the report prepared by the 
U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission. The Slovak Republic supports 
a coordinated and cooperative course of action by the CSCE, the 
Council of Europe, and the United Nations with a view to 
preventing duplicity and negative rivalry in the sphere of the 
human dimension. It welcomes recent activities by the highest 
representatives of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the 
United Nations aimed at the institutionalization and 
formalization of this cooperation. It is also possible to 
assess as positive the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the 
CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities. 
  The issue of protecting the rights of ethnic minorities, 
which has recently moved into the foreground of attention of the 
international community in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the 
Council of Europe, is a chapter in itself. This manifested 
itself fully during the admission of the Slovak Republic into 
the Council of Europe when the attention of Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly reporters focused on the Slovak 
Republic's minority policy, which resulted in clearly formulated 
recommendations. These recommendations are being gradually met 
by the Slovak Republic. Another important task was 
participation by Slovak Republic experts in the preparation of 
legally binding documents dealing with the protection of rights 
of members of ethnic minorities. In view of the newly adopted 
procedure for monitoring new Council of Europe member states' 
compliance with their commitments, a mission by Council of 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly reporters took place toward the 
end of 1993. It will be necessary to evaluate the results of 
this mission and to adopt the appropriate measures if necessary. 
  A serious problem of our foreign policy that has become 
clearly crystallized in the first year of the Slovak Republic's 
existence [as an independent state] lies in the Hungarian 
Republic's approach to the minority issue. With varied success, 
the Hungarian Republic casts doubt on the minority policy of the 
Slovak Republic. This is also contributed to by the Slovak 
Republic's frequently uncoordinated course of action and the 
inability to present to the international public the fact that 
minorities in the Slovak Republic have had, and continue to 
have, rights going beyond the framework of the relevant 
international documents, such as the CSCE document of 
Copenhagen. As a result, our position last year was rather 
defensive and, instead of launching our own activities, we more 
often reacted to external prodding. 
  At the beginning of the year, negotiations started on the 
premises of the Central European Initiative on a document on the 
protection of ethnic minority rights. From both the formal 
viewpoint and from the viewpoint of its contents, the text of 
the aforementioned document was from the beginning unacceptable 
to the Slovak Republic. Representatives of the Slovak Republic 
had to spend much effort to achieve that, by means of 
negotiations, the document gradually assumed a shape that was 
acceptable to the Slovak Republic. 
  In the period under review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
cooperated also with other government departments. This 
cooperation was assisted also by the formation of a new 
independent section dealing exclusively with the issue of human 
and minority rights. 
<H5>  4.4 Sphere of Migration and the Refugee Problem </H5>
  From the very start of its independent existence, the Slovak 
Republic has been paying great attention to the migration issue, 
which has come to the foreground recently throughout Europe. 
This arises from the geographic location of the Slovak Republic 
as a country of transit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Slovak Republic participated in the implementation of many 
projects in this area, in cooperation with other Slovak 
Government ministries. In November 1993 the Slovak Government 
approved the "Principles of Migration Policy of the Slovak 
Republic," which are binding also for the newly established 
Migration Office operating under the Slovak Ministry of 
Interior. A total of 2,483 persons, most of them from 
ex-Yugoslavia, are currently in the care of this office. In 
1993 247 ethnic Slovaks from the Chernobyl area were resettled 
to Slovakia. 
  The Slovak Republic obtained the status of observer in the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), retroactively 
from 1 January 1993. The Slovak side has demonstrated its 
interest in involvement in the project of monitoring migration 
in Central and Eastern Europe (MIU) [expansion unknown]. In 
October 1993 the Migration Department of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Slovak Republic organized a visit by an IOM 
mission to the Slovak Republic. Working negotiations aimed at 
evaluating the migration situation on the territory of the 
Slovak Republic were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Slovak Republic and at the Ministry of Interior of the 
Slovak Republic and an agreement on specific cooperation within 
the framework of the Migration Information Program and in the 
area of training and educational programs and seminars was 
reached. The Slovak Republic expressed its interest in becoming 
an IOM member state. The draft of an agreement on cooperation 
between the IOM and the Slovak Government was presented to the 
Slovak side, which comprises the agreed areas of cooperation and 
assistance to the Slovak Republic, as well as the opening of an 
IOM branch in the Slovak Republic. 
  Within the framework of activities carried out in the 
Council of Europe with regard to migration, the Slovak Republic 
participated in several meetings of working groups set up on the 
basis of the so-called Vienna process, which is at present the 
only discussion forum for countries most severely affected by 
the migration problem in the East-West context. 
  Cooperation with the leadership of the CDMG -- the Council 
of 
Europe's European Committee for Migration -- also started to 
successfully develop in 1993. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the Slovak Republic participates in the implementation of 
many projects, in cooperation with other Slovak Government 
departments. A delegation of the Slovak Republic also took part 
in a meeting of CAHAR -- the ad hoc committee of experts on the 
legal aspects of territorial asylum, refugees, and stateless 
persons. 
  Within the framework of activity of the Central European 
Initiative, a meeting of the Central European Initiative Working 
Group for Migration took place in June 1993, in which the Slovak 
Republic participated. 
  The activity of Slovak humanitarian and charity 
organizations 
(Slovak Red Cross, SHR [Slovak Humanitarian Council], Slovak 
Catholic Charity) in the period under review can be assessed as 
highly positive. Most shipments were sent to the republics of 
former Yugoslavia, Romania, and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. The Slovak Republic also arranged the recreational stay 
of children from Chernobyl on its territory. 
  With regard to the refugee problem, the Slovak Republic 
secured its succession to international contractual documents 
pertaining to the status of refugees (Geneva Convention of 1951 
and New York Protocol of 1967). Right at the beginning of the 
year 1993 the Slovak Republic established close contacts with 
the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR), a result of which was the opening of an 
UNHCR branch in Bratislava in April 1993. The founding of this 
branch helped to deal with the problems of refugees on the 
territory of the Slovak Republic, especially by organizing 
training courses and seminars based on international experience 
in this area, including a solution to the problem of the 
refugees' legal protection. The UNHCR has presented to the 
Slovak Republic the draft of an agreement on cooperation between 
the UNHCR and the Government of the Slovak Republic, which will 
be assessed at a government meeting. 
  The most important activity with regard to the refugee 
problem was the Slovak Republic's participation in the 44th 
session of the UNHCR Executive Committee Program in Geneva 
(October 1993). Within the framework of this session, a working 
meeting took place with Mr. J. Horekens, the new director of the 
UNHCR European Office and an agreement was reached on 
cooperation in drafting projects of assistance to the Slovak 
Republic and in accessing the UNHCR data bases. The offer was 
also extended to us to receive Slovak trainees in the UNHCR 
headquarters. At this session the Slovak Republic acquired the 
status of observer, which will allow it to participate in 
meetings of subcommittees and in other informal sessions of the 
UNHCR Executive Committee. 
  Overall, it is possible to state that the Slovak Republic's 
cooperation with international organizations dealing with the 
migration and refugee issues brought satisfactory results in 
1993 and has achieved a high standard. 
<H5>  5. Presentation of the Slovak Republic Abroad </H5>
  Even though the situation with regard to the presentation of 
the Slovak Republic abroad improved in 1993, it needs to be said 
that a relatively low level of information on the Slovak 
Republic persists among foreign professional, political, and 
economic circles as well as among media workers and the general 
public. The interest of foreign mass media, political 
representatives, and experts is focused predominantly on 
expediently [ucelove] selected ranges of issues -- the situation 
regarding the protection of ethnic minority rights, freedom of 
the press, the problem of conversion of arms production, the 
status of the Romany ethnic community, and the like. 
  The main orientation in the activity of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs was therefore focused on preventive measures. 
The point of gravity of efforts lay in the compilation and 
distribution of basic information about Slovakia. A number of 
documents and books were issued (History of Slovakia and 
Slovaks) in the course of the year, or their re-issue is being 
prepared (Slovakia's Five Shapes, and others). Among the major 
publishing feats, it is necessary to mention the representative 
encyclopedia "Slovakia in the World -- World in Slovakia," being 
prepared for the first anniversary of the founding of the Slovak 
Republic. 
  Some justified reservations notwithstanding, the start of 
the publication of the English-language monthly SLOVAKIA can be 
considered a positive step. In 1993 we launched cooperation 
with the Babylon agency aimed at publishing a quarterly in 
Arabic, called SLOVAKIA TODAY. 
  In cooperation with the Slovak Government Office and other 
state administration bodies, foremost attention was devoted to 
the sphere of trade and economic cooperation. Emphasis was laid 
on our interest, and the Slovak Government's systematic 
activity, in establishing conditions for the influx of foreign 
capital and investments. 
  From the territorial viewpoint, the activities centered 
primarily on the neighboring countries, chiefly Hungary and 
Austria. Despite maximum efforts, with regard to the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project we did not 
succeed in eliminating to the full extent the consequences of 
the Hungarian mass media activities directed against the Slovak 
Republic. The activities of the Slovak side were confined 
almost exclusively to standard methods (news conferences, 
publications, and the like) and very little or no use was made 
of offensive forms of mass media activities (appropriate 
cooperation with selected mass media prior to the adoption, or 
publication, of the Slovak side's relevant decisions). 
  In spite of an endeavor to do so, we did not succeed to the 
full extent in securing the publication of ad hoc materials on 
key foreign policy steps and activities of the Slovak Republic 
and on important domestic political events (such as statements 
by constitutional officials of the Slovak Republic). 
  An important role was played in 1993 by cooperation with 
foreign companies involved in shaping and influencing public 
opinion, particularly in the United States and the most 
important countries of Western Europe. Experience with the firm 
MWW/SC [expansion unknown] confirmed that it is essential to 
thoroughly prepare agreements on cooperation and to set aside a 
sufficient number of staffers assigned these public relations 
tasks. In view of the financial costs, it was not possible to 
make use of the aforementioned form of activity in the period 
under review. This type of cooperation clearly requires a 
coordinated course of action at the highest level and an 
adequate pooling of resources of all interested government 
departments. 
<H5>  6. Building the Diplomatic Service </H5>
  As of 31 November 1993, 415 employees worked at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs in Bratislava, 189 of them in diplomatic 
posts and 226 as desk officers in administrative and technical 
jobs. In the course of 1993, 120 university graduates and 87 
people with secondary and basic education took up work with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  The Slovak Republic maintains abroad 54 embassies, 6 
standing 
missions, and 3 general consulates, at which operate 219 
diplomatic staffers (60 of which, those working at trade and 
economic sections, are under the methodological guidance of the 
Ministry of Economy, 1, working at the Food and Agriculture 
Organization in Rome, under the methodological guidance of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, and 1, working at the standing mission 
at Brussels, under the methodological guidance of the Ministry 
of Finance) and 200 administrative and technical staff. In the 
course of 1993, 42 diplomats and 53 administrative and technical 
staffers were dispatched into foreign service. A total of 10 
diplomats and 2 administrative and technical staffers are 
currently undergoing preparation prior to being sent abroad. 
  A total of 26 diplomats operate in the rank of ambassador; 
another three diplomats have been approved as ambassadors by the 
government and the president of the Slovak Republic and are 
ready to depart for their post; two have been approved as 
ambassadors by the Government of the Slovak Republic and their 
nomination has been submitted to the president of the Slovak 
Republic for approval; and four proposals for ambassadorial 
appointments have been submitted to the Government of the Slovak 
Republic for approval. 
  Building the diplomatic service of the Slovak Republic in 
1994 made it necessary not only to supplement the apparatus of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with new personnel, but also to 
adapt its organizational structures and to draw up internal 
guidelines for the activity of both the Bratislava headquarters 
and representative missions abroad. Attention was also devoted 
to the problems of information flow, communications, and other 
technical and organizational problems of building the Slovak 
Republic's diplomatic service. Emphasis was placed, in 
particular, on the establishment of a basic technical platform 
for the Foreign Affairs Ministry's information system, on the 
drafting of a concept for the development of the 
telecommunications network, and on an effective substitution and 
completion of communications devices, including means of special 
communications. The set tasks have been fulfilled without any 
serious shortcomings, in defiance of complicated conditions 
caused, in particular, by the state of the installations 
inherited from the division [of federal property].

<F P=106> [Atanas Matev commentary: "Close and Remote Interests"] </F>
  [Text] Greece's decision to impose an economic blockade on 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
is extremely erroneous. If one doubts this, it is enough that 
they would listen to the salvos of criticism and denunciations 
of the decision that resounded throughout the world. 
  Greece apparently thinks that it could assert its long-range 
interests through a painful pressure upon the young republic at 
a very painful moment for the Balkans. Athens certainly wants 
to make sure that in the future Skopje will not present any 
territorial claims regarding the northern Greek province of 
Macedonia. 
  Such a possibility exists and it cannot be refuted a priori. 
However, this is not the greatest problem at the present. 
  It is a question for the future whether Skopje will declare 
territorial claims regarding Greek territory. However, an 
economic blockade, which is taking place at the present, already 
represents a clash between Greece and Macedonia. 
  This bodes great dangers against the background of the 
existing situation in the Balkans. One of them is in forcing 
the Macedonians into a too close alliance with Albania in order 
to obtain a commercial outlet to the world. This could violate 
the very fragile ethnic-political balance in Macedonia. The 
second danger is in Greece trying to apply pressure on other 
Balkan countries, including Bulgaria, in an attempt to prevent 
Macedonia from obtaining a commercial outlet. This could 
violate the fragile political balance in the southern Balkans. 
  One should not be puzzled if it appears that, while thinking 
about its long-range interests, Greece neglects the importance 
of the immediate ones. The trouble is that the states bordering 
on Greece could also pay for this mistake, despite the fact that 
this is the last thing they want.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Krum Asparukhov: "National Security Is Even </F>
More Important Than Parliament"] 
  [Text] For the first time in Bulgarian history, the 
parliament, at a meeting behind closed doors, heard a detailed 
account of the state of the Bulgarian Army submitted by Army 
General Lyuben Petrov, chief of Army General Staff. With facts, 
figures, and sound arguments he explained to the deputies that 
the 11.6-billion-leva army budget could only cover the Armed 
Forces' needs for the next few months, until summer, unless 
personnel is cut by half, namely to 40,000 men. 
  The military budget is the price our people have to pay to 
defend the country. It is determined according to the extent to 
which the country's security is threatened. This is the basic 
criterion. It is followed by resources for the tasks the 
military units are expected to accomplish in order to cope with 
the threat, and last but not least, by the forces in charge of 
the aforementioned tasks. The military budget consists of four 
components: Current expenditures for the maintenance of the 
army; the supply of armaments and technical equipment; the 
building of defense facilities and facilities for the troops; 
and finally, theoretical research and developments in the 
military sphere. The experience of the last few years shows 
that most resources are spent on soldiers' everyday needs and 
for routine tasks of military service. The proposed budget 
excludes all possibilities of purchasing new technical equipment 
and armaments. Some 200 of the 230 existing barracks are in 
urgent need of major repairs. The condition of military 
equipment is absolutely desolate. Not even one officer has 
submitted a paper for an academic title in the last four years. 
  In 1989 the military budget represented 4.06 percent of GDP, 
while in 1990 it dropped to 3.2 percent; in 1991 -- to 3 
percent; in 1992 -- to 2.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 2.6 percent. 
In 1994 the percentage is expected even to drop to 2.4 percent. 
The downward trend is determined both by the country's serious 
economic crisis and by the inability to adapt the budget to the 
acute shortage of funds. In these circumstances the social 
problems in the army are likely to get worse, and morale is 
likely to fall because of the hopeless revenue policy, which in 
the long run will further delay the army reform. 
  Turkey's 1994 military budget amounts to $8.601 billion in 
addition to the $2 billion in military aid from the United 
States. 
  Greece's current military budget amounts to $28 billion, 
which represents 8 percent of the national budget, in addition 
to $1 billion in military aid from the United States and 340 
million marks from Germany. The Romanian military budget 
amounts to $560 million, which represents 8 percent of the 
country's budget. States in the same desolate financial 
situation as Bulgaria still manage to find resources for their 
army because they consider it a vital institution. It is not a 
problem of one or another political force, of the government, or 
of a certain ministry. The problem affects our national 
security, without which the transition to democracy would be a 
mere exercise in rhetorics. 
  At the plenary session of the National Assembly General 
Petrov reportedly said that the General Staff cannot bear 
responsibility for the proposed military budget. He called for 
an additional 11 billion leva. Only a few National Assembly 
deputies, in their statements, supported the demands of the army 
leadership. Hence, it would be quite normal for parliament to 
assume responsibility for the state of our national security, in 
the event the requested resources for the army are voted down, 
because national security is even more important than parliament.

<F P=106> [Neven Kopandanova commentary: "BSP Has Monopoly"] </F>
  [Text] On 21 February Zhan Videnov said that in addition 
to meeting the visiting Russian parliamentarians as Bulgarian 
Socialist parliamentarians, the two delegations also had 
unofficial contacts at the party level. Apparently next week 
there will be a meeting of Russia's leftist parties in which the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] will take part. On the Russian 
side, the meeting will be attended by the Socialist Labor Party, 
Rybkin's Agrarian Party of Russia [APR], and the "Free Russia" 
People's Party [as published]. Our Socialists hope that other 
CIS countries will also participate in the meeting. 
  The Socialists' active contacts with congenial parties in 
Serbia, Greece, and Russia, where those parties rule, could 
hardly be reduced to attempts on the part of the Bulgarian 
Socialists to overcome the difficulties along the road to 
Europe. There is a present danger that the BSP could monopolize 
a part of our foreign policy. This evokes an even greater 
concern against the background of the different views of the 
political parties in our country in anything related to foreign 
policy elements. 
  It is true that National Assembly Chairman and the Movement 
for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] also received official invitations 
to visit Russia. On 21 February deputies of the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] said that they also have been invited, 
but for the time being they consider their invitation as 
unofficial. In principle, the SDS was interested in 
strengthening relations with Russia, but for the time being 
there was no adequate program, [SDS deputy] Asparukh Panov said 
on 21 February. The main foreign policy expert of the blue 
coalition [SDS] did not hide his concern with the independent 
foreign policy tunnels the BSP is tracing. He noted that the 
BSP's foreign policy activity is becoming ever more intensive 
and that this hardly contributes to a uniform Bulgarian foreign 
policy. 
  Bulgarian tax payers noted a long time ago that there is no 
uniform Bulgarian foreign policy. If the president is closer to 
the SDS doctrine, the premier undoubtedly professes the BSP's 
doctrine. However, since according to the Constitution, there 
are two foreign policy centers in Bulgaria, it is reasonable to 
expect their chiefs to clarify the direction in which the wind 
blows. One could hardly doubt the fact that we need good 
economic and political relations with Russia. The question is 
to what extend we will be able to defend our independence and 
equality in our relations with Russia, something that the two 
centers, or at least one of them, apparently cannot guarantee. 
It cannot be natural that the political force with the greatest 
influence in our country -- the SDS -- does not have direct 
contacts with a great power such as Russia. Such relations 
would certainly introduce a new tone in international relations, 
which will break out of the narrow party track in which the 
Socialists pushed them through their monopoly.

  [Text] Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle stated 
yesterday at a news conference that "Slovenia is considering 
normalizing relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
[FRY]." According to Peterle, the Slovene Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs "is actively observing the state of everything that has 
recently changed in relations between Ljubljana and Belgrade." 
The diplomatic service in Slovenia is preparing information on 
what needs to be done to promote contacts between Ljubljana and 
Belgrade. Peterle pointed out that Slovenia's official position, 
favoring the normalizing of relations, is in Slovenia's 
interest, particularly because of the increasingly successful 
contacts between Zagreb and Belgrade.

<F P=106> [Article by Ranka Kovacevic-Jelic: "Wendt Did Not Play </F>
Tennis With Jansa"] 
  [Excerpts] We could say that nowadays in Slovenia one of 
the behind-the-scenes battles for power has resulted in a story 
of two chairs. Figuratively speaking, Milan Kucan, Slovene 
president and commander in chief of the armed forces, "nearly 
fell" out of his chair when he heard about the presence of four 
high-ranking U.S. military officers in Slovenia during a 
conversation with Allan Wendt, U.S. ambassador to Slovenia. Now 
the "diplomatic chair" is shaking under Wendt. There are rumors 
of his recall because of alleged "special relations with the 
Ministry of Defense." 
  According to the Ljubljana paper REPUBLIKA, U.S. Ambassador 
Wendt is to leave Ljubljana in May, before the end of his term. 
The news is mentioned in the same context as the early recall of 
Lieutenant Colonel G.E. Lich, head of the U.S. officers group. 
  The Slovene public learned about the presence of four 
high-ranking U.S. officers, members of the "liaison group" who 
have for some time been guests of the Slovene Ministry of 
Defense, in the middle of last week when Lieutenant Colonel 
Lich, before his departure, paid a visit to a secretary of the 
Defense Ministry. President Kucan was not any better informed 
since he learned about it only a day earlier. 
  During the talk with Wendt, Kucan expressed interest in 
details of the "Partnership for Peace" program. He was told that 
Slovenia meets most political and military requirements, except 
for technical questions which are being resolved in the Slovene 
Defense Ministry with the aid of the four high-ranking U.S. 
officers. President Kucan had no idea this was going on, nor did 
Prime Minister Drnovsek, who was informed by the commander in 
chief about the U.S. officers' presence in Jansa's ministry. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Slovene power struggle has also divided U.S. officials 
in 
Slovenia. Some feel closer to Drnovsek's Liberal Democrats, 
others to Defense Minister Janez Jansa, who, according to a 
February DELO poll, is the most popular politician. Regarding 
DELO, it is interesting that this daily did not report this 
affair until recently. "Malicious persons" have found an 
immediate answer, namely, that the Ministry of Defense is trying 
to solve the housing problem of Tit Dobersek, DELO editor in 
chief.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Vodusek: "Sad Defeated Foes"] </F>
  [Text] "The biggest project after Demos," as Dimitrij 
Rupel has assessed the unification of the political center, 
marks the final defeat of the United List, which did not succeed 
in its transformation from a party of "directors" to a party 
with a social democratic profile. The United List has lost the 
unnecessary "crusade" against [Defense Minister] Janez Jansa and 
will after the unification of the center probably play a role of 
wealthy utopian communists with ample financial backing. 
  After the completion of the unification, the United List 
will 
probably be forced to withdraw gradually from the coalition 
although the protagonists of unification emphasize that a 
reshuffle of ministerial departments is not in its background. 
It is interesting that even [Foreign Minister] Lojze Peterle 
and the Christian Democrats oppose the Democrats, the Greens, 
and the Socialists assuming ministerial posts. They believe 
that the United List should stay in the coalition despite the 
unification of the center, because, owing to the burden of its 
past, it is more controllable than the new Liberal Democracy. 
Objectively speaking, the new party will take the segment of 
the political spectrum that has hitherto been covered by the 
United List and at the same time also a proportion of its 
voters, but it will primarily take ministerial posts. 
  The unification of the center also means the end of trauma 
for at least some Democrats, who with 9 percent of the votes at 
the first elections held the most important posts in Slovene 
politics for two years. The story about the political center 
also means the end of the utopian idea about philosophers and 
philanthropists in politics, who used to play the role of bad 
conscience in the parliamentary democracy and by doing so first 
killed off the Slovene Democratic Alliance, later Demos, and 
finally -- people like Rudi Seligo and Tine and Spomenka Hribar 
-- left the party, but not politics. Some intellectuals in 
politics even today cannot come to terms with the fact that 
their vote in parliament counts as much as a vote of a deputy of 
the Slovene National Party or the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS]. 
The problems in the unification of the center should, 
therefore, not be sought merely with the Liberal Democrats, but 
primarily in the Democratic Party, where some people are not 
absolutely convinced about the pragmatism of Igor Bavcar and 
Dimitrij Rupel. Even though Rupel, Bavcar, and Tancig would not 
relinquish their ministerial posts if "the reformists" left the 
coalition, the unification of the center is evidently a 
long-term project -- especially in the light of the local 
elections, where parties lacking finances or party 
infrastructure will be condemned to defeat. 
  The emergence of the new Liberal Democracy also means that 
the ZSMS [the former Socialist Alliance of Youth] faction of 
Jozef Skoljc and the Democrats with their state-forming pedigree 
will clash again, but [Prime Minister] Janez Drnovsek obviously 
does not have much room for maneuver. The left wing is occupied 
by Milan Kucan, while on the right wing it is not yet quite 
clear how the conflict, whose main protagonists are brothers 
Podobnik and Lojze Peterle, will end for the Christian 
Democracy. Christian Democrat Ivan Oman on one occasion said 
that the Slovene Christian Democratic Party [SKD] and the SLS 
will merge only once its leaders have passed away. Of course, 
in realpolitik not even antagonisms last for ever, and one can 
thus at least expect a joint appearance of "the anticorruption 
league" at the local elections if not the actual unification of 
the SDK and the SLS. The "unprincipled coalition" would do the 
biggest service to Janez Jansa by pushing him into opposition, 
as he would then be able to prepare for the looming early 
elections in peace. There is a belief among the new Liberal 
Democracy that the prime minister yields to much to the defense 
minister and "the confessional" part of the coalition. We will 
soon see whether the new Liberal Democratic bloc is against the 
right wing or whether, at least as concerns the Democrats, an 
if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them strategy is lurking in the 
background. 
  The story about the unification, which will mark the 
Slovene political scene for a long time, is not merely about who 
will take what ministerial post but also about who will, through 
the Liberal Democracy, appoint ministers and form the 
government. The public opinion polls show that the rating of 
the parties has not changed much since independence and after 
all the affairs, with the exception of the United List, whose 
crisis headquarters have established that they had lost by their 
wrong policy of antagonizing Jansa, which at the same time 
weakened the influence of President Milan Kucan, and contributed 
toward the rising popularity of the defense minister. 
  Janez Drnovsek, who has never concerned himself much with 
faction struggles, will definitely remain the central figure of 
the new Liberal Democracy until the elections. Secretly, he is 
perhaps coveting the post of the president of the state, where 
he is not without competition even though Milan Kucan has 
announced on several occasions that he will not run in the 
forthcoming elections. 
  Beside the SKD and the SLS, which will definitely have 
advantage at the local elections, personnel is the key problem 
of the parties that have emerged with the democratic elections, 
because they cannot cover approximately 300 new communes. 
Namely, the total membership of some of these parties hardly 
exceeds the number of local communities, as it primarily 
consists of pragmatic elites. This is also how the interest in 
the unification of the center could be interpreted. The times 
of the proverb "two Slovenes, three parties," are over. Only 
those who have the money, the electoral base, and above all 
clear programs for which they are willing to fight until the end 
will survive on the political scene. "A bloc policy" is in the 
process of being created in Slovenia and the time of "the Cold 
War" is nearing, for which some politicians have already lost 
their nerve before it even starts.

<F P=106> [Statement by Fikret Abdic, former Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Presidency member and leader of the Cazin Krajina separatists, 
to Belgrade Television in Belgrade on 24 Feb -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Abdic, do you 
wish to give a statement for Television Serbia on the essence of 
the agreement that you have reached here in Belgrade with 
republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic, mediated by 
Serbian President Slobdan Milosevic? 
  [Abdic] Of course I wish to make a statement because I came 
here publicly, in the function of peace, because it is known 
that 18 days ago a fierce armed clash occurred between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Srpska army. For the 
past 18 days I have been trying to do what could be done over 
the telephone in contacts with Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan 
Karadzic to stop the armed clashes. It is known that we have 
drawn up a cease-fire agreement and an agreement on the 
cessation of all hostilities, however, there are still instances 
of violating this agreement. Therefore, this was actually the 
reason why I turned to Slobodan Milosevic to ask Radovan 
Karadzic to meet with us here in Belgrade and to review once 
again the declaration which we signed on 22 October 1993, which 
Slobodan Milosevic also signed. 
  I can conclude with great pleasure that Mr. Milosevic 
expressed readiness to call Karadzic, and that he remained 
committed to all the principles we agreed to on 22 October. 
That is why we have signed this agreement, and with this 
agreement I can guarantee the citizens of Bihac -- and the 
citizens of western Bosnia -- peace. That is the most important 
thing. Moreover, I believe that when peace is the issue, one 
must choose neither the time nor the place, nor spare oneself or 
fall under the influence of various comments, but must rise to 
the occasion since it is people and lasting peace that are at 
stake. It is the duty of all of us to do everything possible to 
ensure peace returns to all the territories. I have been 
criticized for striving too hard for peace in the autonomous 
province of Western Bosnia, rather than for peace throughout 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. I have to say that in my opinion, peace 
must have a starting point. The most realistic starting point 
is precisely in the autonomous province of Western Bosnia. I 
believe that we can establish peace throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina based precisely on the principles of this 
peace.

  [Text] Nis, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- The signing of the peace 
agreement between the Srpska republic and the autonomous 
province of western Bosnia was a result of the situation where 
both peoples needed peace rather than war, Momcilo Krajisnik, 
the Srpska parliament speaker told Nis radio "Radio about 
politics" program. 
  "We have nothing against the other people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is the Croats, organizing themselves 
the way they find best," Krajisnik said. 
  Commenting on the establishment of a Confederation of 
Muslims 
and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said such a 
confederation was not an expression of the will of the Muslim 
and Croat people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a result 
of great pressure by the mentors who are helping the Muslims and 
the Croats. 
  "The [mentors] objective is to prevent the formation of a 
Muslim state and to prevent the area, which is under the 
influence of the western powers, from becoming split and from 
falling under somebody else's influence in the near future," 
Krajisnik said. 
  "The Muslims are much more closely linked with the Serbs 
[than with the Croats], and perhaps they would opt for an 
association with Serbia," Krajisnik said, adding that this was 
obviously against the interests of certain strong forces in the 
West, which use the United Nations to achieve their objectives. 
  Referring to the demands for the opening of Tuzla airport 
Krajisnik said: "We will be cooperative and we will make maximum 
concessions, but only up to a limit that does not threaten the 
interests of the Serb people." 
  "We have achieved our objective in Sarajevo, although the 
Muslim side had set a trap for us. They wanted to disarm us and 
win in that way. Instead of bombing the Serbs they have now got 
the Russians in -- this is a joke now circulating both among our 
soldiers and among the Muslims," Krajisnik said in "Radio about 
Politics" program.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic charged here Thursday that Serbs have failed to 
honor the NATO ultimatum to withdraw all artillery from 
Sarjaevo. He said many Serb heavy guns were still in position 
against the mainly Moslem Bosnian capital. 
  In a statement read to reporters by Bosnian Vice President 
Ejup Ganic, Izetbegovic gave a list of weapons not pulled out 
since the NATO ultimatum expired Monday. "According to reliable 
data, the realization of the ultimatum is not accomplished," the 
statement said. 
  It listed sitings by Bosnian sources from Monday to 
Wednesday 
of eight tanks, three armored personnel carriers and at least 16 
artillery pieces in the 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone 
NATO had called for around Sarajevo by last Monday. NATO 
threatened air strikes as of Monday to destroy the arms. 
Whether these weapons remained Thursday could not be 
immediately confirmed. 
  UN spokesmen here say there is effective compliance since 
Serb forces have been pulling out artillery and have not shelled 
Sarajevo. 
  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian 
Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said Thursday, however, that 
there were still at least eight weapons sites to be checked. 
Aikman said there were in addition sites where Serbs were 
refusing to hand over arms to UN troops. 
  Ganic charged that the 260 pieces of artillery UNPROFOR has 
collected so far from the Serbs included many obsolete arms and 
many below the high calibre weapons the Serbs possess. He spoke 
of UN Bosnian commander British General Michael Rose "saying he 
was going to go to sleep comfortably (at the time the deadline 
fell Monday at 0100 GMT) since the job was done." "Now it is a 
mess," Ganic said.

  [Text] The chetniks are continuing to violate the 
cease-fire flagrantly. They have again today provided enough 
evidence of the fact that they have not removed all the weaponry 
to the distance required. 
  This morning they fired with an antiaircraft machine gun 
from 
(Kromolje) at Brekin Potok, and small arms fire could be heard 
all day. This was particularly evident in Brijesce, Sokolje, 
Mijatovica Kosa, and Hotonj, while an antiaircraft gun from 
(Nadvozici) fired at (Visocje). 
  The Chetnik snipers have been active in various locations, 
where they have been seeking out victims using weapons with 
silencers. According to reports, there have been no casualties 
so far, but this behavior by the aggressor warrants extreme 
caution.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 25 (AFP) -- UN commander for Sarajevo 
French General Andre Soubirou on Friday blamed ceasefire 
violations here on provocations by the mainly Moslem Bosnian 
army. 
  In a statement read out to reporters by a French officer, 
Soubirou said trench digging by Bosnian soldiers drew fire from 
Serbs who thought the Bosnians were trying to advance their 
lines. 
  "The cease-fire is overall respected. However some shots 
fired break it from time to time," Soubirou said in the 
statement read by Major Guy Vinet. "Most often they are the 
result of Serb reaction from anxious soldiers who shoot at the 
Muslims who dig some trenches regularly. These diggings are a 
Bosnian provocation," the statement said. 
  The ceasefire between Serbs besieging Sarajevo and the 
Bosnians defending it was agreed by the two sides on February 9, 
the day NATO issued an ultimatum for heavy artillery to be 
withdrawn from Sarajevo. 
  The ceasefire has held and Sarajevo is the calmest it has 
been since war began in April 1992. Meanwhile a nation-wide 
ceasefire in Moslem-Croat fighting was due to take effect at 
1100 GMT Friday.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A meeting of the Commission 
for Cooperation with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] began 
at Sarajevo Airport at 1100. Nikola Koljevic, vice president of 
the Srpska republic, set off to the meeting armed with several 
proposals regarding the opening of Sarajevo and the 
normalization of life in both parts of the city. The proposals 
in question concern the so-called blue roads leading toward 
Sarajevo, which would be controlled by the peace forces, and the 
free departure of civilians from the city, primarily Serbs who 
since the beginning of the war have been hostages of the Muslim 
authorities. The outcome of this meeting is awaited impatiently, 
and it will depend to a great extent on the Muslim side's 
position.

  [Excerpt] Within the next two days UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] will put forward a proposal for a document on the use of 
blue routes to and from Sarajevo in accordance with the UN 
resolutions adopted so far. This was one of the most important 
conclusions reached at today's negotiations between our and the 
Serb aggressor delegation at Sarajevo airport. The document, 
which will most probably be adopted, provides for the opening of 
a road corridor from Sarajevo via Vogosca [Serb-held district 
north of Sarajevo center] to Visoko and Zenica [Muslim-held 
towns in central Bosnia] for humanitarian convoys and all other 
users with valid documents issued by the relevant authorities.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1100 GMT on 25 February in its 
regular 15-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Chetniks are 
mindlessly attacking, obviously planning it to be do or die in 
their blitzkrieg in which they plan to occupy the right bank of 
the Una. Therefore, they are bringing in fresh manpower and 
military hardware." Sadikovic says that "during last evening as 
well as in the early morning hours, the artillery was destroying 
Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Several civilians have been 
injured and the material damage is huge. There is no peace 
along the separation lines with the remainders of the 
paramilitary of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. After operating 
at [word indistinct], the commune of Cazin, provocations 
continued at other parts of the separation lines." 
  Hajrudin Sermic describes the situation in Maglaj as 
"extremely dramatic. The attacks by Chetniks and Ustashas on 
Maglaj are increasing by the minute and the encirclement is 
tightening more and more. Everything that the aggressor 
possesses is being used today; helicopters are flying over in an 
unperturbed manner carrying out combat activity with guided 
missiles on our fighters' positions. Tanks are coming ever 
closer to the town and trucks and transport vehicle are 
constantly bringing in manpower reinforcements. All this is 
taking place at a (?critical) line of the (?Ploca)-Plana section 
on the northern section with the generous aid of Ustashas 
dressed up in Chetnik uniforms. Many of them have been 
recognized and the [word indistinct] traffic of Chetniks and 
Ustashas speaks of their coordinated action. There are some 
dead fighters on our side and tanks are rolling over their 
bodies. On behalf of 35,000 civilians of this town, we demand 
that UNPROFOR forces enter Maglaj urgently and immediately and 
prevent an unprecedented catastrophe."

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] On this the 19th day of the fiercest offensive on 
Bihac, the Serb aggressor continues his bestial orgy of 
destruction. The artillery and infantry, and tank and infantry 
attacks and attempts to break through on the Grmuski part of the 
front have continued today, as have attacks on (Hasino Brdo) and 
the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, where the chetniks have again 
directed most of their forces. 
  They have been using a new method of shelling the town. 
Probably because of the increasingly frequent overflights of 
NATO aircraft, they have rescheduled their shelling of Cazin and 
Bihac with howitzers, tanks, and mortars from the hills 
surrounding Bihac to mornings and nights. 
  The defenders -- the heroes of the 5th Corps -- have been 
courageously resisting the attacks, defending with their bodies 
every inch of this blood-soaked land. Today they have repulsed 
several attempts at tank and infantry breakthroughs. 
  Today there have again been provocations along the 
demarcation lines with the remnants of the paramilitary of the 
so-called Kladusa autonomy, and the 5th Corps Command has lodged 
a strong protest with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], since 
the commander of the UN French Battalion promised to mediate and 
to take on responsibility for the observance of the latest 
cease-fire. 
  All in all, the [words indistinct] is continuing with a new 
uncertainty.

  [Text] Ivica Saric reporting for Croatian Radio. Vitez is 
going through one of the most devastating Muslim artillery 
attacks since the aggression began on 15 April last year. The 
usual afternoon mortar provocations this evening turned into 
artillery barrage fire directed at the center of Vitez, the 
Croatian Defense Council's [HVO's] Vitez operational zone 
reports. 
  Tank-fired missiles and 122-mm howitzer shells are landing 
on 
residential areas and other civilian facilities. The attacks 
from the direction of Preocica and Poculica and other positions 
along the Zenica line have been coupled by 60-mm mortar shells 
from the direction of Mahala, the part of Stari Vitez under the 
control of the Muslim army. 
  The command of the Vitez operational zone reports that two 
children have already died in this infernal shelling. Nobody 
bothers to estimate the extent of the material damage any 
longer. The population has been warned by the local radio 
station and in other appropriate ways to descend into bomb 
shelters. The general alert sounded on 15 April last year is 
still in force. It is 1800 hours and the pounding goes on. HVO 
units are responding to the hostile fire with the means at their 
disposal, the Vitez operational zone command said.

  [Text] Maglaj has been going through hell today. The town 
is definitely disappearing under the onslaught of several 
thousand artillery shells. This afternoon two Luna missiles 
were fired at Maglaj, killing and wounding several civilians. 
The Maglaj defense lines are also ablaze under the unabated 
attacks by masses of equipment, weapons, and manpower coming in 
waves. The enemy has been intensifying his attempts to break 
through with infantry at Lijesnica, and has been using tanks in 
frontal attacks on Plane on the northern part of the front. The 
fighters of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade have been resisting 
these attacks. It was said here a long time ago that even a 
retreat of just one meter would mean deserting the people of 
this town to a horrible massacre. That is why the morale, the 
will, and the heroism of the Golden Lilies [Bosnia-Herzegovina 
flag] are superhuman.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 25 February within its 
regular 4-minute newscast carries reports on situation in the 
republic. 
  In a report on the situation in the zone covered by the 7th 
Operations Group, Smail Terzic says that it is "very difficult 
in the zone. The aggressor is incessantly launching shells and 
destroying civilian buildings. Since the morning hours, he has 
fired about 2,000 shells on the defense lines and the towns of 
Tesanj and Maglaj. The situation in the zones covered by the 
201st, 207th, 203d, and the 110th Glorious HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] Brigade is fierce, but our brave fighters are 
withstanding all attacks. About 200 tank shells have been fired 
at the regions of Kriz, Obli Kamen, and Filipovici. Moreover, 
the enemy is bringing in new forces, mainly from Bosnian 
Krajina, and several dozen guns and mortars have been brought to 
the temporarily occupied region of Novi Seher. Since last 
night, two enemy batteries of 122mm and 150mm are present in the 
Potocani region, which means that the enemy has not given up his 
offensive." 
  A studio announcer says that "our correspondent from Fojnica 
reports that at about 1100 [1000 GMT] today, 12 projectiles from 
a 128-mm multiple rocket launcher fell. Therefore, Ustasha 
artillery hit civilian targets in the town for the third time in 
a month. Some people are injured, but the final number is still 
not known. Ustasha snipers are particularly active and are 
opening fire along defense lines. They are active along the 
entire zone covered by the 310th Mountain Brigade."

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 24 (AFP) -- The ceasefire between 
Bosnian Croat and Moslem forces could mean the return of basic 
services such as water supplies in the besieged Moslem areas of 
Mostar, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said Thursday [24 
February]. 
  The UNHCR is also planning to reestablish its permanent 
office in the city, after moving it to Medjugorje last year when 
fighting between HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Croat forces and 
the Moslem-led Bosnian government army made the place too 
dangerous, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told AFP. 
  The office, staffed by five foreigners and about 20 local 
people, should be set up in the Croat-controlled west of Mostar, 
and "we would hope to have access to the east," said Redmond. 
  The eastern Moslem enclave has been under constant Croat 
fire 
for the last 10 months and the UNHCR's information chief Sylvana 
Foa recently described the situation there as "worse than 
Sarajevo ... 55,000 people live there like rats, without water, 
electricity or sanitation," she said. 
  In Rome, the foreign ministry announced Thursday that the 
first humanitarian aid convoy since the weekend's Sarajevo 
ceasefire had arrived at Mostar. Four trucks, escorted by the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), arrived Wednesday with some 30 
tonnes of food, clothing and medicine, it said. 
  Redmond said the ceasefire, due to take effect Friday noon 
(1100 GMT), was "a good sign" which could "change a lot for the 
drivers who risk their lives under the shelling and snipers 
(...) allow setting up a water purification unit taken there 
last week and be of great help for the mobile hospital." 
  According to UNPROFOR, about 48 people died from Croat 
shelling during the week of February 11 to 19 alone.

<F P=106> [By Milan Dragovic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Zagreb, Feb 24 (AFP) -- The beleaguered Moslem 
enclave of Mostar is first priority for UN troops enforcing a 
ceasefire between Croat and Moslem forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
a UN official said Thursday [24 February]. 
  "We are going to intervene at the most contested points on 
the front line," an official from the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) General Staff told AFP. 
  Some 1,200 UN troops from the Spanish battalion, based at 
Medjugorje 25 kilometres (15 miles) south of Mostar, should be 
the first to be deployed once the ceasefire takes effect Friday 
at 1100 GMT, but an effective intervention would depend on a 
significant increase in UN ground troops. 
  "In the circumstances, we are going to use our resources in 
the most honest and rational way possible," the official said. 
  The 55,000 Moslems living in the east of Mostar have been 
under constant fire for the last 10 months by Croat forces, who 
want to make Mostar the "capital" of their self-proclaimed 
Bosnian republic. 
  On Wednesday, the day the ceasefire was agreed, Croat forces 
fired 15 mortar and artillery shells on the sector, UNPROFOR 
spokesman Bill Aikman said in Sarajevo on Thursday. 
  The agreement between General Rasim Delic of the Moslem-led 
Bosnian army and General Ante Roso, commander of the Bosnian 
Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] militia, calls for a "total 
and immediate end to hostilities" and the deployment of UNPROFOR 
troops in "sensitive areas and key sites." 
  It resembles the February 9 accord concluded by Moslems and 
Serbs for Sarajevo under UNPROFOR auspices and reinforced by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum issued the same 
day, made effective last weekend. 
  Heavy arms bigger than 12.7 mm are to be withdrawn from 
specified front lines -- 10 kilometres (six miles) for mortars 
and 20 kilometres (12 miles) for artillery guns and tanks -- or 
put under UN control by midday March 7. 
  A joint commission chaired by UNPROFOR was to be set up on 
Friday at Kiseljak to help reopen roads, allowing free movement 
and the "return to normal life" for the population. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fighting between Croat and Moslem forces continued Wednesday 
in central Bosnia, especially at the Croat-controlled town of 
Vitez where mortar and artillery fire intensified. [passage 
omitted] 
  In Zagreb's UNPROFOR headquarters on Thursday, questions 
were 
raised about the will of Croat and Moslem forces to stop 
fighting. "In the face of people who want to fight each other, 
we cannot do much," said a senior official. 
  But Kofi Annan, visiting head of the UN peacekeeping 
operations department, took an optimistic tone after meeting 
with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  "We are both encouraged by the latest developments and the 
involvement of the major powers," he said after the meeting in 
Zagreb on Thursday. "Both the United States and Russia are 
active and, apart from Sarajevo, we hope there is going to be a 
real movement for peace in the region." 
  Annan said he had raised the question of extending the 
mandate for the 15,000 UN troops deployed in Croatia, which 
expires at the end of March. 
  "The president raised the issue of a more assertive 
implementation of the UNPROFOR mandate, to create a situation 
where displaced people will be able to return to their homes," 
he said. 
  According to the Croatian government, some 25,000 Croats 
have 
been driven from their homes by separatist Serb forces, which 
control a quarter of Croatian territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Redzovic from Tesanj] </F>
  [Text] The Serb aggressor's fierce attacks have been coming 
in waves against the unified free territory under the control of 
the 7th South Operative Group. The enemy has been launching 
heavy attacks along the entire defense line. However, our men 
are not giving in and they have inflicted heavy losses on the 
enemy in the operational zones of all their six brigades. 
  This enemy offensive is by far the strongest in intensity 
and 
it is also the most extensive so far. The aggressor has 
deployed eight brigades with over 15,000 men, six of which are 
local and two from elsewhere, consisting of soldiers from Banja 
Luka, Prnjavor, Mt. Romanija, Pale, Sokolac -- in other words, 
from the Sarajevo front -- and from Serbia and Montenegro. 
Every day the enemy is using over 100 artillery pieces of over 
82-mm caliber, tanks, and armored personnel carriers. 
  These, the heaviest artillery pieces of the occupying 
forces, 
are being accompanied by unprecedented psychological propaganda 
activities, particularly via local radio stations. [words 
indistinct] propaganda during the first days of the offensive 
that started on 17 January was aimed at the Croats, that is, at 
the 110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade, which was constantly being 
urged to join the Serb aggressor. That failed, and then the 
Chetniks launched fierce attacks on Croatian villages and the 
entire defense line of the 110th Brigade. The attacks are 
continuing. 
  There have been questions as to what will change here in 
view 
of the NATO ultimatum, but no one expects the Sarajevo model to 
be applied in this region, even though Maglaj has been mentioned 
as an option but only as a protected area. 
  The Serb aggressor now has four strategic aims: The conquest 
of the free territory under the control of the 7th South 
Operative Group, attacks in the direction of Posavina, the 
linking of Banja Luka via Bihac with Knin and its railroad line, 
and the linking of Chetnik territories via Olovo. Therefore the 
target of the heaviest aggressor's attacks will still be the 
operational zone of the 7th South Operative Group. 
  According to reliable assessments, these attacks will take 
the following course: The enemy will again try to cut the 
Doboj-Teslic route, and occupy the valley of the Usora River. 
There it will launch a massive offensive on the (links) of the 
110th Glorious HVO Usora Brigade and other units, with renewed 
calls for Croatian betrayal. [Words indistinct] of besieging 
Tesanj by capturing the dominant hills around it and gradually 
destroying it. The aggressor's next step will be to cut off the 
Maglaj-Tesanj route and thus close the circle around Maglaj, 
which is at the moment under heavy attack. All this would 
create the conditions for the complete occupation of the Tesanj 
and Maglaj territories. 
  However, to judge by the military results achieved so far by 
the army units from the 7th South Operative Group and their 
outstandingly high morale, it is certain that the enemy 
offensive will end in complete collapse, and -- according to 
Mustafa Cerovac, commander of the 7th South Operative Group -- 
the siege of this area could even be lifted with the cooperation 
of other army units.

<F P=106> [By Dragan Milosavljevic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 24 (TANJUG) -- Vatican's proposal to 
western political centres in late January that Bosnia should not 
be divided and that NATO steps up pressure on the Serbs, is 
turning into open pressure for the renewal of the Croat-Moslem 
coalition. 
  Vatican's re-involvement and its pressure on Zagreb to 
return 
to the anti-Serb coalition with the Islamic fundamentalists 
rallied around Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic, aim to 
oust Russia from the Balkans and give the United Nations a role 
inferior to NATO. 
  Following talks with Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal 
Toran, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic confirmed that the 
Holy See had assessed as positive Croatia's acceptance of its 
proposals, Radio Vatican reports. 
  The turnabout of the Croatian policy in Bosnia, which is 
also 
based on the ceasefire agreement with the Moslems, could have 
been unreservedly accepted only by those who are poorly informed 
about Vatican's underlaying strategy and who see this region as 
the threshold of Catholicism. 
  The unnatural alliance with the 'isle' of Islam in Europe, 
imposed by Vatican, is only the initial stage in pushing back 
the orthodox religion over the Drina river which separates the 
Bosnian Serbs from their brothers in the east. 
  In view of this, it is hardly surprising that the agreement 
between the Serbian and Croatian presidents, Slobodan Milosevic 
and Franjo Tudjman, on the gradual normalization of relations, 
was strongly criticized by Vatican. 
  The Catholic Church, and specially Cardinal Kuharic in 
Zagreb 
and Archbishop Vinko Puljac in Sarajevo, were given the task of 
preventing any kind of rapproachment in the interest of peace 
between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
  In view of the pressure by Germany, Italy and the Holy See 
to 
freeze Croatia's military presence in Bosnia, the Serbs are 
still described as the aggressors and threatened with possible 
new ultimatums, while the Russian initiative for a summit 
meeting of the five big powers on the Bosnian crisis, is viewed 
as unfavourable.

<F P=106> [Rebroadcast of Sarajevo TV interview and phone-in program </F>
with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, by unidentified announcer in Sarajevo on 22 February 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Let us begin with what interests our 
viewers and listeners the most -- yesterday [21 February], the 
expiry of the NATO ultimatum, and everything that happened. You 
declared last night that our spring was at hand, that the 
withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery was a victory for us, but 
that it was not complete and flawless. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes. Some had commented that my statement was 
overly optimistic, and, indeed, it was pronouncedly optimistic 
intentionally. All day long I was listening to people moaning 
about how all this was not good. I could not understand why. I 
am afraid we are becoming slightly inclined to fall for enemy 
propaganda. The Serbs tried to convince their own people that 
this absolute moral, military, and political defeat was in fact 
a victory for them, and they tried to convince us as well. I 
heard certain defeatist statements to that effect, so I wanted 
to counter it by making a slightly overly optimistic statement. 
  However, it is a fact, in my opinion, that it was a moral, 
military, and political defeat. Why? Moral because they 
withdrew. That is undeniable. One must pack up and go -- it a 
moral fiasco. Political because the dreams they had been 
dreaming for two years on those hills about conquering the city 
were finally jettisoned. They were certainly not up there for 
the fun of it. Although their initial and main objective was to 
diminish our numbers by striking at the civilian population, 
their paramount objective was to conquer the city. They were 
compelled to give that up and leave. Militarily? Because they 
left most of the weapons behind. 
  [Announcer] We saw all they had withdrawn -- all those 
tanks, 
cannons, howitzers, mortar launchers. In the long run, it must 
be said that this was their defeat. If they could keep us 
encircled with all those weapons without accomplishing anything 
except for killing civilians.... 
  [Izetbegovic, interrupting] I am not sure anyone noticed 
that 
it has become clear only now what we had to put up with for 
almost two years. The world has been taken aback by the sheer 
might of all that iron, the tanks that remained here, and those 
armored personnel carriers, those barrels that remained, and 
those that were withdrawn -- all that has been registered by 
television cameras belonging to foreign TV networks. Those 
columns of vehicles. All those things were overlooking the 
city. We managed to get rid of all that, we liberated ourselves 
from that, and we certainly have to consider that as our 
victory. And another thing. Our people say: He who punches 
strongly is not the tough one, but he who endures the punch. We 
have endured those punches. 
  [Announcer] UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units have been 
deployed along the separation lines, although it remains to be 
seen whether they will stay there. How do you view the future 
of Sarajevo in the light of the proposals for it to become a UN- 
administered city? 
  [Izetbegovic] The immediate future of Sarajevo is UN 
administration. Of course, it is a temporary solution which 
will last for less than two years. Not longer than two years, 
maybe up to two years. It is a period in which it will be 
possible to salvage what we have always wished to do to have an 
undivided city. 
  We think that first at the beginning.... [pauses] Naturally 
after.... [pauses] The first was by all means necessary, the 
first condition above all other conditions was to stop shooting, 
to stop the immediate killing in the city, although I must say 
straight away, perhaps it is partially a reply to the question 
put a while ago, we cannot think that there will be no killing 
here and there. Their infantry is still there. Of course, we 
are going to resist that infantry much more successfully than 
before. If you can remember the city was full of snipers in the 
first couple of months of the spring 1992; we have managed to 
mop up all those, we have silenced them all. We are probably 
going to silence them gradually, even more so because now that 
their artillery has been withdrawn. Without their artillery 
they are nothing. They are used to having a heavy gun next to 
them. When the gun is gone, they are going to be something 
completely different. But still, here and there they are going 
to snatch a victim or two. Therefore, people should be wary of 
that. That is past. 
  However, we are now trying.... [pauses] The next step would 
be gradually to restore communications. Let people meet, let 
them see each other, let them go; we shall see whether it is 
possible to achieve that thing, that our people go to Serb-held 
Grbavica, let people from Grbavica come here. People are 
something different from their soldiery that was deployed there. 
  [Announcer] And criminals who were there? 
  [Izetbegovic] They are not going to be able to come here. 
But ordinary people who suffered in Grbavica as much as we 
suffered here, who shared our suffering and hardships, maybe we 
shall understand when we have a look at each other that we are 
not monsters. I think that communication is the next step, 
after that a bit of trade will come. Before that, normalization 
in water and electricity supply. Somewhat better food supplies, 
better and more regular humanitarian aid. That would be a path 
to preserve the city as a whole. One day a question will 
probably be asked on what Sarajevans want from Sarajevo. And 
that is the real question. See, we have all been discussing the 
issue of Sarajevo. The question is how much we are authorized 
to resolve the Sarajevo issue. Sarajevo has to be resolved by 
the Sarajevans. And most probably one day we shall demand a 
referendum. 
  Sarajevo has to be resolved by the people of Sarajevo and, 
most likely, one day we shall ask them whether they want a 
divided or undivided Sarajevo and let it be the way the people 
want it. I have almost no doubt at all that the people will say 
they want to live together in the city. How would the people 
from Grbavica [words indistinct]. 
  Where will people ask for medical help? You can see that the 
city cannot be divided The city is an organic entity, and I 
have no doubt that, if asked how they want to live, the city 
will be opened. 
  [Announcer] [Question indistinct] 
  [Izetbegovic] [words indistinct] I must be honest and say 
that nobody ever said that any new UNPA [UN protection area] 
zones should be created here -- the UNPA zones in Croatia have 
proven to be a bad solution. Something like that has not been 
on offer here. 
  Here we accept only patrols and control points, not even the 
demarcaton lines, or control points, but lines. I think such a 
possibility does not exist. 
  [Announcer] Mentioning that, those people on Pale and 
Trebevic have celebrated this as a great victory. They have 
after all got what they have always wanted -- the Russians. 
  [Izetbegovic] Let me say, as we are talking about the 
Russians. I sent a letter today to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali asking him what happened to the Pakistani soldiers 
whose arrival was expected six months ago. Then it was delayed 
until September, then till November, etc. They have not arrived 
-- ostensibly the problem was how to equip 3,000 people, for 
they were soldiers without any equipment. It cannot be possible 
that the West cannot provide equipment for 3,000 people to come 
here. Obviously this is a case of some other kind of games. 
  I demanded his reply to this question. After I had talked 
this morning with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin -- who, as you 
know, has offered 10,000 people to come here, which is really 
too many -- I also demanded in the letter that 2,000 or 3,000 
Turkish soldiers be sent here. 
  As to the arrival of the Russians. They did not come because 
of the Serbs. Anyone who understands anything about politics 
knows very well that this is in fact.... [pauses] You know that 
their arrival was supported by the Americans. The question 
arises: why did they support it? They gave it their support, 
most importantly, to help Yeltsin at a very difficult time in 
Russia. Since Yeltsin began to make some more radical moves in 
Russia, he has managed to shut up whatsis name. 
  [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, Zhirinovskiy. He has shut him up a bit. 
I believe that in such a situation the Americans and the West 
wanted to strengthen Yeltsin's position. I think that was a 
good move. They succeeded in strengthening his position. The 
tide there had to be stopped, the nationalist tide in Russia, 
which does not suit us or the West either, the nationalist 
tide, and its derivative, Nazism. A strong wave of Nazism is 
being felt in Russia and is reaching Europe as well. I believe 
that in this way they have managed to suppress it a little, in 
the general interest of the free world. 
  I therefore think that the arrival of the Russians was not 
motivated by the desire to simply help the Serbs. It helped 
Yeltsin. 
  [Announcer] As we are speaking about the Russians, we have 
had an opportunity to see pictures shot by foreign TV companies. 
We have seen the kissing, hugging, and even the three-finger 
salutes [Serbian] through the little window of the Russian 
armored vehicles, where a gun should normally be positioned. We 
have seen them giving away cigarettes and even exchanging hats. 
Generals exchanging hats! 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, and I have been told that today, as they 
were passing by the Bosnian Presidency building they did 
approximately the same thing. I held talks last night with 
Sergio di Mello and General Rose, and we drew their attention to 
the Russian behavior. They apologized for that, for these 
Russians are, after all, UN soldiers. They said they would talk 
to the Russians and warn them strictly about their behavior. We 
said that the Russians would get correct treatment in exchange 
for correct behavior. 
  [Announcer] We shall see now what was happening. For this 
program we have selected a video for our viewers to see once 
again, although majority of them have already seen, but as 
electricity supply was restored we have received requests from 
Tuzla, Zenica, and other areas, Kakanj, Sarajevo, to repeat this 
video. Here is officer asking where your people are and so on 
and so on. Let us recall once again in brief what and how 
[words indistinct] those that arrived in Grbavica to keep peace, 
here you can see the infamous three-finger salute from an 
armored personnel carrier. Can we trust them in their 
supervision of that heavy weaponry? 
  [Izetbegovic] We can trust them as much as we can trust 
UNPROFOR. We can trust them [word indistinct] with some 
reserve. They are UNPROFOR soldiers, and I hold that.... 
[pauses] There are between 12,000 and 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The number of 400 Russians represents a 
couple of percent. 
  [Announcer] Have there been discussions about a higher 
number? 
  [Izetbegovic] There have been discussions, but I think that 
it will not happen, but we shall demand some other troops to be 
deployed here parallel to them. As I said earlier we have 
called.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Here you can see these pictures. 
  [Izetbegovic] We have called others, if the Russians can 
come, the Turks can also come. 
  [Announcer] And other [word indistinct], of course. Today we 
received an interesting report. On the border between Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs have blocked an UNPROFOR unit. 
Several tanks are also mentioned in the report, and the news 
speaks about calls for NATO air force to act but only by 
carrying out overflights. Will the Sarajevo issue trigger off 
NATO actions in this area. And here we have another question 
from Sarajevo: will there be air strikes against Serb positions 
or is that story nearly finished? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that at least we can say one thing for 
sure: air strikes have not been ruled out. Their likelihood has 
considerably decreased since the evening when Chetniks accepted 
to hand in their weapons, to withdraw or to abandon them. They 
simply abandoned some of their weapons, being unable to withdraw 
them and being unwilling to die sitting next to those weapons. 
They simply abandoned them and informed UNPROFOR that they had 
left them in the snow up there. 
  People who were overflying Sarajevo could see many pieces of 
abandoned weaponry, abandoned heavy guns. Since then the 
likelihood has decreased because it was important for UNPROFOR 
whether Chetniks would shoot. As they were claiming they would 
not shoot, UNPROFOR informed their relevant commands up there, 
and they postponed it. 
  It would be best to say that this is something that has been 
postponed. In case they shoot on the city, no matter where 
from, either from within the 20-km radius, or outside this 
radius, or if they attack UN troops anywhere else, air strikes 
will probably be applied. I think that in this respect, this is 
my impression, there will be no hesitating. 
  Of course, they are trying to avoid that. Let us make it 
clear, they were very happy not to carry out attacks. They were 
not enthusiastic about carrying out attacks. As you know there 
was a trick with a report that was launched at the last hour 
saying that the infamous shell was fired from our positions. 
That was an attempt to somehow avoid a decision to carry out 
air strikes. What is strange is that a good part of the 
international press and some responsible people accepted it as 
something that had to be seriously examined. They would be very 
happy if something like that could be proven to avoid air 
strikes. Then they would not have to intervene, and so on and 
so on. Simply they are not enthusiastic about doing that, but I 
think that in case of flagrant violation of the agreements and 
conditions of the declaration, in case the city comes under 
shelling, if UN troops are attacked, I do not doubt that air 
strikes against attackers would take place. 
  [Announcer] Do you believe NATO forces will react somewhere 
else if UNPROFOR does not? 
  [Izetbegovic] That could happen in two instances: in case 
Sarajevo was bombarded and attacked and in case UNPROFOR units 
were attacked. In these two cases they would.... [pauses] It 
would all depend on the intensity of the attack, whether the 
troops were in danger. In case they were attacked and suffered 
casualties, there is no doubt they would retaliate. 
  [Announcer] Let us return to the shell. A viewer is asking: 
They formed a commission to find out who fired the shell at 
Markale on 5 February. What can you say about that, let us link 
your reply to what was said on French television's Channel Five. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes. I recently replied to that question. You 
see, it was a little cynical. People ask themselves where a 
shell came from. What about the other 300,000 shells? Who 
slaughtered 1,300 children, who maimed 10,000 children, who 
wiped out so many thousands of Sarajevans, who destroyed 
everything in Sarajevo, the city hall.... [pauses] Who fired 
hundreds of shells at the military hospital? This person is 
asking about this one shell?! Finally, it would be very 
difficult today to technically establish who fired the shell, no 
one can say for sure. That is all that can be said at the 
moment. 
  Therefore, they wished to say this: well, as it is known 
that it would be technically impossible to establish who fired 
the shell -- it cannot be established -- then the air strikes 
cannot be carried out. Approximately that line of reasoning. 
Thank God, it did not go down well this time; people could not 
be fooled this time. What I told you a minute ago is very 
interesting. How false information fabricated by a reporter and 
launched at a critical moment, a dramatic moment when decisions 
were being made, how that information was accepted by a certain 
group of people with relief because they said to themselves: 
fine, now we do not have to intervene because that would be 
inconvenient. 
  But I want to say that it is an insult to the dead, the 
people buried here, the commission is an insult to those dead 
people lying in our graveyards, as well as to the living. 
  [Announcer] All the more so as it as it was proven who had 
fired the shell at Dobrinja the day before [4 February], who 
fired the shell at that part of Alipasino Polje, and so on and 
on. It can always be proved who killed up to 10 people, but 
when it comes to more than that it suddenly becomes impossible. 
  [Izetbegovic] A shell landed on Dobrinja the day before; 
those children were killed. It was established with certainty 
that the shell had come from Serb positions, they did not even 
bother to deny it. It was concluded that the shell in Markale 
was of the same kind, of the same make. In any case, let us not 
waste time on that, things are perfectly clear. It was fired by 
those who had fired the other 300,000 shells. 
  [Announcer] What can be done to deblock other towns -- 
Bihac, 
Mostar, Maglaj, and now, particularly at this time, Tesanj -- 
and to have heavy weapons withdrawn from there as well? 
  [Izetbegovic] We shall have to see what further arrangements 
we shall accept. We accepted the arrangement with Sarajevo 
without hesitation because it was in any case envisaged that 
Sarajevo should be UN administrated, which is good. 
  [Announcer] If I am not mistaken, only Mostar is also 
envisaged to be EU administered. 
  [Izetbegovic] We shall probably demand that this is also 
applied in the case of Mostar. As to other towns we shall have 
to think seriously whether to accept this. I am afraid that 
this could bring about the freezing of the situation on the 
ground. We would be willing to have these lines positioned 
elsewhere, not on the actual front lines. We are analyzing the 
question. It is very complex. Admittedly, such a solution 
prevents the Chetniks or the other ones making further advances 
into our lines, but it also prevents our struggle for freedom. 
It prevents us from liberating those lines. So, we shall have 
to think seriously what to do about it. I can only tell you 
that the question is just being analyzed -- it is very complex. 
  [Announcer] The same principle could be applied in 
protected areas -- Bihac, Gorazde, Srebrenica. The same 
principle as in Sarajevo could be applied there and, after all, 
that has to be done. 
  [Izetbegovic] Not exactly the same principle. That is where 
the difference lies: in Sarajevo we agreed to surrender our 
weapons as well. According to Resolutions 824 and 836, it is 
not our obligation to surrender our weapons in the safe areas. 
We knew that here the Chetniks would have been delighted if we 
had disputed this, they would have then procrastinated the 
decision forever. After the contacts with our friends, we 
decided to accept the well-known point seven of the NATO 
decision, for it suited us in this case. But in other towns we 
shall demand consistent implementation of Resolutions 824 and 
836, which specify that the Serb weapons, and not ours, must be 
withdrawn from the safe areas. This will be our demand. 
  [Announcer] The situation in Bihac is almost the most 
critical, as critical as in Maglaj and in central Bosnia. 
  [Izetbegovic] We are defending ourselves there with a lot of 
success, and there would probably be no problems there if it was 
not for the unfortunate [Fikret] Abdic on our back. I believe 
that our people would not accept a Sarajevo-type solution in 
Bihac. We would accept Resolution 836, and that is what we 
shall insist upon. 
  General Rose and Akashi wanted to bring it up two or three 
days ago, on Friday or Saturday. I asked them to postpone it 
until this week, to avoid complicating the situation in 
Sarajevo. We want to resolve the question of Sarajevo, and 
anyway General Delic is travelling to the UNPROFOR base in 
Zagreb for the talks with Akashi, General Rose, and General Cot. 
  [Announcer] To sum it up now. If the West decides, as it has 
decided this time, to issue a threat, it means that something 
can be done. 
  [Izetbegovic] We have earlier said that the recipe is to 
combine negotiations and pressure; that is force. This is the 
only formula leading towards the achieving of some objective. 
We have been constantly told, throughout the 18 months of the 
war, to negotiate and negotiate. We said that it could not 
produce any results. It can, if combined with a pressure on the 
aggressor. It has been proven here that this is the only 
successful and efficient formula. 
  [Announcer] One interesting question: the Serbs got the 
corridor in Posavina. Why cannot we get such a corridor linking 
us with Bihac? 
  [Izetbegovic] People often ask that question. I think that 
the wrong verb is used here. They did not get it, they took it. 
They are holding the corridor militarily. We cannot take it 
back from them. If we can, we shall take it. In this war one 
does not get anything, nobody gives anything to anyone as a 
present. Everything has to be taken. They have taken it. 
Please, let our people bear this in mind when they say: why 
are you giving them something. We are not giving them anything. 
They have simply, as you know, taken it by force, a vast force 
in comparison with our forces, and they will not give it back. 
They will not give it back although our rights to it are 
evident. But they have seized it, we have not given it to them. 
  [Announcer] Let us end this part of our program with a 
report 
from the White House. Today again a warning has arrived from 
there that the ultimatum is still in force, and that all heavy 
weapons within the 20-km zone that are not under UN control will 
be targeted by air attacks. 
  [Izetbegovic] In that respect the U.S. position is very 
clear. The French and German positions are clear up to a point, 
the English one to a lesser extent, the Russian almost not at 
all. But the important thing is that in this respect the 
American position is very clear. I think that they are leading 
the game here. 
  [Announcer] We have received many questions for you. Let us 
start with politics. We have received some new initiatives. 
Russia launched an initiative that was rejected. Now we have a 
French initiative again. What is really taking place in 
connection with the global resolution of problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] Something is taking place behind the scenes. 
Nothing is happening on the main stage. Talks involving experts 
were held in Bonn today [22 February]. I do not know the 
outcome of the meeting. I think it ended late this evening, an 
hour or two ago. I do not know if the results will be made 
public. Experts from several states involved in the problem 
took part, including America and Russia and some European 
states. They were supposed to make some kind of project, 
perhaps some kind of plan for that hypothetical summit that was 
discussed and that would have Bosnia on its agenda. 
  As far as our activities are concerned, as you are aware, we 
held negotiations with the Croatian side two days ago in 
Frankfurt, between Silajdzic and Granic. Silajdzic has been in 
the United States since yesterday. He held talks with 
Christopher yesterday and I think he will meet him again. Today 
he held talks with other American officials. Therefore, 
something is cooking, but most of it is taking place behind the 
scenes. We shall see the outcome. We know our positions and we 
will defend them adequately. We have several options in mind, 
depending on the direction in which the things move. However, 
our people's interest will be protected in all options. 
  [Announcer] Nothing has been solved in Geneva. Are we 
finally going to ask the UN Security Council to take everything 
in its hands? 
  [Izetbegovic] It is most likely that another round of talks 
will take place and, should it fail, there is nothing left to do 
but to return to the United Nations again. If that happens we 
would remind them of their resolutions, of the London 
Conference, and so on. However, I think that another round of 
talks will take place, yet another attempt to find a solution 
based on previous projects. 
  [Announcer] The issue of Croatia and the presence of its 
regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the agenda of the UN 
Security Council. What do you expect will happen with that 
problem? 
  [Izetbegovic] Well, I did not watch the evening newscast 
because I was on the way to your studio. I do not know if the 
Security Council discussed the issue today. I have instructed 
our delegation to delay a decision on the matter for a day or 
two because we are holding intense negotiations with the Croats 
over certain issues. Delic is going to Zagreb tomorrow where he 
is supposed to meet General Roso. Delic will demand the 
withdrawal of Croatian troops again, although Roso has denied 
the presence of these troops in a recent statement. What counts 
is UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] verdict according to which 
at least 5,000 well- equipped troops are present. They will 
have to withdraw them or they will face sanctions. We have no 
doubt about this and neither does the international community. 
It is only a matter of days for some kind of peaceful solution 
to the problems. 
  [Announcer] You mentioned the talks between Messrs. 
Silajdzic 
and Granic, but after the talks it was said that another meeting 
would be held at the highest level. Does that mean that you and 
President Tudjman will meet? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, if any results are achieved. I must be 
frank: It does not seem at the moment that there will be any 
results. I am not an optimist regarding a solution to the 
problems between us and Croatia, which are not our fault. We 
are trying to solve those problems. After all, I do not think 
we should fight if we can solve this by agreement for people to 
stop suffering. 
  Our people in Vitez -- in the old part of Vitez -- in Novi 
Travnik, and Mostar are in a very difficult situation. The 
situation in the old part of Vitez is particularly difficult. 
There are about 1,000 of our citizens there who have been cut 
off for a long time. Of course, there are more hotspots, such 
as Gornji Vakuf. 
  [Announcer] It seems that the situation is calming down 
there. There was not much fighting there today. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, it has quieted down somewhat. UNPROFOR 
has been trying: They bring up the Sarajevo solution; whether it 
would be possible to apply a similar solution there. 
  That is why Gen. Delic will go to Zagreb tomorrow. We have 
tried to organize the meeting here, but Akashi could not come to 
Sarajevo because he has a lot of work to do in Zagreb tomorrow. 
I was very enthusiastic about Akashi's presence. He offered 
for the meeting to take place at Sarajevo airport without him or 
at Zagreb airport where he would be present. So we agreed for 
Delic to go there because we are interested in finding a 
solution. I am not a great optimist concerning all this, 
judging by certain indications that I have had. However, 
miracles are possible. 
  [Announcer] There has been talk about new proposals of a 
confederation. It has been said that the West and the United 
States want it. 
  [Izetbegovic] The U.S. wish, which has been conveyed to us, 
is that we solve our problem with Croats. They believe that 
this is in the interest of both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
When they said Croats, they referred to our internal 
misunderstanding with Bosnian Croats and to the two states. 
They advised us and suggested we try to find a solution because 
that would greatly simplify the problem of implementing the 
agreement. On the other hand, they said very clearly that they 
would lend their support to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia 
concerning their joining future European integrations, and they 
would give us assistance for a speedy reconstruction of both 
countries and so on. Therefore, they have given us very 
appealing offers to encourage us to proceed in that direction. 
  [Announcer] We have to remember that Boban has been 
replaced. 
A new president of the so-called Herzeg-Bosna has been elected, 
but Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic has said that Mostar will be 
the capital of that parastate. In that area there is nothing 
new. 
  [Izetbegovic] We have always said that the replacement of 
Boban was important, for moral reasons as well. We believe that 
he is to blame for the suffering down there. He organized the 
war crimes in Herzegovina, and partly here in Bosnia. But we 
have always said that it was not important to replace Boban, but 
to change the policy. I am afraid that there has been no change 
in policy. 
  [Announcer] Convoys have reached Zenica -- if I am not 
mistaken -- and Nova Bila. I think that the one for Maglaj has 
failed to go through again. 
  [Izetbegovic] The one for Maglaj has unfortunately not 
passed 
through because of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
objections. However, these indications of a change in the 
policy are very unconvincing. Much more should be done to be 
able to say that a change in the policy is on the agenda. I 
cannot see that for the time being. 
  I know that Germany and America -- primarily those two 
countries, but also other European countries including Belgium 
and Holland -- insist on us solving our problems with Croatia. 
They insist the Croats do too, they exert pressure on them too. 
They have also suggested to us that a solution is in our 
interest. We will see whether all this yields result in the 
next few days. Unfortunately, for the time being I cannot see 
any progress. 
  [Announcer] We have received many questions from our 
viewers. 
We have already answered most of them. I will try not to repeat 
questions. Still, there are a lot of questions that have not 
been answered. Let us start from here: Has Bosnia-Herzegovina 
been divided despite all these negotiations? 
  [Izetbegovic] Regarding the reconstruction of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina: Some kind of draft, a project on this has 
been made -- that is true. Specifically, this is the 
reconstruction of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which some people call 
division and which at the same time could and could not be a 
division depending on the direction things develop in the 
future. Optimists could interpret the union as a form, a way of 
keeping Bosnia together at this most critical moment when it is 
in the greatest danger, when there are three armies operating 
within it, and when the situation cannot possibly deteriorate 
further but only improve in the future. Therefore, the union 
would be a guarantee for a future reintegration of Bosnia, 
because the framework would be preserved. Pessimists believe 
that this is a phase in the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  History is not prefabricated. What Bosnia will become 
depends to a large extent on us. It depends on our efforts, on 
our struggle. We will try to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, to 
realize the beliefs of the optimists. I explained on one 
occasion how we imagine this if it turns out that no solution is 
possible other than the union and the three republics, which is 
currently on the agenda because nothing else has been offered. 
In fact, we did offer the internal set-up envisaging cantons, 
but I think that neither the Serb nor Croat sides accepted it. 
If we are talking about solving the problem by agreement, that 
will not work. Bosnia- Herzegovina could perhaps be reunited by 
military means on some new basis. The solution that seems to be 
rather realistic today, the direction in which things are going, 
is the union and the republics, among which our Bosnian republic 
would be the example of a democratic country that would exert 
influence on the integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the 
strength of its political model. Therefore, what 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will turn out to be if it becomes a union 
depends to a large extent on us. 
  [Announcer] We have answered many of these questions: Is 
this 
a division of the city? Is this the freezing of the situation 
in Sarajevo? But there is one interesting question. A viewer 
called and asked whether you know about new concentration camps 
-- for example near Han Pijesak, in Mrkalj, and in Pjenovac -- 
whether the International Red Cross knows about them and what is 
being done concerning that? 
  [Izetbegovic] We have heard about these things and informed 
Mazowiecki -- you know that he is the UN secretary general's 
envoy for human rights on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. His latest report was made public yesterday [21 
February]. We have also informed the Red Cross. However, it is 
difficult to reach those areas. If commissions come to inspect, 
the Serbs relocate the camps and hide the inmates. 
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve that problem with 
them. 
  However, we have people who deal exclusively with that issue 
and who follow the problem of human rights, the concentration 
camps, and crimes. They are in constant contact with the Red 
Cross and relevant bodies. We have managed to do a lot in that 
area. Many camps have been discovered and many people released 
owing to those efforts. Many people have been exchanged and 
saved. We have recently held talks on the release of some of 
our civilians from Kiseljak. We are talking about 500-600 
civilians. I think that we will manage to free them in the next 
two or three days. 
  [Announcer] How do you comment on this escalation of evil, 
violence and everything else that has befallen us in almost 23 
months in this region? 
  [Izetbegovic] It is a phenomenon that will probably attract 
the attention of the world's scientists. It has truly had no 
precedent -- and this is not an empty phrase. It is difficult 
to find something to compare it with in the history of the past 
few hundred years. We are talking about the killing and 
expulsion of people, about the destruction of cultural 
monuments, and so on. 
  The question arises of how such evil could happen here. Some 
people will say: The root of the evil was in Nacertanije 
[writings on Serbian national issues] by a Serbian nationalist 
late last century and early this century. But Nacertanije 
existed before too. It is a very interesting question -- how 
this evil has been brought about. I have a feeling that no 
moral force rose in opposition to the evil. 
  I think that the 40 years of Communist rule here will 
probably have to be included in the explanation of this 
phenomenon. That ideology propagated that everything is 
allowed. If you read the Communist Manifesto, you will see that 
they say that morality is an illusion and so on. Morality is 
only that which is useful for a future aim, or -- as they used 
to say in the better part of their rule -- what is useful for 
the working class and then what is useful for the ruling class. 
Everything is allowed. In my opinion, that destroyed all moral 
buttresses. Nationalists came to power in a moral wasteland, 
and they implemented their policies without any obstacles. No 
moral values opposed them. There are nationalists such as we 
see today in Russia, such as Zhirinovskiy. There is xenophobia 
in, for example, Germany. There are always people who will 
preach evil, but they fail to implement it on a large scale. 
[passage indistinct] 
  I have a feeling that nothing opposed the evil here. Very 
little in people rose in resistance. Something was destroyed in 
people -- their criteria, their moral values. People grew up 
and were educated with the idea that everything was allowed in 
the name of authority. All that was needed was for bad 
authorities to come to power to do whatever they wanted. And 
that is precisely what happened. I think that while explaining 
why it was in this region that such evil happened, my 
explanation is that the communist ideology also bears the blame 
for it. 
  [Announcer] Let us continue with questions from our viewers. 
  In Zenica, they have an electricity as well as a phone link 
with Sarajevo. Is the president familiar with the serious 
situation in Zenica and, above all, with the fact that the 
citizens are dissatisfied with the work of the Zenica 
government? The following question arises: Why does the Zenica 
government not want to accept the UNHCR's offer whereby it would 
take over the bakery and provide bread? The UNHCR claims it can 
solve this problem. 
  [Izetbegovic] I was not aware of that. I know that there is 
some criticism. I am aware of some complaints, although-- given 
the distance--Zenica is almost a two days' walk from here. You 
know, I find it easier to know what is going on in the United 
States. It is a matter of five minutes. Whereas, for example, 
I have no phone link to Konjic. All kinds of things may take 
place in Konjic, but it can take me five days to learn of them, 
until the couriers who operate there arrive. 
  Communications have been disrupted. I have to admit there 
are complaints as far as Zenica is concerned. The police, the 
authorities, are being criticized, etc. People always complain. 
You cannot simply take every complaint and criticism at its face 
value. You have to examine every element. Still, this detail 
about the UNHCR and, as you mentioned, the bakery.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Or what about another example. Why 
is it impossible to organize in Zenica the distribution and 
production of bread in the same way as in Sarajevo? In Zenica, 
the price of flour is 20 German marks. Adem Dervisevic from 
Zenica. 
  [Izetbegovic] These are good questions. I hope the people of 
Zenica as well as Zenica's authorities are listening to this. 
Let them try to explain this issue to those people there. 
  [Announcer] Here you go. Can the state do something to help 
workers, particularly those who are now living in Zenica but who 
worked and lived in the temporarily occupied areas? 
  [Izetbegovic] That is a totally justified question. It 
should be addressed to the government. As you know, the 
government has recently, government representatives have been 
doing some field work, examining this situation, and talking to 
people. They have been trying to find some solution. There are 
a large number of reports indicating that the situation in 
Zenica is extremely grave with regard to the humanitarian 
situation and food. It seems that the highest prices are being 
charged there at the moment. There is no flour. I can take 
notice of this.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] That was probably the reason 
behind 
such a question. [words indistinct] 
  [Izetbegovic] It is also a message to the local official 
there, so they can perhaps take a hard look at what they are 
doing if their citizens are making these complaints. I will 
take notice. All I can say is that tomorrow I will phone them 
in Zenica, and I will draw the government's attention to the 
complaints we have heard tonight. 
  [Announcer] One of our viewers asks: When will we dispense 
with municipal officials? 
  [Izetbegovic] I do not know. In what sense? Municipal 
officials are needed and will be needed in every situation.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Is it your impression--you have 
toured extensively throughout our territory--that these 
municipal officials have now seized too much power? 
  [Izetbegovic] I believe that the viewer is right inasmuch 
that we also have realized that municipalities are attempting, 
due to this existing isolation, due to the fact that we had 
absolutely no communications until a few months ago [sentence as 
heard]. Municipalities had gone independent. They turned into 
statelets of sorts. We have realized this, and now we are 
trying, if possible, to trim that kind of autonomy a bit, to 
consolidate the state as this would be in everyone's interest. 
Municipalities have begun to conduct themselves in a 
self-interested way. It will not give the electricity if it has 
the electricity, or it will not give flour if it has flour, etc. 
I believe that the new government is trying to tackle this 
issue and that they are doing something. 
  You know how difficult it is to reclaim power from those who 
have seized it? It is easier to press the cork into the bottle 
than to take it out. 
  [Izetbegovic] A lady from Zenica asks: Are municipal 
authorities authorized to impound privately owned goods? Well, 
here we have Zenica again. It is indicative.... 
  [Izetbegovic, interrupting] It is indicative. This is all 
coming from Zenica. Yes, there are some situations, although 
they have to be explicitly listed under the law. There are some 
cases, but I am not sure whether the number of these cases is 
high. Only in exceptional cases, of course, can the state 
interfere with private property. Only in exceptional situations. 
  [Announcer] What are the plans for central Bosnia, for 
Maglaj? We also have many questions about other areas. Will 
anything be done about the lifting of the blockade of Tesanj, 
Teslic, Maglaj, and the free territory of Doboj? When and how 
will this happen? How can the people there be helped? 
  [Izetbegovic] Of course, these are military issues, and 
soldiers would hold it against me if I revealed their plans. 
However, the soldiers have faced that issue of lifting the 
blockade of Maglaj for days. As far as aid to Maglaj is 
concerned, we have tried to push convoys through. We have done 
everything we could-- sometimes even what we should not have 
done--in order to send them the convoys. The other day we 
managed to get a convoy through to the very entrance to Maglaj 
but, as you know, some civilians allegedly stopped the convoy at 
the very last checkpoint. The convoy returned to Zenica, and 
then to Belgrade. 
  [Announcer] The UNHCR says that people there are dying of 
starvation. The other day almost 10 people (?died). 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, they know that. That is when we 
intervened. They increased the amount of air-dropped aid because 
this is more or less what Maglaj survives on. The air 
drops--aid dropped by parachutes--were increased. We ensured 
that aid is dropped and that it is dropped in the right place 
because it used to fall all over the place. There have been 
fewer mistakes recently. We are trying to send convoys, but 
sometimes we are completely powerless. 
  With regard to lifting the blockade, that is an issue that 
is 
on the agenda. 
  [Announcer] We have a question here by a soldier who has 
fought since the first day of the war. Could the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have done more and liberated more 
territories? I think that this question is very 
interesting--all the more so since we had to liberate all 
territories. When we remember what happened in the beginning of 
the war--the total occupation and all the corps of the former 
Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] that took control of almost all of 
our republic--it is obvious that we, after all, liberated 
everything we have now ourselves. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, that soldier used the right word when he 
said that we could have liberated more territory than we have. 
Practically, we have liberated all the territory we have today. 
  The people of Sarajevo know that best. There were six or 
seven barracks here from which the JNA had to be expelled. JNA 
soldiers were wandering around the city until 2 May. The 
situation was the same throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Could we 
have done more? Perhaps it is not the time now to assess that. 
You know, one always asks oneself whether one could have done 
more, what would have happened had one done something different. 
  A few days ago I listened to one of their high-ranking 
generals, who said that they could have captured Sarajevo. He 
made this claim and went as far as giving details of how the 
Serbs showed themselves as cowards and saying that they should 
have done specific things on a day when he had asked them to in 
order to cut Sarajevo in two. I remember those days, and [words 
indistinct]. That is when there was fighting around the Marshal 
Tito barracks. We negotiated for them to hand over the 
barracks. Their other generals did not allow that. What we 
agreed on during the day was undone at night. A general goes to 
Lukavica, comes back, and says that the agreement was changed. 
They tried to cut the city in two in that area. 
  They can regret this and say that they failed to do 
something. We can say that we could have had Ilidza with a 
little bit more perseverance. Ilidza would have been ours if we 
had reacted at the right moment. You know that we were in 
Ilidza. I mention only Ilidza, but the viewer who asked the 
question did not refer only to Sarajevo but also to other areas. 
I just wanted to illustrate that we could have done more in 
certain areas. We know that in Sarajevo we may have been able 
to keep Ilidza if we had sent only about 100 to 200 people at 
the right moment; however, there is no second chance there. We 
lost Ilidza. We did not react in time, and people had to 
withdraw. We could have had Ilidza, and the situation would 
perhaps be completely different. 
  [Announcer] [passage indistinct] 
  [Izetbegovic] A list of mistakes, of unlikely successes, and 
strange failures will probably be drawn up later. I think that 
there will be many more successes that will surprise people than 
failures. However, it is certain that there have been failures 
that could have been prevented--such as the fall of Doboj and 
Trnovo. Commissions have been set up to analyze this, as well as 
the incident on Igman. Did it have to happen? All 
circumstances indicate that it did not have to happen and that 
it was due to personal shortcomings. 
  [Announcer] One of our viewers asks about the military 
situation and the further organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army. 
  [Izetbegovic] All I can say is that the Army is being 
constantly worked on in the sense that it is being strengthened, 
and that discipline is being stepped up. This is very 
important; there are no everlasting commanders. You will see. 
There will soon be a series of personnel changes in the Army. 
They are being prepared at the moment. I think that the 
decisions will be reached in two or three days. We are 
constantly trying to improve the situation in the Army by 
introducing changes, by promoting and appointing people who have 
proved themselves, by removing and replacing people who were not 
good, and by appointing to front lines and commanding positions 
those people who have proved to be good. Naturally, personnel 
issues are very delicate and difficult, and all sorts of 
mistakes can be made, but we are trying to improve the situation 
by constantly changing people. We also step up discipline. 
  The political department is active. They have recently 
issued a series of very useful booklets. Every army must have a 
political platform. It must know what it wants and how it plans 
to fight. Therefore, big steps have been made in that respect. 
  Foreigners have acknowledged that this is a real army. Of 
course, there is a lot more to do. I have mentioned the 
specific things that we are doing at the moment. We are working 
on the strengthening of Army personnel by making certain changes. 
  [Announcer] Various newspapers--I read some new papers that 
have appeared in Sarajevo--recently criticized the Army 
leadership, especially the people who have come from the former 
Yugoslav People's Army. I think that there were a lot of unjust 
accusations. 
  [Izetbegovic] It would be inappropriate for me to assess 
this 
publicly. You would like to know what our strategy is? Our 
strategy is to create in peacetime a small and very effective 
army. Not a numerically large army, but a very effective, 
well-equipped, and well-trained army. Perhaps even a 
professional army, which will not have more than 20,000 to 
30,000 personnel. Our army currently has something over 200,000 
people because we are at war. 
  [Announcer] An army that can, with the MUP [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], defend everything we create? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, it can defend everything. At the moment, 
we are trying to have as many mobile units as possible in the 
Army. Most units were not mobile. The Army is very large, and 
it can defend areas to which it is attached. Now we want to 
create mobile units; in fact, we are already creating them. 
There already is a certain number of mobile units, which is 
increasing every day. In any event, the perspective of our 
country is to create a small, effective, well-armed, 
well-equipped, and well-trained army. 
  [Announcer] What about members of the Patriotic League 
before 
the war? How can they survive in such conditions, with the 
humanitarian aid they receive? 
  [Izetbegovic] With difficulty. 
  [Announcer] Soldiers and the wounded from the Patriotic 
League organized a meeting in Zenica, also attended by the 
families of the dead soldiers. Who takes care of them? 
  [Izetbegovic] That is one of the elements of our state of 
affairs seen realistically. Some people here euphorically set 
some impossible goals without taking into account the actual 
state of affairs. Unfortunately, we who receive reports every 
day know the real state of affairs. It could be 
described--especially morale--as unusually high. The people's 
morale is surprisingly high--their readiness to fight and 
sacrifice themselves. On the other hand, of course, we have 
problems with food and the so-called (?MTS). We do not hide 
that. 
  Speaking about arms, we capture most of them, we produce 
some 
of them, and we import some. We are trying various paths to get 
something in, but that has been reduced recently because we are 
under a complete blockade. So--talking about the Army--we 
provide most weapons by capturing them from the enemy. These 
are not negligible amounts, but rather large 
quantities--sometimes very large--because they have a lot of 
weapons, and our actions occasionally yield results. We capture 
a certain amount of ammunition and arms, and we also make some. 
  [Announcer] Well, we have been talking for over an hour, 
let us take a look at humanitarian aid. The situation is 
extremely grave. You have singled out Zenica, central Bosnia. 
I would also add Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia to this list. 
What is going with regard to humanitarian aid? 
  [Izetbegovic] I do not have to conceal that this was a 
case.... [pauses] At some stages, humanitarian aid has been 
used as a method of pressing us. There was a drop in 
deliveries, you know. A person who regulates them, who holds 
the tap, turned them down a little so that we could feel what 
hunger and cold was and, hence, be more pliable regarding some 
concessions, political concessions. You could feel it on the 
ground. There has been no abundance of anything since the 
outbreak of war. In many places, however, the shortages had 
already reached a critical point. 
  It came as a result of this trickling tap policy of 
humanitarian aid, covered by some excuses to the effect that 
nothing could be done--that due to one attack in one location 
there could be no deliveries for a month, or an airport would be 
closed, Sarajevo airport, for example. Central Bosnia was in a 
very serious situation in some periods. I believe that, in that 
respect, conditions will get somewhat better and that perhaps we 
have already experienced the worst phase. It is no longer such 
a grave threat. We have been tested. We are leaving this 
winter, an icy winter, behind us. 
  We have refused to make unprincipled political concessions. 
I believe that they have not yielded any result, and I believe 
that this method will no longer be used. That is provided, of 
course, that our impression is correct that it was a result of 
what we perceive as deliberate moves. They claim that this was 
not the case, that it was a result of some other 
circumstances--snow, lack of safety, etc. 
  Let us wait and see. All in all, I believe that this method 
will no longer be used, so there will be a more positive 
situation in the near future in that regard. That is all the 
more so because the snow will melt away. You have mentioned the 
convoys that have arrived. There is also a huge delivery that 
is yet to arrive; it is expected to arrive from the direction of 
Split and Zagreb. It is being organized by a combination of 
Muslim and Catholic humanitarian organizations.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] [word indistinct] Mr. Separovic 
while he was in Sarajevo? 
  [Izetbegovic] There are huge amounts of food. It is 
available there. It only has to be transported. We have a 
transport problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  That is why we are making these efforts to calm down the 
situation on the ground. It is something people should know. 
Food must come. That is our imperative. At the moment, this is 
the law above all laws; food must reach Bosnia. 
  [Announcer] Could we have done more? We know our situation 
with regard to necessities--gas, electricity, etc. We know how 
everything goes. Yet we have no oil, no logs. For example, we 
are distributing humanitarian aid beans, although most elderly 
people and those who are all alone have no means of cooking 
these beans. 
  [Izetbegovic] I would not say that we could have done more. 
We even reached a point when we were ready to buy heating fuel 
from the chetniks. We even authorized someone to carry this 
out, to [words indistinct]. They spotted it and changed their 
mind. They did not want to give wood to us. That is how far we 
went because we feared that people would be dying in the cold. 
  Luckily enough, this has been a rather mild winter, except 
for the past few days. When it was at its harshest in December 
and January, however, we went as far as this. We believed that 
one day we would be able to explain to the people why we bought 
wood from the chetniks. Well, put simply, it was so you do not 
die from exposure here. They, however, cancelled it at the last 
moment. Hence, we had come close to and perhaps gone beyond the 
limit of-- shall I say--the permissible in order to come up with 
a solution. 
  What we could have done, though, .... [pauses] We have now 
created a program. Last year--perhaps the general public does 
not know this--we imported a huge quantity of seed on time. 
This year we have drawn up again a program according to which 
every square meter will be sown. A draft law has now been set 
in motion that.... [pauses] There is a great deal of abandoned 
land, particularly in central Bosnia and in the Bosnia valley. 
People have fled. We are not going to tolerate this land not 
being cultivated. We are going to introduce a law so as to 
enable municipalities to give this land on temporary loan, for 
one year only. It would be extended every year for as long as 
the war goes on. Municipalities will give a plot of land and 
seeds to refugees. This will be far from any kind of advanced 
agriculture. There is no fuel for the tractors. People will 
have to sow in an old-fashioned way. 
  The government is doing its best to make sure that not a 
single patch remains unsown--whatever land is under the 
government's control--so we can end up with a maximum harvest of 
vegetables. 
  Last year we did a great deal, and partly thanks to this we 
had enough potatoes, a considerable amount of fruit was picked. 
As you know, there were enough vegetables.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] On balconies. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, on balconies etc. We distributed it 
systematically. However, humanitarian aid was not in our hands. 
What was up to us was not to create disruptions in the delivery 
of humanitarian aid. This is why people think we were 
subservient in a sense -- we did not want to bring about a 
situation in which there would be no humanitarian aid. 
  [Announcer] Talking here, let us tell people whether there 
will be any improvements in gas, electricity, opening special 
corridors -- you said very little about this. Are the United 
Nations, UNPROFOR going to take control of the gas valves, 
waterworks, and suchlike? 
  [Izetbegovic] We have a crisis headquarters, headed by 
Ganic. 
There are some other people, civilian and military people, 
civilian experts in this body. They are tasked with examining, 
in cooperation with UNPROFOR, how to open up Sarajevo in such a 
way that there will be benefits rather than damage from this 
opening up. 
  Many people perhaps have not much idea about the kind of 
damage that may ensue. There are some very problematic things 
that might arise from the opening of the city. We will be 
striving to open up the city in a way that will benefit the city 
without problems arising from this. Electricity, I believe, 
will soon return. It, electric power, has gradually stabilized 
at 20 MW. We used to have 20, and then it would drop to 6, to 
zero, and then back to 6 etc. Things have stabilized somewhat in 
this respect. We nevertheless believe that we will soon be able 
to get 70. 
  If there are no extraordinary circumstances, this will 
probably take place toward the end of this week. Saturday, 
Sunday we may get an extra 50 KW. This will make it possible 
for a considerable number of Sarajevans to receive electric 
power, at least four hours a day. This is what the power 
network expects. 
  As for gas, we are sometimes in a very difficult situation, 
we are on the brink of turning it off altogether. The Serb side 
is playing a game with this gas. We are in a position to cut 
their gas as well as our own. We can do it at any time if the 
amount of gas here in Sarajevo falls below a certain minimum 
level. 
  They are, however, holding us in what our people describe as 
a situation of too little to live on, too much to die. There is 
not enough gas. These quantities are, however, not so small as 
to make it sensible for us to cut it off altogether. The bakery 
would be then threatened etc. As far as gas goes, I am not 
really certain that there will be soon any improvements. I do 
not believe there will be any improvements soon. 
  [Announcer] What is the Presidency and government going to 
do 
about the disastrous humanitarian situation in Kakanj? Is it 
possible to do something more about the delivery of baby food to 
Zenica? 
  [Izetbegovic] I can only say that there is a committee 
working on the matter. They are doing their best but 
humanitarian aid is not in our hands. 
  [Announcer] We have four identical questions here: Is Tuzla 
airport to be opened? If so, when? 
  [Izetbegovic] If you want my prediction, I believe that the 
airport will be open. At some point my prediction was late 
February or early March. I still cling to this prediction -- 
late February or early March. 
  [Announcer] We have already heard some hints. As far as I 
know, I heard it today, the airport is supposed to officially 
reopen on 7 March, so it seems you are right. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, but I made my prediction 15, 20 days ago, 
if you remember that occasion. 
  [Announcer] Let us go back to some other matters. What about 
Serb artillery in Ahatovici, Butilo, Paljevo, Rajlovac, in other 
words, behind Stup? 
  [Izetbegovic] According to some reports, well, in any case 
artillery has been either removed beyond the 20-km radius or 
placed under [UNPROFOR] control. There is the odd abandoned 
artillery piece that is being collected by UNPROFOR.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] [words indistinct] some districts. 
  [Izetbegovic] Except those pieces that are hidden, those 
pieces that are possibly hidden underground. In all probability 
UNPROFOR will spot or has already spotted these abandoned 
artillery pieces, and transfer them by helicopter and group them 
in certain locations. 
  [Announcer] In some five places, if I am not wrong. 
  [Izetbegovic] It was first assembled in eight places and 
they 
are now regrouping it in five places. As Mr. [name indistinct] 
said last night, they need to tighten, as they put it, the 
battlefield, in order to ease their control. I do not think 
that we will have any problems in that respect. Some artillery 
pieces have definitely been sent to Kiseljak, according to some 
information that we have. It was sold or given away there. 
Some of their weapons most probably ended up there. 
  [Announcer] As they have been doing so far, they have been 
selling their artillery. 
  [Izetbegovic] We have such reports, I must admit they are 
not 
confirmed, but came from very reliable sources. 
  [Announcer] What will happen to the heavy artillery after 
two 
years, a viewer asks. I think that the fate of it will be 
resolved before that. 
  [Izetbegovic] The fate of the weaponry once peace is 
restored 
is not resolved at the moment. We do not know what will happen 
to the artillery. Of course, we will request that it be 
destroyed. That will be the best solution. 
  [Announcer] What are the prospects for the return of 
refugees? Now we could mention all the refugees, but a viewer 
from Zagreb has raised this question in particular. When is 
this going to be possible? 
  [Izetbegovic] Refugees are one of our main motives in our 
painstaking negotiations with Croatia, following so many 
unsuccessful negotiations -- and now we are again doing the 
same. It is our feeling that without an agreement with Croatia 
we cannot return the refugees. Roads are closed, airports are 
closed. They should be enabled to go somewhere, to travel along 
the road from Split to Sarajevo. Hence, our refugees are our 
main motive in these negotiations as we are trying in one way or 
another to reach some agreement with Croatia. 
  It is our desire to enable as soon as possible these people 
to return. Since this cease-fire in Sarajevo went into effect I 
have been receiving hundreds of letters and messages saying that 
people would like to return to the city. They want to know how 
they can return. In my replies I write of course as much as I 
can, as I cannot reply to every letter, that they should be 
patient for some time. The return of these refugees will 
nevertheless have to be done via Croatia and via the 
Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo road or the Split -Sarajevo road. We must 
reach some agreement on this matter. This is a kind of 
imperative we have tasked ourselves with, we are tasked with 
solving this issue. First, we would, of course, withdraw the 
refugees from Croatia. 
  [Announcer] Talking about this, the question also arises of 
returning people to the strip here along the Drina river in 
particular, i.e. eastern Bosnia, including the question of why 
Foca has been bypassed in all the negotiations so far on drawing 
eventual borders. Why is it not included in the 15 disputed 
areas although Foca always had a majority Muslim population? 
After all, this point was raised in Geneva, as far as I 
remember, including the majority Muslim populations in eastern 
Bosnia as per the 1991 census [sentence as heard]. What is the 
present position of this entire area in the negotiations? 
  [Izetbegovic] We have a basic, rather broad formula. We say, 
give us back our areas, our land and you will have peace -- this 
is our message to the other side. When we say our areas, we 
refer to those areas where the Bosnian population was in the 
majority according to the 1991 census. 
  [Announcer] Cajnice, Foca, Rudo, Visegrad [words indistinct] 
are of strategic importance to us.... 
  [Izetbegovic, interrupting] In Cajnice we unfortunately were 
not in the majority.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] What about Rogatica, for example, 
where we were? 
  [Izetbegovic] We demand that they are given back. According 
to this formula we advocate -- it was the Assembly's position 
too, if you remember, this is precisely how it is formulated -- 
we can demand our majority areas. And we will demand them. We 
are determinedly carrying on in this direction, we have not been 
giving in, as you know, during over one year of negotiations. 
This is our message again. This was the instruction given to 
Silajdzic before he left for these talks. For now it is 
impossible to predict how the negotiations will end because 
various great powers are at play here. We, however, cannot give 
up this principle. It is a kind of platform passed by the 
assembly. 
  [Announcer] Can the presidency do something to help the 
Muslims who are still in Banja Luka? Yesterday, we saw some 
footage of dead people, they were killed there? 
  [Izetbegovic] Hardly anything. What we can do and what we 
are doing at the moment is to inform international organizations 
and the public, international organizations in particular, as it 
is their duty to take care of this. Regretfully, I have to 
state, though, that it is not an effective method. 
  Nobody is ready to react, verbally yes, but not to take 
concrete measures. They deem that for this reason they imposed 
the sanctions against Serbia but are not ready to enter Banja 
Luka and liberate those people. Whether we will ever be able to 
do that is open to question. 
  [Announcer] A question from Sipovo. When are we going to 
return home? What will happen to the western part of 
Herzegovina? The association of citizens of Grbavica and Vrace 
asks when they are going to return home. There are very many 
question of this sort. 
  [Izetbegovic] As to Grbavica and Vrace, I think that a while 
ago I replied to that question. The situation there is somewhat 
clearer than that regarding Sipovo or Banja Luka. 
  [Announcer] Now, toward the end of the program, some more 
questions remain to be answered. I think they are interesting, 
but I think it is primarily up to our government to reply to 
them. If you are ready, may we reply to them as well? What 
does the Presidency think about students drafted into the army? 
Will it enable them to continue the school year 1993-94? Are 
you thinking about sending some exceptional students from 
Sarajevo who have been admitted to some universities in Europe 
and elsewhere in the world? Finally, once educated, they are 
going to be useful as experts. 
  [Izetbegovic] In that respect we have to be very cautious in 
what we are doing. We should neither stop the process of 
education of talented people who can obtain education, nor on 
the other hand should be approach that process too liberally, 
because by this means we are weakening our army. Not because of 
the departure of a couple of dozen people, but because people 
here ask the question of who will defend the country, why should 
some people go to live and study comfortably in America or 
Turkey and so on, while we are getting killed here and so on. 
  That is a very delicate issue. I think that in this respect 
a rational solution must be found. We must not be left without 
cadres, because we will not get far. One day we will restore 
peace, we will have a state, that state and society need 
educated people. No state can do without them. No state can 
allow itself such luxury as to be left without any educated 
cadres. Therefore, perhaps we will have to examine that issue 
with great sensibility in such a way as to send the real talents 
abroad to acquire education. We should not turn down 
scholarships that have been offered. However, those to be sent 
abroad should be people who have fought over the past two years 
and who made their contribution, to be able to be withdrawn from 
the army. I think that people who did not fight should not 
enjoy such a privilege. But, by this I am not giving a final 
reply. Of course, this is a question that needs to be examined 
well. 
  [Announcer] Have you been informed about shooting in Sandzak 
over the past two days and the fluid situation in Bijelo Polje? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, I know. As you know we have drawn 
attention to the situation in Sandzak. We have done what can be 
done in this respect. I think that we have sent a letter to the 
UN Security Council, asking it to examine the situation in the 
light of the latest developments, the escalation of terror 
there. We will have to warn the Security Council to do 
something. 
  However, with regard to the experience that Bosnia has had 
with the Security Council in this connection, I think that we 
should not count on them to take any effective measures. I do 
not believe they would. As regards Sandzak, our strategy will 
be to try to tie it to the Bosnian problem. Therefore we put 
forward an initiative for a wider conference, some called it the 
Balkan conference. We advocated that standpoint in order to 
gain the chance to put the Sandzak issue on the agenda. It 
should not remain on the sidelines. We cannot tackle it within 
the resolution of the Bosnian issue. We can only tackle it if 
we extend it. In any case, regardless of the resolution of the 
situation in Bosnia, at one time the whole thing will have to be 
discussed in a wider context; at least, the complex including 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia. 
  The issue of Sandzak, as soon as we deem it possible to do 
so, will be linked to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we will 
try to resolve it in a package. In the meantime we can draw the 
attention of the international public and the relevant 
organizations to the violation of human rights. 
  [Announcer] When we are already talking about [words 
indistinct], can I ask you about Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], how do you view the blockade of 
the Macedonian borders and how do you view the possibility of 
the deployment of fresh U.S. troops in that republic. Would 
that be a chance for the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue to be resolved 
more quickly? 
  [Izetbegovic] We have condemned the latest moves by Greece 
against Macedonia, which is an independent and sovereign state. 
That was also done by the European public, but I do not think 
that they did enough in this regard. But, still, the 
international public and the international community have 
condemned Greece. However, Greece did not find it appropriate to 
rectify its behaviour. That is, indeed, a regrettable act. 
  I do not think that fresh American soldiers will be deployed 
down there. Anyhow, their number is only symbolic, but 
completely sufficient to make an attack on them an attack on the 
United States. That is very clear [words indistinct] the message 
is very clear. It is not important whether there are 300 or 600 
soldiers [words indistinct]. I think that a military action 
against Macedonia cannot be expected. 
  [Announcer] Do you believe the war will end in May, a viewer 
from Tuzla asks. We are nearly at the end of the program, may I 
ask you what your prediction is, what will happen in the 23d and 
24th month of the aggression against our country? 
  [Izetbegovic] I have to tell you [words indistinct]. I do 
not have the feeling that the war will end that quickly. I do 
not have that feeling. It would be good, we are in favor of 
restoring peace here as soon as possible. However, our objective 
is a fair peace -- I do not think we can expect it in a month or 
two. Peace at any price could be signed tomorrow. We have to 
fight a bit more to restore a fair peace, we have to work toward 
it a bit longer, we still need some more time. 
  [Announcer] A message for the Sarajevans. Let us end as we 
started, can this situation be considered a nucleus of our free 
country Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Izetbegovic] Sarajevo is very important [passage 
indistinct].

<F P=106> [Communique of the Press Bureau of the Romanian Intelligence </F>
Service on Virgil Magureanu's presence at miners rally in Targu 
Jiu released in Bucharest on 21 February; published under the 
headline: "The Great Rally of the Miners in Targu Jiu. `Who Is 
There? My Good People!' -- As Far As We Know, the Applause Was 
Actually Booing"] 
  [Text] In connection with mass-media allegations about the 
presence of Mr. Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI] in Targu Jiu -- some of which are 
purely tendentious and slanderous -- the SRI Press Bureau is 
authorized to release the following: 
  1. The SRI director's presence in Targu Jiu on the afternoon 
of 18 February was exclusively linked to the activity of the 
respective SRI county branch in 1993. 
  There is no political connotation to the meeting between the 
SRI director and Mr. Miron Cosma [leader of the Mining Trade 
Union Confederation of Romania]. The purpose of the meeting, 
which took place at the SRI headquarters in Targu Jiu at the 
latter's express request, was to brief our institution on the 
actual situation in the field. 
  2. The SRI director's gesture of addressing himself to the 
crowd of miners gathered in front of the Lignitul [Brown Coal] 
Public Corporation headquarters in the town -- which many 
considered "spectacular" -- was solely motivated by the desire 
to diffuse the still explosive state of spirit prevalent among 
many of the miners there and to assure them that the relevant 
institutions will be given a correct briefing on the situation. 
  3. Consequently, we can see no justification to the 
allegations about an so-called intervention in a labor conflict 
or to those implying that one thus stood to gain some political 
advantage to the detriment of others. 
  No promises were made aside from passing the correct 
information to the relevant state authorities. 
  To back our position, we herewith publish the text of the 
speech made by the SRI director on that occasion: 
  "My good people, 
  "I did not come here to earn some cheap popularity points. 
Please listen to me, rather than applaud. 
  "Therefore, I beg you to listen to what I have to say, 
rather 
than applaud me, since, with all your problems here, one hardly 
feels the need for applause. 
  "Second, the last thing this country needs is for people to 
die and fight. This country needs honest work and the defense 
of all rights, primarily yours. 
  "There is no need for you to fight or die to defend your 
leader. Nobody is threatening him. 
  "We took note of the fact that there are many irregularities 
pointed out by your delegation. 
  "We also know that a miners' delegation is now in Bucharest 
explaining the situation to the people there. 
  "I assure you that I will report what I saw and heard here 
to 
the appropriate authorities, up to the highest level. 
  "It is never to late to do justice, if this is what the 
people want. 
  "Nobody stands to gain anything if they are trying to obtain 
by force what they can very well obtain through legal means. 
  "You have sent your leaders to talk to us and to all those 
with a say in resolving the situation. Now, you must be patient 
for two or three days. 
  "One needs these few days of respite, if we are to establish 
the guilt and responsibility of various people. Nothing can be 
done overnight." 
  The SRI Press Bureau can make the video recording of the 
speech available to any interested party. 
  The SRI Press Bureau.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Why Does Virgil Magureanu Keep </F>
Silent?"] 
  [Text] I think that everyone has been able to note that 
Virgil is silent. Some might respond to such a statement by 
saying that it is precisely the duty of a man like Virgil 
Magureanu to keep silent. He is the director of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI]. In this position, it is not only 
his duty, but also a priority to be as discreet as possible in 
the area of our public activity. In this respect, Virgil 
Magureanu is an exception to the rule. For a long time, he was 
a true star of present-day Romania: Statements in the press and 
on television, long conversations in magazines and on various 
wavelengths, more or less flattering photographs, and televised 
talk shows. Lately, however, Virgil Magureanu has no longer 
displayed the same self-possession in public. He no longer 
gives so many interviews or news conferences, and especially, no 
longer makes public appearances. From the difference between 
his former and current conduct, we may draw the conclusion that 
Virgil Magureanu keeps quiet. 
  In [writer] Marin Preda's "Delirium" there is an extremely 
interesting scene. It takes place during the night of the Iron- 
Guard uprising. Horia Sima's supporters are destroying stores, 
setting fire to houses in which Jews live, and attacking 
soldiers. Bucharest is reverberating with gunfire. There is 
tension in the streets. Gathered in a room, a few figures in 
this novel ask themselves with concern: Why is the general 
keeping silent? The general being, of course, Romania's future 
Marshal Ion Antonescu [wartime military dictator]. Many strange 
things are happening in our country these days. A number of 
people belonging to the executive power have been accused of 
espionage for a foreign country. The minister of defense, 
Niculae Spiroiu, one of the most fervent advocates of army 
modernization and integration in North- Atlantic structures, has 
been accused of corruption. The campaign against him is based 
on information that is believed to have come from the Romanian 
Intelligence Service. The son of General Marin Pancea, 
secretary of the Supreme Defense Council and presidential 
adviser, has been accused of being involved in dishonest deals. 
One of his partners, Radu Popa, was crudely arrested. Iosif 
Boda, the presidential adviser most convinced of the need for 
dialogue with the opposition and Romania's orientation to the 
West, is to leave for Switzerland as ambassador. True, the 
country is thus gaining an intelligent representative abroad. 
It loses, however, because the group of reformers around Ion 
Iliescu is weakened, while the conservative group represented by 
Marin Pancea and Vasile Ionel triumphs. Although it is clear to 
everyone that this will harm Romania's image abroad, 
negotiations are conducted to create a nationalist-communist 
government, the government of the so-called Red Pentagon. On 
his return from Washington, Petre Roman said the State 
Department would not like such a shift to the left. The leaders 
of the Red Pentagon, mainly Adrian Nastase, wince and say the 
Americans did not broach the subject. These are strange things. 
They do not, however, match the strangeness of those during the 
Iron-Guard uprising. Virgil Magureanu is not Ion Antonescu 
either. Nevertheless, keeping a sense of proportion, we can copy 
the characters in "The Delirium" and ask: Why does Virgil 
Magureanu keep silent? There is, however, a connection between 
Ion Antonescu and the strange things during the night of the 
Iron-Guard actions. The order in the country depends on the 
leader of the state. It was normal for simple citizens to ask 
themselves why the general keeps silent. In this respect, one 
could argue that there is no connection between the strange 
things of late and Virgil Magureanu. And that, thus we cannot 
ask, as in Ion Antonescu's case, why the SRI director keeps 
silent? Close study, however, shows that this argument is 
unjustifiable. The strange things these days are closely linked 
to Virgil Magureanu. Not only because he could clarify the 
enigma of them, but also because they began to happen exactly 
when Virgil Magureanu fell silent. There have been so many 
strange things since the SRI director withdrew from the public 
scene that we would risk nothing by asking another question: Do 
they not happen, by any chance, just because Virgil Magureanu 
keeps silent?

<F P=106> [Army Press Bureau "communique"] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the serious accusations against the 
leadership of the Ministry of National Defense published in the 
weekly ROMANIA MARE, the Press Bureau of the Army is authorized 
to state the following: 
  1. The entire activity of the Ministry of National Defense 
is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the strategy 
of the government program, under the control of Romania's 
Parliament, the Supreme Defense Council of Romania, and the 
government. Therefore, no action taken by the leadership of the 
ministry, including the minister, has taken place without the 
previous approval of the institutions authorized in this respect 
(...) 
  2. Although the consequences of the economic recession and 
of the other difficulties specific to the transition period are 
seriously felt in the army, too, the Ministry of National 
Defense has obtained noteworthy results, which have been 
mentioned as such at the meeting of the Executive and the public 
has been informed about them. 
  We mention a few of these results: 
  -- the equidistance of the army from any political or party 
ideology; 
  -- the actions aimed at improving the training of all 
military groups, while the budget is being reduced every year -- 
last year's budget was three times lower than in 1989 and was 
among the lowest in Europe. 
  -- courses of flying instruction for military pilots, with 
an 
average duration three times longer than before 1990, but which, 
unfortunately, is still below international norms. In 1993 we 
succeeded in promoting all military pilot trainees to the first 
stage of full command [iesirea in simpla comanda a tuturor 
pilotilor militari], an unprecedented fact in the past 15 years; 
  -- the improvement of military discipline while action to 
restructure the system of social values is taking place, with 
respect for the traditional standards of the military 
institution thus being weakened. In this respect, through 
appropriate measures in the army, we achieved a threefold 
reduction of the number of serious violations of standards in 
1993 compared with 1991; 
  -- the implementation of certain measures of social 
protection for all military ranks, including reserve officers, 
retired officers, and veterans. 
  3. Through legal measures and government decisions initiated 
by the Ministry of National Defense together with the Ministry 
of Industry, which bear responsibility for private corporations 
that produce military equipment, we succeeded in preserving the 
production capacities of the defense industry. They have 
continued their specific activity, ensured the production of 74 
percent of combat equipment, equipment taken over by the army in 
1993, and ensured the fulfillment of export orders, as well as 
products for civilian use. 
  No type of military equipment that can be produced at home 
has been imported (thus, no tanks from Israel either!), and the 
export of special products has been constantly increasing since 
1990. 
  With Israel and other countries we have organized ventures 
to 
jointly produce certain special products, but actual production 
has been exclusively the job of industrial capacities in Romania. 
  4. A reduction of combat technology is currently taking 
place in our country and as in the case of other European 
countries -- including our neighbors -- this action is carried 
out strictly in accordance with programs under international 
treaties that Romania has signed, treaties signed by the 
country's political leadership and approved by parliament. 
  5. Regarding the so-called "Kent" affair [cigarette 
smuggling affair involving a number of military personnel], the 
Military Prosecuting Magistracy's investigation in connection 
with the case before the court established that the renting of 
storage space from the "Romtechnica" Autonomous Public 
Corporation was a legal act and did not result in any material 
damage to the Ministry of National Defense. From documents 
provided to the investigators by the "Romtechnica" Corporation, 
the identity of the guilty party was established -- Lebanese 
citizen Nassar Elias -- and the amount of the damage to the 
Romanian state through evasion of customs duty with the use of 
fake stamps was recovered. The military cadres guilty of 
certain violation of the military norms, on the basis of which 
the customs evasion took place, were removed from their 
positions and turned over to the appropriate legal authorities. 
  6. Regarding the alleged damage to the army's patrimony as a 
result of the contract with the Delta Design firm -- whose owner 
is Iulian Rosengren -- a firm that had to supply us with oil 
products, using its own means, the Ministry of National Defense 
detected a lack of trustworthiness of the partner -- who cheated 
other institutions as well -- and thus canceled the contract in 
time and recovered all the money that represented the payment, 
together with interest on the amount owed by the firm (...). 
  We express our regret that, at this time that is extremely 
important for speeding up the process of our country's 
integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures, accusations that 
are in flagrant contradiction with reality are made public. 
These actions show ill will, the more so, since the ministry 
leadership has submitted to the democratic bodies of our country 
all the requested information regarding the activity of the army.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petru Ianc, chief of the Metallurgical </F>
Industry Department, by Romulus Maier; place and date not given: 
"Professional Retraining Program: In 10 Years, the Labor 
Employed in the Metallurgical Industry Will Be Cut Back By More 
Than 50 Percent"] 
  [Text] According to a study on restructuring the 
metallurgical industry carried out by the Ministry of Industry, 
it is estimated that by the year 2000 the number of personnel 
employed in the steel, nonferrous metallurgical, and fireproof 
material industries will be cut back by more than 50 percent. 
For details, we approached Petru Ianc, state secretary and 
chief of the Metallurgical Industry Department. 
  [Maier] What are the social implications of your 
department's restructuring policy? 
  [Ianc] More than 145,000 people are currently working in 
metallurgy in various activities: Transportation, the actual 
production process, repair and maintenance, and research and 
design. In the West, in countries with market economies, when 
people refer to metallurgy they actually mean the basic 
structure: Raw material storage, iron and steel works, rolling 
mills, and storage for finished products. Other, complementary 
activities are organized in a separate system of services, which 
are paid for. This delimitation between the basic activity and 
complementary activities would mean to shift down from 145,000 
employees to some 80,000. Thus, it would not mean a cut in 
personnel, but simply a separation of activities. Obviously, it 
is only natural that this process should continue in each of 
these components combined with appropriate measures resulting 
from correlating the volume of work with the number of 
personnel. This, however, will not have a drastic effect, at 
least not for the time being. Given the prospects for 
modernizing the production flow, a labor cut from 80,000 to some 
40,000 is expected over a period of 10 years. A major part of 
this cutback will occur naturally. A further part of employees 
will be absorbed by specific ecologically-motivated actions. 
Obviously, a retraining program is also needed. 
  [Maier] As a representative of the ruling center-leftist 
party, do you believe the Vacaroiu government will look 
favorably on the program you propose? 
  [Ianc] I think it will be supported by the current 
government. And I also think that this program should not only 
be supported by a leftist government, but by any government in 
power over these 10 years. That is what has happened in all 
countries in the world, both in those with a leftist government 
such as France and in countries with center or center-rightist 
governments such as Britian. Social problems are the focus of 
the current government and must be the focus of any government.

<F P=106> [Marian Ivancu article: "Reform and Restructuring the Armed </F>
Forces"] 
  [Text] In the 1993 inventory of the Army, those 
responsible for the Romanian Armed Forces emphasized the fact 
that new Army levers and command structures were established and 
verified during the previous year: the Supreme Council for the 
Country's Defense; the Ministry of National Defense; the State 
Secretariat, the General Inspectorate, the General Chief of 
Staff, and directorates; the Ground Troops Command, the Aviation 
Command, and the Navy Command. In 1994, the restructuring of 
lower echelons will be finalized: Army corps, brigades, and 
independent battalions. Thus, it is believed that in this way 
the mobility and effectiveness of troops will improve. 
  The government strategy program of the PDSR [Social 
Democracy 
Party of Romania] has set up the coordinating instrument for the 
activity of the Ministry of National Defense. Given the efforts 
to stabilize the economy and the difficulties characteristic of 
Romania's transition to the market economy, the Army has made 
indubitable progress. The Army's noninvolvement in politics and 
its increased credibility form the starting point for training 
our troops even under difficult financial conditions -- three 
times fewer funds than in 1989. 
  One of the Army's successes was maintaining the national 
defense industry intact (Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu 
recently said that "not even a single drill press was given 
away") and ensuring 74 percent of the combat equipment from our 
own supplies. Aside from this, all export orders have been 
finalized and, given the fact that the military conversion 
process has begun, we have started manufacturing products 
designed for civilian purposes. The Army has not imported 
anything that can be manufactured in our country, except for top 
technologies to be used in the defense industry. As a result of 
this technological adjustment, high performance systems on the 
basis of licenses from the NATO member countries or Israel have 
been manufactured in our country. 
  In the area of electronics, Israel benefits from valuable 
U.S., French, or own technologies not to be matched by similar 
Soviet technologies (speed, precision, pattern, consumption, and 
so forth). Let us recall that during the Arab-Israeli war the 
big tank battle in the Sinai (1973) was won by Israel with a lot 
of leeway. General Ariel Sharon's victory in the second biggest 
tank battle of all time was not a battle of more powerful and 
bigger tanks, but a battle of more "intelligent" tanks with 
better night "vision" and more precise computer-guided weapons. 
The same thing was reconfirmed during the Gulf war. 
  Other highly technological products manufactured in Romania 
in cooperation with Israeli experts are the components of the 
aeronautical industry (navigation, targeting, and fire-contol 
systems). It is known that the training of pilots in Israel (a 
country with limited resources like we ourselves) and technology 
have tripled their combat capacity and the number of sorties of 
each plane and pilot. This is how they ensured their supremacy 
in the air, although they had half as many planes as the Arabs. 
The most interesting argument, however, is the fact that all 
NATO members (including the U.S., France, Germany, and Great 
Britain) are sending their elite pilots and engineers to attend 
courses in Israel to perfect their knowledge. 
  The contracting of Romania's exercise planes IAR-99 and 
IAR-108 by Israel and the United States will be all the more 
successful. Anyhow, these planes are being tested in the two 
countries. 
  On the other hand, instead of procuring expensive, modern 
planes like the MiG-21, using Israeli electronic devices would 
mean important savings. 
  In the area of reducing combat equipment under international 
supervision, the Ministry of National Defense was able in 1993 
to abide by what was established during negotiations and thus 
able to scrap 25 percent of the planned equipment (especially 
used and outdated ones). In 1994, scrapping will be increased 
to 35 percent, and what is left for 1995 is 40 percent. 
  In the area of cutting back troops, their number will amount 
to 268,000 (on 1 January 1994) and 230,000 (in 1995). They will 
be, first and foremost, fighters, not people from auxiliary 
branches, because the "Army can no longer be jack of all trades 
and do everything" (as Lieutenant General N. Spiroiu put it). 
  Given the East European conflicts, the only area of balance 
and security is the one under NATO's umbrella. Romania's 
tendency to avoid dangerous imbalances and to get closer to NATO 
is justified and necessary because NATO remains the only 
political-military body able to offer guarantees for territorial 
integrity and the continuation of our democratic process. 
  A gradual getting closer to and integration in the North 
Atlantic structures are possible on the basis of compatible and 
complementary military standards and doctrines based on the 
following principles: 1. The inviolability of national and 
European security; 2. The defensive nature of forces and 
limiting them solely to the national territory; 3. The 
preparation of the territory and of the economy for defense; 4. 
The national exclusiveness of ordering Romanian military 
components. 
  Certainly, NATO integration involves high costs. 
Restructuring the Army and the national defense industry will 
entail important financial efforts throughout several years. We 
have to bear in mind, however, that beginning in 1968 Romania 
detached itself from the sole Eastern supplier in this respect 
and began the construction of its own defense industry on the 
basis of Western standards: Aviation (on the basis of French and 
British licenses), artillery (partly on the basis of NATO 
standards), air-to-ground and antitank missiles (French 
licenses), and so forth. The main Romanian accomplishments in 
this respect are based on Western type of components and 
technologies. 
  Even in the area of telecommunications, everything, 
beginning 
with small- and medium-size portable equipment (which is needed 
by the troops), has been manufactured in our country with 
transistors, integrated circuits, connections, and computers on 
the basis of such licenses as Souriou, IBM, Control Data, and so 
forth. 
  This is why Romania only has to preserve its specialized 
labor force and to modernize its production capacities by 
introducing new technologies. This is precisely what is 
happening now. True, there are dysfunctions, but they are kept 
under control. Thus, the Army is able to do its duty at all 
times.

  [Text] The ministers of national defense of Romania and 
Poland, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu and Mr. Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk, signed an agreement on military cooperation 
between the two Ministries of National Defense in Bucharest this 
afternoon. The signing ceremony was followed by a news 
conference given by the two ministers. 
  Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu said that the visit by a 
Polish military delegation, the first since 1989, is an 
outstanding moment in bilateral cooperation. He recalled that 
Mr. Piotr Kolodziejczyk was received today by Romanian President 
Mr. Ion Iliescu and yesterday by Mr. Adrian Nastase, president 
of the Chamber of Deputies, and by Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu. He also mentioned that the guest had talks with the 
chairmen of the Commissions for Defense, Public Order, and 
National Defense of the two chambers of Parliament, that is 
Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte and Deputy Petre Roman, 
respectively. 
  The discussions conducted during the visit, Mr. Nicolae 
Spiroiu said, emphasized the readiness of the two ministries to 
regulate their multifaceted relations of cooperation and 
collaboration, in keeping with the foreign policy promoted by 
Romania and Poland. They also decided to hold consultations and 
engage in various activities in accordance with the Partnership 
for Peace, which both Romania and Poland have joined. 
  Mr. Piotr Kolodziejczyk said in his statement that Romania 
and Poland and the armies of the two states are going through 
similar processes. In his opinion, the long road to the 
European structures, which entails great financial efforts, can 
be covered more rapidly through very good cooperation.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Is There a Russian Encirclement </F>
of Romania?"] 
  [Text] On Sunday evening, 20 February, the world's major 
television stations carried footage of the entry of the Russian 
contingent of UN peacekeeping forces into Pale in Bosnia. 
Television viewers were surprised by one thing. In every 
respect, the arrival of the Russian contingent in that area is a 
routine matter. The UN troops are made up of contingents 
belonging to various nations. Thus, numerous national 
contingents have been replaced since the UN intervention. Some 
have come, others have gone. Local people were hardly disturbed 
by this. They continued to pursue their affairs, that is to 
fire their guns and let themselves be filmed in their tragedy by 
foreign television crews. This is why the arrival of the Russian 
contingent had to be welcomed as well. It could have been 
viewed as a mere replacement of a contingent under UN flag. It 
was, however, viewed differently. The Serbs in Pale welcomed 
the Russian troops like liberators. The television images from 
Pale were strikingly reminiscent of the atmosphere in which 
allied troops were welcomed in a Western city during the last 
year of World War II. The enthusiasm among the Serbs about the 
appearance of the Russian troops draws our attention to a fact 
whose real dimension is not yet perceived by Europe and the 
entire world. The Russian troops came to Bosnia under the UN 
flag. Following Moscow's diplomatic actions, the Serbs agreed 
to withdraw their heavy weaponry provided that the UN troops in 
the area also included Russian troops. So far, this had not 
been possible, because the West was, naturally, afraid that 
these troops might become partisans for the Serbs. The only 
thing is that, in reality, the arrival of the Russian contingent 
-- through all its implications -- turned into Russia's return 
to former Yugoslavia. Almost half a century ago, in 1948, the 
Serbs were emerging from the traditional influence of their Slav 
big brothers -- the Russians. After a few years of hesitation, 
Tito, however, opted for the West. For almost half a century, 
Yugoslavia was, if not hostile, then at least indifferent to 
Russia. The arrival of the Russian troops in Bosnia was the 
price that the United States had to pay to come unscathed out of 
the mess called the NATO ultimatum. Russia's initiative solved 
a crisis that worried the entire globe. The Serbs withdrew 
their heavy weaponry. Even though NATO declared that it was 
going to maintain the ultimatum, it is clear that the question 
of air strikes is no longer valid. At least for the time being. 
The price that the United States have to pay for this 
face-saving operation is the loss of new Yugoslavia. Is it too 
high? Is it too low? In my opinion, for the United States this 
price is not as high as some people may think. First, because 
the Serbs were lost anyway from the very moment that the United 
States chose to side with the opponents of the Serbs -- 
Slovenia, Croatia, and the Muslims in Bosnia. Second, as I have 
stated before, the United States is less and less interested in 
Europe. In the new U.S. world plans, Europe is increasingly 
being eclipsed by Asia. Within this context, the loss of the 
Serbs does not seem to count a great deal. In exchange for this 
loss, the United States could win over the Muslims throughout 
the world. Which means not only the most attractive part from 
an economic point of view, but also the most aggressive part 
from an ideological point of view. The great analysts of the 
U.S. Administration must have realized that communist ideology 
is being replaced, with every passing day, by Islamic 
fundamentalism, a sort of religious Bolshevism. 
  Things are satisfactory for the United States. For Romania, 
however, things are a little different. For the Serbs to fall 
under Russia's sphere of influence is tantamount to the 
beginning of a Russian encirclement of Romania. Not so long 
ago, we used to meet with Russia only in the east. Now there it 
is waving to us from the west. Bearing in mind the increasingly 
closer relations between Hungary and Russia, we cannot rule out 
that soon we will see the Russians waving to us from the north. 
All that is left is the south. I do not believe, however, that 
there is any Romanian who, even for a moment, would have any 
doubts about the true relations between the Bulgarians and the 
Russians. Thus, one cannot rule out that, in a short time, we 
will really be an island of Latinity in a great sea of Slavs.

<F P=106> ["Text" of message by President Kiro Gligorov to Greek Prime </F>
Minister Andreas Papandreou in Skopje on 23 February: 
"Normalization of Mutual Relations Is of Lasting Interest"] 
  [Text] Skopje, 23 February 94 
  Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister: 
  After today's talks with Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner 
for foreign affairs, and with his kindness, I would like to 
introduce you to the views of the Republic of Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] regarding 
finding solutions to the present problems in relations with the 
Republic of Greece. 
  The Republic of Macedonia, an independent country and a 
member of the United Nations, is deeply interested in 
constructing relations and cooperation with all its neighbors on 
the basis of good neighborliness and in the interest of peace 
and stability in the region. In that sense, we are interested 
in a broader development of relations and cooperation with the 
neighboring Republic of Greece, which is of multifold interest 
to both sides. 
  For that sake, we are encouraged to do our best to create 
conditions for the normalization of our mutual relations in a 
principled way and on the basis of equality, as a lasting 
interest for both countries, and of a larger significance. 
  On this occasion, I would like to reiterate our readiness to 
sign an agreement with your country guaranteeing the existing 
borders between the two countries. If necessary, we are ready 
to accept the United Nations or the European Union as guarantors 
of this agreement. 
  We support the idea of resuming a dialogue between our two 
countries as soon as possible, without any previous conditions, 
on the mutual relations and questions of dissent between us, 
including the use of the symbols, the name, and so on. That 
dialogue should continue within the framework of the United 
Nations and with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance. We are ready 
to involve all necessary efforts to reach adequate and mutually 
acceptable solutions to the existing problems. Moreover, we 
highly appreciate the engagement of the European Union, as well 
as the promptness of other international factors, in finding the 
best solutions within the framework of the mentioned dialogue. 
Therefore, I extend a proposal for a meeting between the 
foreign ministers of our two countries in one of the European 
capitals, which will function as a dialogue between the two 
countries. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, I would particularly like to express our 
concern about the situation created after the measures 
undertaken by your government on 16 February this year in 
relation to our country. The sustenance and the continuation of 
this situation will cause undesired consequences for the peace 
and stability in this part of the Balkans, which will 
undoubtedly lead us to turn to the Security Council. Moreover, 
due to the European dimension of the problem, the engagement of 
the CSCE will be indispensable. 
  I firmly believe that, due to the seriousness of all these 
issues and the responsibility we are bearing, a way for their 
fast settlement will be found, on a principled and lasting 
basis, and in the interests of our two countries and peoples. 
  With respect, 
  Kiro Gligorov

  [Text] Skopje, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Hans van den Broek, EU

this afternoon to convey the Greek reply to a proposal that the 
Macedonian president sent to Greece yesterday on overcoming the 
dispute and the lifting of the Greek blockade. 
  Upon his arrival at Skopje's Petrovac airport, van den Broek 
stated that he was bringing some positive messages to Kiro 
Gligorov, president of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], and the government. On the other hand, 
he added, much remained to be done, but in any case a dialogue 
must be restored in the forseeable future.

  [Text] Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner for 
international relations, arrived in Skopje yesterday at the 
request of the EU ministers. Just after his arrival, van den 
Broek had talks with President Kiro Gligorov. According to the 
announcement released by the president's cabinet, they exchanged 
opinions about the present questions in Macedonian-Greek 
relations and the latest events after the trade embargo embarked 
on by the Republic of Greece against the Republic of Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  President Gligorov gave the European commissioner a written 
message for Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in which he 
reiterated the goodwill and preparedness of the Republic of 
Macedonia to resume talks in the framework of the United 
Nations, with the assistance of the European Union. The 
economic damages caused by the Greek embargo and the danger of 
new tensions in the region were particular subjects of 
discussion. 
  EU Commissioner van den Broek made a short statement after 
the discussions he had with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov 
regarding the situation created after the Greek embargo and the 
possible consequences and implications for Macedonia, but also 
for security and stability in the region. 
  "We had over two hours of intensive, fruitful discussions 
and 
exchanges of opinions with President Gligorov," Mr. van den 
Broek stated to the numerous journalists. "You know about our 
mission here -- we are here, first of all, to help resume the 
dialogue between Skopje and Athens on a number of very dangerous 
and sensitive subjects. We are certainly convinced that the 
process of normalization in relations between Skopje and Athens 
is irreplaceable for stability and peace in this part of the 
region. And I think that both sides are very much aware of that. 
  "You live here, in a very dangerous part of the world, and 
it 
would be very careless if the relations between Skopje and 
Athens were to escalate the situation in the region," van den 
Broek said. 
  "I shall take the message of President Gligorov to 
Papandreou, whom I expect to meet tomorrow afternoon after my 
talks with Foreign Minister Papulias this evening, and tomorrow 
we are leaving for Brussels," said van den Broek.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Damovski: "Tranquilization of Coalition </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] An informal meeting was held three days ago [21 
February] in response to a message from Djeladin Murati, PDP 
[Party for Democratic Prosperity] president, to Prime Minister 
Crvenkovski, in which he asked for an urgent government session 
with the participation of the PDP ministerial group. The 
meeting was attended by Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, Prime Minister 
Branko Crvenkovski, Parliamentary Chairman Stojan Andov, 
together with the parliamentary vice chairmen, [Interior] 
Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, and Risto Ivanov, and the PDP 
ministerial group. According to all the information available, 
the misunderstandings in the government coalition were overcome 
at this meeting. 
  Let us recall: In his letter to Prime Minister Crvenkovski, 
Djeladin Murati said that he had learned that the authorities 
had started a game of dishonest obstruction against the PDP 
group so as to conceal its approach to the new group from the 
other congress (Menduh Taci's group), and to hide the support 
that it was giving to it. The aim was, Murati said in his 
letter, to eliminate from political life and discredit Albanian 
delegates and ministers in a perfidious way. Murati thought 
that there were indications of Interior Ministry involvement, 
and that if the facts were not examined, "it would be possible 
to reexamine further activities within the institutions of the 
system." 
  Amazingly soon after that, on the next working day, the 
requested meeting was held and it was concluded that the PDP 
would remain within the institutions of the system. As an 
introduction to this conclusion, the visit of the Macedonian 
state delegation to Albania was mentioned, and, understandably, 
the alleged forcing of the split within the PDP. 
  As we know, minister-coordinator Bekir Zuta was a member of 
the Macedonian delegation that made a recent official visit to 
Tirana, and the Albanian side demanded his exclusion from the 
discussions with Albanian President Sali Berisha. The PDP 
leadership interpreted that as a kind of a shift in policy 
toward their party. 
  The second subject discussed at the meeting was the opinion 
expressed by the PDP about forcing Taci's position via the state 
media (Taci's interview for Macedonian Television and AFP in 
Albanian, the reports on the main newscast about the interview, 
reports of telephone calls with Taci on the main newscast of 
Macedonian Television, and the contribution of other journalists 
to the party's division). 
  The PDP group also brought up the problem of granting 
citizenship, as well as the great reservations demonstrated by 
the Macedonian leadership concerning the behavior of the 
Albanian Embassy in Macedonia, even going so far as to be 
directly involved in supporting Menduh Taci's faction.... 
  Nonetheless, a certain agreement was reached. There are no 
more threats to abandon the coalition, the PDP is no longer so 
upset, and an image is being projected among its membership that 
their group is being consistent in its efforts to realize their 
policy goals.

  [Excerpts] Three Croatian politicians have left Frankfurt 
for Washington following an invitation from U.S. Secretary of 
Warren Christopher, including Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime 
minister and foreign affairs minister. Mate Granic is to have 
talks tomorrow with U.S. Government representatives and with his 
U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher. 
  A Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna delegation is traveling 
together with Minister Granic. It is led by Kresimir Zubak, 
president of the Presidential Council [of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna] and justice and administration minister. 
Presidential Council member Mile Akmadzic is also traveling with 
him. 
  In Washington they are going to discuss a possible agreement 
between Croats and Muslims and putting an end to the war. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Croatian side will display a high degree of flexibility 
and will do everything for a Croat-Muslim agreement to be 
reached, in which the United States and the European Union are 
interested, most of all the Croat and the Muslim nations, 
Minister Granic said in Frankfurt this afternoon. We will bear 
in mind that the fundamental interests of the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be completely protected. We have won 
support for our stands from numerous important European 
countries. We are beginning the negotiations in good faith that 
an agreement is possible, and that reaching an agreement would 
mean the beginning of the end of the war and the restoration of 
a permanent peace. This agreement would give a chance to the 
third side [Serbs] to take their standpoint toward a future life 
together in Bosnia-Herzegovina that will be based on equality of 
the three nations, Minister Granic stated for Croatian media 
prior to his departure from Frankfurt.

  [Text] Banja Luka, Feb 24 (TANJUG) -- The local authorities 
of the Serb-held region of western Slavonija on Thursday 
requested from the U.N. Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) command and 
Yasushi Akashi to immediately order the deblockade of the bridge 
over the Sava river, close to Stara Gradiska, and warned that 
the population of the region will no longer tolerate such 
conduct which is pushing them towards death. 
  The Stara Gradiska bridge links the republic of Serb Krajina 
(RSK -- formed by the local Serbs in parts of Croatia where they 
are in the majority in response to Croatia's secession from the 
former Yugoslav Federation), and the Srpska republic (RS) in the 
territory of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "By blocking the Pakrac-Okucani-Gradiska route, viewed by 
the 
Serb people as their sole lifeline, UNPROFOR has severed the 
supply of food and humanitarian aid, and halted the transport of 
the seriously ill to medical centres in RS and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia," says the protest letter. 
  The letter asks whether "the peacekeepers were deployed in 
this region to maintain a cease-fire and help in establishing a 
lasting and just peace, or if they were brought in to threaten 
the Serb people." 
  RSK Deputy Prime Minister Branko Lubovac told Serbian radio 
Obrenovac that the Serb side fully controls the situation on the 
bridge and expressed hope that it will be resolved in a peaceful 
way, which depends on UNPROFOR. 
  He said that the Serbs have always been willing to take part 
in a dialogue and expressed hope that Friday's top level meeting 
between the representatives of RSK and UNPROFOR will give 
concrete solutions to the current situation. 
  Over 4,000 U.N. troops from Jordan, Argentina and Nepal have 
been deployed in western Slavonija, which is within the sector 
west of the U.N. Protected Area (UNPA).

  [Text] Belgrade, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Colonel Mark Wood, 
special envoy of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander 
for the former Yugoslavia, Jean Cot, today talked in Knin to 
representatives of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] about the 
problem of the Okucani bridge. 
  Citing unofficial sources, SRNA [news agancy] says that the 
bridge near Okucani linking RSK and the Srpska republic will be 
discussed tomorrow in Belgrade by Yasushi Akashi, special envoy 
of Butrus-Ghali, and RSK President Milan Martic. 
  This morning at about 0530 UNPROFOR units completely blocked 
all roads between western Slavonia and this bridge. The "blue 
helmets" denied access even to trucks carrying bread. 
  Several hundred citizens gathered at about 1100 near the 
bridge to protest against this blockade. 
  As we have unofficially learned in Knin, the members of the 
RSK ministry for internal affairs, who control the bridge, have 
no intention of abandoning it. At today's talks Colonel Wood 
received an offer whereby members of UNPROFOR may control the 
bridge along with Krajina's police, SRNA says.

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.: "Truce Extended"] </F>
  [Text] Two days ago in Knin representatives of the general 
staff of the Serbian Krajina army signed the second consecutive 
agreement to extend the Christmas truce. 
  The first extension of the truce, signed on 13 January 1994 
at the Turanj border crossing near Karlovac, expired last 
midnight. The second, newly signed extension is only a 
continuation of the previously signed agreements, and it will be 
in effect until the end of February. 
  This signing in Knin two days ago was mediated by UNPROFOR 
representatives, as was the previous signing in Zagreb. 
  This latest agreement, according to the general staff of the 
Serbian army of Krajina, provides for a cease-fire and readiness 
to continue negotiations until a general cease-fire is achieved. 
  Armed clashes on the Knin front have significantly decreased 
since 23 December of last year, when the Christmas truce took 
effect. Croatian forces at the Benkovac-Zadar front did not 
observe the cease-fire. Military clashes in this North Dalmatian 
theater continued almost uninterrupted, but they are 
considerably less intense than before.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mirko Galic: "New Division of Interest"] </F>
  [Text] Have the Russians come to Bosnia to protect their 
"Orthodox brothers"? If we judge only by the three raised 
fingers [symbol of Eastern Orthodoxy, used by Serbian 
nationalists, and displayed by Russian troops arriving in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina], we could be wrong. It is true that the 
Russian soldiers could not help their hearts (or perhaps they 
could not help the slivovits either, if they made a stop or two 
on the way) and that they too -- surprised, probably, by the 
people applauding them -- gave vent to their religion. However, 
Yeltsin is not a religious convert but a statesman who, 
regardless of the occasional caricatures with which he is 
described in the West, has the old reflex of his predecessors. 
Is the greater-Russian opposition pushing him toward imperial 
waters? Or the military leadership? Or has he himself found 
this way to put Russia back into world politics again? 
Yeltsin's egg is difficult to separate from the Russian chicken. 
  The return of Russia -- provided that it is "neither 
temporary nor accidental," as the best French "Kremlinologists" 
prove -- is radically changing political relations in Europe 
(and the world). Some strategists are jumping the gun in 
declaring "a new era of bipolarity," just like the one before 
the Berlin Wall came down. It is still better to wait: Can 
Russia, if it is not able to follow its imperial pretensions 
economically, be a "world factor" in some other way apar from by 
threatening a global conflict one more time? The latest 
experience from Bosnia induced Paris LE MONDE to speak about 
"the taste of the Cold War." Fortunately, only "the taste," for 
the present leaders in Moscow are far too dependent on Western 
connections to take the ultimate risk. 
  After the "tragic helplessness" throughout "Yugoslav 
crisis," 
Europe can do nothing but admit that it was given a three-year 
free play by the United States to stop the war on its territory, 
but could not do it. It remained a "political dwarf," as it 
does not have the means (the army) to realize its ambitions. 
Gradually, persuaded by Europe (or France) among other things, 
the United States is getting back into Europe, but as the only 
superpower, not just as an ally. Has it, as a tugboat, following 
the logic of the "old situation," pulled Russia along as well? 
A couple of years ago, when Moscow was disoriented, the United 
States would probably not have managed to pull it along, at 
least not so fast and efficiently. The way the "Russian 
phoenix" is rising from the ashes (according to Mrs. D'Encausse, 
the first to predict the collapse of the former empire) shows 
that it has the strength, or thinks that it has. Anyhow, Russia 
is here to save its friends, but also to protect its interests. 
  Does that create a new concept of European balance? One 
concept disintegrated with the fall of the Berlin Wall. How to 
build another one, without making it "a new Yalta"? Can one 
determine the borders of interest of "a new West" and "a new 
East" in the Balkans, for example, since we are talking about 
"Russian interests"? 
  Russia's entry onto the Bosnian scene is, in the eyes of 
many, to do with creating a new balance. Perhaps with creating 
a new division (of interests) as well.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- There are several 
mutually conflicting initiatives at the moment. None of them is 
fully articulated, but it is obvious that the Russian initiative 
is the most serious one as it requires that the issue of the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina be resolved at a summit between the 
major powers, or rather the most responsible powers, Yugoslav 
Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in the 
Hallmark of Time program broadcast on Kragujevac Radio [Serbia]. 
  The fact is, the federal foreign minister said, that there 
is 
no other place that is more suitable nor any other participants 
more competent to take steps toward peace. 
  Commenting on other proposals, and the West's refusal to 
offer support to the Russian initiative, Jovanovic said: "There 
have been some proposals favoring small steps and referring to 
lower level meetings under the pretext that larger steps require 
longer preparation. It is difficult to say whether they are 
only a way to prevent the acceptance of the Russian initiative, 
or whether they are guided by rational reasons. At the moment 
it seems to be more important to prevent the Russian initiative 
than to offer another alternative plan that would be as good and 
as useful."

<F P=106> [By Dusan Radovanovic] </F>
  [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (TANJUG) - A proposal by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin that the United States, Great Britain, 
France, Germany and Russia should gather for a summit on former 
Yugoslavia's crisis has been received in the West with certain 
diplomatic reserves. 
  Using a familiar diplomatic formula that it cannot take a 
stand on the issue because it has not received Moscow's 
"official" proposal, Paris has clearly shown its restraint in 
the matter and thus concealed its reluctance to leave the 
initiative in former Yugoslavia's crisis to Russia. 
  French sources maintain that such a summit would be 
"premature", alleging that the choice of the countries to attend 
the summit is debatable. 
  After all their mediating efforts aimed at resolving former 
Yugoslavia's crisis which have not been very successful so far, 
the European Union believes that it has every right to attend 
the summit. 
  French daily Le Figaro refers to Russia's initiative as 
"spectacular" and goes on to say that its goal is "clear and 
ambitious" and directed to putting even more emphasis on the 
"Dalin aspirations to re-establish its status of the 
indispensable great power." 
  French commentators say Sayosin's undoubtedly successful 
diplomatic initiative around Sarajevo has enabled Russia "to 
take its place (?in) the international [word indistinct]," but 
Moscow, they claim, now insists on "playing the first violin in 
that orchestra." 
  Last week NATO was ready to launch air strikes in the 
Sarajevo area, which was in line with the ultimatum set to 
warring sides in Bosnia, requesting them to demilitarize 
Sarajevo. However, the ultimatum practically referred only to 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  Moscow, which severely critized the ultimatum set by the 
Western military alliance, guaranteed to Bosnian Serbs that 
Russian peacekeepers would be located in a buffer zone between 
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems in the Sarajevo area. It was only 
after they received these guarantees that the Bosnian Serbs 
pulled back their artillery.

  [Text] Belgrade, February 24 (TANJUG) -- In one month's 
time of its implementation, the government's program aimed at 
reconstructing the monetary system and invigorating the economic 
recovery has revived optimism amongst people in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.). 
  The elimination of a hyperinflation is the most obvious 
success of the program makers, awaiting confirmation by official 
statistics for February. Between December 24 and January 24, 
the prices were growing at a rate of two per cent per hour. In 
the past month's time, however, the prices have constantly 
declined. 
  Before the program was enforced, one kilogram of meat sold 
for 50 deutsche marks (DM). Now, however, the price fell to 
around 6 dm (one DM to one dinar). 
  Confronted with shortages of ready money, which can no 
longer 
be obtained from primary issue, the shops and factories opened 
the doors of their storages, re-marketing the articles hitherto 
in short supply. 
  The new dinar superseded the "inflationary dinar," the 
purchasing power of which was next to nil. Old dinar bills, 
denominated in millions and billions, only were the money 
collector's attraction abroad. 
  The convertible new dinar is on a par with the DM, but 
because of the lack of new dinars, German currency circulates at 
the green market and restaurants. Since the foreign currency may 
be bought and sold freely, the government reserves have 
increased by 160 million DM in the past month's time. 
  Bankers announce the return of a variety of credit cards, 
while retailers begin to grant short-term consumer credits. 
These are the signs that inflation has been under control, 
while the value and the purchasing power of the national 
currency has stabilized. 
  The program makers have evidently won the first round in 
eliminating hyperinflation and regaining confidence in the 
national currency. What they face now is the re-start of 
production, the success of which is to determine the future of 
the program. 
  "The F.R.Y. implements this program relying upon itself, 
without any foreign support and under the conditions of economic 
sanctions imposed on it by the U.N. Security Council on May 30, 
1992."

  [Text] Pristina, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK], said today 
that "if the international community recognizes the division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina then the same principles of division along 
ethnic lines will be also valid for Kosovo." 
  At a news conference Rugova said that "what is valid for 
Muslims and Croats must be valid for Albanians as well," 
explaining that the option chosen by the DSK and other Albanian 
political parties was "an independent and neutral Kosovo." This 
option is also the minimum [of Albanian demands] -- nothing less 
than that could be acceptable in the talks with the Serbian 
leadership, he said. This would be a compromise both for the 
Serbs and for the Albanians [as received], he believes. 
  Rugova today denied the existence of "the Defense Ministry 
and other ministries of the Kosovo republic" and called [the 
Serb claims of their existence] "a stage-managed political 
process." He also denied the role of his close aide Anton 
Koljaj in the group, which had been discovered recently, saying 
that these "arrests were organized with the aim of discrediting 
certain personalities and efforts for a peaceful resolution of 
the Kosovo question." 
  Speaking about Boris Yeltsin's latest initiative for a 
summit 
of leading European and U.S. statesmen [on Bosnia], Rugova said 
that this was unnecessary and that "there can be no alternative 
to a global approach to the resolution of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia." 
  "We do not want another Yalta and a reorganization of the 
Balkans into spheres of interest; instead we advocate 
integration processes," Rugova said, and added "Russia's role in 
the Balkans cannot be one-sided, but it must be adapted to the 
international community's principles." 
  Rugova welcomed the signing of the "Partnership" agreement 
between Albanian President Sali Berisha and the NATO alliance, 
describing it as "important for Albanian, all [ethnic] 
Albanians, and for the whole of the Balkans."

  [Text] The trumped-up political trials continue in Kosova. 
The Serbian Court convicted 17 Albanians in Prishtina. They 
were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment. Let us 
follow a report by Leke Musolli: 
  [Musolli] On Thursday, the Serbian Court of Prishtina region 
made up of a jury of five and presided over by Zoran Zavanic 
pronounced the verdicts on a group of 19 Albanians charged with 
collaboration with the intention of hostile activity and 
territorial infringement toward Yugoslavia. The prosecutor gave 
up the indictment against one defendant, while another was set 
apart from the penal procedure for health reasons. Meanwhile, 
17 others were sentenced to a total of 80 years of imprisonment. 
  During this trial, about which numerous remarks were made, 
there were no witnesses at all to support, with even one word, 
the criminal act with which the Albanian defendants were 
charged. That is why we should nevertheless stress that this 
fact itself and the numerous violations of procedure against the 
defendants, both in the prosecutor's office or outside it, 
testify that this trial was completely a trumped-up political 
endeavor to convict as well as compromise the peaceful policy 
that the Albanian people in Kosova are following. 
  We should finally say that during the last 10 days alone, 
the 
Serbian communist justice sentenced 26 Albanians, nine in Peje 
and 17 in Prishtina, to a total of 120 years of imprisonment, 
something which testifies to the brutality and banality of a 
regime which denounces even the silent thought of Albanians.

Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk; place and date not given: "The 
Polish Minister of Defense: `Partnership for Peace Is Less Than 
I Expected...'"] 
  [Text] In an interview granted to ROMPRES national news 
agency, Polish Minister of Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk said, in 
connection with his country's participation in the "Partnership 
for Peace" [PFP] initiative and NATO integration: 
  "The PFP concept is less than I expected, but it also 
represents an essential step in an adequate direction. It is 
the beginning of the road to the aim pursued, namely to a 
European security system. We are counting on mutual contacts 
between the Polish Army and the armies of the NATO countries and 
we favor joint maneuvers; for the time being, at the lowest 
tactical levels. We are trying in various ways to become 
acquainted with and get used to each other. In this sense, we 
are creating numerous opportunities, the West is doing the same, 
and this inspires us with moderate optimism." 
  In connection with the stage of Polish-Romanian military 
relations and their development, the Polish defense minister 
said: 
  "Were we to check the history of the two peoples, we would 
find numerous elements of friendship, fruitful cultural 
contacts, economic, and, of course, military cooperation. Now, 
we are jointly solving problems linked to higher military 
training and improving cooperation between our topographical 
services and in the area of health care. We are relying on 
technical cooperation. The access by our two countries to the 
PFP initiative is opening up new opportunities for cooperation."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Janina </F>
Paradowska and Jerzy Baczynski; place and date not given: 
"Sometimes It Is Better Not To Say Anything"] 
  [Text] [POLITYKA] How has the problem inside the coalition 
been solved? The communique from the talks does not say much 
except that the coalition wants to sit out its full 
parliamentary term. But how? What was decided? 
  [Pawlak] The confusion was largely the result of automatic 
processes. There was no tension among the politicians, but 
people on the outside thought there was a major problem. This 
might be just my own private view, but I think that if less 
publicity had been given to this business, the outcome might 
have been different. 
  [POLITYKA] Might Deputy Prime Minister Borowski have kept 
his job? 
  [Pawlak] Quite possibly. In politics one has to watch one's 
actions. I am frequently accused of being too quiet and having 
poor relations with the media, but I think that sometimes it is 
safer to be quiet than to say one word too much. Our partners 
simply do not have an easy way out. The Middle East accord 
might never have happened if the talks had not taken place in 
Norway, far from journalists. 
  [POLITYKA] But we still do not know why you fired Deputy 
Minister Kawalec in such a way. 
  [Pawlak] We discussed this matter with the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] when the coalition was formed, so it cannot have 
come as a surprise. What happened was this. I sent Deputy 
Prime Minister Borowski his notice to quit. He refused to 
accept it, so I delivered it personally. I fail to see what 
this has to do with later events. Later, Borowski's dismissal 
was given such prominent media treatment that it was difficult 
to shut one's eyes and pretend nothing had happened. I decided 
that the best thing to do was to explain everything and put the 
whole issue behind me. The decision to dismiss Mr. Borowski was 
not an easy and pleasant one either for Mr. Borowski or for me. 
But that is how things are in politics. Sometimes, one is on 
one side of the barricade, and sometimes on the other. The most 
important thing is to have cooperation. 
  [POLITYKA] You did not expect Kawalec's dismissal to cause 
such an avalanche? 
  [Pawlak] No. I think the significance of the matter has 
been exaggerated. But I do not shun responsibility. I realize 
it might be the result of my own actions, but I think that each 
political group should ask itself whether such an end result 
really had to come about. 
  [POLITYKA] Not just Deputy Prime Minister Borowski, but also 
the SLD wanted to tidy up the rules governing cooperation with 
the the coalition, the functioning of the Council of Ministers, 
personnel policy, and a curb on the powers of the chief of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers. 
  [Pawlak] I have never heard that the powers of the chief of 
the Office of the Council of Ministers should be curbed. 
  [POLITYKA] But we have. The SLD has spoken out loudly about 
it. 
  [Pawlak] Be that as it may, but we have never discussed this 
at the coalition forum. You see what happens when people gossip 
in public? Misunderstandings occur. 
  [POLITYKA] We understand that other postulates have been 
presented to you. So what have you decided? 
  [Pawlak] I think the communique presents quite clearly the 
compromise that was reached. Basically, we decided that 
government issues would be discussed and resolved at government 
level, and coalition issues at coalition level. There must be a 
clear distinction between the government and the coalition. As 
far as the functioning of the government is concerned, I realize 
that there are many discrepancies. Soon after I became prime 
minister we entered a difficult period, for we had to work out a 
budget, after which the Sejm Committee debates started. This 
prevented me from taking a closer look at administrative 
procedures and the entire administrative system. Our 
administration may function far more efficiently if it tidies 
itself up. A central office or ministry, and even a provincial 
office, sometimes functions according to its own principles. 
Some operations are common to all administrative units, such as 
book-keeping, organization, and communications, but often there 
is no comparison between the way one office performs them and 
the way another does. Such problems occur in every office, and 
yet the administration must be functional. 
  [POLITYKA] But let us return to the crisis and the solving 
thereof. Are we to understand that the SLD has accepted your 
personnel policy, for example your changes to governor posts? 
Aleksander Kwasniewski has accused you of nepotism. 
  [Pawlak] That is not true. There are just as many Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] governors as there are SLD governors. 
  [POLITYKA] No. Almost every single governor belongs to the 
PSL. 
  [Pawlak] As fare as deputy governors are concerned, there is 
a difference. Deputy goverors are appointed by the prime 
minister, but at the governors' recommendation. So I have no 
influence on whether a candidate for deputy governor belongs to 
the PSL or SLD. 
  [POLITYKA] So PSL people are not hungry for posts? We 
thought they were. 
  [Pawlak] There was a time when we never discussed posts. It 
was one of the coalition partners who announced the need to 
replace a few governors and deputy ministers. You did not know 
that. In the United States, nobody objects when a new president 
comes into office and the entire administration is replaced top 
to bottom. No one talks about nepotism. 
  [POLITYKA] We believe that today in Poland, the policy is 
to adopt any kind of system, as long as it works. Right now 
everything is geared toward a certain political model. 
  [Pawlak] No, we are not pursuing a personnel policy that is 
geared toward any political model. Some old employees have 
remained, and others have left. During this time of change, it 
is important not to create the impression that we are writing 
off people immediately because of their party membership or 
political convictions. That way, we would lose qualified 
people. But there are changes, there have to be. If we want 
politics to undergo at least a slight change, then we must 
replace some personnel. 
  [POLITYKA] You said that government issues should be kept 
distinct from coalition issues. But such a distinction is 
impossible. The government has been formed by a specific 
coalition, and the government's operation is governed by the 
coalition pact. Is this pact still in force? 
  [Pawlak] In every coalition, key issues should be governed 
by agreements. However, the members of the government should 
have freedom of action. When we talk of a violation of 
agreements, am I the only one who violates them? I am not going 
to tell you about all the surprise moves that have taken me 
unawares, because that is an internal government matter. These 
matters must be set in order, there is no doubt about that. 
  [POLITYKA] The sequence of events was as follows: First 
there was a personnel dispute, the SLD turned it into a dispute 
concerning authority, and you interpreted this as a political 
dispute concerning differences in the assessment of economic 
policy. How differently from each other do the SLD and PSL view 
economic policy? 
  [Pawlak] Differences occur not just between the parties that 
form the coalition. They also occur within a particular party, 
in the SLD and in the PSL. But the general path of reform 
pursued since 1989 is not being questioned by anyone. We are 
all committed to democracy and a free market. The problem is 
what kind of solutions we apply, what kind of economic processes 
we set in motion, and how we handle privatization. And last but 
not least, the speed of these changes is also significant. 
  [POLITYKA] Differences between parties are rather hazy, we 
find it hard to accept that there are no strong groups that 
question the basic path of reforms. There is no doubt that in 
the eyes of the West, Marek Borowski and the SLD have become the 
main guarantors of continuing the reforms. 
  [Pawlak] You are thinking in socialist terms. You make it 
sound as if this party is guaranteeing the chosen path of the 
reforms. This reminds us of the past when, in addition, this 
guarantee was enshrined in the Constitution. By the way, I 
remember people saying in September and October that democracy 
and the market changes might be in danger if the SLD and PSL won 
the elections. But when I was in Brussels, I had the impression 
that my interlocutors were not so much interested in my party 
affiliation as in my policies and actions. In Brussels they 
were not interested in noble declarations that we want to join 
NATO as quickly as possible. They were interested in the 
practical measures that we were implementing in order to reach 
that objective. For the West and for out own society, effective 
solutions are the best guarantees, and no single person or party 
has exclusivbe rights to them. We must also be flexible and 
revise our opinions from time to time. One could have taken an 
easier path and drawn up a better budget, better from the point 
of view of accountancy, a budget with secure income and low 
expenditure. But would the economy and the population have 
withstood it? If we say that there is a general and firm desire 
to build a market economy and democratic system, we have to know 
that there are other paths that lead to this goal. 
  [POLITYKA] So, along what path do you and your government 
want to lead us? 
  [Pawlak] First, we have to establish what our main problems 
are, and there is no doubt that such problems are the drop in 
production and the sky-high increase in unemployment. Last year 
we experienced economic growth. In order to continue it this 
year, given society's present standards of living, we must on 
the one hand concentrate on expanding the domestic market, and 
on the other hand increase exports of our products. We have 
been experiencing an increasing trade deficit in recent years. 
Poland, a poor country, has become an exporter of capital. 
This problem requires very precise actions, which is why from 
the very beginning my government has been laying emphasis not 
just on security, but on economic issues, and saying all the 
time how important it is to have a trade balance. The accords 
that we have concluded with the European Union contain an 
imbalance in our favor, but in financial practice the situation 
is quite the opposite, because various non-tariff barriers are 
being applied. 
  We propose concrete solutions to revive the domestic market. 
It is true that budget requirements necessitate an increase in 
taxation, but we are increasing the tax on private incomes, and 
not on the profits of firms. We have also introduced a system 
of concessions for investment. I am not saying this system is 
perfect and that everyone will reap benefits from it, but those 
with profitable enterprises can allocate income for investment 
purposes. One can also take a look at the solutions applied in 
other countries. The general principle of buying Polish goods 
before other goods is not recognized by our media, and yet that 
would be the best way to help our economy. Of course, our 
Polish products do not always match our wishes, but prosperous 
countries also promote their own products. Therefore we have 
undertaken concrete activity to point the economic processes in 
a slightly different direction. We have not made a 180-degree 
turn, there is no need to do so, but nevertheless we are clearly 
altering the method of implementing the reforms. 
  [POLITYKA] I think most people, including opposition 
politicians, will agree with what you have just said, but in 
your last television interview you said that the budget must be 
made more socially friendly, and people think that that means 
increasing consumption. 
  [Pawlak] Surely investment projects and the creation of new 
jobs are socially friendly activities? I repeat, one can 
restrict oneself to activities that provide an easy budget. But 
the point is not to have a budget that is easy for the 
accountants to manage, but to have one that provides social and 
economic effects. 
  [POLITYKA] One can have a budget that is financially easy, 
and one can have a budget that is politically easy. A 
financially easy budget is usually politically difficult. The 
present budget has not been badly received, but people have the 
impression that you and some of the parties oppose it, and that 
you would prefer a politically easier budget. 
  [Pawlak] It is difficult for me to explain away people's 
impressions. As I said, there are even differences inside each 
party. But when a budget is drawn up and certain financial 
proportions are proposed, the final version is never the only 
correct one. The present draft budget was drawn up at the end 
of December, so there are going to be adjustments to it. But 
its basic financial proportions will not be touched. The Sejm 
committees have indicated the possibility of changes in 
spending, and it has transpired that last year's budget deficit 
was less than expected. So changes are possible. Not major 
ones, but important all the same. 
  [POLITYKA] So a socially friendly budget does not mean 
greater spending on social benefits, pensions, and subsidies? 
  [Pawlak] Of course it does, but it means more than just 
that. 
  [POLITYKA] Today you are facing a picket of miners outside 
your offices, and a great Solidarity strike. Do you not feel 
that the state should abandon its role as entrepreneur? 
  [Pawlak] That is our aim. We want the chairmen of 
enterprise management boards to decide how their enterprises 
should be managed, because these are people who concentrate on 
economic matters. Some old habits have to be eliminated, such 
as the habit of writing to the prime minister when there is a 
problem about an enterprise's functioning, instead of solving 
the problem at management level or provincial level. But 
generally speaking, it is far easier to say we want a free 
market and democracy than to bring these things about in 
practice. One really needs a lot of ideas to dispense with old 
habits. But I think there is a chance of success. For example, 
in neglected areas, we can introduce modern technology 
immediately. If the Poles could not get used to the industrial 
age because the idea of working on an assembly line and 
producing the same piece of equipment for eight hours was alien 
to them, they will certainly have to do so now that we are in a 
difficult situation, with a recession in Poland and the West, 
and we have to seek new ideas and solutions everywhere. 
  Every country and society is struggling to achieve a good 
position. We still have to learn how to play this game, and to 
play it together with others. In Poland, the situation is still 
similar to that of two farmers, one of whom has one cow, and the 
other has five, and the farmer with only one cow, instead of 
praying for another four cows, prays that four cows belonging to 
the other farmer will drop dead. This is part of our mentality, 
and it is worth pondering over this.

  [Text] Croatia's Foreign Minister Mate Granic has called 
for continuing dialogue in order to find a lasting solution to 
the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Granic told the 
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva that 
negotiations were the only way to end the war and find a 
political settlement to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  However Granic, who is also deputy prime minister, made no 
reference to Wednesday's statement by ethnic Croatians in Bosnia 
that they were willing to consider a union with Bosnia's 
Muslims. Croatians and Muslims in Bosnia have agreed a 
cease-fire, which comes into effect at midday on Friday.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, Feb 24 (TANJUG) -- Croatian Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic on Thursday made an unconvincing 
attempt to absolve Zagreb from responsibility and attribute it 
to the Serbs. 
  Without denying that the Serbs' humanitarian rights have 
been 
violated on a large scale in Croatia, as confirmed in the latest 
reports by the U.N. special rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki and 
the U.S. State Department, in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, Granic attempted to find an excuse in 
saying that "Serb armed forces still hold one-third of the 
Croatian territory." 
  Granic said that human rights have been violated as 6,900 
people had been killed, 26,000 others wounded and 7,600 people 
perished in war (which broke out following Croatia's violent 
secession from former Yugoslavia), and that there were currently 
some 550,000 refugees and displaced people in Croatia. 
  Granic, however, failed to explain what this had in common 
with mass evictions of Serbs from their homes, with destruction 
of their property, with discharging them, and especially with 
banning the non-Croat children to attend classes, all of these 
listed in Mazowiecki's report as drastic examples of violation 
of human rights. 
  International humanitarian organizations, including the 
Croatian Helsinki Committee for the Protection of Human Rights, 
have warned intermittently that these actions spurred on ethnic 
cleansing campaigns against the Serbs, 300,000 of them already 
expelled from Croatia. This was why 10,000 Serb houses have 
been blown up and scores of Christian Orthodox churches 
destroyed in Croatia. 
  Granic assessed that the normalisation of relations with 
"the 
Serb minority in Croatia, especially in the U.N. protected 
areas" was "a key to stability in the area and in overall 
Croatian-Serb relations," and threatened in a familiar way that 
there should be no delusions that the Croatian Government would 
negotiate Croatia's territorial integrity. 
  In 1991, Serbs in Croatia proclaimed the Republic of Serb 
Krajina (R.S.K.), now a U.N. protected area, within their ethnic 
and historic territory in response to Croatia's violent 
secession from the former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce 
their status to that of a national minority. 
  Serbs in Croatia also decided to take such a step because 
they were afraid of a relapse of the genocide committed against 
them in World War Two, when in the Nazi puppet "independent 
state of Croatia," more than a million Serb civilians had been 
killed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by </F>
correspondent Michal Tvarozek in Bratislava on 24 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Tvarozek] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, has the 
foreign minister's resignation influenced the decision you are 
making? 
  [Kovac] We discussed this matter with each other and reached 
the same conclusion: that it was necessary to make it easier for 
the president to make a decision about our dismissal from the 
cabinet, because if we do not make it easier for him, the 
confrontation between the castle and the cabinet might grow more 
serious. We do not see any sense in this. Both of us entered 
political life with the intention of seeking a consensus and a 
certain moderate attitude. If we continue to insist on our 
original stance, we think we would be betraying these principles. 
  [Tvarozek] Does this mean that you are also submitting your 
resignation? 
  [Kovac] Yes, I am. I am going to see the president tomorrow 
to submit my resignation. 
  [Tvarozek] A short while ago, you said--it was in this 
room-- 
that it would mean that you had admitted your own mistakes if 
you resigned. 
  [Kovac] I insist that I have not made any mistakes great 
enough for me to leave the government because of them. This 
means that I insist that I have performed my work according to 
my abilities, and I am not convinced that I have performed 
badly. Despite this, I think that this step is necessary in the 
interests of calming down the situation in Slovakia. There is 
no point in increasing tension. 
  [Tvarozek] Is this not, for example, caused by the situation 
in the government being such that a new political entity--if we 
may call it that--would obstruct the government line and the 
program that the government has planned? 
  [Kovac] I am not altogether convinced that it is because of 
this. I truly think that a government in which the prime 
minister cannot cooperate with his deputy prime minister because 
the former proposed that the latter resign--thereby, in effect, 
demonstrating that he cannot cooperate--I would find it very 
difficult to work in such a government if I stayed in my post. 
  If a political entity comes into being, it will be a 
political entity that is based on the program principles that 
were declared by the Movement [for a Democratic Slovakia], but 
which could not be fulfilled. 
  [Tvarozek] Are your further ambitions of a political or a 
professional nature? 
  [Kovac] It is very difficult to give up responsibility for 
political development. I did not enter into top-level politics 
but into trade union politics and then transferred to so-called 
top-level politics. Because I entered political life, I had the 
duty to represent the views of a certain group of people, the 
people who elected me, the citizens who believed me. This was 
expressed in very beautiful letters, for which I thank the 
people who have morally supported me in this situation. I think 
that it would be irresponsible toward them to leave the 
political scene completely. 
  [Tvarozek] Let us decipher this: Do you plan to establish a 
new political entity? 
  [Kovac] I am considering this possibility.

  [Text] Colonel Bill Aikman, representative of the UN

had come under attack three times yesterday, once near Visoko 
and twice near Gornji Vakuf. He accused the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] of attacking convoys near Gornji Vakuf. On 
both occasions British troops escorting the convoys returned 
fire on the HVO positions, silencing the attackers. No 
casualties or serious damage was inflicted on the convoys. 
  The UN soldiers could not say with certainty who attacked 
the 
convoy on the Kiseljak-Visoko road, so they did not return fire, 
Colonel Aikman said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 24 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, and Fikret Abdic, the 
president of the autonomous province of western Bosnia, signed 
an agreement on guaranteeing peace along all borders and lines 
of separation. The agreement was signed in Belgrade today 
through the mediation of the President of Serbia Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
  The agreement was signed on the basis of a mutual commitment 
to restoring peace throughout the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, and in line with the 
Belgrade declaration of 22 October 1993, a statement says. 
  The text of the agreement is: 
  -- Peace is guaranteed along all borders of the autonomous 
province of Western Bosnia and the Srpska republic, along the 
entire line of separation between the forces of the autonomous 
province of Western Bosnia and the Srpska republic army, without 
exception. 
  When units of the national defense of the autonomous 
province 
of Western Bosnia are deployed on the section of the front from 
where the Fifth Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army launches 
military actions against the Srpska republic army, permanent 
peace will immediately be established in this remaining sector 
of the front too. 
  -- Liaison officers, responsible for preventing incidents, 
have been appointed in all sectors on the line of separation 
between the forces of the autonomous province of Western Bosnia 
and the Srpska republic army. 
  -- The governments of the autonomous province of Western 
Bosnia and the Srpska republic will jointly provide conditions 
and undertake measures to enable communications links, traffic, 
and commerce between the autonomous province of Western Bosnia 
and the Srpska republic. 
  -- Borders between the autonomous province of Western Bosnia 
and the Srpska republic will be defined in line with the 
Belgrade declaration, and exclusively between the legal bodies 
of the autonomous province of Western Bosnia and the Srpska 
republic.

  [Text] At Victoria Palace today Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu and other representatives of the executive held a 
meeting with seven leaders of the CNSLR [National Confederation 
of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Fratia Trade Union Confederation 
intended to further discuss the 14 union demands. 
  After the conclusion of the talks Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu made a statement to the press in which he reviewed 
yesterday's and today's meetings with the trade union 
confederations, saying that each of those demands has been 
examined separately. The premier said that many of them refer 
to issues for which there are no financial resources, whereas 
others are in connection with the problems of the economic 
reform and the 1993-1994 program for economic restructuring and 
privatization, whereas other demands lack realism. Some of the 
demands have nothing to do with the unions' activity, the 
Romanian prime minister assessed adding that those claims pursue 
other goals. 
  Vacaroiu also mentioned the fact that issues related to 
social protection were also approached, especially the ensuring 
from the state budget of the necessary funds to improve the 
standard of living of employees working in the public sector. 
In that context the premier expressed his hope that by the end 
of this year the standard of living will increase to a certain 
extent, but the essential prerequisite of that is the increase 
of production. 
  The prime minister concluded his statement by saying that 
interruptions of work lead to considerable losses in the 
national economy. 
  In turn, the chairman of CNSLR-Fratia, Mr. Victor Ciorbea, 
stated that the majority of their claims date back four to 13 
months, and they have still not been settled, whereas in the 
case of certain demands the solutions that were found have not 
been applied. During today's meeting they agreed that 
negotiations should be continued between CNSLR--Fratia and the 
government intended to settle the 14 demands forwarded to the 
government by the union confederation. 
  Ciorbea also pointed out that none of the claims was settled 
during today's meeting, and, as a consequence of this, the 
general strike on 28 February will take place as scheduled. 
  Today we were sent via fax the decision adopted by the 
National Council of the National Trade Union Bloc [BNS] in 
connection with the continuation of their labor actions. The 
text outlines the fact that BNS continued its efforts to 
conclude an economic-social pact, provided the signatory partner 
is a credible and generally accepted executive. The document 
also says that after taking note of the state power's refusal to 
cooperate with BNS in order to extinguish the current conflict, 
as well as of its refusal to answer the suggestions forwarded to 
it by that union confederation, the BNS National Council decided 
to continue the labor conflict against the government that was 
begun on 10 January last year. 
  The document also points out that in order to avoid making 
the same mistakes that were previously made by Romania's trade 
unions, the BNS National Council decided to commence ample 
actions to mobilize basic union structures and to organize a 
national referendum intended to establish the opportunity, 
viability, and the concrete schedule of the continuation and 
implementation of the labor actions that were begun on 29 
November 1993.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roman Latkovic: "Dumb Gambler Playing </F>
Roulette"] 
  [Text] If a miracle happens and NATO really gets going, on 
the expiration of the 10th day of the ultimatum for the Serbs -- 
who have been killing both Sarajevo and its inhabitants (and 
thousands of other innocent victims who are not "fortunate" 
enough to be in front of television cameras) for almost two 
years, not fearing that they will be punished -- those couple of 
hours necessary for Western state-of-the-art airplanes to 
destroy "possible 200 to 300 targets," will finally show that 
"the big world" has been participating in the crimes that Serbia 
has committed in this unfortunate land of ours. For the 
potentates of this world have been silent, silent in deed, while 
Vukovar was dying, Dubrovnik bleeding, and no one did anything 
to save Nustar and Dalj, Skrabrnja and Bjeljina, Mostar and 
Zadar, Karlovac and Gospic. Belgrade fascists -- who call upon 
us on the occasion of "normalization" of relations, while their 
mines and chetniks still kill our people -- have done so much 
evil and aroused so much hatred, soaked our land with so much 
blood and suffering. They had a free hand to "calm" former 
Yugoslavia and tailor-make it for values of the outdated world 
system, whether a "new" one or suddenly an "old" one, and since 
they cannot stop, as with every other fascism, for their evil is 
their sustenance, their evil that lives on other people's 
happiness and lives, perhaps, only perhaps, the time has come to 
stop them. [sentence as published] 
  And that is why this "ultimatum" to the Serbs, in spite of 
all the diplomatic negotiations, games, and child's play of the 
poor world politics that never had an ounce of morality, is an 
attempt to stop the horror that brings unease through television 
to happier homes all over the world. And since it is clear to 
everybody that we cannot even dream of procedures like putting 
Great Britain on trial for assisting the genocide 
(Bosnia-Herzegovina accused Britain on those grounds), and we 
can therefore not expect to see potentates "of the big world" 
put on trial, those who only brought shame upon themselves and 
their countries by talking much without saying anything, while 
hundreds of thousands of innocent people were injured or killed 
throughout former Yugoslavia (except in Serbia, of course), but 
ONE MUST insist on putting on trial, in a new Nuremberg or 
Tokyo, those who are directly responsible for the war and the 
horror they arranged. 
<H5>  The Mud of Common Destruction </H5>
  If this world wants a future in which, for example, 
Zhirinovskiy will not be a threat, in contrast to a future that, 
for the time being, seems to be controlled by people like 
Milosevic, Husayn, Karadzic, al-Qadhdhafi... then we must do 
everything to radically change the relations that rule the world 
today. The victims of the new fascism in the middle of Europe, 
and Croatia was the first, must provide the nucleus from which a 
new understanding of the future will originate. We will never 
be able to arbitrate like a Bill Clinton or a Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and really influence global relations. But small 
as we are, we have an enormous strength as a VICTIM (never mind 
the fact that, due to Tudjman's politics, we have almost been 
put in the same basket with the aggressor and gambled away our 
victim status like a dumb gambler playing roulette) and the 
strength of justice that is on our side. Fascists like Slobodan 
Milosevic, madmen like Radovan Karadzic, or mass murderers like 
Ratko Mladic must not be put in a position where other people 
will listen to what they have to say. Except in the dock during 
a fair trial -- that incredible advantage that not a single 
inhabitant of Vukovar, Sarajevo, or any other miserable person 
from Josip Jovic onward, did not have. The future of the world, 
with its interdependence that gives us the chance to snicker at 
the black U.S. soldier who "took a spill" when disembarking in 
Somalia and a chance for the French political public to again 
"shudder with indignation" at the latest massacre in Sarajevo, 
is not a future that can guarantee peace and progress if 
fascists go unpunished. The appearance of Zhirinovskiy, the 
voracity of Belgrade's greater Serbian madness, the possible 
blood-lust of "mother Russia" for Belarus and other parts of the 
former Soviet Union (even the "democratic" favorite of the West, 
Boris Yeltsin, used tanks to destroy his parliament in the name 
of that very same "democracy"), the starvation in Africa, the 
silence of China, and the latent Latin-American timebomb -- are 
a part of the same evil potential that can crush us down into 
the mud of common destruction. 

<H5>    Serbia -- Infectious Patient </H5>
  Croatia must be changed (both its political map and the 
people who created it, with a shame that should not be shared) 
and the time has come when it is perhaps discernible that the 
brutal killing and exile of people who have no way to protect 
themselves will not be tolerated indefinitely; Croatia must be 
the part of the "crisis" on the territory of former Yugoslavia 
that, as an active factor, will stand on firm foundations 
defending human dignity! Human rights, freedom, the 
immutability of borders, not permitting the legalization of 
"ethnic cleansing" (the most horrible conceivable genocide in 
which the euphemism "cleansing" is no less horrible, as if it 
were "Dash" or "Ariel" [laundry detergents] and not slaughter 
and destruction), and punishing the guilty are principles one 
MUST insist on if we want to break a deadlock that permits the 
killing of civilians. The road is clear. 
  Serbia must be further and fully isolated, as every 
infectious patient is. NATO or some other force should be 
deployed along its borders (even the token contingent of 300 
U.S. soldiers have been an effective protection for Macedonia; 
the Seseljs and Arkans of the Serbian madness can enjoy 
themselves destroying defenseless towns and civilians, just as 
every other coward does, but it is unlikely that they would dare 
to attack the representatives of the world's only real military 
force), its military potential must be destroyed, its exports 
and weapons production must be banned for at least another 
century, a protectorate over Serbia must be introduced, 
Milosevic (and Cosic, and the members of SANU [Serbian Academy 
of Sciences and Arts], and Karadzic, and Arkan, and their ilk -- 
there are masses of them...) must be put on trial, and only 
then, by opening up the media and "normalizing" its inner life, 
making space for a germ of democracy, we can help that country. 
It must first repent and pay for its sins and then be given the 
opportunity to change. And to become democratic. To sober up 
from its Serbian-ness, from our sea, from Zadar, Plitivice, 
Vukovar, from all those "Serbian republics" and to start living 
a dignified life. 
<H5>  Resembling Its Enemy </H5>
  Until then, there will be no happiness. The present Serbia, 
the fascist monster made of crime, the chetnik movement, and the 
plunderers, will do everything to survive, and in that -- in 
addition to some ambiguous statements, to say the least, of some 
minor Russian personalities -- it is helped by this kind of 
Croatian politics. THERE IS NO "normalization" of relations 
with fascism, and THERE SHOULD BE NO "normalization" when the 
rope around the neck of that fascism is tightening still. For, 
no matter what the "big world" is doing and regardless of the 
extent of vested interests at stake, interests that tacitly 
support Serbian crimes, those crimes will not stop. Too much 
blood has spilt across the borders of Europe and the world, and 
there is too much blood on the hands of all those Milosevics to 
be able to tighten the rope without getting blood on our hands 
too -- whether we "normalize" relations or not. 
  While Serbia is breaking down in misery and moral decay, and 
while its only strength is the strength of its weapons (which it 
keeps using against us, taking the whole world for a ride, the 
world that swore "Never again!" when it was punishing fascists), 
while there are sanctions and while, for the first time, it is 
being seriously threatened, Serbia does not deserve anything 
else but for us to work for its final defeat. 
  That country lost this war long time ago. On human, moral, 
ethical, military grounds, if you will. And all it has 
"conquered" are charred remnants of bloodshed and houses and 
they mirror its chetnik fascism perfectly. Croatia, as its 
first victim, and therefore historically responsible for the 
outcome of our "crisis," must not look in that mirror and see 
that it resembles its enemy. Croatia must regain its allies, be 
it the Bosnians, the Albanians, the Germans, it does not matter, 
by re-establishing just relations on which future good 
neighborly relations with Serbia will be founded. There will be 
no justice and happiness if we contribute to Milosevic's 
"conference-making" in Geneva, etc., instead of in Nuremberg, 
and, to save the best for last, round off the journey Milosevic,

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jezsensky by </F>
Cristina Lopez Schlichting in Madrid; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Lopez] As neighbors of the 
Balkans, you have a sword of Damocles hanging over your heads. 
Last year, you were talking about the threat of the war 
spreading to Vojvodina -- the Serbian region where a large part 
of the population is Hungarian. Do you believe that this 
eventuality is closer? 
  [Jezsensky] No, fortunately; partly thanks to our careful 
moves and partly also because Belgrade has now won through war 
what it wanted and is now interested in consolidating and wants 
no more problems. The defeat of the most extremist Serbian 
groups in the last elections must also be taken into account. 
It is true that the Hungarians of Voivodina remain innocent 
victims of the economic embargo and that they are harassed by 
certain sections of the population -- especially Serbian 
refugees from Bosnia and Croatia -- who are pressing them to 
leave, but we have detected in Belgrade signs in favor of 
granting this minority a certain cultural autonomy. 
  [Lopez] Around you, there is almost frantic diplomatic 
activity between Romania, Serbia, and Greece. Do you not feel 
isolated? 
  [Jezsensky] The three nations are Orthodox and share common 
-- Byzantine -- cultural roots, but it would be dangerous to see 
these moves as the beginning of a division between the Catholic 
and Orthodox cultural worlds in the area. It is true that 
Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia share a rejection of the Hungarian 
minorities' desire for autonomy, and that Greece and Romania 
vigorously supported Serbia at the worst point in the Balkans 
crisis, but I believe that the mutual rapprochement now is due 
more to a desire to end the Balkans conflict and to maintain an 
economic route to the West through Yugoslavia or Romania. 
  [Lopez] Hungary has just joined the Partnership for Peace. 
To what extent do you feel protected by this intermediate course 
between NATO and nothing? 
  [Jezsensky] We have always made it clear that our intention 
is to join NATO; from this viewpoint, we disagree with 
Partnership for Peace, but at the same time we understand the 
efforts of Europe and the United States to reassure Russia. 
Moreover, the Partnership is much more than we initially 
believed. In fact, NATO's future expansion has been accepted, 
and we are being allowed to prepare for later membership. We 
will take the opportunity. 
  [Lopez] I recall that you used to be very much in favor of 
strengthening the CSCE.... 
  [Jezsensky] The CSCE is too uncoordinated. Its members are 
too numerous, and some of them are not actually European or, 
unfortunately, stable. The CSCE has shown itself unable to 
resolve the Balkans conflict. It has noble aims, but it is too 
large to guarantee European security. To some extent, when 
thinking about the CSCE, I recall Stalin's remark about the 
pope. How many divisions does he have? The CSCE has no 
divisions, but NATO does. That is why NATO is effective. 
  [Lopez] Speaking of effectiveness, NATO has just taken an 
initiative. What will become of this current ultimatum? 
  [Jezsensky] An ultimatum is a threat in order to try to 
secure something. It must be backed up by credible strength but 
also by common sense. NATO has this strength, and I believe 
that the Serbs will not venture to repeat their contempt of the 
ultimatum which was delivered in 1914. At least, Belgrade does 
not seem inclined to do so, and although everything depends on 
the Bosnian Serbs, I hope that they will withdraw and carry out 
what is being demanded, but I also hope that, even if they do 
not do so completely, NATO will not find itself obliged to 
intervene. Peace is the responsibility of all the parties 
involved. Responsibility for the origin of the war is a matter 
for an international court and history, but the most important 
thing now is to secure peace, even at the cost of not achieving 
everything that is demanded. The alternative is mutual 
annihilation. 

<H5>    Feel Nostalgia for Stalin </H5>
  [Lopez] The Russian scene has changed substantially with the 
rise of opposition leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. What is 
Hungary's stance on this change of scene? 
  [Jezsensky] Look, Zhirinovskiy does not alarm me personally 
or Hungary. What does alarm me is Europe's not taking him 
seriously. Although there is no exact parallel, it must be 
recalled that Hitler was not taken seriously, either. The 
Russian people feel that they have lost an empire. They were 
told for decades that everybody loved Russia because it provided 
security. Now, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they 
find themselves abandoned by everybody and plunged into poverty. 
The West has done a great deal, but it must do more. It must 
help seek an economic solution and show them the advantages of 
the free market and democracy; help them understand, as was done 
with Germany and Japan after World War II, the evilness of the 
regimes which were left behind. If the Russians do not see an 
improvement in their immediate situation, they will feel 
nostalgia for Stalin. They will forget the 50 million dead but 
remember the price of bread when he was alive. Zhirinovskiy 
cannot be understood outside the Russian situation. That is why 
it is imperative to support the minority who see Russia's future 
in Europe and who, unfortunately for everybody, did not fare 
well in the last elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Joseph </F>
Pozsgai; place and date not given: "We Need Calm"] 
  [Text] [Pozsgai] What are the chances of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], the leading party of the government 
coalition, of keeping its position at the parliamentary 
elections in May? 
  [Boross] I cannot give you a percentage. I believe that it 
has a chance -- undoubtedly, after a series of unpopular 
measures. A question mark always hangs over a chance like this. 
However, it is certain that the public view of the MDF has 
improved. This is, somewhat, also supported by the economic 
situation and the hopes based on this, therefore, if this 
continues, we might reach a better result in May than has 
previously been predicted by many people. 
  [Pozsgai] Can you expect a strong shift to the left in 
Parliament as happened in Poland, Lithuania, and Russia? 
  [Boross] Certainly not as strong, in my view. In addition, 
the left wing is rather divided. Certain coalition versions 
exist on the left wing but, I dare say, I do not think this will 
actually happen when the time comes. Hungary does not have a 
party that is so clearly committed to the successor party that 
it would also be suitable for coalition. As far as I can see, 
some of its members would welcome this, while other would not. 
Therefore, the Polish analogy does not apply to us. In the 
meantime, we also have to consider that the non-compliance with 
left-wing needs has its consequences in Poland and the Hungarian 
public is informed about this through television. 
  [Pozsgai] In 1993, we received unfavorable economic news 
from Hungary: Export reduction, agricultural decline, and the 
continuation of a restrictive monetary policy that reduces 
production, demand, and thus state revenue. It is self-evident 
that this monetary policy leads to further increases in the 
state's foreign debts. What is the justification for continuing 
this economic policy? 
  [Boross] In my view, the Hungarian monetary policy is not 
restrictive. This statement is certainly not true. Anyone who 
is familiar with the Hungarian economic conditions knows very 
well that Hungary is forced to be part of international trade. 
The ratio of exports and imports in the Hungarian economy is 
extremely high. The problem arose mainly from the fact that the 
Western economic recession induced reduced demand for Hungarian 
export products, and the often mentioned motor of Europe, 
Germany, did not show its best side with its economic growth 
being around zero percent instead of being higher. Evidently, 
all this is supplemented by the fact that we convert the economy 
at a certain speed and this is impossible without temporary 
losses, including the uneconomic export bases. 
  [Pozsgai] If the European Union continues to refuse the 
increase of imports from Eastern Europe, would it not be 
possible at least for the "Visegrad countries" to create a 
"common market" for themselves the way the six Western European 
countries began to set up the EEC in 1957? This could even 
accelerate gaining membership of NATO. 
  [Boross] Those were six developed West-European countries 
with very well developed economies. We once were part of a bloc 
based on an undeveloped economic basis, which destroyed the 
Hungarian economy. All Visegrad countries are in a state of 
change. Therefore, it is in their vital interests that they not 
only coordinate affairs between themselves (where, of course, 
practical relations do exist that have to be used and even 
improved), but they also adjust to the most developed region of 
the world that draws the Hungarian technical level, product 
quality, and therefore, many factors, toward its level. It 
makes demands against the Hungarian economy. We need these 
demands so that one day we will become suitable for common 
market membership, which, naturally, is one of our ambitions. 
  [Pozsgai] How are relations between Budapest and Bonn just 
now? I am asking this on the occasion of your forthcoming visit 
to Bonn. According to our information, relations were excellent 
at the time of the change of the regime, during the fuel crisis 
[not further specified], and even after that, but later they 
became more quiet. 
  [Boross] Fortunately, events do not always occur that would 
specially highlight good relations. During these crises, 
Germany did indeed support us, but this is continuing. 
Chancellor Kohl and former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall had a 
special relationship. I think that this is widely known. When 
Chancellor Kohl was here at the funeral, I had an opportunity to 
meet him and I was glad to see that he applied the same intimate 
style with me. This gives me hopes that this good relationship 
will continue on the same level. It is self-evident that, in a 
relationship, it is not possible only to ask for things and 
request donations. This is not my goal. I would like a 
cooperation that has more advantages for us -- simply because of 
the power conditions -- but I am certainly not thinking of 
relations that would embarrass Germany because we might not be 
able to keep within the limits. We are. I will be talking to 
the chancellor on these terms. 
  [Pozsgai] In the German television and press, it is mainly 
the Hungarian left wing that represents Hungary and it often 
gives a distorted picture of the domestic situation. Why is the 
Hungarian center passive in this area? 
  [Boross] Because we are lagging behind in communication. 
This communication is essentially the heritage of the former 
regime, including a large section of its personnel -- mainly in 
the first two years of our operation. The result is that a keen 
political battle is going on here. The left wing suffered a 
great disappointment at the 1990 elections because it had been 
almost certain of its victory and, because of this, it often 
oversteps the limits that are adhered to by the communications 
experts of other countries' oppositions. 
  Indeed, these actions that damage our image are very 
disturbing for us. Many of our domestic political battles are 
also on this issue. Occasionally, astonishing news can appear 
in Germany, and I can read striking distortions of my words in 
newspapers. Similar images are shown on television, for 
example, on the Gypsy issue. As far as I can remember, this did 
happen, although it has nothing to do with the truth. We are 
not in a good position regarding communications. 
  [Pozsgai] So the media war is still on. In my view, the 
main reason for this is that the change of the regime has not 
been implemented in the area of the media. The daily newspapers 
had largely been privatized before the change of the regime, 
therefore, they avoided the change of the regime. 
  [Boross] First of all, I would like to say that I can 
remember that the Springer concern was a main enemy in the 
previous, socialist-communist system in the West because of the 
level of its anti-communism. Then Springer bought six communist 
newspapers, and these are still edited by the same people as 
before. I can only placet a large question mark next to this, 
nothing else. This kind of problem did not exist in Germany. 
The staff of the East German television was fundamentally 
changed, and the Czechs did the same. This did not happen in 
Hungary. There are many reasons for this, and we are now 
suffering the consequences. The Hungarian transformation 
insisted on legality and this prevailed during the changes. In 
fact, as opposed to the eastern part of Germany, this change 
actually began in the previous regime. Therefore, here, the 
government never made any illegal or anti-constitutional 
measures and was always moderate. This has many advantages, but 
some disadvantages too, as is shown by the media issue. 
  [Pozsgai] The political developments in Russia 
understandably worry the West. What do you think about 
Zhirinovskiy? Can he become Yeltsin's successor? 
  [Boross] I dare not predict this, because political 
personalities sometimes appear and then disappear from public 
life. However, I dare say that the imperialist view and the 
slogans corresponding to this may bring lasting popularity in 
Russia, and this might mean a special advantage in politics -- 
even its extreme version. Therefore, in Russia, the imperial 
mentality is stronger than the Russian mentality in people's 
general views. A nationalist version of communism appeared 
there -- I am now talking about the left wing. 
  [Pozsgai] Was Foreign Minister Jeszenszky's visit to 
Belgrade unavoidable right now when the Bosnian conflict has 
become more tense and the Serbs have been internationally 
isolated? 
  [Boross] Let us be precise! Jeszenszky's visit and the 
state secretary's visit preceding it took place before the 
events you mentioned. Certain factors could have been taken 
into consideration if communication in international politics 
had been adequate. However, we also had to remember after all 
that 400,000 Hungarians are living in fear in Vojvodina. I 
think that we waited long enough. The foreign ministers of 
other countries, for example of the NATO member Greece, had been 
to Belgrade long before our visit was made. Hungary's interest 
in putting the Vojvodina Hungarians at ease was expressed in 
this visit -- some 100,000 members of this community have 
already left, some of them to Hungary, others to all parts of 
the world. In these circumstances, and recognizing that we will 
still be living next to each other for centuries, and historical 
experience also shows that it is dangerous to live in hostility, 
especially with Serbia, therefore, I believe that we had to make 
this step. We need peace here, on our southern border, and 
peace is needed for the Hungarians in Yugoslavia. We do not 
want to struggle with the problems of masses of refugees. They 
should stay at home and the feeling of danger that they have 
been living with for years should be reduced. Therefore, rump 
Yugoslavia is our neighbor and it will remain so. It is, of 
course, possible to give various pieces of advice. However, the 
advice is coming from many thousands of kilometers away from 
here. In such a case, we always have a strange feeling that 
they might not be living the situation as we have to live 
through it.

<F P=106> [Jozsef Szabo Bartha report: "Csurka Supports Csucs's </F>
Nomination in Mohacs -- The MIEP's Budapest Elections List Is 
Complete"] 
  [Text] The unlawful police actions against the Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party [MIEP] have become tendentious. The 
latest incident occurred on 18 February, when the MIEP's 
petition for a referendum was confiscated in the underpass at 
the Nyugati railroad station, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath 
announced at the party's news conference on 23 February. 
  He said that a MIEP member who tried to clear up the matter 
immediately after this police action was ejected from the police 
station, being told "walkies outside, why should we deal with 
such a matter, you will not win the elections anyway!" In the 
MIEP's view, it is not impossible that police patrols had been 
given orders to act against the collection of signatures. A 
letter has been sent to National Police Chief Sandor Pinter 
asking him to investigate the responsibility for this 
politically motivated act. 
  In connection with the elections, it was said at the news 
conference that the Budapest list is complete and the number of 
their individual candidates exceeds 140. They are delaying the 
publication of the list of names because running in MIEP colors 
involves the threat of losing one's job in a number of cases. 
  They are willingly to support Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman 
of Hungarian Radio, if he runs as an independent candidate in 
Mohacs [southern Hungary]. Similarly, they would also be happy 
to support Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian 
Television, either as a MIEP or as an independent candidate. 
  Answering NEPSZABADSAG's question in connection with the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] National Convention last 
weekend, [MIEP Co-Chairman Istvan] Csurka stated: "The MDF's 
ship is already nose down in the sea. We are lucky that we had 
been removed from this Titanic before it started to sink. The 
current three captains will not be able to repair the hole that 
was caused by the previous captain Jozsef Antall when the ship 
collided with the iceberg of the pact."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Popularity of Party List Leaders"] </F>
  [Text] At the request of MAGYAR HIRLAP, the Median Public 
Opinion and Market Research Institute will, until the elections, 
regularly examine the popularity or the parties' list leaders 
and how well they are known. 
  At the top of the list, no move has been made from December 
1993 to January 1994: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP) chairman], [Republic Party (KP) Chairman] Janos Palotas, 
and Zoltan Kiraly [Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP) 
chairman] continue to be in the first three places. 
  However, it cannot be ignored that these politicians are not 
in the same position: In the case of the Socialists, the party 
and its first man are equally popular, but the very popular 
Palotas and Kiraly lead parties whose support does not even 
reach the minimum required to get into parliament. People link 
Horn to his party with rather big certainty, while the party 
links to the other two popular politicians are unknown to many 
people. 
  By the beginning of 1994, almost all significant political 
parties named their leading person on the election list. From 
now on, it is of outstanding importance on the basis of what 
information the citizens will make their decision on 8 May, 
whether they know who the main actors of political life are, 
what they represent, and how popular they are. 
  Since the beginning of December, Peter Boross who was 
elected 
prime minister in the meantime, has become known virtually to 
the whole adult population. Although he had previously also 
been among the known politicians, in the first month as prime 
minister, this increased by almost 10 percent and reached the 
virtual maximum. The level of how well known the other list 
leaders are has not changed in the past month apart from 
accidental variations, and Gabor Kuncze's [list leader of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] popularity and how well he is 
known, which had formerly increased fast, has also stagnated. 
  On the basis of how well they know the politicians, the 
citizens can be put into three groups: The first group consists 
of people who know the politician, have an opinion about him, 
and are aware of which party he belongs to; the second group 
consists of those who know the politician's name, can express 
their opinion on him, but do not know, or incorrectly know, his 
party affiliation; and people in the third group have heard of 
the politician's name but will not form a view on him and do not 
know where he belongs.

  Out of the 10 list leaders, people know the party 
affiliation 
of five on the average (12 percent could not name the party of 
any of the politicians and no one was able to name them all). 
  Four-fifths of the people who were surveyed know about the 
best-known Jozsef Torgyan and that he belongs to the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP]. Viktor Orban's party [Federation of 
Young Democrats (Fidesz)] membership is also well known. A 
quarter of the questioned people were unable to link Gyula Horn 
and Peter Boross to a party, but the number of people who gave 
the wrong party name is negligible in the case of these two. 
  The party link of Laszlo Surjan [Christian Democratic 
People's Party (KDNP) chairman] is only known correctly by 53 
percent of those who know him, 37 percent cannot link him to any 
party, and 8 percent gave the wrong party name (out of this, 5 
percent said he was an MDF member). Only a little more than 
half of the people who know Gabor Kuncze are also aware that he 
is the prime minister candidate of the SZDSZ, and the proportion 
of the wrong answers is similar in his case, 7 percent, but 
there is not a typical wrong answer. 
  Few people know which parties the otherwise popular leaders 
of the smaller parties represent. Half of the people who know 
Istvan Csurka [chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, 
MIEP] do not know to which party he belongs, and 12 percent gave 
incorrect answers (9 percent of these still think he is an MDF 
member). More than one-third of the questioned people cannot 
place Janos Palotas on the party palette, and one-quarter link 
him to the wrong party (19 percent of these said he is a member 
of the Entrepreneurs' Party). Zoltan Kiraly's party position is 
the least known for the public, almost two-thirds of the people 
did not even attempt to place him anywhere, and 19 percent gave 
the wrong party name. 
  The popularity of politicians is shown on the following 
table.

  On this question, people were allowed to give their views 
on all politicians, and as can be seen, the popularity of most 
of the list leaders was said to be average or a little better 
than average. However, when people said whom they would welcome 
at the head of the government after the next elections -- that 
is, when they were only able to select one person for this 
important political role -- most named Horn. 
  Although there is little difference in the general views on 
most leading politicians, these differ as regards their 
suitability for the prime ministerial position.

  Nine percent more people would welcome the current prime 
minister back in his position than the number of people who 
would vote for his party. Horn would also be welcome as prime 
minister by 4 percent more people than who would vote for the 
MSZP. However, 3-4 percent fewer people can see the leaders of 
the liberal parties as prime minister than the number of people 
who would vote for their parties. 
  Although Palotas continues to be popular and, for many 
people, appears to be a politician suitable to be leader, his 
party has not yet been able to utilize this popularity. The 
situation is similar in the case of the MSZDP where the party 
chairman is considered to be popular by many people but this 
sympathy does not come across to his party -- although it is 
true that not many people would like him to be prime minister 
either.

  [Text] Belgrade, 25 February (TANJUG) -- The UN 
secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, and the 
president of the Republic of Serb Krajina, Milan Martic, reached 
an agreement in Belgrade today on the bridge between Gradiska 
and Stara Gradiska. They agreed that the situation on the 
bridge is to be restored to what it was on 18 February when the 
police of the Republic of Serb Krajina took control of the 
bridge from the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
  After one hour of talks, Akashi and Martic said that it was 
agreed that the UN peace forces are to withdraw armored 
personnel carriers deployed around the bridge over the past few 
days and that, at the same time, members of the ministry of 
internal affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina are to withdraw 
as well.

  [Text] Belgrade, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi, head of 
the UN peace mission for the former Yugoslavia, said in Belgrade 
today that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] is more optimistic 
than ever before regarding further progress in reaching a 
lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Following one-hour talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic, Akashi told journalists that he was encouraged by 
President Milosevic's readiness to support the United Nations 
and UNPROFOR in their mission, and added that the talks were 
very useful. 
  The head of the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia 
rejected the possibility that the United Nations could set an 
ultimatum to the warring sides in Bosnia, stressing that the 
word ultimatum does not exist in the United Nations' vocabulary. 
  Akashi said that he had informed President Milosevic about 
an 
agreement reached today with Milan Martic, president of the 
republic of Serb Krajina, on the resolution of the problem that 
has arisen between UNPROFOR and the Krajina police regarding the 
bridge near Nova Gradiska. 
  We also discussed the latest developments in Sarajevo and 
other important issues, such as Mostar and Tuzla, he said. The 
UN envoy explained that they had discussed the opening of Tuzla 
airport and said: We would like to resolve this issue in a 
peaceful and diplomatic way. UNPROFOR is ready to provide 
certain guarantees to those who think that the airport could be 
used for other than humanitarian purposes. We are ready to 
guarantee that Tuzla airport will be used for humanitarian 
purposes only. If the presence of officers of both sides is 
necessary we are ready to let it be so, Akashi said. 
  He did not rule out fresh ideas on the resolution of that 
issue, which would offer greater guarantees. We think it 
important to resolve that issue (Tuzla airport) through an 
agreement between all sides, Akashi said. 
  Stating that he also discussed with Milosevic the 
initiative to set up a Muslim-Croat confederation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said that he believed that the 
initiative was good. That is a step toward a comprehensive 
peace that should not, however, involve only two, but all sides, 
Akashi said. 
  Concerning the massacre at Sarajevo's Markale market, Akashi 
said that a special five-member UN commission reached a 
conclusion that the shell could have been fired from Serb or 
Muslim positions. We cannot ascribe the responsibility to any 
of the two sides, but we are sure that a 120-mm mortar shell 
could have caused such tragic consequences, Akashi stressed. 
  Asked about a secret UN report which says the Muslim side is 
responsible for the massacre, he said that he had heard various 
reports but that he had to stick to the conclusions of the five 
experts. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic declared on 
Akashi's departure that the talks with the head of UNPROFOR were 
cordial and open and that they reiterated the desire of 
Yugoslavia and Serbia to see peace in Bosnia as soon as possible. 
  President Milosevic, Jovanovic said, expressed deep 
satisfaction at the success achieved today by Mr. Akashi and 
[Serb Krajina] president Martic in normalizing the situation 
surrounding the bridge across the Sava. 
  The president recalled the support we lent to the Vance plan 
and its implementation and underlined that we were convinced all 
issues that crop up could be and should be resolved through 
dialogue, Jovanovic added. 
  The Yugoslav foreign minister stressed that the talks with 
Akashi emphasized the problem of the sanctions as an obstacle to 
peace, because the Muslim side is still relying on hopes that 
the sanctions will help it achieve what it could not achieve on 
the battlefield. He said that Akashi was told that the lifting 
of the sanctions would shorten the road to peace and relieve the 
Muslims of that last grand illusion. 
  Asked about the Yugoslav stand on the opening of Tuzla 
airport, Jovanovic stressed that the Serb side in Bosnia should 
negotiate and decide on that. We believe that this is basically 
a marginal and artificial problem that arose when the Muslim 
side had to be protected against their responsibility for the 
failure of the peace plan on Bosnia. The issue of Tuzla airport 
should not evolve into a problem that could threaten the peace 
process, and give a fresh impetus to the advocates of the war 
option to further aggravate the situation in Bosnia. 
  Jovanovic went on to say that this issue could be 
effectively 
solved by introducing control of the airport, which would 
involve the Bosnian Serbs, and which would theoretically and in 
practical terms rule out any possibility of the airport being 
misused for other [than humanitarian] purposes. 
  Jovanovic stressed that the issue of opening the airport in 
Banja Luka would probably be raised at the same time as that of 
Tuzla airport, because that [Serb-held] area needs humanitarian 
aid.

  [Text] Belgrade, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic this afternoon received Yasushi Akashi, 
special envoy for the UN secretary general and head of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mission, and General Jean Cot, 
commander of the UN peacekeepers for the former Yugoslavia. 
  According to the Serbian president's office, the talks 
centered on issues relating to a political solution of the 
Yugoslav crisis and the implementation of the UN forces' 
mandate. President Milosevic expressed his satisfaction at the 
successful talks between Yasushi Akashi and Milan Martic on 
surmounting tensions surrounding the bridge across the Sava 
River at Gradiska, stressing that Serbia, as usual, prefers to 
resolve disputes through political dialogue instead of 
confrontation. 
  The Republic of Serbia has been extending and will continue 
to extend support to the implementation of the UN peace plan, 
which does not prejudge political solutions but leaves this up 
to negotiations in conditions of a stable peace. 
  The head of UNPROFOR's mission informed President Milosevic 
about viewpoints pertaining to the latest developments and 
future activities, in the context of the peace process for 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The talks were also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic.

  [Excerpts] In Bosnia the cease-fire between Croats and 
Muslims has been respected on the whole, UN forces have said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Belgium will be sending UN soldiers. Soon 150 Belgian UN 
soldiers will leave Baranja, in eastern Croatia, for central 
Bosnia. A vanguard of a dozen Belgian soldiers has already 
left. The Belgian infantry is equipped with some 15 armored 
vehicles. The number of Belgian troops in Bosnia will thus 
total some 450 soldiers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, special rapporteur of </F>
the UN Human Rights Commission for the former Yugoslavia, by 
Helga Hirsch; place and date not given: "Helplessness is 
Outrageous"] 
  [Text] [Hirsch] Have the Serbs really fulfilled the 
demands of the West so far that an air strike is no longer 
necessary? 
  [Mazowiecki] To be really able to assess how far they have 
placed their weapons under UN control, one would have to study 
the situation on the spot. Undoubtedly, however, the 
development proves that resolute pressure can force decisions. 
The point is now that the things that have been achieved are 
not lost. 
  [Hirsch] Will the Russian UN contingent really be neutral? 
  [Mazowiecki] As part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], 
the Russians have to observe its rules. On the other hand, 
Russia has, of course, achieved a political success. 
  [Hirsch] In the West, many opposed any military intervention 
by saying that the political objective of the war is unclear. 
Might the West not be involved in intricate fights for an 
incalculable period? 
  [Mazowiecki] Conversely, I am asking: What would happen 
without intervention? Is the alternative supposed to be: Let 
them bleed to death...?! Helplessness is outrageous in the 
event of such serious human rights violations. As early as 
August 1992, President Alija Izetbegovic told me that bombs have 
to be dropped if the heavy weapons are not withdrawn. At that 
time, this also seemed to be exaggerated to me. However, I am 
convinced that it would have been possible to get the weapons 
under control by strong political pressure as early as one and a 
half years ago. 
  [Hirsch] How much is the West also to blame for the 
escalation of the conflict? 
  [Mazowiecki] It started with the absence of any ideas for a 
global solution in the former Yugoslavia: How the rights of 
nations and nationalities could be preserved if Yugoslavia 
disintegrates. Slovenia and Croatia were recognized without 
clarifying what would be done with small Bosnia. The second 
mistake was made with the London conference or the lack of 
preparedness to implement its resolutions. At that time, in 
August 1992, all committed themselves to refrain from further 
"ethnic cleansing," to dissolve the prison camps, and not to 
prevent humanitarian help any longer. And what happened? None 
of the resolutions was adhered to, but the negotiations 
continued. When the monitoring of the embargo really began on 
the border between Bosnia and Serbia in the spring of 1993, the 
Serbs threatened to shell Rome or Paris or Vienna -- and the 
West yielded to the threats. All the time it was like this: 
First the West announced a resolute course of action and then 
it stated that it could not be implemented. Undoubtedly, the 
hesitation spurred the warring parties on. 
  [Hirsch] How do you explain the helplessness of the West? 
  [Mazowiecki] There is the fear that, for example, the death 
of every English soldier will lead to troubles in Great Britain: 
"We will not die for Sarajevo." I understand this fear. But 
can criminals be tolerated without any consequences? The 
situation was certainly different in 1939. But there is a 
parallel to that time, when nobody wanted to die for Gdansk. 
  In addition, the "Vietnam complex" continues to be felt. On 
the other hand, let us not forget that the man in the street in 
Paris, Bonn, Warsaw, or London asks the justified question: If 
it was possible to intervene in Iraq, why can this not also be 
done in Bosnia? 
  [Hirsch] The longer the war lasts, the more every side will 
make itself guilty.... 
  [Mazowiecki] Unfortunately. 
  [Hirsch] ....and therefore the West is increasingly 
justified in talking of a fratricidal war. Do you still see 
clear differences in the guilt of the warring parties? 
  [Mazowiecki] Certainly. The policy of "ethnic cleansing," 
with all its brutality, was applied by the Bosnian Serbs. Then 
it was again revived in the Croatian-Muslim conflict -- above 
all by the Croatian side. In view of such a cruel policy, the 
respective other side -- also the Muslims -- carried out 
reprisals. 
  [Hirsch] Do you know of cases where Muslims shot at their 
own people to force the West to intervene? 
  [Mazowiecki] I have heard of such cases, but I can neither 
confirm nor deny them because I did not investigate them myself. 
However, one should bear in mind that the Bosnian Government has 
the greatest difficulties in controlling its irregular troops. 
A desperate act of an individual or a unit cannot be completely 
ruled out. I think that such a course of action is unlikely as 
a deliberate tactic of the government. If this became known, it 
would be completely compromised and would have to expect even 
greater pressure from the West to sign a peace treaty. 
  [Hirsch] What is known about the situation of the raped 
women? How many prisoners and how many camps are still there? 
  [Mazowiecki] According to the International Red Cross, there 
are still 4,000 people in prisons and camps. The number of 
rapes has apparently decreased. However, they still occur on 
all sides. The children also deserve particular attention: 
According to experts' estimates, 280,000 children have been 
indirectly or directly involved in the war. Some 16,000 have 
probably died. 
  [Hirsch] What political solution is realistic after these 
horrors? 
  [Mazowiecki] The pressure for the settlement of the basic 
problems has to continue resolutely: All prisoners have to be 
released and all camps have to be dissolved. Unhindered access 
has to be ensured for the convoys providing humanitarian help. 
It is extremely difficult to negotiate a solution. On the one 
hand, certain realities and, on the other, law and justice have 
to be taken into account. In my opinion, however, a peace 
process that makes a pluralist coexistence gradually possible is 
feasible after the demilitarization of the territory. But the 
presence of international forces and institutions will be 
required for a long time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Martin Minkov] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt that this [downing of planes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] is a very serious incident, but in my view 
one should not overdramatize the situation. The planes were 
downed as a result of them violating the no-fly zone that was 
imposed under the UN resolution last year, and it has no direct 
connection with the NATO ultimatum that, as our listeners are 
certainly well aware, led to the peace that reigns in Sarajevo 
at the moment. However, what is alarming is that the violation 
of the no-fly zone happened after the ultimatum. In my view, it 
is this aspect that transforms the violation into a deliberate 
provocation aimed at testing out [the no-fly zone] and 
establishing to what extent the international community, 
represented by NATO, is firm in its intention to use force in 
the event of an action that contravenes the categorical 
conditions specified in the key documents -- the UN resolution 
on the no-fly zone and the NATO ultimatum. 
  The point of the sounding-out operation was to find out the 
following: If, in the event of a violation of the no-fly zone, 
the monitoring forces limited their reaction merely to a 
warning, then if the NATO ultimatum was breached, one might also 
be able to get off scot-free, speaking figuratively. It is now 
clear that this will not be the case, and the people who 
continue to look for loopholes in the firmly adopted stances 
should draw the proper conclusions, namely that they [the NATO 
forces] will act firmly, that is, use weapons, in the event of 
any attempted violation. 
  Regarding the issue of the identity of the planes in 
question, at the moment it appears that they belonged to the 
Bosnian Serbs, according to NATO claims. However, the Bosnian 
Serbs hastened to deny that this was the case, and Belgrade also 
says it knows nothing. There has been no official reaction from 
the Croatian and Muslim sides. Accordingly, all this has to be 
further investigated. Nonetheless, it is most likely that the 
planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs, who are in the best 
position to deny the fact. It is very doubtful whether anyone 
in Pale, or wherever else their military command is located, 
would allow himself to conduct such an experiment without first 
consulting Belgrade and without carefully considering the 
possible consequences if the planes were downed, as in fact was 
the case. Since the attempt did not come off, the position of 
denial or possibly shifting blame to some third-level commander 
is now the only possible alternative, to prevent an escalation 
of the international military pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.

  [Text] Robin Beard, NATO assistant secretary general for 
defense support, ended his two-day visit to Bulgaria today. 
Before leaving, he held a final meeting in Sofia with the 
President's Military Office, at which the participants exchanged 
information on the preparation of concrete programs for 
cooperation between Bulgaria and NATO under the Partnership for 
Peace initiative. 
  At a news briefing given at the Defense Ministry, Mr. Beard 
summed up the results of his visit, describing it as fruitful. 
During his visit, he said, he finalized a program for 
multilateral cooperation that will strengthen the links between 
Bulgaria and NATO. The program covers issues concerning the 
relations between civilian and military structures in the 
fulfillment of military programs and ways to implement state 
deliveries. It was agreed that three groups of NATO experts 
would visit Bulgaria with the task of providing assistance in 
information technology in connection with the administration of 
joint military programs.

  [Excerpts] The institutionalized protection of minority 
rights was discussed at the Budapest consultation of youth 
organizations of the European Democratic Union. [passage 
omitted] Attila Kert reports: 
  [Kert] Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky has spoken, among 
other things, about collective rights. Referring to his recent 
visit to Belgrade, he spoke with cautious optimism about the 
cultural autonomy efforts of the Hungarians in Vojvodina 
[Vajdasag]. He said that negotiations with President Milosevic 
can give rise to some optimism. 
  At the same time, the foreign minister said it was 
regrettable that the draft law on ensuring parliamentary seats 
for the representatives of the ethnic minorities in Hungary was 
not adopted in the Hungarian National Assembly by the required 
two-thirds majority. He stressed, however, that even now the 
Hungarian National Assembly had currently as many as 30 members 
from various nationalities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Arpad Goncz, commander in chief of the 
armed forces, said that due to the southern Slav fighting, 
Hungarian soldiers must prepare themselves to defend peace. At 
a meeting with military leaders, Defense Minister Lajos Fur said 
that despite shrinking financial resources, the capability to 
mobilize and to react to unexpected challenges must be preserved. 
  In connection with the NATO Partnership for Peace, Fur 
stressed that it is in Hungary's basic interest to take 
advantage of this opportunity for cooperation since this will 
lead us to full membership. He said that it is necessary to 
prepare for joint training and joint military exercises, as well 
as Hungary's participation in peacekeeping.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The national council of the biggest 
opposition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], held a 
session today. Party Chairman Ivan Petoe made a submission on 
the list of deputies and Gabor Kuncze, leader of the party's 
parliamentary group and the party's candidate for prime 
minister, on the coalition guidelines. Our staff member Peter 
Obersovszky spoke to Gabor Kuncze. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Obersovszky] In recent days the SZDSZ 
signed the liberal election agreement. [passage omitted] Many 
people feel that the most problematic situation would be if the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] got about 30 percent and would 
then be in a position to choose its coalition partners or to 
start forming a government. What would happen then? The SZDSZ 
has very many times been accused, explicitly or implicitly, that 
it is potentially willing to form a coalition with the HSP. 
  [Kuncze] It is worth repeating what we said at the SZDSZ's 
last delegates' assembly, that whereas on the one hand we strive 
to see the present coalition replaced, on the other hand we 
would not even dream of helping the HSP to victory. I also 
doubt whether it could get 30 percent. 
  But there is another viewpoint here, the viewpoint of the 
country's governability. It would not be a good thing if it 
turned out to be impossible to form a coalition after May and 
new elections had to be called. That is why we laid down our 
coalition guidelines. On the basis of these we are open to 
negotiations. The electorate can also see what kind of 
coalition the SZDSZ is willing to enter into, and we will be 
accountable on these points. 
  However, at this stage it is not worth saying any more than 
this with regard to the HSP, or any other parties. For the time 
being there exists but one agreement: this is at the center, the 
agreement of the liberal parties. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] The foreign affairs spokesman of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] has reaffirmed that the foreign policy 
that his party wishes to pursue is that hallmarked with the name 
of Jozsef Antall. The two main aims of this are European 
integration and the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond 
the borders. Gyorgy Csoti stressed that there is no better 
security guarantee than economic interconnections; for this 
reason the ruling party urges cooperation between the regions. 
In this endeavor, there is agreement between the parliamentary 
parties. The politician does not consider it likely that the 
Hungarian-Romanian and Hungarian-Slovak treaties will be signed 
in the near future because the two neighboring countries are not 
willing to accept minority protection guarantees.

  [Text] We will now present a statement by the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs which states that it has learned 
about the abominable tragedy in the sacred establishment in 
Hebron in the West Bank, where scores of innocent people have 
become victims of insanity and intolerance, with profound 
concern. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs most firmly condemns this 
criminal and irresponsible action just as it has condemned and 
continues to condemn any act of violence committed by the forces 
that oppose the easing of tensions in the Middle East. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses the hope that, 
despite this dramatic incident and other attempts to hamper the 
peace process, the desire by the sides to solve the conflict in 
this area by political means will continue with the same 
determination to capitalize on the favorable preconditions 
offered by the results of the bilateral Arab-Israeli 
negotiations in Washington, which have led to a mutual 
recognition between the PLO and Israel and to the signing of the 
principled declaration of 13 September 1993. 
  By virtue of its traditional relations in that area, Romania 
reiterates its readiness and interest in supporting the process 
of achieving peace, understanding, and economic cooperation in 
the Middle East, the statement by the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, which has been faxed to us, emphasizes in 
conclusion.

<F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Tiberiu Iacob: "Despite the Rumors That </F>
Are Being Circulated, Mr. Coposu Remains Firm: `PNTCD Will Not 
Join the Government Without CDR'"] 
  [Text] In a dialogue with our correspondents yesterday, 
Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic 
Party] chairman, categorically refuted the rumors that are being 
circulated alleging that certain so-called changes occurred in 
his political-strategic position. "As far as we are concerned, 
no changes have occurred," the PNTCD leader said. "We decided 
to answer favorably to the invitation addressed to us by Oliviu 
Gherman [chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania -- 
PDSR] to engage in a dialogue with the PDSR separately from the 
rest of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], but we will 
not join the government without our allies within the CDR, and 
that could also happen only if Ion Iliescu renounces his 
monopoly over the country's authorities. We refuse the idea of 
setting up a national unity government and we will not cooperate 
with the extremist parties -- the PRM [Greater Romania Party], 
the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], and the PUNR [National 
Romanian Unity Party]. As far as the UDMR [Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania] is concerned, our relations with them 
have not cooled down at all; they are the same as before. The 
UDMR remains our ally, despite our reserve regarding their 
program and the draft they elaborated for the ethnic minority 
bill."

  [Text] A session of the Council of Representatives of the 
Hungarian Democratic Union in Romania [HDUR] is continuing in 
Miercurea Ciuc. Laszlo Tokes, honorary president of the 
Council, has sent a letter to the representatives. Our special 
correspondent Peter Marvanyi reports. 
  [Marvanyi] Only 30 days remain from the six-month period 
that 
the Council of Europe gave Romania to fulfill the conditions 
laid down when Romania was admitted as a Council member. To 
this day, Romania has not fulfilled one single obligation it 
undertook, not even those which directly affect the Hungarian 
minority in Romania, their minority, and human rights. Bishop 
Laszlo Tokes, HDUR honorary president -- who is not present here 
in Miercurea Ciuc -- has warned the Council of Representatives 
about all this in a letter. The parliament, or more precisely 
one of its committees, is drafting a resolution linked to this. 
  By the way, yesterday, after reading out Bishop Tokes's 
letter, Csaba Takacs, executive chairman of the Council of 
Representatives, said the HDUR is constantly collecting 
documents relating to the Council of Europe's conditions and 
registering the events, or more precisely the actions which the 
Romanian Government has mostly failed to carry out. The HDUR 
will submit the material to international forums.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Havel by Robert Tamchyna at the </F>
Lany presidential residence in Prague on 27 February; from the 
"Conversations at Lany" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Incompetence or going beyond one's 
authority--these were the words used in connection with the 
personal initiative by Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys on 
resolving the conflict in the Balkans. These are the final 
assessments, I would say. I think, however, that you, given 
your position, have been trying to find some rational 
explanation of this unusual political move, as it were, because 
this move ignored a minister's subordination to government 
policy. Have you found this explanation? 
  [Havel] This appears to be a popular topic these days, and 
one is reluctant to comment further on it because many comments 
have already been made. Nevertheless, it seems to me that it is 
my duty to add a little more. 
  I am unable to find a proper explanation. Minister Baudys's 
intention was undoubtedly noble. But the whole matter was so 
dilettantish that it broke all of the elementary rules of 
diplomacy, politics, and so on. This was almost shocking. I 
firmly believe that the sensation it caused and the degree of 
shame it generated for our Republic is perhaps a sufficient 
lesson to all of us to exercise caution. 
  At issue here is not merely the fact that Minister Baudys 
failed to consult our constitutional officials on his original 
idea, whose content was very contentious, by the way. The point 
here is that this is not the way in which international 
initiatives should be pursued. [passage omitted] 
  It was so absolutely dilettantish from start to finish, and 
I 
firmly hope that nothing of this kind will ever be repeated. 
But, should that be the case, the consequences of it would have 
to be more serious. 
  [Tamchyna] Conditions of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia have, 
on the whole, been met. The world can take a deep breath in the 
few days to come. Mr. President, despite all of this, don't you 
feel that Minister Baudys's personal position, presented to the 
world, or the discrepancies between your statement and the 
statement by the Czech prime minister could send a signal to the 
world that our foreign policy is not completely united on this 
currently very important issue? 
  [Havel] The fact that representatives of the same state hold 
contradictory views does not, of course, create a very good 
impression. [passage omitted] 
  The fact is, however, that the state must have its own 
foreign policy and direction, which it has. I think that, in 
principle, all of us are acting within the foreign policy 
constraints. In some cases, it might appear that some have gone 
beyond these constraints. It appears that all of them should 
give careful thought to what they are saying, and they should be 
aware that thinking aloud, which is often well intended, can 
give an altogether different impression once journalists get 
hold of it. [passage omitted] 
  [Tamchyna] In the light of some political evergreens 
repeatedly discussed by the government, it seems that the fine 
and sensitive fabric of relations within the ruling coalition is 
not always as firm as it should be. Mr. President, in this 
context, what do you think about the two election bills [on 
local and Senate elections] approved by the government this week? 
  [Havel] First, I am pleased to see that these bills have 
actually been passed by the government and that they will soon 
go through the parliament. Given that local elections and 
elections to the Senate are scheduled for this fall, it is high 
time to get these bills ready. I think that retaining the 
principle of a combined electoral system in the bill on 
elections to local and city councils is a good thing. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for the elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the 
Senate, it is absolutely proper, and I think that it is a good 
thing that elections to the Chamber of Deputies should be based 
on the proportional representation system and that, as 
prescribed by the Constitution, elections to the Senate should 
be based on the majority system. 
  I do not wish to declare this categorically, but I myself 
favor the principle of small-sized constituencies with one seat. 
This was agreed by the government. This is, indeed, a clear 
majority system as prescribed by the Constitution. From the 
voters' point of view, the system is easier to understand; I 
think it is correct. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F>
place and date not given: "Slovakia Should Devalue its 
Currency"] 
  [Excerpt] [Danes] Are you completely satisfied with the 
result of Wednesday's [16 February] extraordinary session of the 
Customs Union Council? 
  [Klaus] We achieved what we could. The reversal of 
Slovakia's one-off measures and the fact that further solutions 
will be sought were the only way out of the situation. The fact 
that Slovakia, in the current political crisis, does not want to 
deal with its economic problems in a more emphatic manner is not 
unusual; it is even very common. Therefore, I do not anticipate 
that the current Slovak political representatives would, within 
the context of the political crisis, demonstrate more meaningful 
courage and adopt a more radical measure, a measure that would 
certainly not do them any good on the domestic scene. 
  [Danes] Do you think that the measure adopted by Slovakia on 
11 February--requiring special certificates testifying to the 
quality of imported foodstuffs--was motivated unequivocally by 
an attempt to reverse its unfavorable situation in the clearing 
account? 
  [Klaus] Of course. Slovakia is making a monthly payment for 
exceeding the clearing account that amounts to roughly 10 
percent of its foreign currency reserves. That is a distressing 
sum. 
  [Danes] Do you not view the future of the Czech-Slovak 
Customs Union skeptically? The current situation of recurring 
Slovak deficits in the clearing account is not beneficial to 
either of the partners. 
  [Klaus] The situation in the clearing account is not a 
repercussion of the Customs Union. It is a consequence of the 
Slovak koruna's poor exchange rate. So, I believe that the 
Slovak koruna's exchange rate will be devalued, and not the 
Customs Union. 
  [Danes] You issued a statement last week on the Allies' 
ultimatum in Bosnia, and, shortly afterwards, the president 
issued a completely different one. Would it not be in the 
interest of the Czech Republic's good name abroad to coordinate 
your stances on such fundamental international issues in advance? 
  [Klaus] I think these differences are being overstated. I 
do not think that this has caused a tragedy in our country. Let 
us not look for fundamental disputes in these statements. I am 
absolutely certain that, in the United States, Great Britain, 
and France, various opinions are being expressed on how to 
resolve this terribly difficult problem. There are radical and 
less radical opinions in these countries, opinions that 
emphasize an internal solution and opinions that emphasize an 
external solution. I think that emphasis on the fact that air 
strikes per se will probably not solve anything is the majority 
opinion, at least judging by the way I interpret the reactions 
of world politicians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Lubos </F>
Palata on 20 February; place not given: "I Was Trying To 
Specify the Causes of the War, Says Baudys"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys feels that 
his initiative differs from the previous plans for ending the 
war in Bosnia because he was trying to specify the real causes 
of the conflict. "In my opinion, they are ethno-religious 
ones," he said in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES during 
yesterday's flight to Ankara, where he was headed on an official 
visit. 
  [Palata] What is the most important point in your proposal? 
  [Baudys] The essence of my plan is an attempt to find a way 
of ending the war that ensures that the fighting does not break 
out again. The means that peace must be associated with 
disarmament. All of the warring parties must simply be given 
unequivocal guarantees that the conflict will be resolved in 
such a way that none of them can feel at a disadvantage. The 
solution must be acceptable to everyone; this should be 
guaranteed by the states allied with the individual sides in the 
conflict. It is important that police units and not troops 
provide direct protection. 
  We do not know the solution to the conflict yet, but we want 
to stop the war. The aim of my proposal is to seek a solution 
and to give the warring sides guarantees that this will proceed 
in a just and responsible manner. 
  [Palata] Did you consult anyone on your initiative? 
  [Baudys] I did not consult anyone, apart from a group of my 
closest friends, who took part in formulating the proposal with 
me. I did not consult anyone in the government, parliament, or 
other parties for the simple reason that the decision on whether 
this initiative is accepted must be made by those authorized to 
do so--the UN Security Council and representatives of the NATO 
countries. I did not consider a discussion on the domestic 
political level to be appropriate. 
  [Palata] Do you think that the European Union's peace plan 
could form the basis for a solution? 
  [Baudys] It is certainly a good plan, although I do not have 
enough information to be able to say responsibly what is better 
and what is not. I submitted this initiative in order to 
broaden the spectrum of possible solutions. 
  [Palata] Disarming the warring sides is the first point in 
your plan. How do you intend to achieve this? 
  [Baudys] My proposal does not envisage disarming the warring 
sides in the form of a NATO ultimatum; it banks on guarantees 
from the Goodwill Committee and on the agreement of the warring 
sides. 
  [Palata] Should the Czech Republic also take part in the 
work of the Goodwill Committee? 
  [Baudys] I think the Security Council must make this 
decision. I do not think, however, that it would be feasible for 
the Czech Republic to send its units to resolve this conflict. 
The situation may develop the other way round. It may turn out 
that my initiative will be rejected because it proves to be 
unimplementable. I have merely tried to find a way to a 
solution.

  [Text] President Vaclav Havel today sent a letter to the 
coordinating committee of the humanitarian campaign "for peace 
in Angola," with its headquarters in Lisbon. He has thus added 
his voice to the humanitarian campaign of Africa Amiga, whose 
aim is to halt the war in Angola. This action, which ends on 
Sunday, also received support at the beginning of February from 
Pope John Paul II.

<F P=106> [Afrticle by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Iran Wants Tamara, but the </F>
Manufacturer Will Not Sell"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Islamic Republic of Iran has several 
times shown an interest in the Tamara passive radar system, the 
Czech state-of-the-art air defense product that, according to 
the experts, is even capable of detecting the "invisible" U.S. 
Stealth aircraft. This information has been confirmed by Ludek 
Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which manufactures 
Tamara. He emphasized, however, that HTT will not sell it to 
this country. 
  Although Iran is not one of the countries to which arms 
exports are banned, many foreign politicians nevertheless 
consider it to be a very-high-risk region. "We respect the 
state's interest in not supporting the arming of this region," 
added Stodulka. 
  According to him, countries such as India, China, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand could purchase Tamara. France is 
also interested in it. 
  Tamara and its predecessor, Ramona, have only been exported 
to some of the countries of the former East bloc. At the 
moment, Tamara is also owned by the German Bundeswehr, which 
acquired it from the former GDR National People's Army, and the 
Americans. Apparently, they got it for trials from the Polish 
Army's weaponry. The former Czechoslovakia also sold Tamara to 
Syria. 
  The HTT Group has also developed a civilian version of 
Tamara, said Stodulka. He added that the company could supply 
Tamara, for example, to the police force or the taxi service. 
The radio impulses that the equipment receives from the 
atmosphere could determine precisely the location of vehicles in 
a city. 
  According to Stodulka, Tamara could even be used in the hunt 
for those who kidnap children. If a child were kidnapped along 
with its baby carriage, the radar system could monitor the 
culprit's movements. Stations that could receive and analyze 
the appropriate signals would have to be set up in a city for 
these purposes.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonin Jilecek, of the Czech Statistical </F>
Office: "Developments in the Czech Republic's Economy in 1993"] 
  [Text] Economic development in the Czech Republic last 
year was influenced not only by the continuing transformation of 
the economy, including the introduction of a new taxation 
system, but also, and especially, by the establishment of the 
independent Czech state and the subsequent currency separation. 
  Industrial output in the Czech Republic in December 1993 was 
4.0 percent lower than in December 1992. It fell by 5.3 percent 
in 1993 as a whole compared with 1992. Organizations with 100 
or more employees had a decisive influence on the decline. In 
1993, the average monthly wage in industrial organizations with 
25 or more employees was 5,962 korunas [Kc] and was thus 23.8 
percent higher than in 1992. The number of state enterprises 
declined; on the other hand, the number of business associations 
and cooperatives increased. Construction output fell at the end 
of 1993 and, in December, was 20.5 percent lower than in 
December 1992. The volume of construction output for 1993 as a 
whole was 7.5 percent lower than in 1992. The average gross 
monthly wage in organizations with 25 or more employees was 
Kc6,566 and 28.6 percent higher than in 1992. 
  The volume of goods conveyed by public freight 
transportation 
in 1993 was 200.6 million tonnes; it declined by 13.2 percent. 
Railroad freight transportation declined by 9.4 percent. In 
view of the increasing exports, however, 14.9 percent more 
wagons were used to transport cargo abroad. In public road 
haulage, the percentage of international truck transportation 
increased. 
  In 1993, the potato harvest increased by 21.7 percent, rape 
by 25.9 percent, sugar beet by 11.2 percent, fruit by 13.1 
percent, and vegetables by 19.1 percent. The cereal harvest 
declined by 1.5 percent. Compared with 1992, the sale of 
agricultural products from primary producers was 26.1 percent 
lower for slaughter poultry, 10.5 percent lower for milk, and 
3.1 percent lower for slaughter cattle. The sale of slaughter 
hogs and eggs increased by 8.6 percent and 22.4 percent, 
respectively. 
  Foreign trade turnover (excluding the Slovak Republic) in 
1993 amounted to Kc599 billion and was 10.6 percent higher than 
in 1992. Exports rose by 20 percent and imports by 2.7 percent. 
Exports fell in relation to the countries of the former East 
bloc. The balance of trade was in the red by Kc3.7 billion. 
When trade with Slovakia is included (exports of Kc74.6 
billion; imports of Kc65 billion), the overall balance was in 
the black by Kc5.9 billion. The physical volume of retail sales 
rose by 1.0 percent in 1993, compared with 1992. 
  The number of registered job seekers increased gradually 
from 
July and, by 31 December, had reached 185,200 (50,400 more 
compared with the end of 1992). The unemployment rate at the 
end of the year was 3.5 percent. The average monthly rate of 
increase in consumer prices in 1993 was 1.4 percent. Following 
a more substantial rise in prices in January and February, 
caused in particular by the introduction of value-added and 
consumer taxes, the rate of increase in the succeeding months 
was approximately 0.5 percent. The exception was a higher rise 
in prices in September and October. This was influenced by 
increases in the prices of meat, meat products, and 
communications tariffs. 
  In December 1993, the level of consumer prices was 18.2 
percent higher than in December 1992. The prices of services 
increased fastest (by 25.3 percent), and the prices of food 
products increased slowest (by 13.2 percent). The rate of 
inflation, expressed as the annual sliding average of the 
aggregate consumer price index, was 20.8 percent.

Bermudez and Venezuelan Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz Leon have discussed new strategies to jointly combat 
guerrilla forces, drug trafficking, gunrunning, kidnapping, car 
theft, contraband, and other criminal activities along the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border. 
  Meetings between the two high-ranking military officers took 
place on 17 and 19 January in Bucaramanga, the capital of 
Santander Department, 250 km northwest of Santa Fe de Bogota. 
The military representatives discussed the mechanisms necessary 
to obtain greater efficiency in the implementation of current 
agreements between the two nations and in bilateral issues 
between the Armed Forces. 
  They agreed to act cordially, based on mutual respect for 
the 
two Armed Forces' autonomy, in the war against the different 
crimes that occur in the zone. 
  The meeting between the two defense ministers strenghtens 
the 
ties of friendship and good relationship that have always 
existed between both countries.

<F P=106> [Statement by Venezuelan Defense Minister Radames Munoz Leon </F>
at a news conference with unidentified reporters at the 
Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas on 29 January -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] This morning the entire military High Command and I 
were called to the residence of President-elect Caldera in 
Tinajero. There we were told that the president [not further 
identified] wants to return to the tradition of the president 
choosing his ministers and the military High Command at the 
beginning of an administration and that for this reason we were 
to be changed. 
  He made some acknowledgements and appointed General Manuel 
Montero Revete as defense minister; the inspector general of the 
Armed Forces will be Air Force Gen. Maglio Montiel; Vice Admiral 
Rafael Huizi Clavier will be Armed Forces chief of staff; the 
commander of the Army is Gen. Moises Orozco Graterol; the Navy 
commander is Vice Adm. Jesus Ramos Flores; the Air Force 
commander is Gen. Otto Garcia; and Gen. Hegberto Artuza Delgado 
will be the commander of the Armed Forces of Cooperation. 
  In view of this situation, I told President Caldera that we 
are soldiers who respect civilian authority and that our last 
demonstration of obedience, subordination, and respect for the 
norms of discipline we honored during our years of service in 
the military institution, would be our compliance with that 
decision, but that I, personally, do not agree, and I do not 
agree because I think this marks the beginning of a breach in an 
institution that rescued the values of discipline, of service to 
the nation, and of respect for the democratic system above 
everything. 
  The military High Command has demonstrated clearly that it 
backs the democratic system and respects its fundamental values. 
It has demonstrated its love for Venezuela and its respect for 
the people. 
  This has been possible because we respect honor, our own 
honor. 
  Today we were humiliated. This is the kind of reward we 
receive for the personal sacrifices that the High Command has 
made for the democratic development of the country. We were 
humiliated because we were asked to explain our resignations 
with a childish excuse; and thirdly, because we were offered 
private meetings to offer us some other things and this goes 
against honor and dignity. I do not accept -- we do not accept 
-- unprincipled and merchant-like posts to hide a political 
decision. 
  We think that the values that were rescued while we held our 
posts in the Armed Forces were for the purpose of strengthening 
the institution so that it could serve the people and the 
country and not the personal interests of private individuals 
who have no sense of institutional values. 
  I do not accept flattery from people whom we do not deserve 
to receive it. I do not accept childish excuses either. In 
first place is my dignity, my family, and my people. I accept 
no humiliation of any kind from any person or for the sake of 
any institution or person in this country. My dignity is first. 
The dignity of the High Command is first. I have asked the 
president to relieve me from my post as minister on Monday or 
Tuesday, when he finds it suitable, and I have decided also to 
present by irrevocable retirement from the Armed Forces. 
  This situation has infuriated me. This cannot be the reward 
we receive for the democratic struggle we have waged within the 
Armed Forces. I am crying inside over my people because I do 
not know what will happen to the country with a precarious 
government that was elected by scarcely 8 percent of the 
population, or 16 percent of the potential voters, and whose 
first act was to strike an institution that is at the service of 
the fatherland and not of political parties, personalities, or 
economic or political interests. 
  Gentlemen: I have nothing else to say. Our posts will be 
placed at the disposal of the Presidency. We will leave 
honorably, with our heads high, through the front door, through 
which we dreamed to step out someday after our 30 years of 
institutional life. 
  Thank you. 
  [Reporter] You have said that the unity of the Armed Forces 
has been broken. Is a coup d'etat possible? 
  [Munoz] I do not think the Armed Forces are thinking about 
that. We have planted the seed of democracy and it is deep in 
the heart of the Armed Forces. They are responsible. However, 
in the face of an attitude such as this, hopelessness will enter 
the minds of many people because they will think that after 30 
years of service they still will be unsure what a political whim 
will decide for their lives. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1850 GMT on 29 January in a 
150-word, Caracas-datelined report adds: "Montero Revete will 
assume the post of acting defense minister on Monday in view of 
Defense Minister Rear Admiral Radames Munoz' decision to resign 
and to request his retirement, President Ramon J. Velasquez 
said. The president made this announcement in the company of 
Munoz at the Miraflores Presidential Palace, after Caldera 
informed both of his decision to change the entire military High 
Command."]

  [Text] Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames Munoz Leon 
has asked Head of State Ramon J. Velasquez to irrevocably accept 
his retirement from the national Armed Forces. Along with 
members of the military High Command, Munoz placed his post at 
the president's disposal. The defense minister adopted this 
stand because President-elect Rafael Caldera decided to 
reorganize the military High Command. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said that the work 
done by these soldiers over the past months was decisive in 
preserving democracy. He added that President Caldera is fully 
empowered to make the changes he deems necessary. 
  [Begin Velasquez recording] I wish to say that the military 
High Command and the defense minister have been key 
collaborators in the process that led to the 5 December 
elections. For seven months, months which were filled with 
difficulties, the presence of the military High Command meant 
support and strong stability for the government I headed. 
Holding elections in December was also the High Command's main 
goal. 
  I hold you in high esteem for the work you did, the way you 
have maintained discipline within the military institution, and 
your high sense of patriotism which guides each one of you as 
members of a key team within the national Armed Forces. [end

<F P=106> [Statement by Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera; </F>
date, place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] All members of the National Armed Forces [FAN] as 
well as all Venezuelans know perfectly well that the president 
has the power to appoint ministers. The defense minister is no 
exception. There are no other requirements other than to be a 
Venezuelan citizen, more than 30 years of age, and a lay person 
[seglar]. Therefore, in theory, a civilian, a retired military 
member, or an active military member could hold the post. There 
are no requirements of rank for the post of defense minister. 
  When General Lopez Contreras became president, he appointed 
Colonel Isaias Medina Angarita as war and navy minister, as the 
position was called back then, despite the fact there were very 
important Armed Forces generals in active service, such as Gen. 
Manuel Moran, Gen. (Antonio Chalvo Cardona), and Gen. David 
Lopez Enriquez. 
  In this case, I have decided to appoint a division general 
who has more than enough merits for the post and who currently 
is second in the Army's hierarchy. The Constitution empowers 
the president, as FAN commander in chief, to carry out this 
delicate task. This task is so important that it is one of the 
two posts the president, according to the Constitution, can 
directly appoint without the need to have the minister confirm 
the appointment. 
  This is perfectly clear, simple, and is a tradition that 
dates back in our democracy. During each constitutional period, 
the president appointed the defense minister and the top 
military command. When President Romulo Betancourt handed over 
the Presidency to fellow party member Dr. Raul Leoni, Dr. Leoni 
did not confirm Gen. Antonio Briceno Linares, who was 
Betancourt's defense minister and who still had two years of 
service before retiring; instead, he appointed Gen. Ramon 
Florencio Gomez. 
  When I took over as president after Dr. Leoni, I did not 
confirm Dr. Gomez, who still had a few more months of service 
before retiring. Instead, I appointed Gen. Martin Garcia 
Villazmil as defense minister. When my period in office ended 
and Mr. Carlos Andres Perez took office, he did not keep or 
confirm Gen. (Gustavo Pardo Davila), who still had some time 
before retirement; instead, he appointed Gen. Homero Leal Torres. 
  This tradition was broken when President Luis Herrera 
Campins 
took office, who confirmed Gen. Paredes Bello to the ministry. 
Something similar happened in the following years; nevertheless, 
when President Perez again became president, he made his own 
military appointments. 
  I want to refer to the statements by Vice Admiral Radamez 
Munoz Leon regarding my decision, statements that are improper 
for an active member of the military. I must reject the 
statement that I have humiliated the minister and members of the 
High Command. I do not know how this can be termed humiliation 
when I have invited them to my home, courteously telling them I 
had decided--after meditating the situation of the country and 
Armed Forces--to appoint a new defense minister and a new 
military High Command. I added that I wanted to give them my 
full recognition as a Venezuelan and as a participant in the 
electoral process for the services rendered to the country 
regarding this electoral process and in defense of the 
democratic institution. 
  I have told them they were entitled to announce this 
decision 
to reporters if they felt they should, or if they preferred they 
could say they had gone to my house to tender their respective 
positions. This is what the defense minister termed as childish, 
a totally unjustified remark. I do not want to refer to the 
minister's other remarks, except one which I consider important. 
One cannot speak of a rift within the Armed Forces simply 
because seven generals--of whom five are retiring in four months 
because they have been in service for a long time, the two 
others, in one year and four months-- will request, as President 
Velasquez told me they had requested, their retirement. There 
is no rift within the Armed Forces. There simply is a decision, 
perfectly regular within the armed institutes. 
  Furthermore, I am convinced the adopted decision strengthens 
the Armed Forces' unity. I have absolute confidence the Armed 
Forces are aware of their role within the Constitution and the 
laws, which is to abide by and firmly support the president's 
decisions when exercising the powers vested upon him by the 
Constitution.

  [Text] Caracas, 30 Jan (AFP) -- Admiral Radames Munoz, 
outgoing defense minister, today modified the position he voiced 
yesterday when he said he respected but did not agree with the 
decision to remove him from office. Today, Radames Munoz wished 
success to the new administration of President-elect Rafael 
Caldera. 
  Munoz, who on Saturday was informed by Caldera that the 
entire high Military Command would be removed, said he was 
"humiliated" and announced he would resign before the 
inauguration of the new president on 2 February and that he 
would request his retirement from the Armed Forces. 
Nevertheless, this Sunday, as he left the last meeting of the 
council of ministers of interim President Ramon J. Velasquez, 
Munoz said "the new government must be given an opportunity to 
succeed. It must be helped because the success of the new 
government means success for the country, and the failure of the 
new government means the people's failure." 
  Vice Adm. Munoz also praised the members of the new high 
Military Command that Caldera will appoint and denied that a 
crisis might break out in the government or the Armed Forces. 
These remarks contrast with those he made yesterday, when he 
said, "I am crying inside because I do not know what will happen 
with a precarious government that was elected by 16 percent of 
potential voters and that begins by striking out at an 
institution that is at the service of the fatherland and not 
political or economic interests." 
  Munoz will be replaced as defense minister by General Manuel 
Montero Revette, current Army inspector general.

  [Text] While President Ramon J. Velasquez' last Council of 
Ministers meeting was being held at Miraflores Palace, Vice 
Admiral Radames Munoz [outgoing defense minister] said that 
after the statement he made yesterday he had nothing to add. 
Nevertheless, he rejected the statements made about him by 
reporter Jose Vicente Rangel during a television program. Here 
is what Vice Admiral Radames Munoz said: 
  [Begin Munoz recording] If I had ever thought about staging 
a 
coup d'etat, I had 271 days to do so. Gentlemen, simply by 
taking advantage of the incident that occurred at the 
presidential palace and by arresting one parliament member I 
could have staged a coup. I never perpetrated this and I never 
wanted to, even though in the media there were suggestions that 
I had ordered something like that. I did not do this precisely 
because of my respect for the Venezuelan people and the 
democratic system in which I have a firm belief. Therefore, 
those accusations are groundless. [end recording]

  [Text] The funds to pay Banco Latino depositors, beginning 
on 28 January, have already been deposited into the Central Bank 
of Venezuela [BCV]. In addition, the possibility of also making 
such payments at branches of the government-intervened bank on 
29 and 30 January is being analyzed. 
  Esperanza Martino, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] 
president, 
has said her organization has deposited funds into the BCV to 
settle Banco Latino debts with small-savings account holders. 
Those who have accounts with less than 100,000 bolivares--that 
is, about 326,000 accounts--will be paid during the first phase. 
Meanwhile, those account holders who have up to 1 million 
bolivares must wait until Fogade makes a 60-billion bolivar 
deposit. 
  Meanwhile, Colonel (Numa Coz Briceno), Metropolitan Police 
Intelligence Division chief, has said a large-scale operation 
will be conducted beginning 28 January around Banco Latino 
branches to protect depositors from possible holdups. 
  [Begin recording] [Martino] We have already issued bonds and

  [Reporter] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares? 
  [Martino] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares. We are 
procuring funds to make them available to the BCV. I want to 
tell you that we are maintaining a perfect relation with the 
BCV, and we are working together. I think we will have good 
news for account holders. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich denied 
statements by Colombian authorities regarding an increase in 
coca and marijuana crops on Venezuelan territory. He considered 
them to be "a campaign to discredit Venezuela's image." 
  "I am concerned with such statements because possibly a few 
laboratories and coca crops exist in the Venezuelan border area 
-- the country's most inhospitable zone (...) but to say that 
Venezuela is a country where cocaine and marijuana are 
extensively grown is to lie," the minister stated. Ochoa 
pointed out that "there has been a very conspicuous campaign of 
comments against Venezuela in the past days. As foreign 
minister, I categorically reject such comments." 
  He added that "Colombia and Venezuela, as neighboring 
countries, have to review and reevaluate our bilateral policies. 
There are sectors in both countries that sincerely want 
integration. However, there are also sectors that maintain a 
radical position against Venezuela; I will always reject them." 
  Omar Baralt, the head of the Venezuelan delegation at the 
Border Affairs Commission, also questioned Colombia's attitude 
regarding border issues and especially regarding the illegal 
trafficking of stolen vehicles. He said, "Colombia does not 
dare implement drastic measures" to stop this activity because 
"it fears the border will be paralyzed." Baralt explained that 
80 percent of the vehicles in the border area are Venezuelan. 
His statements were made after the Border Affairs Commission 
presented a final report to Venezuelan President Ramon J. 
Velasquez after four years of work. 
  Enrique Vargas, head of the Colombian delegation at the 
commission, emphasized that Colombia and Venezuela have worked 
jointly to identify more than 70 common problems. He said that 
"incidents that prompt friction are not good but they are 
inevitable."

<F P=106> [Article by Josias de Souza and Gilberto Dimenstein] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco is distressed by the lack of 
results from the economic policies implemented by Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso [FHC]. He expressed certain 
disappointment during private conversations, adding that he 
expected more from the FHC plan. 
  FOLHA learned that Franco said he expected an immediate, 
although gradual, reduction in the inflation rate, adding that 
he was surprised by the temporary inflation increase. According 
to Fipe (Economic Research Institute Foundation of the USP 
[University of Sao Paulo]), the inflation rate could hit 40 
percent this month. 
  Franco usually says that during the last year of his mandate 
every day is as long as a week. He has begun to doubt his own 
political strategy's chances for success because of the lack of 
economic results. He thought he would be able to influence his 
succession. He even played with the thought of a ticket with 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso as presidential candidate and former 
Minister Antonio Britto as his running mate. 
  Franco told his closest advisers that he fears the plan will 
not yield the desired effects in April, when FHC would need to 
leave the government to run for an elected office. The president 
avoids opening fire against his minister. But some assistants 
already have began criticizing FHC openly, inclusively during 
cabinet meetings. The president does not oppose the criticism, 
giving his assistants the impression that he agrees with some of 
what is being said. 
  President Franco also complains about the lack of 
"partnership" spirit in Congress. He thinks deputies and 
senators are delaying the approval of the plan's main items. 
  So far Franco maintains the promise he made to FHC not to 
comment on the economy. But his patience is reaching the limit. 
He says he is particularly annoyed with price increases in the 
pharmaceutical industry, which he finds excessive, and our high 
interest rates.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Enrique Cardoso is 
irritated because Congress did not approve some measures in the 
government's economic plan. He said that now part of it is 
missing. 
  The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]'s blocking of voting on 
the provisional measure increasing the income tax on large 
companies and creating a control tax on the financial system 
somewhat irritated Finance Minister Fernando Enrique Cardoso. 
  He said he will not accept suggestions in the future to 
balance the public budget at the expense of low-income groups.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said 
today that he will not leave his post following the government 
defeat in Congress. He added the government will maintain all 
the agreements signed for the approval of the economic plan. 
  Minister Cardoso said that the commitment the government 
needs from Congress is a zero deficit this year. He explained 
that there are conditions to compensate, via other measures, for 
the resources that would have been collected with the income tax 
increase on large companies and the financial operations tax 
which were not approved by Congress. 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] From the point of view of numbers, 
there is no problem in replacing what was denied, but this 
something else cannot come from the workers or from the middle 
class; it must come from companies because they benefited from 
the decision of the minority in the Chamber of Deputies 
yesterday which opposed the approval of the tax rate increase on 
companies, which was a small rate. I reaffirm that the struggle 
against inflation is everyone's struggle for the benefit of the 
Brazilian people because there are favorable conditions for 
investment in Brazil -- the time is right. But this is 
everyone's struggle, otherwise inflation will not be defeated. 
[end recording] 
  Cardoso also said that the government will continue to 
fulfill the agreements reached during the negotiations for the 
approval of the economic plan. He added that in the amendment 
for the creation of the social emergency fund, the states will 
also be excluded, like what happened to the municipalities 
following the retention of the participation fund. Cardoso 
explained that in exchange for the retention the states accepted 
a cut in the budget program equivalent to $200 million. The 
fund will also receive the PIS [Social Integration Program] 
revenue from the banks.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- A group headed by Ambassador Roberto 
Abdenur, secretary general of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, 
will visit Washington in early February to try to prevent the 
United States from retaliating against Brazil, which will 
probably not be able to meet the 28 February deadline to approve 
a bill on industrial property rights (trademarks and patents). 
  The fatal deadline imposed by the United States is already 
the extension of an investigation into Brazilian industrial 
property law. Last November the U.S. Government decided to 
bring forward by three months its decision on whether to adopt 
restrictive measures on Brazilian exports. 
  This subject was discussed yesterday by Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim and 20 businessmen from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. The minister does not think there will be 
difficulties in the talks with the United States, because the 
Brazilian draft bill being discussed in Congress "will be very 
similar to the intellectual property agreement" of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks which concluded last 15 December. 
  "An action that does not take into consideration what was 
attained bilaterally and multilaterally would be technically 
precipitate and politically inopportune. If Brazil had wanted 
to, it would have hindered the GATT intellectual property 
agreement," Amorim said. 
  The main point of controversy in the Brazilian draft bill is 
the requirement that pharmaceutical products must be 
manufactured in Brazil in order to obtain a license. The text 
of the GATT agreement on the subject is ambiguous, and has not 
yet been clarified within the Paris Convention which deals with 
intellectual property rights. "The text of the agreement deals 
with the subject indirectly. Political vision is necessary to 
deal with this ambiguity, which will in time be resolved," Celso 
Amorim said. 
  The foreign minister also spoke with the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce businessmen about the Common Market of the South, the 
Uruguay Round of the GATT talks, and trade problems between 
Brazil and the United States, such as problems in the iron and 
steel industry and in the shoe and tobacco sectors.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: </F>
"Difficulties Ahead"] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has an almost impossible task 
ahead: to defend Brazilian interests without the cooperation of 
the Senate, which has been making decisions affecting foreign 
policy. In an interdependent world -- regardless of whether we 
agree with it -- many domestic policy decisions end up becoming 
part of a conflict with other nations, which are sometimes more 
powerful than Brazil and can impose conditions during a 
negotiating process. 
  The Senate is currently debating two items that have a 
strong 
effect on our relations with the United States: 1. The approval 
of agreements between Brazil and Argentina and the quadripartite 
agreement between Brazil, Argentina, the nuclear agency created 
by both governments, and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
-- all related to the international supervision of the Brazilian 
nuclear program -- and 2., the approval of the law on patents. 
The delay in approving the agreements has produced all kinds of 
negative effects. Now only a very swift and expeditious Foreign 
Ministry action will be able to make the members of the select 
nuclear club believe that Brazil does not have a second purpose 
in developing its nuclear program. The damage produced by the 
delay in approving those agreements affects the image of 
Brazilian diplomacy, and wears out our relations with the 
nuclear club, but it does not produce immediate damage to the 
country's economic interests. The delay in voting on the 
intellectual property law has doubly negative effects, as it 
affects the image of the country's diplomacy and hurts it 
economically. 
  The Senate seems incapable of realizing that the U.S. 
Government -- following U.S. domestic laws and subject, without 
the shadow of a doubt, to reasonable pressures -- has designated 
the month of February for verifying whether or not the 
legislation on intellectual property rights in Brazil 
contemplates certain requirements. If the answer is negative, 
that country will apply sanctions on Brazilian exports. The 
problem for the Brazilian Foreign Ministry -- which at the 
beginning of the month will send the Foreign Ministry secretary 
general to Washington to attempt, once more, to postpone a 
judgment on the question -- is that the U.S. position is 
sometimes so oblivious to reality that it is comparable to that 
of some Brazilian industrial groups. 
  These national groups are blind to the fact that the economy 
today has a global scope, and that all states do not have equal 
power. On the contrary, the new scope accentuates the 
differences between states. The Americans, on their part, 
appear to be virtually blindfolded in that they fail to realize 
that the Brazilian Government also suffers pressures, and must 
also take the national interests it represents into account. 
  What is important to bear in mind, for as long as the 
Americans do not make a decision, is that the Senate must act if 
it wants to influence foreign policies. You cannot support old 
rhetoric and simply refuse to vote on items that are important 
for our foreign affairs agenda. You cannot implement policies, 
much less foreign policies, by omission -- particularly when on 
the other side of the table is a party that wants action, and 
can demand it by applying sanctions.

  [Text] President Itamar Franco asked today for support from 
the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate for the 
approval of the Social Emergency Fund. 
  President Franco met today for almost three hours with 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the presidents of 
the Chamber of Deputies and Senate to discuss alternatives that 
would guarantee the implementation of the government economic 
plan. 
  Franco delivered a letter to Deputy Inocencio Oliveira and 
Senator Humberto Lucena calling for the urgent approval of the 
constitutional amendment proposal that creates the Social 
Emergency Fund to balance the budget and to maintain a zero 
deficit. With the rejection of the provisional measures 
increasing the income tax rates on large companies and creating 
a control tax on banks, the public treasury will end up with a 
deficit of $410 million. The provisional measures were not 
voted on in Congress for lack of a quorum, and cannot be 
presented again because of the annuity principle [principle by 
which a tax cannot be implemented in the same year it is 
approved by Congress]. 
  Franco says in the letter that he was not only surprised, 
but 
also concerned over congressional approval of a tax increase for 
workers but not for large companies. Franco called for the 
urgent approval of the complementary draft law that increases 
social contributions from the profits of financial institutions, 
and that a constitutional amendment be included in the Social 
Emergency Fund allowing the banks to collect the Social 
Integration Program, PIS. 
  Franco also called for the approval of the 1994 budget with 
the changes proposed by the government. Franco reaffirmed his 
belief that there still is time to reverse positions, and called 
on the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate to 
double their efforts, along with the party.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- Aeronautics Minister Lelio 
Vianna Lobo yesterday confirmed the reactivation of the Piranha 
(MAA-1) Missile-Air-1 project, as anticipated by O ESTADO DE SAO 
PAULO. The Piranhas will be fitted onto patrol fighter planes 
by mid-1996 after being built by the Mectron Engenharia and 
receiving approval from the Navy institutes. This is a priority 
project for the Aeronautics Ministry, which wishes to replace 
the 150 U.S. missiles purchased 20 years ago that still equip 
Brazilian combat planes. Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of 
the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), said that there is the 
possibility of exporting these missiles. The initial production 
capability will be 10 missiles per month. With a fund of $8.8 
million, the Piranha is being developed by engineers from the 
Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA). Mectron will review 
the electronic parts and the missile guide control. As this is 
a teleguided weapon, parts of its plans will be modernized with 
the help of the CTA experts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Zombies Try to Get Moving"] </F>
  [Text] For all candidates not named Luis Inacio Lula da 
Silva, this presidential election year has started out like a 
parade of zombies. The Paubrasil case drove a stake into Paulo 
Maluf's heart. Leonel Brizola is one of the country's least 
popular governors--in the opinion of his own constituency in Rio 
de Janeiro, whose governorship he assumed for the second time in 
1990. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has to deal 
with inflation before he can think about sitting in Itamar 
Franco's chair. In the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party], the parade features multiple personalities and it looks 
as though the show will go on forever. 
  A fugitive from the political arena for nine months, former 
Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia is now being seen fairly 
frequently during the daylight hours. Wednesday he met with top 
PMDB leaders to explain the remarkable evolution of his personal 
wealth during 30 years of his political career. Having wasted 
away to a 6 percent rating in the polls, on his tour of the 
federal capital city Quercia did everything possible to give the 
impression that he can be taken seriously as a candidate for 
Itamar's job. 
  After leaving the PMDB meeting, Quercia had lunch at the 
home 
of former President Jose Sarney, who had spent the previous week 
announcing his resignation from the PMDB on the grounds that 
"ethical impediments" kept him from remaining a member. The 
ethics of the PMDB have not changed at all since then, but 
Sarney stayed in the party, having reached an awkward 
accommodation. "We will make a civic-minded march through this 
country," the former president announced. The duet with Quercia 
was staged to make the public outside think that everything is 
hunky-dory in the party that once was in the trenches of the 
democratic resistance. Pure theatrics. Were it taken seriously, 
Orestes Quercia's explanation of his accumulated wealth, 
estimated at $52 million, would not have turned out as it did. 
  Quercia spent 50 minutes reading a written statement he had 
brought with him. Backed by a partial study done by Trevisan 
Auditors and Consultants, a Sao Paulo company that rendered 
various kinds of services to the Sao Paulo state government 
during Quercia's term in Bandeirantes Palace, Quercia assessed 
his personal fortune at $12 million. He received perfunctory 
applause and left without convincing anyone--not even his 
allies. "Quercia's explanation was competent," said PMDB 
President Luiz Henrique, without explaining whether the former 
governor had been competent in concealing or revealing. The next 
day, in conversations with advisors, Sao Paulo Governor Luiz 
Antonio Fleury Filho spoke frankly of Quercia's performance. "He 
did not change his situation much," the governor said.

<H5>  The Debutante and the Beggar </H5>
  Ibsen Pinheiro has lost 14 kg since the CP [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] began investigating him. Last week, 
Deputy Geddel Vieira broke down and cried during his testimony. 
Imperturbable, Quercia actually scored a point. Although weaker 
than he would have liked, he showed that he has the PMDB under 
his thumb. The party is not in the mood to investigate him, and 
has no figure capable of challenging him. The man who has shrunk 
in stature is former President Sarney. He has gone from 
exhibiting all the charm of the most beautiful debutante at the 
ball to the status of a famished beggar at the bus station. 
Sarney knocked on the door of three different parties (the PTB, 
PP, and PFL) [the Brazilian Labor Party, the Progressive Party, 
and the Liberal Front Party], got support from none of them, and 
decided to stay where he was. He was saved by the bell when 
Quercia commissioned a note from the [PMDB] governors appealing 
to the former president to remain in the party. Six of the seven 
signed the document--the only one who refused was Roberto 
Requiao, of Parana. 
  "If there were any problems in the PMDB, they were solved by 
the solidarity I received," said Sarney. In return, he opened 
the doors of his residence to the former Sao Paulo governor and 
his allies. At the lunch, they ate well and devoured the host's 
credibility as well. With a 12 percent rating in the polls, 
Sarney has so far looked better as senator from Amapa than as 
president of Brazil. Having avoided involvement in minor 
political issues, he had maintained the demeanor of one who is 
more concerned about the dignity of the position he held than 
with fleeting ambition. After looking both ways, and with an eye 
to the opinion polls, he felt he was in a position to run for 
president as the PMDB's candidate against the PT [Workers 
Party]. By consummating his "marriage" to Quercia days after 
announcing the break with the party, he reincarnates the 
personality of Sarney-as-president, undecided between the PMDB 
and the PFL but very determined to win a five-year term at any 
cost. 
<H5>  Mutual Admiration Society </H5>
  The PMDB name ranking highest in the polls is that of former 
Social Security Minister Antonio Britto. He has garnered 12 
percent of expressed voter intentions and the lowest rejection 
rate of any presidential candidate. Because of an opportunity to 
run for governor of Rio Grande do Sul, Britto spent the week 
cloistered at a southern beach and allowed rumors to circulate 
that he had reached an accord with Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], who has 
a 10 percent rating. Britto and Fernando Henrique are old 
allies. While serving in the administration, they worked 
together to force out then-Minister of Health Jamil Haddad. By 
shutting off the funding faucets at Haddad's hospitals, FHC was 
always able to keep Britto's coffers full, thus helping him to 
win the reputation--deserved for other reasons--of being a good 
administrator. 
  Late last year, they talked again about supporting each 
other 
in 1994. "If you decide to run, you may win the support of the 
PMDB in the very first round," Britto suggested. "If the PSDB 
turns out to be in a better position, the vice presidential 
candidate could be someone from the PMDB, a man with your 
qualifications," was FHC's reply. The duo's strategy was 
thwarted by Britto's departure from the cabinet, at Itamar's 
request. But it did not stop the mutual stroking. "There is no 
way I can campaign if I have to sit on the same platform with 
Quercia in Sao Paulo, Newton Cardoso in Minas, and Nilo Coelho 
in Bahia. In that case, I would prefer to run for governor of 
Rio Grande do Sul," Britto told a party colleague. But both 
Britto and Fernando Henrique are mired in the group of potential 
candidates who have not been able to jump out ahead of the 
multitude of those whose approval ratings are below 12 
percent--they are down there with Maluf, Brizola, Sarney, and 
Quercia. The elites are still reeling from the electrifying year 
of 1993 when Fernando Collor went into exile at Casa da Dinda, 
Maluf was run aground by the Paubrasil case, Quercia got 
submerged under the weight of his fortune, and no one could come 
up with a candidate who has a good chance of running for 
Planalto Palace against the "bearded frog" of the PT. 
  Sunday 9 January was the deadline for candidates who will 
run 
for office in October to change their party affiliation. On the 
eve of the deadline, there was heavy traffic in the corridors 
leading to and from the parties. The PSDB reeled in Minister of 
Labor Walter Barelli, a former sympathizer of the PT. Senator 
Albano Franco also went over to the PSDB, and scheduled a 
reunion between the party and his business interests. In the 
tucanos' nest, Albano is perched alongside Tasso 
Jereissati, president of the PSDB and his new partner in the 
competition to supply cellular phone service in the Northeast. 
The PTB, whose candidate for Planalto Palace will be banker and 
Senator Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, also picked up members. 
Minas Governor Helio Garcia disembarked in the party along with 
seven secretaries, nine state deputies, and four federal 
deputies. He arrived with the blessing of President Itamar. 
Garcia promised to accompany Itamar in the presidential campaign 
and, in return, will have the Planalto's support in selecting 
his successor in Minas Gerais. The alliance was formalized last 
Thursday when Jose de Castro, president of Telerj [Rio de 
Janeiro Telecommunications] and a friend of Itamar, joined the 
PTB. 
<H5>  Phantom Candidate </H5>
  Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf makes his appearance in the 
battle of the zombies, but has received negative vibes even 
within his PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. In a recent Ibope 
[Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute] poll, 
members were surveyed to find out who would be the best 
candidate. Maluf ranked first, with 34 percent of the 
preferences. But Senator Jarbas Passarinho, from Para, won 29 
percent of the preferences from PPR members. Passarinho is 
sitting pretty since he took over the chairmanship of the Budget 
CPI, where he has done a fine job. Another potential candidate 
who has done nothing but lose ground is Rio de Janeiro Governor 
Leonel Brizola; at 9 percent in the polls, he is a phantom 
candidate. A survey by DataFolha found 54 percent of Rio de 
Janeiro State voters describing his administration as ranging 
between poor and awful--not exactly the kind of resume that 
would withstand a campaign. 
  With so many phantoms around him, the PT candidate is in a 
relatively comfortable position. He is now entitled to discuss 
his plans for governing. Sometimes, this hinders more than it 
helps. Last week, one of the coordinators of the PT's platform 
for the presidency, editor Cesar de Queiroz Benjamin, a former 
colleague of Captain Carlos Lamarca in the MR-8 [8 October 
Revolutionary Movement] terrorist organization, made a gesture 
toward the military. In an interview published by FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO, Benjamin insisted that the PT plans to quadruple the 
Armed Forces budget, raising it from 0.5 to 2 percent of GDP. He 
also said he was in favor of the development of nuclear 
technology, coded language that, in military circles, means 
supporting the development of an atomic bomb. To top it off, 
Benjamin stated that the PT is in favor of a moratorium on 
paying the foreign debt, discussing repayment of the domestic 
debt, and suspending the privatization program. A week earlier, 
Lula had given an interview to the NEW YORK TIMES, the most 
influential U.S. newspaper. 
  Lula came to the end of 1993 after visiting 300 cities in 
the 
course of three caravan tours that covered more than 10,000 km 
of Brazil's highways, and having held 56 meetings with groups of 
businessmen, bankers, and industrialists. Between now and April 
1994 he will make four more caravan tours and will try to find a 
vice presidential candidate that can broaden the appeal of his 
slate--his hope, less enthusiastically shared by the other 
party--is tucano Tasso Jereissatti. Predicting the 
results of the balloting nine months ahead of time would be an 
exercise in astrology. All we can say is that so far, all we 
have is Lula--and a string of contenders desperately trying to 
emerge as the candidate able to challenge him.

  [Text] Brazil will support the establishment of a free 
trade zone encompassing the Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] countries -- Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil -- and 
Bolivia. This was announced by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim, who added that the free trade zone should be established 
in 1994. 
  The establishment of the free trade zone between Bolivia and 
Mercosur countries was decided during the presidential summit 
held earlier this month in the city of Colonia, Uruguay.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil and Argentina will create two new 
commissions: one for economic and commercial affairs and one 
for integration and cooperation affairs. In addition, they will 
study other ways to promote contacts between lawmakers, 
academicians, and entrepreneurs. 
  Diplomatic teams from Brazil and Argentina ended a meeting 
on 
Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro. The main issues addressed at the 
meeting were the political, economic, and commercial relations 
between the two countries; Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
affairs; the coming into force of NAFTA; Argentina's intention 
to create a peace operations center; and the Brazilian desire to 
study a similar initiative for the purpose of promoting the 
approach between the military of the two countries. 
  The Brazilian team was headed by Foreign Ministry Secretary 
General Roberto Abdenur, whose interlocutor was Argentine Vice 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella. The meetings were also 
attended by officials in charge of the economic and political 
planning areas of the two foreign ministries. 
  According to Abdenur, the idea is to create a true system of 
consultation so that integration reaches not only the 
governments but also other social sectors. In order to show the 
degree of proximity between the two governments, Abdenur said 
that presidents Itamar Franco and Carlos Menem have already met 
seven times. 
<H5>  Warren Christopher </H5>
  Argentine and Brazilian diplomats also agreed on the 
significance of the conference of nations of the hemisphere that 
the U.S. Government has proposed for this year. Concerning the 
postponement of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
visit to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela, 
Abdenur said that no specific date had been established for the 
tour, and that it should be made in the near future.

reported that 19 Brazilian Armed Forces officers left on 28 
January for Mozambique to join the UN peacekeeping mission under 
way in that country. 
  These Brazilian Army and Air Force officers will replace 
colleagues who have already served one year of peacekeeping duty 
and are about to return to Brazil. 
  Some 146 Brazilian military and police officers are carrying 
out nonmilitary duties -- observation, medical support and 
management -- in five of the 14 UN peacekeeping operations. 
Brazilians are working in Angola, El Salvador, Mozambique, the 
former Yugoslavia and on the Rwanda-Uganda border. 
  The Brazilian Government has asked Congress for permission 
to 
increase its contribution to the peacekeeping force in 
Mozambique by sending 25 police officers and 100 Army privates.

  [Text] Another large group of peasants has already reached 
the corner of 7th Avenue and Roosevelt Street in the Zone 11. 
Here with us is someone who will give us some details about the 
demonstration. It is already headed downtown. It left the 
assembly area approximately 15 minutes ago. They said they are 
headed downtown, and will pass by the Supreme Court of Justice 
and the Congress and will wind up at the National Palace. Let 
us listen: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified person, shouting] [Words 
indistinct] 
  [Celis] What is your name? 
  [Tilin] Juan Tilin. 
  [Celis] Why is this large number of peasants demonstrating? 
  [Tilin] This is one of the demonstrations scheduled for 
today 
to continue to demand that the Government provide a concrete 
response to the petition we presented on 16 November demanding a 
minimum wage for farm workers. We made the formal request on 16 
November to the government, to the Labor Ministry, to the proper 
officials so that we would get better wages for farm workers in 
view of the difficult moment we are experiencing. The most 
difficult economic situation is evidenced in the farms along the 
southern coast, in farms in diverse parts of the country where 
the workers don't even receive minimum wages. Furthermore, the 
treatment accorded to the workers is infrahuman. The Labor 
Ministry has done nothing up to now. That is the reason for 
this demonstration. [end recording] 
  [Celis] We can tell you that at El Trebol there is a large 
group of peasants of the GAM [Mutual Support Group] who are 
waiting for the two groups coming from Aguilar Batres and 
Roosevelt Avenues to join them in order to march together to 
downtown. As we reported earlier, another large group of 
peasants is marching on the Salvador highway and another on the 
highway to the Atlantic. They will meet at the National Palace 
to submit their petitions to the president and tell him about 
the problems the farm workers in the interior are experiencing.

  [Text] Alirio Cifuentes, secretary of the Judicial Branch 
Workers Union [STOJ], says that peasants who have loans with the 
Penny Foundation [Fundacion del Centavo] will not budge from the 
U.S. embassy until their problems are definitively resolved. 
  [Begin Cifuentes recording] The peasants who arrived from 
different communities are still standing across from the U.S. 
Embassy building, waiting for an answer from delegates appointed 
by the president of the Republic to mediate the conflict. The 
meeting is taking place at the Labor Ministry with the 
participation of the labor and agriculture ministers, a human 
rights ombudsman delegate, and, of course, delegates from the 
Penny Foundation, AID, and STOJ. 
  The worrisome part of this issue is that the U.S. Embassy 
has 
refused to examine the conflict in a reasonable manner. AID is 
part of the United States of America, it is part of the U.S. 
Embassy, and if AID donated $11 million to the Penny Foundation 
to set the land project in motion, we cannot explain why it is 
now claiming that it is not in any way involved in the conflict, 
which it says is strictly between the STOJ, peasants, and the 
Penny Foundation. 
  The embassy tells us that if there are any problems we 
should 
file a lawsuit at the competent courts but our position is that 
the funds donated to the Penny Foundation should be supervised 
by AID, which is part of the U.S. Embassy. [end recording]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- According to 
the government, today's strike called by Guatemalan public 
administration workers to demand a 40 percent salary increase 
and to reject the upcoming Sunday referendum was "a failure." 
The unions, however, called the strike "a success." There were 
no violent incidents during the strike. Official sources report 
that the central government has approximately 180,000 employees, 
with another 100,000 from decentralized institutions. 
  Meanwhile, the government called the protest movement 
intended to undermine the referendum a "failure." If approved, 
it will make possible reforming the Constitution to hold the 
parliamentary elections ahead of schedule, change the Supreme 
Court of Justice magistrates, and reduce the president's term 
from five to four years. 
  Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz has reported that work in 
government institutions is proceeding normally, with the 
exception of two or three of them. Ortiz said the union leaders 
made the mistake of calling the strike for political reasons 
rather than labor-related reasons and this is what caused the 
strike to fail. 
  Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the National 
Federation 
of State Workers Unions, told the press that 90 percent of the 
workers went on strike and that the protest will be resumed 
Monday if their demands are not met.

  [Text] Unsitragua [Guatemalan Workers' Trade Union] leader 
Byron Morales today stated that Guatemalan workers do not care 
about the results of the referendum; instead, what they really 
want is the resignation of the deputies. 
  Morales, who participated in a demonstration across from the 
Congress building, indicated that the constitutional reforms do 
not attempt to resolve public problems. Rather, they attempt to 
resolve the private problems of politicians who want to remain 
in power forever.

<F P=106> [Report by Willie Melgar from the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Dozens of peasants from the southern coast and other 
regions this morning participated in a demonstration to demand 
higher salaries for agricultural work. Roadblocks were erected 
at the end of the Raul Aguilar Batres Road, in Zone 12 of the 
capital, where the demonstrators also burned many tires. 
  It was reported that peasants, who are traveling to the 
capital from other regions to demand a daily minimum pay of 20 
quetzals, are staging similar demonstrations. A witness reported 
that this morning's demonstration on the Raul Aguilar Batres 
Road nearly caused a fight between the demonstrators and 
residents of the El Mesquital neighborhood. 
  Meanwhile, several terrorist devices planted near power 
pylons were defused the evening of 27 January. The police made 
this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified police official] In the past 
few hours, based on people's calls and reports, and thanks to 
the citizens' cooperation, we were able to defuse a bomb planted 
near one of the pylons in Villanueva. We can see it from here. 
Bomb technicians defused this bomb at 0200 because of the 
possible damage it could have caused to nearby houses. This 
device contained aluminized [aluminizada] gunpowder, which is 
what has been used to damage the pylons. 
  We found wire used for electrical installations. We found 
the 
power source: a nine-volt battery. We found part of a timing 
device. As you can see, this is a clock face. This was found at 
the downed pylon in Barcenas-Villanueva. We also found 
electrical wire and a timing device, which included this clock, 
at the pylon in Zone 18 in Las Ilusiones. 
  This debris suggests a time bomb was involved. These is the 
debris found at two places. Bomb technicians, honoring their 
motto to protect the citizens, have worked around the clock and 
have shown up wherever they were needed. 
  Five explosive devices of this sort were defused at Los 
Antojitos Restaurant on Roosevelt Road at 0800 today. You can 
see them here. We urge citizens to continue to help us. We want 
them to call the telephone numbers that were announced. We do 
not want them to take any chances because we are ready to defuse 
such devices at any time. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] where were they found? 
  [Police official] All the bombs shown here were among those 
defused in urban and rural areas. The work was done by explosive 
technicians. We are showing them to the citizens to ensure they 
can identify such devices. We want them to report any findings. 
We do not want them to take any risks. Above all, we want them 
to warn children, who have been the main victims so far. This 
was the case in the grenade explosions in Mazatenango. We want 
to prevent this. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, peasant organizations from the countryside and 
southern coast marched today toward Guatemala City to demand a 
wage of 22.4 quetzals for countryside workers. The peasant 
organizations want national and international human rights 
groups, especially the United Nations and International Labor 
Organization, to pay attention to their problems. 
  Leaflets distributed during the demonstration carried 
messages like: We denounce the unjust and shameful starvation 
wages paid by farm owners in the rural areas of Coban, Alta 
Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Peten, and Izabal. We demand that 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio decree a 22.4 quetzal wage 
increase for peasants right away because his goal is to fight 
poverty, which is what he has repeatedly claimed in the media. 
We demand the freedom to organize, mobilize, demonstrate, and 
speak out in keeping with Articles 34 and 35 as well as other 
articles of the Constitution. 
  We say no to [word indistinct] and forced recruitment. We 
say 
no to the popular referendum because it is another attempt to 
deceive the people and because the people are not allowed to 
participate. 
  People: Do not allow the same people to deceive us. Join the 
struggle because it is the only path. Unican [expansion unknown] 
is here!

  [Begin De Leon Carpio recording] I have a great deal of

<F P=106> [Message to the Guatemalan people from President Ramiro de </F>
Leon Carpio; issued in Guatemala City on 28 January; broadcast 
in progress -- read by presidential spokesman Felix Loarta 
Guzman] 
  [Text] ...very similar to the various proposals made by the 
Guatemalan Government. 
  The new Honduran president talked about his firm commitment 
in favor of a moral revolution, and he spoke about his 
determination to fight corruption and impunity. He also 
outlined the basic principles of the new Honduran Government, 
such as austerity, honesty, and integrity, and the decision to 
initiate a great crusade against poverty. 
  The multitude that gathered at the stadium in Honduras -- 
the 
people of our sister nation -- showed their friendliness to the 
Guatemalan president with an enthusiastic ovation at his 
entrance and departure. 
  This afternoon, President de Leon Carpio returned from 
Tegucigalpa very grateful for the expressions of affection and 
solidarity he received from the Honduran people and government. 
The changeover of presidents in a democratic manner in our 
region is one of the most important factors to gradually 
consolidating the process of integration in Central America. 
  In Honduras, the president also had the opportunity to meet 
with several heads of state and government representatives from 
friendly nations who expressed their support for the efforts 
conducted by the Guatemalan people in favor of democracy. 
  The U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs met this morning with President de Leon Carpio in 
Tegucigalpa, and he expressed the firm support from the 
government of President Bill Clinton for the aspirations of 
peace, development, and democracy in Guatemala. He received the 
same expressions of support from the prime minister of the 
Republic of China, Venezuelan officials, and from the Spanish 
justice minister. The entire international community is 
supporting the achievements made in Guatemala to consolidate the 
government within the framework of legality. 
  Therefore, upon returning to Guatemala and learning about 
the 
unfortunate incidents, particularly about the cowardly actions 
carried out by terrorist groups trying to create unrest among 
the Guatemalan people, the president condemned these actions. 
He also noted that both our people and the people of the world 
condemn these actions, because they represent an attack against 
democracy. 
  The Guatemalan president is a man who respects the laws and 
Constitution. Therefore, he immediately issued instructions to 
the state security agencies to fight terrorist groups according 
to the law. Nevertheless, President de Leon feels the best way 
to counter those who are acting against democracy is by working 
together -- the people and the government -- and report those 
who are planting the bombs. 
  The sense of awareness and repudiation of terrorism is very 
high. Thanks to the cooperation of many people of goodwill, we 
have managed to deactivate several bombs. 
  As a democratic president, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
is 
issuing a call to all of the people of Guatemala to defend the 
institutions and to reject provocations by those who, while 
hiding behind anonymity, are trying to make the country return 
to the sad disgraceful days of abuse against fundamental rights. 
The truth is that people no longer want to return to the past. 
Guatemalans want to live in peace, and therefore they reject 
violence. 
  The president was very sad to learn about the victims of the 
terrorist actions. All of this must come to an end in Guatemala. 
  The president has instructed the civilian forces, with the 
Army's support, to reinforce all measures to ensure every 
citizen's safety. The government will act firmly, yet within the 
Constitution's framework. 
  The president of the Republic also wants to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the state workers for their profound 
common sense in ignoring the leaders' unauthorized call to 
declare a general strike in the public administration. The state 
workers did not comply with the agitators and kept on working as 
normal. This shows we are maturing. The Guatemalan people want 
peace. All Guatemalans reject the attempts to destabilize the 
country. 
  Finally, the president of the Republic appeals to the people 
who are being used to plant terrorist bombs. The president wants 
to tell them they are causing great damage. They have left a 
trail of victims and damage. Power outages have irritated the 
population. Also, the damage caused on the electric 
infrastructure is considerable. The terrorists are hurting the 
people. This is why the people reject them. 
  The president hereby asks the Guatemalan people to turn a 
deaf ear on reports of bridges being blown up and bombs being 
planted. He also asks bus and truck drivers to be sensible, to 
keep talking with the government delegates, and to forget the 
idea of striking next week. The possibility of reaching an 
agreement through talks should be explored to its fullest. He 
also asks the Guatemalan people to remain firm and move the 
country forward. The only way to rebuild a Guatemala with social 
justice is with the Constitution and democracy. Thank you.

  [Text] Army spokeswoman Major Berta Vargas de Marroquin 
blamed URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] guerrillas 
for the recent terrorist actions because it was URNG members who 
planted the powerful bombs on electricity pylons located 
throughout Guatemala City at 2100. She pointed out that these 
bombs caused blackouts and left people without lights. 
  Vargas de Marroquin noted that, by perpetrating these 
criminal actions, URNG members endanger the physical safety of 
the population, destroy the country's infrastructure, hurt 
private citizens by depriving them of indispensable electrical 
power, and cause considerable financial losses to the industrial 
sector and the population in general.

  [Text] Yesterday, Army spokesperson Berta Edith Vargas de 
Marroquin reported the National Army will carry out a "military 
control at a distance" operation in the capital's area given the 
upcoming referendum on Sunday. 
  The Government Ministry is responsible for the citizens' 
safety in order for the people to be able to exercise their 
right to vote in an appropriate atmosphere, although the Army is 
providing its cooperation in a coordinated way. 
  The actions will include patrols along roads used by people 
traveling from one place to another, and the number of Army 
forces will be increased accordingly in certain areas. Although 
she did not specify the number of soldiers that would directly 
participate in this operation, she said a special operation has 
become traditional for electoral events in recent years. She 
also said tranquillity and a peaceful electoral process should 
be expected on Sunday due to the work done by civilian security 
and military forces. 
  Members of the Attorney General's Office reported certain 
people have plans to obstruct the referendum; they said it 
involves groups that are interested is preventing the event. 
They added: Investigations conducted into recent terrorist 
attacks indicate unfortunate events may occur on Sunday, 30 
January. Therefore, a contingency plan was prepared to guarantee 
the Guatemalan people's safety. 
  Carlos Alvarez, a member of the Public Prosecutor's Office, 
and Claudio Porres, investigations director at the Attorney 
General's Office, said the plan will be executed on a national 
level and will include all security forces. 
  Public prosecutors and investigators will also be deployed 
in 
strategic areas so they may immediately proceed to arrest people 
or groups found perpetrating criminal actions. The officials 
said: Likewise, we have information that members of the 
government worker unions will carry out demonstrations, but they 
will be immediately arrested and arraigned if they violate the 
law. "We trust the groups that have called for demonstrations 
will reconsider their decision and allow the people to freely 
cast their ballots so everything may be carried out normally," 
Alvarez and Porres said.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The Army has 
accused the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) of 
being responsible for dynamiting electricity high-tension pylons 
and for placing bombs in commercial establishments, resulting in 
at least three people being wounded during the past hours. 
  The Information and Press Department of the Army (Dide) has 
stated the URNG has caused the wave of terrorist attacks taking 
place throughout the country on the eve of the 30 January 
referendum to reform the country's Constitution. 
  "With these criminal actions, the URNG is endangering the 
people's personal safety, destroying the country's 
infrastructure, and causing countless industrial damages," the 
Army has stated. 
  According to the Dide, the guerrillas are seeking to 
intimidate the people to prevent them from participating in the 
referendum, because the URNG opposes Guatemalans expressing 
their desire to vote. 
  The Armed Forces communique also states the URNG is seeking 
to imply that they are still active and give the international 
appearance that Guatemala is undergoing a reign of violence. 
  According to National Institute of Electrification (Inde) 
sources, losses resulting from the dynamite attacks surpass 2 
million quetzals (approximately $340,000). 
  The Army has implemented operations and is maintaining 
security measures along bridges and electricity high-tension 
pylons to prevent further attacks, Dide Spokesperson Major Edith 
Vargas has said. 
  The referendum scheduled to take place tomorrow aims to 
ensure the approval of reforms to 48 articles of the 
Constitution, such as rescheduling parliamentary elections for 
an earlier date, changing the Supreme Court of Justice, and 
shortening the presidential term from five to four years. 
  Guatemala is the only Central American country where 
guerrilla activity, which began in 1960, still persists.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (DPA) -- Guatemalan guerrilla 
leader Angel Garcia de la Cruz, 31, whose nom de guerre is 
"Lieutenant Ramiro," died during clashes between rebels and 
Guatemalan Government forces, military spokesman Major Edith 
Vargas reported today. 
  According to the Army, the deceased was one of the most 
important members of the "Javier Tambriz" rebel front from the 
Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms, one of the 
four rebel groups that comprise the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity. The "Javier Tambriz" front took its name 
from a guerrilla leader. 
  According to Marroquin, "Lieutenant Ramiro" was a lieutenant 
of "Gaspar Ilom," (Rodrigo Asturias), one of the four principle 
guerrilla leaders and son of Miguel Angel Asturias, recipient of 
the 1967 Nobel Prize for Literature. 
  The clashes between the guerrillas and the Army have 
intensified in the past weeks in the southwestern and 
northwestern part of the country.

  [Text] A bloody clash took place in the (Ixcandla Grande) 
area, third village, where a military detachment was transferred 
a few days ago in observance of the agreements with the 
repatriated and organizations that work for them. 
  The Guatemalan Information and Press Department of the Army 
[Dide] reports that yesterday at 0120 a gang of criminals 
cowardly attacked with rifle fire and RPG-7 rocket launchers the 
troops guarding communities in the area of (Mayalan), 
(Ixcanche), where five soldiers were killed and three more were 
seriously wounded. 
  This took place a few kilometers away from the last 
repatriation depot, which makes apparent, the Guatemalan Army 
states, the lack of resolve to reach a peaceful agreement for a 
solution to the domestic armed conflict. 
  Dide reports the soldiers killed are Corporal Efrain 
Gonzalez 
Ramirez; Soldiers First Class Luciano Perez Chua and Jesus 
Arturo Najera Perez; and Soldiers Second Class Valdemar 
Hernandez Jimenez and Edgar Benjamin Guevara. 
  The Guatemalan Army is informing the local and international 
public opinion of this cowardly act by URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] criminal terrorists so that the people may 
judge and condemn these stateless people, identified by the 
limited outlook of their criminal minds. 
  The Guatemalan Army bulletin adds that it deeply regrets the 
death of the five soldiers who gave their lives to the 
fatherland in the line of their sacred duty, and the Army 
extends its sincerest condolences to family and friends, praying 
for Christian resignation.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (AFP) -- Calm prevails in 
Guatemala tonight a few hours before the beginning of the 
referendum on constitutional reforms despite the tension on 28 
January. A Guatemala Fire Department spokesperson told AFP that 
"it has been one of the calmest days" the capital has ever 
experienced. Meanwhile, few vehicles are circulating in the 
streets. 
  On 28 January there was a great deal of tension and it was 
even announced there might be a fuel shortage. This led to 
hundreds of Guatemalans going to gasoline stations to fill their 
vehicles for the next few days. Nevertheless, the supply of 
gasoline has been normal, despite the announcement of a 
transportation strike next week, which, according to 
transportation owners, might provoke a fuel shortage. 
  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today warned that 
"we will intervene with transportation if it is halted." He also 
reiterated that the yes vote will win in tomorrow's referendum. 
  Polls indicate the yes vote will win. The constitutional 
reform will move up the election of a new Congress to this year. 
Nevertheless, uncertainty continues regarding the abstention 
rate in the referendum.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemala's 
polling stations opened their doors at 0700 (1300 GMT) today, 
Sunday, so that 3.4 million potential voters may have their say 
in the 1985 constitutional reform proposal. 
  If the yes vote wins, the Constitution will be changed and 
the legislative elections will be moved up, the Supreme Court of 
Justice will be changed, and the term for holders of public 
office will be reduced, among other measures. 
  Approximately 20 international observers, delegates from 
human rights organizations, and police and Army forces are 
watching so that the referendum will be held normally. The 
referendum has been preceded by a wave of bomb attacks in recent 
days. No one has claimed credit for these attacks. 
  President Ramiro de Leon and the Congress deputies have 
agreed on a referendum to end the confrontation the executive 
branch and Congress had last year, when congressmen refused to 
resign as the chief of state had asked to "purge" institutional 
corruption. 
  De Leon and the country's most important political parties 
have called for a "yes" vote to the reforms, but the left and 
the guerrillas--the only ones left in Central America and that 
have been armed since 1960--have urged the people to abstain 
from voting and to boycott the referendum, because they do not 
believe it will resolve the country's political and economic 
problems.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- According to 
several sources, the first hour of voting has been characterized 
by abstention and guerrilla propaganda against the 
constitutional reforms being voted on today in Guatemala in a 
referendum. 
  Alleged Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) 
members scattered fliers in the city's outskirts calling on the 
people to reject the reforms. 
  Several streets were littered during the predawn hours with 
other fliers in favor of the reforms. 
  Campaigning in favor or against the 43 constitutional 
reforms 
was prohibited by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) since 
noon 28 January. 
  TSE Magistrate Mario Guerra Roldan has said to carry out any 
campaigning either for the "yes" or "no" vote, which includes 
moving ahead the date of the legislative elections, is against 
the electoral process. 
  Meanwhile, abstention marks the first hour of voting, and 
according to radio reports, the number of people who have gone 
to polling stations installed in various schools in Guatemala 
City averaged between three to seven.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Wong from the Parque de la Industria </F>
Information Center polling station] 
  [Text] There are citizens at the voting center, but very 
few, we have noticed. I also want to report that this morning's 
transportation service was very scarce. Very few vehicles were 
operating. The people going to the various voting centers in 
the capital to vote are doing so timidly. 
  We have an interview with Jose Pinzon, secretary general of 
the CGTG [Guatemalan Workers General Central Organization], who 
will give us his opinion about what is happening at Parque de la 
Industria. 
  [Begin Pinzon recording] There is an average of three voters 
per voting booth. We have toured the place. The CGTG is an 
observer in this popular consultation event. 
  At the voting booths we have visited, there is barely an 
average of three voters per booth, meaning, there is no 
enthusiasm. The people of the capital are stating no opinion. 
We do not know what is happening at other voting places, in the 
downtown area. We are going there. Anyhow, I believe the 
people are pessimistic and frustrated about the reforms to the 
Constitution, because they believe they have not been prepared 
clearly or honestly. 
  We do hope the people vote, to decide their own future in 
this issue. It is not good for the people to abstain from 
participation. They have been invited to abstain, but we believe 
this is negative, because to abstain from voting favors the 
reforms to the Constitution and this would be fatal to the 
Constitution, which has always represented some kind of social 
pact among Guatemalans [sentence as heard]. If this social pact 
is reformed, the pact would be broken. We do not think it is 
positive to remain home. [end recording]

  [Text] In Coatepeque, thank God, everything is normal. 
Polling stations opened at 0700. We visited the National 
Police and the Treasury Police. We will first listen to 
Coatepeque Police Chief Patrocinio Benjamin de Leon: 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...to work out 
without problems and to allow the security of all citizens and 
Coatepeque voters. 
  [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders or terrorist 
attacks 
in your municipal jurisdiction? 
  [De Leon] Everything is going normally, thank God, and 
thanks 
to the security afforded by the National Police and the Army, 
with whom we have worked closely in addition to the municipal 
police. 
  [Espinoza] Is there any sort of special recommendation you 
would like to make to the people? 
  [De Leon] Only that they remain calm and behave the best 
they 
can to ensure that these elections benefit our Guatemala. That 
is what we wish. 
  [Espinoza] We are now in the office of Luis Everardo Soto, 
Coatepeque Treasury Police chief, who will give us important 
information on the sale of liquor. From what time were liquor 
sales suspended? 
  [Soto] Everyone who sells liquor and beer was told sales 
have 
been suspended from 1200 [as heard] onward until 0600 on Monday. 
The idea is to afford greater control during this referendum. 
Regarding security, this has been coordinated with the National 
Police. All the necessary security has been rendered since the 
day the election papers and ballots arrived in the municipality. 
Today we also have, in addition to the Treasury Police, the 
National Police. 
  [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders, or is everything 
normal up to now? 
  [Soto] Everything is normal up to now. I do not know if we 
are going to have any type of problems later. 
  [Espinoza] What recommendations would you like to make to 
our 
listeners? 
  [Soto] That they continue to behave the same way they have 
done up to now, so as to avoid any problems. [end recording]

and the people are participating. 
  [Reporter] But participation.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] We do not know that yet because

Court, and the restructuring of [word indistinct]. This will be 
the first.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct]. 
  [De Leon] Political stability and calm that will allow us to 
govern and to face important social and economic problems 
through a government plan we have drafted. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, do you have any preliminary report 
from the interior? 
  [De Leon] Of course. Fortunately everything is going 
normally, calmly. We do not know how many people are voting, 
but the truth is that despite all the terrorist problems, 
obstacles, pressure, and efforts to boycott the event, the 
referendum is taking place. The fact that the event is taking 
place strengthens the democratic system, because this is an 
example to the world. While in other countries domestic 
problems are resolved antidemocratically, through violence, here 
in Guatemala we are resolving this national political problem 
democratically, the most sacred way the people have as the 
expression of their sovereignty: through votes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zapaca Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza) and </F>
Antonio Ramirez Rivas, president of the Department Electoral 
Board, by reporter Elias Castro at the Department Electoral 
Board Headquarters in Zapaca--live] 
  [Text] [Castro] We now have a report from the Department 
Electoral Board Headquarters. We have statements by the Zapaca 
Department governor as well as by Antonio Ramirez Rivas, 
president of the Department Electoral Board. We will listen 
first to Governor (Augusto Cesar Riaza's) comments on this 
event. The department governor will now address our listeners 
via Emisoras Unidas, and he will let us know if any incidents 
have occurred and announce any other information he can provide 
concerning the referendum. Good morning, Mr. Governor; the 
microphones are yours. 
  [Riaza] Since the voting centers opened this morning at 
0700, 
voting throughout the ten municipalities has been taking place 
quite peacefully. We know of no abnormal incidents that could 
tarnish the referendum. 
  [Castro] Mr. Governor, have you traveled throughout the 
other 
municipalities or just certain ones? 
  [Riaza] I personally toured three municipalities, but some 
of 
ny assistants are keeping me abreast of what is developing in 
the various municipalities. They have advised me that voting is 
taking place quite normally and that there are no problems now. 
We expect [words indistinct] there has been low voters turnout 
in certain places. I believe this is because it is still too 
early. About 10 or 20 minutes ago we received reports from 
[word indistinct], where only 6 percent of the total number of 
voters has already voted. 
  [Castro] Mr. Governor, we have observed security forces near 
the voting centers. Have you received any special instructions 
in this regard? 
  [Riaza] Yes we did. The security forces have been placed 
near the voting centers. According to a request by the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE], the security agents will not be 
stationed inside the voting centers, but they are close by 
should any incident take place. As I already mentioned, no 
incidents have occurred so far. 
  [Castro] I appreciate the information provided by Governor 
(Augusto Cesar Riaza) and his participation here today. The 
Department Electoral Board president will now state why the 
Zapaca voting centers will be closing at 1700 and cite other 
information he can about the voting centers. 
  [Ramirez] First of all, I would like to thank you for the 
opportunity to address the Guatemalan people. You are always 
where the news is to be found. I would like to say the 
legislation regulating the referendum and the political parties 
allows us to establish when voting is to conclude. Considering 
the events that have been taking place during the past days 
regarding attacks and the possibility that electricity may be 
cut, we have decided it would be better to conclude at 1700, 
because there will still be enough light at that time, and we 
will be able to receive information from the voting centers. We 
have already issued a press bulletin in which we officially 
announced that voting will conclude at 1700. So far, the 
municipalities have reported that voting is taking place quite 
normally and peacefully. Our observers have noted, however, low 
voter turnout. By 1000, our observer at Rio Hondo reported that 
only 200 voters had participated. 
  [Castro] Will we be having another report soon, and what 
time 
will it take place? [Ramirez] I would like to say, according 
to information I have received, every municipal Electoral Board 
president must report to us by 1400 and 1600. They must notify 
us via telephone.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Celis Marroquin] </F>
  [Text] We are in Belen, where Vice President Arturo 
Herbruger is preparing to vote at voting booth No. 28. The vice 
president is voting just as the president of the Republic 
already voted at the center in the university assembly hall. 
While the vice president is voting we would like to say at this 
time the city looks very crowded, and there is much traffic. We 
also observed that there are several buses parked directly in 
front of the mayor's office. We do not know why so many buses 
are parked there, given we have not seen any municipal officer 
around the area. 
  As we said, the city seems increasingly crowded. Numerous 
individuals are starting to approach the voting centers located 
throughout the city. The vice president of the Republic is with 
us now, and he will comment on the referendum taking place. 
  [Herbruger] My first impression is that it is quite 
favorable. There are not too many people at this time, but 
neither is the place deserted. There are many people right now. 
I believe as the day progresses, voter turnout will increase. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe the campaign against 
the referendum had anything to do with the low voter turnout? 
  [Herbruger] I cannot say anything about that specific issue, 
because anything on which I may comment may be interpreted as 
propaganda. [laughs] 
  [Reporter] It is possible, however, to see propaganda 
against 
the referendum scattered throughout the street. Can you comment 
on that? 
  [Herbruger] I have not seen anything. As I was driving from 
my home, there was not much traffic, and I did not see any 
garbage or propaganda scattered about the streets. 
  [Reporter] How do you believe this process is being viewed 
internationally? 
  [Herbruger] I believe it is being viewed positively, because 
it is the first time a referendum is taking place in Guatemala 
in order to approve constitutional reforms; in this respect, I 
believe that internationally it is going to be viewed favorably.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan Education Minister Celestino Tay </F>
Coyoy by Lucia Dubon, at the Parque La Industria voting station 
in Guatemala City--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Dubon] Good morning, Mr. Minister. 
  [Tay] Good morning. I am here to say, regarding the civic 
event taking place this morning, this has been a somewhat chilly 
morning and that I think this has had some impact on the people. 
I was in the west side, in the Santa Teresita area, where I 
voted, and I was told not many people had gone to vote. There 
were lines of approximately 40 voters per voting booth. When I 
was leaving I noticed that more people were going to vote. 
[passage omitted] 
  This is a very important moment for all the people of 
Guatemala, because our democracy is beginning to consolidate. A 
very important point has been made: In spite of the conflicts 
and crises we have endured, we have overcome them rationally, 
via dialogues. I believe this civic event, this voting, is very 
important. We must take advantage of this opportunity to speak 
out about in which direction we think the government should go. 
This is why I am inviting Guatemalans to fulfill their civic 
duties. 
  [Dubon] What do you think about the Congress president 
saying 
that regardless of the referendum result there should be a 
rapprochement between the executive and legislative branches, 
which have had confrontations that have produced the political 
crisis the country is enduring? 
  [Tay] Regarding the yes or no vote, I think it is important 
that Guatemalans speak out on this, because they have the right 
to do this to develop democracy. I think we all want to 
overcome the errors of the past, and this must be the framework 
of our civic behavior at this moment. Regarding the Congress 
president's statement that there has been a growing apart 
between the two branches, what happens is that the origin of the 
executive branch is different from that of the legislative 
branch. [passage omitted] 
  [Dubon] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the attacks? 
What influence will they have on the referendum? What about the 
leaflets that have circulated after the deadline for written 
propaganda? 
  [Tay] I have no information about the leaflets. I was in the 
interior yesterday, dedicating a school, in San Antonio, 
speaking with the teachers and the community. They were highly 
motivated. You know, the towns of San Antonio and Santa Catalina 
are places [words indistinct] enjoying the beauty of [words 
indistinct]. The people there are growingly in favor of 
pacification. I heard that [words indistinct]. 
  There is an environment of fear in the capital, however. I 
think the media have also contributed to the creation of this 
atmosphere in the capital. 
  This morning, when I left home, certain people recommended 
that I not go too far away from the capital. I think this is a 
contradiction, because it is here where there is this atmosphere 
due to the attacks, due to those who think the people would not 
participate in the referendum. 
  I think this is, definitely, very negative, and the 
Guatemalan people should realize this and not approve of that 
kind of behavior; otherwise, how are we going to develop? 
  I think we Guatemalans must improve ourselves. Those who 
have carried out the attacks have committed a crime against the 
fatherland, because they harm the country. What they are doing 
is very grave. 
  We have to draw energy from our inner strength, because we 
are Guatemalans who are uprighteous, who are working for the 
people who want honesty and calm. I think honesty and calm must 
permeate through all Guatemalans so that we all, together, in an 
environment of reason, justice, and equity can march forward, 
because the country must progress. 
  This country must get out of the crisis and reach the 
development levels we all want. This is what everybody says; 
for this reason, I think it is very important that this morning 
we Guatemalans speak out, aware of the fact that we are part of 
this democracy.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio denied here today that he could 
resign from his post should Guatemalans reject his 
constitutional reform package revoking the mandate of Congress' 
116 deputies and nine Supreme Court justices. 
  Speaking at the University Auditorium (in this capital's 
Zone 
One), where he cast his vote, the president said he trusts the 
referendum will strengthen the democratic system, which was 
negatively affected by the foiled self-coup d'etat by Jorge 
Serrano Elias. 
  De Leon said this morning voting is taking place within the 
framework of "political calm." Meanwhile, the Defense and 
Government Ministries have mobilized at least 24,000 troops 
throughout the country. 
  The president said he is happy with the way Guatemalans are 
participating, because "the referendum is taking place as 
planned" despite terrorist activities. 
  He said: "The referendum represents an example to the world, 
because while in other countries, political crisis are resolved 
in antidemocratic and violent ways; here in Guatemala electoral 
mechanisms are wielded to resolve problems." 
  Referring to the threat of a transportation stoppage on 1 
February, de Leon Carpio said: If necessary, "I will check it." 
He cautioned: "I will assume my responsibilities with whatever 
measure I may have to adopt in the economic, social, and 
political fields." 
  De Leon discarded, however, utilization of the Army to 
guarantee power and staples for the Guatemalans. Regarding this 
Sunday's referendum, he said there are many covert groups (which 
he did not identify) that are interested in the democratic 
system not gaining strength. 
  He cautioned that if the "no" vote wins and should public 
order be disrupted, "I will adopt measures the situation may 
require and the law allows, because I will not tolerate any 
disruption of public order." 
  De Leon Carpio--who hinted that violence could increase if 
the no vote wins--said: "The enemies of democracy are not very 
happy." 
  The president reiterated his intention to fight violence and 
poverty, which affects 80 percent of Guatemalans, and to channel 
resources to strategic fields, such as health and housing.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (AFP) -- A "small propaganda 
bomb" exploded today in Guatemala as the referendum was under 
way to vote on reforms to 43 constitutional articles, but the 
incident did not cause damage or casualties, police sources have 
reported. 
  At 1100 (1700 GMT) there has been scarce voter turnout, and 
the election centers are half empty, although the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal (TSE) trusts "voter affluence will increase 
later." 
  It was confirmed in a downtown polling station that the 
number of voters was not over 15 percent four hours after the 
polling station opened. 
  In addition, Carolina de Reobordelo, president of the 
Electoral Board of Quezaltenango, the second largest city, has 
told reporters voter turnout has not even reached 10 percent, 
but she said "it will increase after mass." 
  Other interior reports note that voter turnout has been less 
than in previous elections, making it appear that voter 
abstentionism might exceed 60 percent. 
  The National Police has reported the explosion of "a small 
propaganda bomb" but did not report where or who was responsible. 
  A police spokesperson has said that despite this incident, 
the referendum is being held normally and under strict security. 
  The polling stations will close at 1800 (0000 GMT), and 
preliminary returns will be known a few hours later. It is 
expected that the final result of the referendum will be known 
before midnight.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz has told ACAN-EFE that today's 
referendum to reform the Constitution of Guatemala is proceeding 
normally and added that there have been no sabotage or attacks. 
  Three hours before the closure of voting centers at 1700 
(2300 GMT), the minister pointed out that there is absolute 
normalcy nationwide and added that voter turnout appears to be 
low. Ortiz, as well as the magistrates of the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE), attributed the apparent abstentionism to 
citizens fearful of possible explosions and bomb threats, of 
which there were dozens in the past weeks. 
  The police reported that a grenade, which did not explode, 
was found today inside an abandoned car in the capital. It is 
not known when it was planted there. The police attributed the 
explosions to the guerrillas who urged the people to abstain and 
boycott the referendum. 
  Ortiz said that the police assigned to voting centers are 
protecting 3.4 million citizens, more than a third of the 
population. The Army, which stays away from voting centers, has 
also guaranteed security along highways and at bridges and 
towns, but men in uniform are virtually absent in the capital. 
  Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna also reported 
absolute normalcy during the referendum that will approve or 
reject 43 reforms to the Constitution. Among other things, they 
would allow legislative elections within three months and the 
replacement of members of the Supreme Court of Justice. 
  TSE Magistrate Marco Guerra told ACAN-EFE that terrorist 
actions promoted abstentionism, which could reach 50 percent, 
according to Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Voting in the 
referendum held today in Guatemala to reform the constitution 
and replace the Parliament and Supreme Court concluded nearly 
everywhere in the country. It was characterized by high 
abstentionism and an absence of major incidents. 
  The presidents of several voting tables in the urban and 
rural areas estimated the turnout at 20-25 percent at closure 
time. 
  One of the first tables to yield results in Totonicapan 
reported, according to local reporters, 71 yes votes, 18 no 
votes, and 35 void votes, and was marked by very high 
abstentionism that was not quantified.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan Vice 
President Arturo Herbruger ruled out the possibility that a high 
abstention rate at the referendum on constitutional reforms, 
which is being held in the country today, will weaken the 
government headed by Ramiro de Leon Carpio. In statements to 
ACAN-EFE, Herbruger Asturias indicated that a referendum is 
based on valid votes and not on the number of people who did not 
vote and voluntarily excluded themselves from participating in 
the solution of a national problem. Herbruger Asturias, who 
prior to holding the vice presidency was the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE) president, pointed out that the people's 
abstention in the referendum "had been anticipated a long time 
ago" and "nobody said it would weaken the government." 
  "We have to take into account that the electoral system 
gives 
people the option to vote as it is only a civic duty," Herbruger 
argued. He credited the electorate's poor response "to the 
people's indifference. They do not care what happens 
politically in their country" and not to the recent terrorist 
actions. "I don't believe the terrorist actions negatively 
affected the referendum, although this was their purpose. 
People vote with or without terrorism," the vice president 
underscored. 
  Arturo Herbruger cast his yes vote at the Belen Institute, 
located approximately 600 meters from the government offices, 
and he showed his ballot to reporters. For this reason, the 
Union of the National Center requested that his vote be 
annulled. According to National Prosecutor Sydney Shaw, the 
vice president violated the electoral and political parties laws 
because the vote is secret. However, TSE President Fernando 
Bonilla indicated that the electoral law does not stipulate any 
penalty for citizens who show their ballots. 
  The Guatemalans were called to a referendum today. They have 
to approve or reject the constitutional reforms negotiated 
between the deputies and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio in 
November 1993. The reforms include the purge of government 
organizations and an end to the political confrontations between 
government branches. 
  The first results reported by the media indicate the victory 
of the "yes" vote. This victory, however, has been minimized by 
the high abstention rate, which, according to local politicians, 
could be greater than 60 percent. Important union and civic 
organizations, as well as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity -- with which the government will hold peace talks in 
February -- had requested people to abstain from voting.

There is complete agreement on the principles of austerity,

a distribution with social equality. I believe there is a 
complete identification with the new Honduran president.

  [Text] Quito, 28 Jan (DPA) -- Violent street riots by 
workers and students broke out today in several Ecuadoran cities 
following confirmation by official sources last night that this 
weekend the government will announce an economic-adjustments 
package. 
  The incidents reached peak intensity in Quito. Since early 
in the morning, the areas surrounding public schools and 
universities turned into the sites of bitter clashes between 
demonstrators and the police who tried to keep the riots from 
spreading to the city's downtown area. The situation was also 
tense in other Ecuadoran cities in spite of the government's 
announcement that it "will not permit any break of the peace." 
  The United Workers Front, the Federation of Secondary School 
Students, and the National Union of Teachers called for "mass 
protests" against the announced economic adjustment. 
Reportedly, the adjustment will be limited to severe fuel price 
increases of up to 70 percent. 
  The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has 
described the measure as "absolutely inevitable" because of the 
collapse of the international price of oil, which is the 
country's main source of income. The price drop is keeping the 
country from receiving $1 million daily. In November, the 
government proposed increasing taxes to compensate for the 
budget deficit but the plan was rejected by Congress, which is 
controlled by the opposition. The fuel price increase reportedly 
will include the imposition of a new domestic marketing 
structure for oil by-products, with the private sector competing 
with the state enterprise -- currently a monopoly -- in the 
framework of prices freely set by the supply and demand 
mechanism. 
  All the parties, of both the right and the left, have spoken 
out against the planned adjustment and are prepared to stop them 
in Congress. Meanwhile, the United Workers Front announced its 
decision to call for a "combative and indefinite" general strike.

  [Text] Quito -- At least three policemen were injured and 
an undisclosed number of students were arrested in the wake of 
protests staged here today in the face of announced economic 
adjustment measures. The demonstrators, mostly students from the 
Central University of Ecuador and some from certain secondary 
schools, were repelled with tear gas and a water cannon known as 
Trucutu. 
  Security measures were tightened at the Government Palace. 
Nearby roads were blocked with Army armored vehicles. The 
students are throwing rocks and making obscene gestures at the 
policemen, and they are shouting slogans against the government 
and the IMF. 
  We do not want more increases, and we say no to gasoline 
price increases were among the slogans shouted as the 
demonstrators threw rocks and other hard objects at the public 
forces. 
  As we reported earlier, the government will announce fuel 
price increases to cover the large fiscal deficit, which is 
growing by the day given a drop in revenues due to lower 
petroleum prices. Petroleum is Ecuador's main revenue source. 
  The police were forced to close the access roads near the 
university in downtown Quito as well as other streets in the 
southern part of Quito. This has created a huge traffic jam. 
There are long lines at gas stations. 
  It is not yet known whether there are disturbances in 
Guayaquil, the second most important city in our country. Radio 
reports state that more public demonstrations against gasoline 
price increases are expected next week as secondary school 
students join the demonstrations.

  [Text] Quito, 28 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- In an attempt to unravel 
the fiscal deficit problem sparked by the fall in the 
international price of crude oil, the Ecuadoran Government 
tonight announced an increase of up to 70 percent in the price 
of fuel as of 29 January. 
  In a message broadcast via a radio and television network, 
Ecuadoran Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has detailed the 
decreed increase according to each type of fuel. 
  The measure will specifically modify gasoline prices, which 
remained the same since September 1992. 
  The minister said premium gasoline, the type which most 
Ecuadoreans use, will increase from $.80 per gallon (3.78 
liters) to $1.35, while unleaded gasoline will increase by 50 
percent. Concurrently, regular gasoline and aviation gasoline 
will increase by 40 percent. 
  Robalino said the measure was necessary, because the 
reduction in the price of hydrocarbons on the international 
market has caused a financial imbalance of $700 million for 
Ecuador in terms of crude exports. 
  This situation was complicated even further as a result of 
Congress' refusal to approve an 18-percent increase in the 
value-added tax (VAT), the minister added. 
  The fuel price system is geared toward deregulating the 
domestic market for crude oil byproducts and to ensure an 
adequate increase in tax revenues. 
  The government has also included several decrees 
establishing 
public spending controls and measures aimed at cutting tax 
evasion and modernizing customs systems. 
  Robalino added that "the fall in fiscal revenues for 1994 is 
very important. It is no government fabrication and requires 
the implementation of corrective measures." 
  The minister said the government does not intend to increase 
the price of other crude oil byproducts such as diesel and 
household gas, and he reiterated that urban transportation fares 
will remain the same as a result of a government subsidy. 
  Nevertheless, union sources have announced they will 
coordinate general actions to protest the government's economic 
measures, which they believe will only result in the speculation 
of basic commodities.

  [Text] Quito, 29 Jan (DPA) -- New fuel prices, increased by 
up to 71.23 percent, went into effect today in Ecuador, while 
violent street protests staged by students and workers against 
the government-ordered adjustment affected several cities for 
the second consecutive day. 
  Defending the validity of the government decision adopted on 
28 January, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said today the 
increase was "absolutely inevitable." He explained that this 
decision is aimed at covering the budget deficit caused by the 
fall in international petroleum prices. In statements made on a 
radio and television network, Robalino noted that the plan 
initially proposed to cover the fiscal gap -- estimated by the 
government at $1 million per day -- did not include fuel hikes, 
but only tax reforms. "However, Congress rejected the plan and 
left us no other alternative," he continued. 
  The adjustment, which would result in $250 million in 
additional revenue for the state in 1994, sparked a wave of 
protests and street disturbances even before the official 
announcement was made. On 28 January three policemen were 
seriously injured in clashes with demonstrators, who closed the 
major roadways in Ecuadoran cities again today. 
  The United Workers Front [FUT] today called for an 
indefinite 
general strike for an unspecified date, while the Transportation 
Workers Union threatened to paralyze transportation if the 
government insisted on its announcement to freeze fares. 
  All parties, except the two progovernment parties, voiced 
their opposition to the measures prior to the government 
announcement and reported their intentions to fight it in 
Congress "like we did with the package to increase taxes," said 
Heinz Moeller, legislative wing leader of the Social Christian 
Party, the largest in the Chamber. 
  The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen is 
experiencing a severe popularity crisis, confirmed by polls 
taken even before the adjustment, with an approval rating of 
below 10 percent. Additionally, political experts believe that 
"the government is too weak, alone, and without prestige to try 
to implement such a harsh and badly presented package." 
  However, the government said that "its economic successes, 
in 
particular lowering inflation to less than half in one year, 
gives it the moral strength necessary to implement an adjustment 
which, no matter what, is absolutely unavoidable." 
  Different parties and organizations have called for street 
mobilizations on Monday, but the government anticipated today 
that "no interference with peace will be tolerated."

  [Text] Quito, 30 Jan (AFP) -- A worsening of street 
protests against the 71.2 percent increase in gasoline prices 
ordered by the government on Saturday, is expected in Ecuador on 
Monday [31 January], local observers indicated today. 
  According to some leaders of the United Workers Front (FUT), 
peaceful marches will be held in several cities early on Monday, 
but it is feared that extremists will take advantage of the 
situation to create disorders. 
  Since Friday, one day before President Sixto Duran-Ballen 
decreed the increase to obtain funds to deal with a growing 
fiscal deficit of a little over $200 million, protests were 
already anticipated. Students, workers, housewives, 
transporters, and citizens in general have expressed their 
disagreement with the increases, but the government said it had 
no other choice in the face of its economic situation after it 
had to grant a salary increase to 120,000 public school teachers. 
  The fact that the increases were announced on Saturday night 
postponed the street protests, which are being announced for 
Monday by labor federations, one of whose leaders, Edgard Ponce, 
announced that a nationwide strike for an indefinite period 
might be staged. 
  The Catholic Church has also indicated that the increases 
are 
very high and the bishop of Cuenca, the country's third largest 
city, said the poor are the ones punished the most because, he 
explained, the wealthy have cars and other means of 
transportation. He said the peasants will have to "pay the 
consequences" and he added that even though they produce food, 
they have to sell their products at low prices because they do 
not have the means to transport them to the cities. 
  "It is terrible to have to increase fuel prices or to have 
to 
create new taxes. This has caused much anguish for the 
president," his daughter Alicia said on Sunday. She added that 
"as a good father, he did not want to do so, but the Ecuadoreans 
have to understand that it was necessary so the government can 
fulfill its goals." "It is very hard to undertake the social 
projects the people need if there are no funds," the president's 
daughter explained to justify the increases. 
  After describing the measure as "a clumsy maneuver to 
violate 
the law," the Ecuadoran Socialist Party said the increase is "an 
unbearable tax on the Ecuadoran people." It proposed that the 
people go to the streets to show the government "their total and 
increasing discontent." The wave of discontent was becoming 
general in Quito, Guayaquil, and Riobamba. 
  Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo and General Guido 
Nunez, the police commander, have warned that the Armed Forces 
are ready to safeguard peace and they said that any person who 
is found disrupting order "must take responsibility for his 
actions." 
  Victor Granda, secretary general of the Socialist Party, 
announced that a suit of unconstitutionality against the 
increase will be filed on Monday "because it worsens the 
Ecuadoran people's poverty." He indicated that "we will 
struggle in the streets to organize a social movement that must 
demand the trial and removal of Ecuadoran Vice President Alberto 
Dahik. [no end quotation mark as received] Dahik, a conservative 
economist, has been blamed for the economic policy of the 
government of right-wing Duran-Ballen. 
  Even though the government has insisted it will not 
authorize 
increases in bus fares and intermunicipal transportation, 
beginning Sunday some Quito taxi drivers have begun to charge up 
to 40 percent more on their urban runs.

  [Text] President-elect Eduardo Frei today appointed 23 of 
the 29 under secretaries of the administration that will take 
over on 11 March. He explained that he will appoint the 
remaining six in the near future: the education under secretary 
and the five under secretaries of the Defense Ministry. 
  Last night, after attending a mass that marked the 12th 
anniversary of his father Eduardo Frei Montalva's death, 
President-elect Eduardo Frei announced that he would release the 
list of under secretaries the next day. This decision -- which 
caught everyone by surprise because the president-elect himself 
had indicated earlier that the appointments would be postponed 
-- had journalists waiting for the announcement at Frei's 
offices on Hindenburg Street since early morning on 22 January. 
Just as he had done with the cabinet, the president-elect did 
not appoint all the under secretaries at once, leaving six 
appointments for later. 
  [Begin Frei recording] Since I believe in teamwork I also 
believe that the respective ministers and under secretaries 
should be properly attuned to each other and trust each other 
because they will be working together day in, day out. Thus, I 
will appoint the education under secretary later and the same 
goes for the under secretaries of the Defense Ministry. [end 
recording]

under secretary under the new administration:

  The president-elect stated that there has been no pressure 
whatsoever behind these appointments. 
  [Begin Frei recording] I would like to say once again that I 
have not been pressured to make any of these appointments. 
Undoubtedly, the various political parties have conveyed their 
suggestions and I have talked to the ministers, but everybody 
left me free to make the appointments. As I have explained, the 
delay -- which I believe to be perfectly normal given the fact 
that I was operated on just a week ago -- in making these 
appointments gave me the chance to talk to all of them and make 
sure that they will do their jobs independently. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Deputy Camilo Escalona yesterday was installed as 
president of the Socialist Party [PS] until November 1995, after 
the Central Committee plenum ratified the consensus formula 
proposed for reorganizing the party leadership. 
  The new executive board gathers representatives from the 
three existing factions within the PS: the "New Left," headed by 
Escalona, considered the most orthodox faction; the renewed 
faction [renovados]; and the third position faction 
[terceristas]. 
  The new PS leadership headed by Escalona has appointed three 
more vice presidents in addition to Isabel Allende -- first vice 
president and president until yesterday -- and Vivienne 
Bachelet, fifth vice president. Gonzalo Martner will be 
secretary general and Anibal Palma will be general under 
secretary. 
  The new executive board members are Jaime Perez de Arce 
(from 
the third position faction) as second vice president; Marcelo 
Schilling (from the renewed faction); and Ricardo Solari as 
fourth vice president. 
  The PS plenum unanimously approved the restructuring of the 
leadership by 79 votes in favor and four abstentions. Manuel 
Almeyda did not want to vote, and argued that the grassroots 
should have participated in the process. 
  This decision was made following two days of meetings and 
debates that took place in the "El Canelo de Nos" center.

  [Text] The new Socialist Party [PS] leadership met 
yesterday with President Patricio Aylwin. They greeted him and 
reasserted their support for the way in which he has conducted 
the democratic transition process. 
  The PS leadership reiterated its proposal for the adoption 
of 
measures leading to the prompt resumption of full diplomatic 
ties with Cuba. 
  Aylwin and the PS leadership share an optimistic view of the 
future of Chile in view of the strength of the CPPD [Coalition 
of Parties for Democracy] and the projected positive social and 
economic development indicators. 
  The PS leadership is headed by Camilo Escalona, who assumed 
his duties on 15 January. A one-hour meeting was held with 
Aylwin yesterday afternoon at Government House. 
  Also present at the meeting were PS Vice Presidents Isabel 
Allende, Jaime Perez de Arce, and Marcelo Schilling. PS Under 
Secretaries Anibal Palma and Hernan del Canto also attended. 
  Prior to this meeting, Aylwin held separate meetings with 
newly appointed PS Vice President Ricardo Solari and Secretary 
General Gonzalo Martner, who will assume their party posts in 
March. They are currently working as presidential under 
secretary and regional development under secretary, respectively. 
  Speaking about the issues discussed with Aylwin, Camilo 
Escalona said they held a very cordial meeting during which they 
exchanged points of view about the administration's experience 
over the past four years. The PS reasserted its support for the 
progress achieved toward the consolidation of democracy. 
  Escalona stated that the PS agreed to extend its recognition 
to Aylwin for his relevant role during a friendship meeting to 
be held after 11 March 1994. 
  The new PS leader added that they discussed with the 
president the future of the nation, concern over the recession 
in Europe, and its possible impact on Chile. 
  He said: "We are all reasonably optimistic about the future 
of Chilean politics, particularly because of the CPPD, which is 
an alliance that continues to govern the country in the same way 
it has for the past four years." 
  The PS also discussed the party's interest in promoting 
specific steps toward the prompt restoration of diplomatic ties 
with the Cuban regime. 
  Camilo Escalona said: "The president is now studying the 
issue." 
  On several occasions the PS has stressed the need to 
reestablish full diplomatic ties with Cuba, which were severed 
by Fidel Castro's regime in September 1973 following the rupture 
of institutional order in Chile. 
  The Aylwin administration has reestablished ties with Cuba 
at 
the commercial and consular levels but the PS leadership insists 
on the need for full diplomatic ties with Cuba for humanitarian 
reasons and the pragmatic nature of Chilean foreign policy.

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Enrique Krauss has rejected 
the possibility of promoting amnesty for the Chileans under the 
protection of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, who 
have not returned to the country because they have judicial 
proceedings pending with the military justice. 
  Krauss said that the government is more than willing to 
contribute to their return to Chilean society, but noted that no 
one can avoid the court proceedings. 
  Krauss also valued the recent presence in Santiago of the 
UNHCR regional chief for South America, and pointed out that the 
UN official confirmed the ending of the Chileans' status as 
political refugees because of the democratic normalization 
taking place in our country. 
  Krauss also stated categorically that since March 1990 there 
have been no political prisoners in Chile, but rather terrorist 
criminals who practice violence to achieve political goals. 
  He pointed out that the expression "political prisoner" is 
inadequate and misleading from the point of view of the 
political situation in the country. In this regard he accused 
the front organizations and the relatives of the prisoners for 
spreading rumors about the alleged existence of this kind of 
prisoner. 
  Krauss made these comments yesterday during a conversation 
with reporters in La Moneda Palace. 
  Krauss was asked about the activities carried out by 
Mohammed 
Benamar, UNHCR chief for South America, to facilitate the return 
of about 180 Chileans, who have charges pending or arrest 
warrants against them in Chilean courts. 
  Krauss said that the UN official expressed real recognition 
for the Chilean situation in that the progress of our political 
process no longer allows for the existence of people who could 
claim refugee or asylum status for political reasons. [passage 
omitted] 
  Krauss said that the justice and acting interior minister 
told Benamar that those who decide to return to Chile will have 
all the guarantees of an appropriate trial to resolve their 
situation according to the rules of a state of law. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry sources yesterday reported that 
Chile does not consider the Lima Convention lost, and hopes that 
Peru will abide by the original terms and continue to negotiate. 
The objective of these negotiations is to conclude a 
supplemental agreement on some aspects of the convention and a 
protocol for the peaceful settlement of possible controversies. 
  The sources said that resigning its aspiration to be granted 
the use of an esplanade -- which joins Sector 7 of the northern 
dock and the terminal of the railway to Tacna, on the bay of 
Arica -- will be considered a clear gesture that Lima has the 
political will to resolve the "impasse." 
  This would be especially significant because the request -- 
which was made at the last moment -- is regarded as a maneuver 
by some Peruvian sectors to cause the failure of the two 
governments' efforts to resolve the pending issues of the 1929 
Treaty. 
  Under such circumstances, the announcement that President 
Alberto Fujimori will visit Santiago for the presidential 
changeover becomes even more significant. The Foreign Ministry 
has received a very favorable reaction to this announcement. 
  Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma yesterday met with 
Peruvian Ambassador Alfonso Rivero, with whom the issue was 
addressed for more than one hour at the minister's office. 
  After the meeting, Rivero made no comment and Silva Cimma 
said only that the dialogue was positive and that he remains 
optimistic that Congress will approve the Lima Convention. 
  The minister thus sought to minimize reports on the 
suspension of the bilateral talks that were being held to 
clarify some points of the Lima Convention. The talks were 
stalemated because Peru requested, at the last moment, 
exchanging the compensation that Chile promised to pay for the 
land used in "El Chinchorro" without the owner's permission, for 
the use of the esplanade. 
  Ministry sources said that rather than a legal-diplomatic 
problem between Chile and Peru, a domestic Peruvian political 
problem was the result. 
  Some people maintain that the situation entails a problem of 
nationalism because Fujimori, Democratic Constituent Congress 
(CCD) President Jaime Yoshiyama, and Victor Joy Way, the CCD 
Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, are all third-generation 
Peruvians -- the first two are of Japanese and the third of 
Chinese descent. Consequently, strong nationalist sectors 
believe the fact that they are willing to approve agreements 
with Chile shows ignorance of Peruvian historical roots. 
  Some sources have said that another noteworthy fact is that 
President Fujimori is not at his political best at the moment. 
His meager victory at the constitutional referendum did not 
help him to insist on the approval of the Lima convention by the 
CCD. This year he will confront elections within Congress and 
he will have to decide whether to run for reelection in 1995. 
  Observers believe that Peruvian Government opposition forces 
are using the issue of the resolution of historical 
disagreements with Chile as an easy weapon against Fujimori. 
Because this criticism does not touch in-depth matters, it can 
be concluded that the opposition is not willing to give Fujimori 
the opportunity to boast that he managed to end the pending 
points of the 1929 Treaty. 
  The Chilean negotiators' refusal to give Peru an unbroken 
territory in Arica was positively regarded by Carlos Valcarce, 
RN [National Renewal] deputy for Arica. He said there cannot be 
any exchange. 
  For 64 years, Chile and Peru could not agree on how to 
implement the terms of Article 5 of the 1929 Treaty, involving 
different interpretations given to the assertion that Chile will 
build a dock, a customs office, and a terminal on the railroad 
to Tacna "for the use" of Peru. 
  On 11 May 1993, the two governments signed the so-called 
Lima 
Convention, in which Peru expressed its approval of these 
facilities that were built in Arica, and the two countries 
established the legal framework in which they will work. 
  This agreement, a free transit convention, and four exchange 
notes concluded the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty. 
  Under the terms of the Lima Convention, Chile grants Peru -- 
permanently -- the use of the northern side of the dock, which 
is to the north of the bay of Arica, the customs office built 
there, and the railroad terminal on the line to Tacna. 
  The convention rules that ownership of the facilities shall 
be registered with Arica's Real Estate Registry as Chilean state 
property, yet noting the right to use it permanently. 
  Peru will authorize a private company to operate the 
facilities. This will be a corporation based on Peruvian capital. 
  In an exchange note, Chile promised to make a monetary 
compensation to Peru in lieu of the "El Chinchorro" areas that 
were used without the owner's consent. "El Chinchorro" is a 
145,500 square meter area owned by Peru and located north of 
Arica. 
  These agreements were negotiated on bases proposed by then 
Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller and were 
endorsed by his successor Oscar de la Puente. Among the 
proposals was Blacker Miller's novel formula to grant the 
operation of the facilities to a private enterprise, without 
touching "El Chinchorro," a highly sensitive issue for Peru, or 
splitting Arica's territorial continuity, which Chile will not 
allow. 
  The Lima Convention should have been rapidly approved by 
Congress, but the opposition to Fujimori and traditionalist and 
regionalist Peruvian sectors protested. The strongest voice was 
that of United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, who said that the convention can be improved. 
  Some experts believe the problem emerged because the Chilean 
Government stated that all agreements can be improved, and by 
the decision to reach an agreement to "clarify, specify, and 
supplement" the Lima Convention. 
  After making clear that the Lima Convention would not be 
modified, Chile made concessions to Peru seeking to help 
Fujimori present such a historical understanding. The Peruvian 
side -- without explanation and disrespecting the basis of the 
negotiation -- asked for the use of the esplanade, which gave 
rise to the problem of breaking Arica's territorial continuity. 
  It should be recalled that the efforts made in the 
mid-1980's 
to settle the pending issues of the 1929 Treaty did not yield 
any results precisely because the Act of Lima provided for the 
use of the esplanade by Peru, a matter that was categorically 
rejected by Chile. Peru's promise to sell "El Chinchorro" was 
as strongly rejected in the neighboring country. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros; from the "The Morning Paper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar, Honduran 
Armed Forces spokesman, said the military had to handle a report 
that turned out to be a false alarm before the inauguration of 
the new government. 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] The Public Security Forces were 
alerted to an unidentified object, near the Camosa area, I 
understand. Specifically, it was located on the route to 
Toncotin Airport. The bomb squad went to the site and 
determined it was an empty box. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the catcalls heard at the Tegucigalpa National 
Stadium during the inauguration the moment the Honduran Armed 
Forces General Staff members entered, Santos said: 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] We regard this in a positive 
light. This definitely shows you rifles have not served only to 
crush the people. The people at any given time are totally at 
liberty to express themselves without the fear of being crushed. 
We believe this is a situation.... [pauses] We look at it 
under a positive light. These situations definitely merit 
analysis. This did not happen four years ago, and it happened 
now. We hope that in the next four years corrective measures 
are taken. That way the situation will be totally different 
four years from now. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Colonel, why do you think the people 
in the stadium jeered you? 
  [Santos] The fact is these things happen to express 
disapproval of certain actions that are not conducted by 
institutions but are often isolated incidents by individuals who 
commit actions that fall outside the law. [end recording] 
  Santos maintained the catcalls were not directly aimed at 
Luis Alonso Discua, the Armed Forces chief. 
  [Begin Santos recording] This is not a situation against the 
Armed Forces chief. It shows disapproval of some actions that 
we have acknowledged at the opportune time and have sought to 
correct. At any given moment, the important thing is to analyze 
them with the goal of amending them so these things do not 
happen. [end recording]
