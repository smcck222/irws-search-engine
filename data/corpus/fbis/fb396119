<F P=106> [Interview with General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of </F>
the Armed Forces, by Reporter Trino Murillo on 25 January; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Murillo] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua 
Elvir, chief of the Armed Forces, explained certain Armed Forces 
plans and rebutted criticism from certain sectors of Honduran 
society. At the beginning of the interview Gen. Discua 
discussed a very important issue: the transfer or change over of 
Joint Chief of Staff Reynaldo Andino Flores to the Defense 
Ministry. My first question is if this should be viewed as a 
purge or a normal change within the Armed Forces. 
  [Discua] Allow me to tell you that no ulterior motives 
should be attached to this situation. A list of officers who 
could fill the Defense Ministry post was presented to the 
president-elect, who had publicly requested such a list at a 
council meeting. When he returned from the United States I gave 
him a list of several officers and the selection was made 
exclusively by the president- elect. 
  [Murillo] That is a normal decision during a change of 
government. Nevertheless, he also spoke of the duties the 
military institution would carry out through the Executive 
Branch to coordinate with Congress a purging of the police and 
to counteract the crime wave that is destroying the country. 
  [Discua] As I said, there are many issues that must be 
approached in a very serious manner, such as military service, 
human rights, and the police. I have spoken at length with the 
president- elect about these issues because the Armed Forces 
want to resolve them. Of course, it would be irresponsible on 
our part to [words indistinct] because that requires a process 
that should conclude prior to the year 2000 when the police and 
Armed Forces are in the condition the people would like to see. 
The Armed Forces have always agreed with a constitutional 
reform pertaining to the police, and we are working on it. In 
due time we will present a report to the president-elect; the 
general situation has been outlined to him and we are waiting 
for him to summon us. We are [words indistinct] to all the 
issues that have been sources of controversy at any given time, 
but this has helped us to reconsider and begin a period during 
which, I believe, the people will be content. 
  [Murillo] Spokesmen from the party that is about to take 
office have said that international organizations are pressing 
for constitutional reforms and that they have established 
certain conditions. These conditions include reducing the Army 
and making certain basic taxes mandatory so payments will 
continue to be made to the government. What is your reaction to 
this? You have always said that foreign pressure should never 
prevail. 
  [Discua] I must tell you that approximately three months 
ago, or, in other words, last year a meeting was held in Chile 
to examine Latin America's military spending. The participants 
took a very close look at military spending with regard to each 
country's gross domestic product. In Latin America, military 
spending fluctuates between 1 percent and 7.6 or 7.8 percent. 
Therefore, there are countries whose military spending is very 
high. Honduras' spending is less than 1 percent. In other 
words, our military spending with regard to our GDP is the 
lowest in Central America and even in Latin America. The 
Honduran Armed Forces have a budget of $40 million; Costa Rica 
has $48 million, and the figure rises. In other words, Honduras 
is the Central American country that spends the least on its 
military. 
  [Murillo] [words indistinct] making of demands seems to be 
a prerequisite? 
  [Discua] This is logical. However, I believe the 
president-elect stated categorically in Washington that the 
Armed Forces reduction had to conform to each government's needs 
for equipment [word indistinct]. I have always said that we 
have to find a balance in Central America. I know the 
institution must make structural reforms to be in keeping with 
the new government's modernization policy. 
  [Murillo] With regard to the implementation of the military 
law, General Discua said there is no wrestling for power or 
internal strife in the military institution. He added that new 
groups arise in the Armed Forces as classes start to retire in 
compliance with the institution's bylaws and military law. 
  [Discua] Logically, we at Mufoco [expansion unknown] will no 
longer be active Armed Forces officers, and new classes will 
start taking our places. I believe we have to start the opening 
process. My entire graduating class will retire when I finish my 
term and new classes will take our places. They are young 
military men with experience who will always try to do what is 
best for the institution. We have to hope that this is how it 
will turn out. 
  [Murillo] As an institutional policy, and based on 
international agreements, several U.S. Government sectors have 
already asserted that they support turning Palmerola into a 
regional counter narcotics center for Central America and the 
Caribbean. This prospect is also supported by President Reina. 
Do the Armed Forces endorse it too? 
  [Discua] One of my administration's main objectives has been 
the struggle against drugs. I have supported all the programs 
initiated by our government and those initiated by friendly 
countries to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. I have 
always said the Soto Cano Base should be turned into a Honduran 
base to combat drug trafficking at a regional level. It should 
unify all actions in the region to enable us to stop or lessen 
the flow of drugs to northern countries. 
  [Murillo] Has this been discussed at top levels, General? 
  [Discua] Yes, we have been talking about this possibility 
constantly. I visited Washington and talked with senators and 
congressmen about my plans to combat drug trafficking.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (AFP) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said the recent terrorist attacks in 
his country are linked to the upcoming referendum, and he added 
that some "extremist groups" do not want the democratic process 
in Guatemala to be strengthened. 
  De Leon, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new 
Honduran president, regretted that the bombings, blackouts, and 
some shootings, which took place in the capital last night, are 
creating tension in his country two days before the referendum. 
In Sunday's referendum, the people will decide whether to 
approve a series of constitutional reforms, the most important 
of which will allow new officials to be appointed to the 
Congress and to the Supreme Court this year. 
  De Leon said he and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina 
share the goals of fighting corruption, drug trafficking, and 
poverty, as well as the search for peace and economic growth 
with social justice for everyone. The Guatemalan president 
noted that guerrillas have been active in his country over the 
past 30 years. He said his government will resume talks with 
the rebels in mid-February in a search for peace in the only 
Central American country where an armed conflict persists. 
  De Leon Carpio said he hopes a peace agreement will be 
signed 
this year because a commitment has been made to the United 
Nations to achieve this goal. He also said that if the parties 
fail to reach an agreement, they would be showing a lack of 
commitment.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin and Carlos Garcia] </F>
  [Text] The National Directorate of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] and the Sandinist faction reached an 
agreement on 24 January regarding the negotiating process of 
constitutional reforms, a topic that had been triggering 
disagreements between the two Sandinist sectors. 
  Yesterday, after concluding a special National Directorate 
meeting, and which was attended by all of its members, the 
Sandinist leadership agreed to consider the document approved on 
18 November 1993 by the National Assembly as the "fundamental 
political document" on the topic. 
  In addition, the UNO [National Opposition Union]-FSLN 
agreement is for the FSLN, according to the agreements reached 
by the National Directorate, the "basis to discuss the 
constitutional reforms." The Sandinist National Directorate and 
the faction added that documents or draft bills presented by the 
other groups or factions must be recognized as legitimate 
positions of the other parties. 
  The Sandinist leadership also decided that the FSLN 
negotiating commission, which is made up of Daniel Ortega, 
Sergio Ramirez, and Bayardo Arce, begins a round of meetings 
with the representatives appointed by the deputies of the Group 
of 13 (Social-democrats and conservatives) and with the 
representatives of the Political Council of the four factions 
"so as to strengthen the negotiating process of constitutional 
reforms in political terms." 
  The Sandinist leadership also gave its political support to 
the Sandinist faction when it agreed that it "should be the 
sector to study and discuss the draft reform bill, which will 
result from the consensus reached by all parties," and that the 
"parliamentary negotiation ... will be conducted by the 
Sandinist faction." 
  One of the directors of the Sandinist faction said that this 
mechanism will allow the National Directorate's negotiating 
commission to coordinate with the Sandinist faction, which will 
discuss the draft reform bill with the other groups in 
parliament that are not members of what we currently know as the 
"Group of 13." 
  This position, which was unanimously adopted by the National 
Directorate yesterday, seems to resolve a problem that 
threatened to create a new crisis among some leading sectors of 
the FSLN. 
  Last night, FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega confirmed 
that the differences between the two sectors had been overcome 
completely. 
  After concluding a meeting with Presidency Minister Antonio 
Lacayo on the transportation strike, Ortega stated that: "All 
differences between the faction and the National Directorate 
regarding the topic have been overcome entirely." 
  According to Ortega, the decisions made yesterday by the 
National Directorate will not affect the discussion of the 
reforms, but they will rather "broaden other forces." Ortega 
added that this does not imply disrespect for or disregard of 
the agreements among factions. 
  He reiterated that the FSLN wants to meet with various 
social 
sectors to analyze the reforms and, particularly, that 
Nicaraguans are given the opportunity to express their views 
regarding the draft reform bill through open town councils.

<F P=106> [`Act of Agreement' signed between the Nicaraguan Government </F>
and representatives of the Transportation Commission at the Olof 
Palme Convention Center on 29 January 1994; read by Dr. Francis 
Silva, from the Presidency Public Relations and Official 
Information Directorate] 
  [Text] Act of Agreement 
  The undersigned ministers, representing the government of 
the 
Republic of Nicaragua, and representatives of the transportation 
organizations have gathered at the Olof Palme Convention Center 
to find a solution to the current transportation problem and 
hereby agree that: 
  1. Gasoline prices are hereby frozen until 31 May 1994. From 
that date onward, fuel prices will be adjusted monthly, 
considering only the sliding exchange rate, except when 
international oil prices exceed $17 a barrel. 
  2. Diesel fuel prices will remain frozen at a national 
average price of 7.15 cordobas a gallon until 30 April 1994. 
  3. An in bond [preceding words in English] store is hereby 
authorized for the importation of tires, spares, and other 
supplies for the exclusive use of cooperative transportation 
sectors so that, in accordance with Article 74 of the General 
Law of Cooperatives, they can benefit from tax exonerations 
established therein; exceptions to this are stipulations under 
Chapter 27 of the SAC [Central American Tariff System]. 
  4. The value added tax for local purchases of goods and 
services by legally registered transportation cooperatives will 
be reimbursed, beginning 1 March 1994. 
  5. Within the framework of the development of transportation 
enterprise cooperatives properly registered with the MCT 
[Constuction and Transportation Ministry] to this date, the 
government will provide a revolving fund, via the appropriate 
institution, to retain an annual market of 10 million cordobas, 
endeavoring to obtain the lowest possible interest rate. 
  6. Commercial passenger and cargo trucks, as well as taxi 
drivers with operating vehicles, organized under legally 
registered cooperatives will receive a coupon worth 1.28 
cordobas for a gallon of gasoline up to a maximum of six gallons 
a day. This coupon system will be effective between 30 January 
to 30 April 1994. This coupon will be handled according to the 
September 1993 agreements. 
  7. It goes on record that there will be no additional 
charges 
to those currently established under Decree 62-93 for license 
plates, driving licenses, and others. The Presidency will be 
requested to issue a new decree to this effect, which in effect 
will repeal Decree 62-93. 
  8. It has been agreed to appoint a commission to create the 
National Land Transportation Council [Consejo Nacional de 
Transporte Terrestre]. 
  9. A review of the agreements signed in September 1993 will 
take place via work commissions for each case; likewise, the MCT 
communique dated 27 April 1993 will be implemented. 
  10. By 15 February 1994, and after studying Central American 
costs, a meeting will be held with the mayors' financial 
commission of the directors for the Nicaraguan Institute for 
Municipal Development [Instituto Nicaraguense de Fomento 
Municipal], Imifom, the Finance Ministry, and transportation 
representative organizations to discuss the 1994 road tax and 
methods of payment for the cargo and passenger transportation 
sector. Imifom will summon a meeting for this. 
  11. Once this agreement is signed, the transportation 
organization representatives pledge to immediately suspend the 
national transportation strike. 
  12. At the request of the transportation organization 
representatives, signatories of this act of agreement, all those 
who have been arrested for their involvement in the events 
linked to the transportation strike were freed, without 
detriment to the corresponding procedural investigation. 
Present were Monsignor Eddy Montenegro [Vicar general of the 
Managua Archdiocese] and Dr. Armando Urbina Vasquez. 
  Issued in the City of Managua at 0600 on 29 January 1994. 
  [Signed] Finance Minister Emilio Pereira Alegria; Labor 
Minister Dr. Francisco Rosales Arguello; Construction and 
Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil Icaza; Government Minister 
Alfredo Mendieta Artola; Economy and Development Minister Pablo 
Pereira Gallardo; Brigade Commander Fernando Caldera Azmitia,

  [Text] Managua, 29 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Transportation Commission [CNT] today ignored the agreements the 
government and four transportation sector organizations signed 
early this morning and called for the continuation of the 
transportation strike throughout the country. 
  During this morning's meeting with the government, the 
Nicaraguan Freight Transportation Federation [Federacion de 
Transporte Carga de Nicaragua], the National Chamber of 
Transportation [Camara Nacional del Transporte], and the 
National Association of Transportation [Asociacion Nacional del 
Transporte] committed themselves to suspending the 
transportation strike, which entered on its sixth day today. 
  The authorities agreed to freeze the prices of gasoline and 
diesel fuel until May and April, respectively, granted a subsidy 
to cooperatives of taxis and commercial delivery vehicles during 
the next four months, and granted tax exonerations and 
concessions. 
  The government also released the 209 drivers arrested 26 and 
27 January during police operations in the Nicaraguan capital, 
because they had obstructed the free movement of people. 
  After dismissing the agreement, Gustavo Aguiluz, a spokesman 
for the Sandinist CNT, described this morning's agreement, 
however, as a show mounted by the government in alliance with 
other organizations to unsettle or weaken the strike. 
  He said unilateral decisions do not resolve the demands on 
the gasoline issue. He said in four months a new demonstration 
would be necessary to prevent a fuel price increase. The 
passenger service strike continues, and only a few buses and 
taxis are circulating in Managua. 
  The CNT has called a demonstration of force for 31 January 
in 
this capital, where it will rally all of the country's buses and 
taxis.

  [Excerpt] Managua, 30 Jan (DPA) -- National Police troops 
patrolled the Nicaraguan capital today on the seventh day of the 
transportation strike, although certain buses began to operate 
in the capital. 
  The police deployment, which includes vehicle checks, was 
prompted by the National Transportation Commission (CNT), which 
said it will stage a huge march with 5,000 vehicles that will 
gather in Managua tomorrow to continue the protest against the 
government. 
  Although the government has released more than 200 drivers 
who had been arrested in the past operations in Managua, the 
CNT, which called the strike, this weekend rejected the way four 
transportation organizations made "deals" with the government, 
causing them to be labeled "traitors" by the CNT. 
  The city newspapers published reports on Managua's 
militarization, noting there are few cases in which street 
corners and crossings are not guarded by policemen who are armed 
with Soviet AKA rifles and ammunition, giving the impression 
they are going to war. 
  Many policemen are driving state vehicles, including 
Transportation and Construction Ministry vehicles. [passage

  [Text] General Humberto Ortega underwent surgery on both 
knees at a Mexican clinic, Sergio Ramirez, Sandinist National 
Liberation Front bloc chief, stated yesterday during a news 
conference. 
  Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock confirmed 
today to LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega underwent "a minor 
operation in Mexico on both knees but is in perfect condition 
and will soon return to the country." 
  Yesterday, Sergio Ramirez called a news conference to defend 
himself from attacks by his opponents in Sandinist radio 
stations La Primerisima and Ya. 
  In a commentary, newsman William Grisby said Gen. Ortega had 
maintained a political alliance with Presidency Minister Antonio 
Lacayo and Ramirez, but these two had betrayed the army chief 
last September. 
  When Ramirez was asked about the charges that he betrayed 
Gen. Ortega, he replied: The last time I spoke with Humberto 
Ortega was Thursday, when he called me from Mexico because of my 
mother's death. "From his hospital bed and still under the 
anesthesia, he called me very shaken to give me his 
condolences.... That is my personal relationship with Humberto 
Ortega," the former Sandinist vice president stated. It is not 
known if Ortega will use crutches for some time or will walk 
with a cane.

  [Text] Demetrio Chavez Pena Herrera, 40, alias El Vaticano 
or Loco Limoniel, the country's most wanted drug trafficker was 
briefly presented today to the media at the Dincote [National 
Counterterrorism Directorate] headquarters in Lima. Chavez, who 
during the presentation was wearing a striped prison suit 
bearing the number 1891 on the back, has been charged with 
narco-terrorism and treason. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote spokesman recording] According 
to 
preliminary investigations carried out by DINAN [National Police 
Intelligence Narcotics Department] in accordance with police 
report no. 45 of 23 January, evidence was found linking Demetrio 
Chavez Pena Herrera to narco-terrorism activities. [end 
recording] 
  As has already been established, initial DINAN 
investigations 
have uncovered links between El Vaticano and subversive groups 
operating in the Alto Huallaga region. This connection has been 
verified by several former terrorists who decided to surrender 
to the authorities. 
  The charges were acknowledged by El Vaticano to a military 
prosecutor as well as his defense attorney Juan Lazarte Luna. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote spokesman recording, in 
progress] 
...alias El Vaticano or Loco Limoniel, used them as links to 
ensure their support and cooperation which has been corroborated 
in affidavits by several former terrorists who decided to 
surrender. In turn, the charges have been acknowledged by the 
accused in the presence of his defense attorney as well as the 
corresponding prosecutor. [end recording] 
  The drug trafficker would resort to the services of a few 
terrorists known as Artemio, Clae, Manzini, James, and Liborio 
to transfer protection money [cupos] to the PCP [Peruvian 
Communist Party], Shining Path, as well as MRTA [Tupac Amaru

newscast] 
  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] 
has discovered links between drug-trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera and subversive organizations in Alto Huallaga. 
  Chavez, alias El Vaticano, was presented to the local and 
foreign media a few minutes ago wearing the characteristic 
striped attire in which terrorists are presented. Chavez' shirt 
had the number 1891 and he appeared very briefly -- 10 seconds 
-- before the media. 
  Dincote Commander Hugo Sayers Calderon illustrated the links 
between the drug trafficker and the subversive organizations. 
He reported that Chavez had provided weapons to the terrorists 
and had built a rural road at Campanilla. 
  Juan Lazarte Luna, who was Chavez's lawyer until noon today, 
formally announced that he would not defend the drug trafficker 
because, he said, he has too much work. He declared, however, 
that he will continue to defend Demetrio Chavez' sister, Berta 
Chavez, who is scheduled to be released tomorrow. Lazarte also 
reported that Fausto Parra will continue the drug terrorist's 
defense for all pending charges against him. 
  Television host Susan Leon, who is being held at the police 
station women's section for her alleged involvement in the El 
Vaticano case, will be released in the coming hours. Her 
lawyer, Mario Rodriguez Hurtado, presented a habeas corpus 
appeal, which the 5th Arraignment Court has to respond to within 
24 hours. Upon receiving the habeas corpus, 5th Arraignment 
Court Judge Carmen Rojari visited Susan Leon in jail where she 
has been held for the last four days. 
  Also, hair stylist Segundo Gonzales, alias Chocco, who has 
been held at the Dirandro [General Narcotics Directorate] 
headquarters for the last five days, will be released today or 
tomorrow. His lawyer, Rosa del Corral, reported that El 
Vaticano himself had testified that his friendship with the hair 
stylist was only based on the latter's profession. 
  Former Miss World Lucila Boggiano de Zoeger's situation, 
however, is still unknown. She is currently at the Estela Maris 
Clinic where she had to be admitted last Monday. Comedian 
Andres Hurtado, alias Chibolin, and his wife, Marilu Montiel, 
are also under arrest on charges of alleged links to the El 
Vaticano case.

  [Excerpts] In recent months the Navy has captured more than 
40 insurgents and some 160 drug traffickers as they were 
transporting drugs from Aguaytia towards the area of 
Constitucion and Palcazu, an area of increasing drug trafficking. 
  This according to Rear Admiral Juan Luis Podesta Llosa, 
chief 
of the Politico-Military Command of the Ucayali Front, who also 
said that the most turbulent area in his region of 
responsibility is the province of Padre Abad (Aguaytia). 
  He said that the province is still experiencing much 
violence 
because of the relationship that exists between drug traffickers 
and terrorists. 
  "The insurgents are seeking funding sources for their 
criminal activities and they have found them in Padre Abad," 
Podesta said. 
  He said he is not able to advance toward full pacification 
in 
the region as fast as he would like, but that in recent months 
they had captured more than 40 terrorists, of which some 18 had 
expressed a wish to avail themselves of the Law on Repentance. 
  He explained that the drug collection points near Aguaytia 
had been moved to Palcazu, with the result that the "rattling" 
(method of carrying drugs in small quantities to the collection 
centers) has a broader road to travel between the coca area of 
Aguaytia and Palcazu. The Navy was able to capture about 160 
drug traffickers there in the last six months, according to 
Podesta. 
  "This," he said, "is why drug trafficking operations have 
been moved to Palcazu, a region for which the Ucayali Front does 
not have responsibility." 
  He said that in the case of Ucayali, all the leaders of the 
terrorist groups have been identified thanks to various 
repentants. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Most Important Capture </H5>
  Podesta Llosa considers the capture of Leo Humberto Pena 
Gutierrez, formerly of San Marco University, and known as 
comrade Marcos, Gramdzo, or Felix, the most important capture 
this year because he was a leader in two SL [Shining Path] 
companies, "Adversity" and "Daring," while at the same time 
being the military deputy of the "Nippon" battalion, all of 
which are active in the Ucayali area. He was also one of the 
leadership in the Huallaga Regional Committee of the Shining 
Path. 
  With that capture and the capture of comrade Atilio--Roman 
Rengifo Murrieta--only eight of the Navy's most wanted 
terrorists remain at large in the Ucayali region.

  [Text] Gustavo Petro, M-19 [19 April Movement-Democratic 
Alliance] delegate to the Chamber of Representatives, was at the 
head of a large number of visitors to Juanchaco, where U.S. 
soldiers, whose presence is controversial, are stationed. Petro 
and his group not only could not get in but confirmed that the 
foreigners completely control the area. 
  Only four of the group of 84 were allowed into the site and 
observe everything related to the presence of U.S. troops 
stationed at Malaga Bay. The group, People's Observers, headed 
by Petro, rapidly walked around the area and confirmed that 
Colombian authorities do not control the U.S. troops. The 
Marines control everything. 
  [Begin Petro recording] The Colombian High Command does not 
control the U.S. weapons, which are locked in an 80 cubic meter 
green trailer. We also found that the Colombian military does 
not control the information dispatched from the site, which 
presently is being sent via microwave, but which later will be 
dispatched through a satellite whose ground station is being 
built. [end recording] 
  Petro said it is impossible for the People's Observers to 
operate. Not only was he not permitted to film the 
installations, but an accompanying photographer was ordered to 
stay out of the area, although he held a card authorizing entry.

  [Text] Just as the government slogan stated during the year 
of the blackout [el apagon] that "Drop by drop, the water is 
wasted," President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy for the position of 
OAS secretary general will run the same fate, at least insofar 
as the human rights problem vis-a-vis the OAS is concerned. 
  Gaviria's nomination will reportedly be doomed by the 
government's noncompliance with the Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission [CIDH], which has asked the Colombian Government to 
severely punish human rights violators. 
  For the lawyers who have denounced 15 human rights cases 
before the OAS, the black mark the Gaviria administration has in 
the organization's files will shatter the president's candidacy. 
  The future of Gaviria's candidacy is being threatened by the 
case of Fernando Lalinde Lalinde, who was murdered in 1987; the 
disappearance of 13 students between 1981 and 1982, when the 
police were searching for the kidnappers of the Alvarez 
children; and the cases of attorneys Alirio Pedraza, Martin 
Calderon, Primitivo Silva, Isidro Caballero, Patricia Rivera, 
and Olga Ester Bernal. In all these cases, the OAS asked the 
Colombian Government to financially compensate the relatives and 
punish severely those responsible for these actions. 
  President Gaviria's government has said, however, the 
commission's resolutions were recommendations and, therefore, 
were not mandatory. This attitude annoyed the CIDH, which in 
the following days decided to file a suit against the Colombian 
Government before the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court, 
which is headquartered in Costa Rica. The suit regarded the 
cases of rural teachers Isidro Caballero and Maria del Carmen 
Santana, who disappeared on 4 February 1989 in Cesar Department. 
  The lawyers who denounced these events before the OAS 
believe 
this constitutes a major setback to Gaviria's candidacy, because 
the government's accuser, the CIDH, has weight and influence 
throughout the continent. 
  According to the lawyers, this lawsuit against the 
government 
represents an unavoidable obstacle to Gaviria's candidacy, 
because whenever he would have to make any decision--should he 
became the new secretary general--nobody would trust a person 
who did not comply with the organization's resolutions during 
his administration.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 January (DPA) -- Presidential 
Narino Palace sources reported today the Colombian Government 
had initiated the new Environment Ministry, which will watch 
over and protect the country's natural resources from now on. 
  President Cesar Gaviria has appointed Manuel Rodriguez as 
this agency's first minister. Rodriguez was director of the 
government's Institute for the Development of Renewable Natural 
Resources (Inderena), an organization that will be liquidated 
shortly. 
  The Congress of the Republic approved the creation of the 
Environment Ministry last year. The guidelines, planning, and 
implementation of this ministry will be financed by a special 
transfer of resources, Rodriguez stated when he accepted the 
position. 
  Colombia is a country rich in natural resources, but those 
resources have suffered a serious erosion during the past years 
due to the high levels of contamination and deforestation to 
allow for the emergence of "concrete jungles." 
  The government has announced, however, that it will launch a 
strong environmental protection policy, which the new agency 
will coordinated.

  [Text] French President Francois Mitterrand and Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe have offered Colombian Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin de Rubio their full support in getting the European 
Union (EU) to prolong the special tariff privileges program for 
Colombian products. 
  After a meeting scheduled to last 15 minutes, but which 
lasted an hour, the Colombian diplomat said Colombia will be 
able to sell almost all its products to the 12 EU countries 
without paying duties. She added that such conditions would be 
applicable for a period of four or 10 years, depending on 
Colombia's request, to begin when the current agreement expires. 
  Noemi Sanin visited France in December and met with French 
officials to expound on the country's achievements, the 
government modernization policy, the strengthening of the 
judicial system, the efforts to counter drug trafficking, the 
peace process with the guerrillas, and the defense of human 
rights. 
  The possibility of France investing in our products, 
including bananas, and the repercussions for Colombia -- 
especially the Uraba region -- would be a positive step that 
would further expand Colombia's participation in the foreign 
market.

<F P=106> [Article by Camilo Chaparro; first paragraph is EL TIEMPO </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] In 12,000 early sentencing hearings, the 
prosecutor's office has sentenced nearly 9,000 people. Of those 
investigated, 60 percent were charged with crimes related to 
drug trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. 
  The Office of the Prosecutor General has developed legal 
procedures for the early termination of criminal proceedings and 
penalty negotiations, and in this way has put an end to crimes 
going unpunished and delays in nearly 9,000 investigations. 
  In just 18 months the Office of the Prosecutor General has 
held approximately 12,000 special early verdict hearings and has 
sentenced almost 9,000 accused persons. 
  According to Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose 
Sintura, the use of penalty negotiations is increasing, and is 
having a direct impact on unclogging the judicial backlog and 
preventing crimes from going unpunished. 
  Sintura told EL TIEMPO that even though most of the 
negotiations (60 percent of the hearings) were held for persons 
charged with crimes in the jurisdiction of regional or special 
prosecutors, the use of early verdict hearings is rising for 
ordinary crimes. 
  "Of the 12,000 early verdict hearings the Office of the 
Prosecutor General has held, most are related to crimes handled 
by regional judicial officials--drug trafficking, extortion, 
terrorism, homicide for the purposes of terrorism, and 
kidnapping--but we are also beginning to see a significant 
increase in the negotiation of penalties for ordinary crimes 
like petty theft, personal injuries, embezzlement, etc." 
  Only 30 percent of the 12,000 settlements of negotiated 
penalties reached in the last 18 months by regional or special 
prosecutors and sectional or ordinary prosecutors have been 
overturned by judges. 
  Sintura stated that negotiated settlements are rejected 
basically because of judges being overly legalistic. "For 
example, there are cases," he said, "in which a judge annuls a 
settlement reached between the accused and the prosecutor's 
office because a member of our staff forgot to list the penalty 
of a fine, which in any event is clearly stipulated in the law." 
  Sintura admits, though, that on other occasions prosecutors 
have made mistakes that lead judges to annul the settlements. 
"In some cases they do not properly support the charges, or they 
poorly describe the crime or seek inappropriate penalties," he 
added. 
  The deputy prosecutor general believes that with last 
November's reform of the Criminal Procedures Code, negotiated 
penalties are going to increase considerably, for now they will 
be easier to use. 
  "With these new amendments," said Sintura, "this type of 
settlement will be reached directly between the accused and the 
prosecutor. After the hearing a document will be sent to the 
judge so the judge can verify its legality. That will make the 
negotiations smoother, as the judge's intervention will not be 
as direct." 
  According to Sintura, the early verdict procedure has 
enabled 
society to convict a number of criminals against whom the state 
had no evidence. 
<H5>  The Ochoas and Urdinola </H5>
  Of the 12,000 hearings held by the Office of the Prosecutor 
General, the deputy prosecutor's office has handled the eight 
most sensitive cases. Sintura conducted the sentence negotiation 
procedures with Ivan Urdinola Grajales, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, 
Fabio and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and some others as well. 
  "In some of these cases we had no solid evidence, and if not 
for the criminals' confession, which grants them some benefits, 
it would not have been possible to win a conviction," said the 
official. 
  "This office has conducted eight early verdict hearings. The 
most difficult to date was Urdinola's case, as we knew that the 
automatic sentence reductions provided by the law would not let 
us put him away for many years, and second, because the evidence 
we had against this man was quite rudimentary," added Sintura. 
  Sintura says that the sentence of four years and seven 
months 
(the actual time) that Urdinola has to serve was "essentially 
based on his own confession and on some documents U.S. officials 
provided. If we had taken this case to court without his 
confession, we could not have gotten a verdict." 
  He explained that a negotiated penalty also offers the 
prosecutor's office the advantage of the possibility of 
conducting other investigations against persons with whom 
penalties are being or have been negotiated. 
  "We conduct very specific negotiations with very 
well-circumscribed charges so that we can pursue other 
investigations; for example, Jorge Luis and Fabio Ochoa 
confessed to cocaine trafficking between 1974 and 1990." 
  "If the prosecutor's office demonstrates that between 1991 
and 1993 they distributed more cocaine, we can bring another 
case against them that has nothing to do with the negotiated 
penalty," says Sintura. 
  "In Urdinola's case," he added, "charges and penalties were 
arranged for drug trafficking, and he was told that a homicide 
charge against him was not included in this negotiation." 
  "He obviously always wanted the homicide charge to be 
included in the negotiation. But the position of the Office of 
the Prosecutor General was clear: homicide charges were not 
negotiable unless he made a confession; as he did not confess to 
the homicide charges and claimed to be innocent, we are now 
moving forward with that case," said the deputy prosecutor 
general.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of </F>
the Armed Forces, by Reporter Trino Murillo on 25 January; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Murillo] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua 
Elvir, chief of the Armed Forces, explained certain Armed Forces 
plans and rebutted criticism from certain sectors of Honduran 
society. At the beginning of the interview Gen. Discua 
discussed a very important issue: the transfer or change over of 
Joint Chief of Staff Reynaldo Andino Flores to the Defense 
Ministry. My first question is if this should be viewed as a 
purge or a normal change within the Armed Forces. 
  [Discua] Allow me to tell you that no ulterior motives 
should be attached to this situation. A list of officers who 
could fill the Defense Ministry post was presented to the 
president-elect, who had publicly requested such a list at a 
council meeting. When he returned from the United States I gave 
him a list of several officers and the selection was made 
exclusively by the president- elect. 
  [Murillo] That is a normal decision during a change of 
government. Nevertheless, he also spoke of the duties the 
military institution would carry out through the Executive 
Branch to coordinate with Congress a purging of the police and 
to counteract the crime wave that is destroying the country. 
  [Discua] As I said, there are many issues that must be 
approached in a very serious manner, such as military service, 
human rights, and the police. I have spoken at length with the 
president- elect about these issues because the Armed Forces 
want to resolve them. Of course, it would be irresponsible on 
our part to [words indistinct] because that requires a process 
that should conclude prior to the year 2000 when the police and 
Armed Forces are in the condition the people would like to see. 
The Armed Forces have always agreed with a constitutional 
reform pertaining to the police, and we are working on it. In 
due time we will present a report to the president-elect; the 
general situation has been outlined to him and we are waiting 
for him to summon us. We are [words indistinct] to all the 
issues that have been sources of controversy at any given time, 
but this has helped us to reconsider and begin a period during 
which, I believe, the people will be content. 
  [Murillo] Spokesmen from the party that is about to take 
office have said that international organizations are pressing 
for constitutional reforms and that they have established 
certain conditions. These conditions include reducing the Army 
and making certain basic taxes mandatory so payments will 
continue to be made to the government. What is your reaction to 
this? You have always said that foreign pressure should never 
prevail. 
  [Discua] I must tell you that approximately three months 
ago, or, in other words, last year a meeting was held in Chile 
to examine Latin America's military spending. The participants 
took a very close look at military spending with regard to each 
country's gross domestic product. In Latin America, military 
spending fluctuates between 1 percent and 7.6 or 7.8 percent. 
Therefore, there are countries whose military spending is very 
high. Honduras' spending is less than 1 percent. In other 
words, our military spending with regard to our GDP is the 
lowest in Central America and even in Latin America. The 
Honduran Armed Forces have a budget of $40 million; Costa Rica 
has $48 million, and the figure rises. In other words, Honduras 
is the Central American country that spends the least on its 
military. 
  [Murillo] [words indistinct] making of demands seems to be 
a prerequisite? 
  [Discua] This is logical. However, I believe the 
president-elect stated categorically in Washington that the 
Armed Forces reduction had to conform to each government's needs 
for equipment [word indistinct]. I have always said that we 
have to find a balance in Central America. I know the 
institution must make structural reforms to be in keeping with 
the new government's modernization policy. 
  [Murillo] With regard to the implementation of the military 
law, General Discua said there is no wrestling for power or 
internal strife in the military institution. He added that new 
groups arise in the Armed Forces as classes start to retire in 
compliance with the institution's bylaws and military law. 
  [Discua] Logically, we at Mufoco [expansion unknown] will no 
longer be active Armed Forces officers, and new classes will 
start taking our places. I believe we have to start the opening 
process. My entire graduating class will retire when I finish my 
term and new classes will take our places. They are young 
military men with experience who will always try to do what is 
best for the institution. We have to hope that this is how it 
will turn out. 
  [Murillo] As an institutional policy, and based on 
international agreements, several U.S. Government sectors have 
already asserted that they support turning Palmerola into a 
regional counter narcotics center for Central America and the 
Caribbean. This prospect is also supported by President Reina. 
Do the Armed Forces endorse it too? 
  [Discua] One of my administration's main objectives has been 
the struggle against drugs. I have supported all the programs 
initiated by our government and those initiated by friendly 
countries to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. I have 
always said the Soto Cano Base should be turned into a Honduran 
base to combat drug trafficking at a regional level. It should 
unify all actions in the region to enable us to stop or lessen 
the flow of drugs to northern countries. 
  [Murillo] Has this been discussed at top levels, General? 
  [Discua] Yes, we have been talking about this possibility 
constantly. I visited Washington and talked with senators and 
congressmen about my plans to combat drug trafficking.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (AFP) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said the recent terrorist attacks in 
his country are linked to the upcoming referendum, and he added 
that some "extremist groups" do not want the democratic process 
in Guatemala to be strengthened. 
  De Leon, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new 
Honduran president, regretted that the bombings, blackouts, and 
some shootings, which took place in the capital last night, are 
creating tension in his country two days before the referendum. 
In Sunday's referendum, the people will decide whether to 
approve a series of constitutional reforms, the most important 
of which will allow new officials to be appointed to the 
Congress and to the Supreme Court this year. 
  De Leon said he and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina 
share the goals of fighting corruption, drug trafficking, and 
poverty, as well as the search for peace and economic growth 
with social justice for everyone. The Guatemalan president 
noted that guerrillas have been active in his country over the 
past 30 years. He said his government will resume talks with 
the rebels in mid-February in a search for peace in the only 
Central American country where an armed conflict persists. 
  De Leon Carpio said he hopes a peace agreement will be 
signed 
this year because a commitment has been made to the United 
Nations to achieve this goal. He also said that if the parties 
fail to reach an agreement, they would be showing a lack of 
commitment.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (AFP) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio said today that the Central American 
countries will support Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister 
Bernd Niehaus on his bid to be OAS secretary general. De Leon, 
who is in Honduras on an official visit, told the media that 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria requested support for his 
possible candidacy to the OAS post, but "we have a commitment 
that we must keep unless a reason unrelated to said agreement 
prevents us from doing so." 
  The Guatemalan president participated in the inauguration of 
liberal lawyer Carlos Reina, the new Honduran president, on 27 
January. Before he returned to Guatemala today, De Leon also 
participated in the closing of the Central American Parliament 
plenary sessions. 
  Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and President Reina 
also expressed their support for Niehaus, although the new 
Honduran president reiterated his position of supporting Gaviria 
should the Costa Rican foreign minister fail to win in the first 
round of the elections. Reina told the media that "we like very 
much other rulers who want the post." 
  Confronted by the media, Nicaraguan President Violeta 
Chamorro refused to address this topic and only said that "the 
vote is secret." Some inferred that she tacitly supported 
Gaviria in violation of the Central American commitment. 
  Gaviria, who also attended the protocol acts in Tegucigalpa, 
met briefly with several regional leaders who attended the 
inauguration on 27 January. He denied that he was lobbying for 
his candidacy and pointed out that they discussed only issues of 
common interest such as trade and technical cooperation. 
Gaviria said that he is studying the launching of his 
candidacy, proposed by other countries, before making a decision. 
  The selection of the new OAS secretary general is scheduled 
for March 1994, and the United States has publicly backed 
President Gaviria. 
  Besides Niehaus, who claims to have 23 votes so far (18 are 
needed to win the election), former Foreign Ministers Carlos 
Iturralde (Bolivia) and Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), who 
has also lobbied in Honduras lately, were also nominated to the 
post.

  [Text] The following is a press release signed by 
Jean-Claude Martineau, spokesman for President Aristide. The 
communique reads as follows: 
  A working session between the Haitian delegation, led by 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; and a Canadian delegation, led 
by Andre Ouellet, minister of foreign affairs, took place on 24 
January at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa. The 
session's agenda included the following points: the Haitian 
crisis; the United Nations file; the training of a managerial 
staff for a national police force, as provided for in the 
Governors Island agreement; and Haitian-Canadian bilateral 
cooperation. The two delegations agreed on the following points: 
  To disentangle the Haitian situation, the embargo must be 
total; this will shorten the duration of the crisis. 
  Other countries should be added to the four friendly 
countries that now include Canada, Venezuela, the United States, 
and France. 
  The police force can be trained outside of Haiti. It will be 
done either with the collaboration of the United States or with 
the participation of several friendly countries. This force will 
receive training not only in maintaining order and safety, but 
also in respect for the law and the Constitution. 
  The two delegations reviewed several branches of activity in 
which Haitian-Canadian cooperation will be broadened following 
the return of democracy to Haiti: education, literacy, 
cooperative communication, and energy. Also discussed was a 
radio station that would allow the Haitian people to be well 
informed about what is being done and said on their behalf 
throughout the world. This would break the rule of silence and 
disinformation imposed by the military regime. 
  This press communique is signed by Jean-Claude Martineau, 
spokesman for President Aristide.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilfredo Cordoba; from the "KL Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Salvadoran police and judicial authorities rejected 
acts of impunity encouraged by the U.S. Embassy personnel who 
helped U.S. Major Mike Lopez illegally leave El Salvador. Lopez 
is charged with murdering Salvadoran citizen Jose Crecencion 
Diaz Alvarado. 
  The incident took place on 20 January when Diaz Alvarado's 
body was found inside a Jeep Cherokee with diplomatic license 
plate No. 753. Diaz Alvarado was one of Lopez' bodyguards. 
  Prosecutor General Romeo Melara Granillo considers the 
attitude of the Americans contradictory: 
  [Begin Melara recording] This is a total violation of our 
laws. What is also worrying is that the United States demands 
that we correctly apply justice while they violate our laws and 
make a mockery of them. They demand that we uphold the law but 
they violate them in cases such as this. This is what is 
worrying. Regardless of whether or not this person has 
diplomatic immunity he should have been processed through the 
Salvadoran legal system and it should not have been handled the 
way it was. [end recording] 
  The legal investigations are being conducted by the 
Soyopango 
2d Criminal Judge, who received a note from the U.S. Embassy 
saying that the criminal had departed the country bound for 
Panama. Nevertheless, immigration does not have his departure on 
record, PNC [National Civilian Police] Director Jose Maria 
Monterrey said. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] We are exerting pressure. That 
is our job and this is why we are here with the prosecutor. We 
are outraged over this incident. You must realize that every 
person who leaves through the airport must go through 
immigration. Even in the case of the president, he sends his 
passport and he enters and leaves and gets his passport stamped 
as well as all members of his entourage. This applies to 
everyone. 
  [Cordoba] Have you been able to establish who is to blame at 
the airport? 
  [Monterrey] We do not know yet whether he left through the 
airport or if he was taken out of the country some other way or 
whether he left using a passport under another name. The fact 
remains that several hours after the murder this major was 
already in Panama. You, as a member of the media, should recall 
the case of the Mexican who was involved in the cocaine robbery. 
Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] immediately ordered that 
he be placed in the hands of the justice system despite his 
diplomatic immunity. He has been under arrest for eight or nine 
months and is under the orders of a judge. [end recording] 
  This case will show whether the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador 
practices what it preaches to the Salvadoran Government and not 
allow another murder case to go unpunished.

  [Text] The U.S. Government offer to build roads, schools, 
and health centers in the interior of the country will 
reportedly be definitively rejected by President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy. He is reportedly being influenced by the local 
military leadership who has been purportedly left out by the 
"Yankees," who fear the Paraguayan military will mistakenly get 
the credit for the work. Sources contacted yesterday said that 
Wasmosy met with members of the Permanent Commission of 
Congress, who were asked to reject the U.S. Government offer 
because it will result in a national political-military dispute 
that can be avoided by rejecting the offer. 
  Several deputies held negotiations yesterday to avert the 
loss of important aid because of squabbles among national 
political sectors. 
  To get the offer rejected, Wasmosy reportedly met members of 
the Permanent Commission of Congress at the presidential 
residence to ask them for their "support." 
  Congressional sources have told NOTICIAS that Wasmosy asked 
the legislators to reject U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman's offer 
because of the privileges the Americans want to build these 
installations. 
  The same sources added that Wasmosy is refusing the offer in 
view of a political-military problem which arose because the 
U.S. Embassy demands that no Paraguayan military be involved in 
the project. 
  According to these sources, Wasmosy already gave his 
approval 
to Glassman at the beginning of January, but the president 
changed his mind after consulting the military commanders. It 
has been learned that the president is looking for a dignified 
way out. In view of this, he is meeting legislators so that 
Congress, not he, will "supposedly" be the one to reject the 
offer. 
  The same sources added that the problem is that the 
Paraguayan Army has already promised "to build one school per 
year." 
  It has been learned that legislators are studying the issue 
closely because the Paraguayan military law does not allow the 
Armed Forces to discredit politicians by committing themselves 
to build schools. Moreover, they said, this is not an Armed 
Forces task. 
  The 14-point agreement to be signed by the two governments 
establishes that the U.S. contingent will be relieved of some 
chores. Moreover, it will be provided with transportation. The 
agreement specifies that all privileges will apply only for the 
fulfillment of the mission. 
  Deputy Blas Llano was among those who, led by Congressional 
Permanent Commission Chairman Juan Carlos Ramirez Montalbetti, 
attended the meeting with Wasmosy on 26 January. Yesterday he 
paid a suspicious visit to the U.S. Embassy. Asked if he 
discussed the issue of the arrival of the American contingent, 
he answered yes. He added that consultations were being 
conducted to avoid losing the donation. Llano said: "I am only 
obtaining information to see how we can obtain this aid." 
  The U.S. Government has offered to build one health center, 
eight schools in rural areas, eight wells with raised water 
tanks, the corresponding plumbing and pumps, and to repair the 
roads leading to the construction sites. The United States 
wants only the Public Works Ministry involved in the project. 
  The project -- named "Strong Roads 1994-South" -- will be 
carried out by the U.S. Southern Command Task Force unit that is 
stationed in Panama. It will be held between 16 May and 15 
September. 
  In exchange for the works, the United States will conduct 
long- range deployment exercises. The agreement to be signed 
the U.S. Embassy specifies that the soldiers will not use heavy 
artillery or armored vehicles but that they will carry pistols. 
  The installations will be built in Santa Lucia, San 
Salvador, 
Santa Clara, San Francisco, Libertad and the city of "6 de 
Enero" in San Pedro department. 
  Deputy Euclides Acevedo (National Encounter Alliance), first 
vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday that 
only a joint session of Congress may authorize or reject a U.S. 
Government offer. However, he said that Congress is displeased 
over the arrival of the U.S. military contingent "because we 
have our own Armed Forces." 
  Acevedo added that he lacks sufficient information on the 
U.S. Government offer but stated he is not in favor of Congress 
authorizing U.S. military forces to build schools in Paraguay. 
  He said: "In principle, I do not fully agree with it. This 
is a sovereign country with its own Armed Forces. They should 
clearly specify the true objective of this trip because I do not 
see what the U.S. Armed Forces have to do with building schools 
in Paraguay." 
  Asked if he approves Army Commander Lino Cesar Oviedo's 
commitment to build "one school per year," Acevedo merely said 
that "the entire issue will be studied" in Congress.

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Jan (AFP) -- The street disturbances of 
the past days in Venezuela are reportedly part of a "political 
conspiracy" to mar the inauguration on Wednesday of president 
Rafael Caldera, Interior Minister Carlos Delgado Chapillin said 
on Friday. 
  "Everything is a conspiracy, a preconceived plan to disrupt 
the peace. The idea is to mar the inauguration of the new 
government and the functioning of the Congress," Delgado told 
newsmen. He added that classes will be suspended in those 
schools where disturbances take place. 
  The protests and turmoil in Caracas and major cities in the 
interior of the country have gone beyond student skirmishes. On 
Saturday, 18 January, over 100 persons were arrested in 
Barcelona (in the west) for setting fire and looting food 
trucks. The unrest extended the next day to neighboring Puerto 
La Cruz, Valencia (in the center), and Punto Fijo (in the 
northeast). 
  This week there were transportation strikes in several 
cities 
but the disturbances were concentrated in schools in the 
metropolitan areas of Caracas. A 17-year-old student was killed 
in the bedroom community of Los Teques in the midst of a 
skirmish between students and police.

  [Text] Brasilia -- On 26 January, after a day fraught with 
negotiations and comings and goings, the administration managed 
to get congressional approval for Provisional Measure [MP] No. 
400, which increased income tax rates for individuals and 
established the 35 percent bracket for those who make more than 
$10,000 [time span not specified]. This MP was approved by 190 
votes to 111 in the Chamber of Deputies and by 39 votes to five 
in the Senate. 
  Now that MP No. 400 has been approved there are still five 
fiscal adjustment-related MP's pending: MP No. 407 that 
increases corporate income taxes 5 percent, MP No. 404 that 
establishes an inspection tax that banks must pay, MP No. 401 
that increases the tax on financial operations for investments 
in the financial market, PM No. 394 that bans the use of 
Treasury funds at the Central Bank to pay anything but debts, 
and MP No. 392 on privatizations. 
  Throughout the day the administration managed to get 
approval 
for only three of the nine other MP's Congress had to vote on. 
The obstructionist attitude of the PPR [Progressive Renewal 
Party] and the PFL [Liberal Front Party], unwilling to approve 
tax hikes, was jeopardizing the voting on the main fiscal 
adjustment measures. The PFL and the PPR broke the agreement 
they had reached with Finance Minister Henrique Cardoso the week 
before and asked for quorum verification. Unless there were 252 
deputies present (the minimum required) the entire time, the 
session would be discontinued and it would be very difficult for 
the administration to get approval for the MP's, which would 
expire over the weekend. 
  During the morning and afternoon of 26 January, Congress 
approved MP No. 402 that establishes an income tax on foreign 
investments in the stock market and the distribution of 
dividends, MP No. 399 that changes the Rural Land Tax (ITR), and 
MP No. 406 that reduces the deadline for the collection of 
federal taxes and contributions. In view of the inflexibility 
of the PPR and the PFL, Jose Serra, Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party speaker in the Chamber of Deputies, went so far as to 
threaten to withdraw the administration's support for the 
constitutional reform.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemala 
public administration today is semi-paralyzed because the 
majority of its 140,000 workers have joined the one-day strike 
called by the National Federation of State Workers Unions 
(Fenasteg) to request salary hikes. 
  Fenasteg Secretary General Armando Sanchez told ACAN-EFE

the strike is general (and requests a 40-percent salary 
increase), while government sources said it has had no effect. 
Fenasteg stressed that some 140,000 government and municipal 
employees are on strike as of 0800 hours local time (1400 GMT) 
and will stage demonstrations on the capital's main access 
routes to block traffic. 
  For its part, the National Federation of Public Employees 
Unions (Fenasep), a public administration labor union which does 
not support the strike, reported that the strike is partial. 
  Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli, told the 
media that the strike will have no repercussions on the 
government, as it is backed by a "minimal number of workers," 
those who maintain a radical position and exert pressure without 
exhausting the possibility of a dialogue. 
  Luna said the strike will not undermine the development of 
the referendum, to be held next Sunday, through which the 
reforms to the Constitution should be ratified or rejected. The 
reforms include the possibility of moving up the elections to 
elect a new Congress and Supreme Court of Justice. The official 
advised that, if the public employees carry out actions that 
"clash" with the law, they will be punished. 
  He reiterated that the government will not grant any salary 
increase to the workers because the state has no funds to meet 
those demands, which shall be discussed by the Labor Ministry 
Commission for Salary. 
  This is the first labor movement to confront the 
administration of Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who took office in June 
1993, after Jorge Serrano was overthrown following his failed 
self-inflicted coup in May. The National Transportation 
Confederation (CNT), also announced that it will stage a general 
strike on 1 February to demand that the government authorize an 
increase in the rates for their service. The CNT gathers 
passenger and fuel transportation enterprises, which will mean a 
lack of fuel supplies and the resulting paralysis of industrial 
and commercial activities in the capital.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mattos] </F>
  [Excerpts] The new security and seclusion system 
implemented at the Miguel Castro Castro prison, which lodges 
around 500 subversives, has began showing positive results. 
Shining Path followers who support surrender have separated 
from their radical "commanders" and now want peace. And those 
who have repented demand that the law benefiting them be 
regulated. 
  Colonel PNP [Peruvian National Police] Gabino Cajahuanca 
Parra, director of the Miguel Castro Castro Special Regime 
Prison, said: "Everything seems to indicate that Shining Path 
inmates are involved in something that can be described as 
withdrawal." 
  The work of the intelligence service to get Shining Path 
followers to support Abimael Guzman Reinoso's call to lay down 
their arms, and the rigorous isolation surrounding indicted and 
condemned subversives, has apparently affected Shining Path 
morale. 
  It is not a coincidence that in the past few weeks many 
Shining Path "commanders" imprisoned in the Castro Castro prison 
have began distancing themselves from their most radical cadres. 
  "That is a fact that no one here denies," a subversive 
inmate 
said. 
  It is known that 35 subversives have repented at the Castro 
Castro prison so far. But their numbers could increase if the 
government issues regulations for reducing the sentences of 
"repenting" Shining Path followers. 
  LA REPUBLICA talked with one "repenting" Shining Path 
follower whose secret code is A1AA0043. He said that inside the 
prison "many Shining Path followers want to repent, but the lack 
of definition of their legal status makes them remain silent." 
  The case of this Shining Path inmate -- number A1AA0043 -- 
who was leader of a teachers union before being recruited by the 
Shining Path, could be useful for the government in speeding up 
the approval of the regulations in question. 
  "I have been under the protection of the Repentance Law for 
the past four months, and so far no one has helped me. I have 
more information on Shining Path leaders, but why should I give 
it away if I am still here?" the repenting subversive said. The 
information he gave to the police permitted the capture of three 
important political and military PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist 
Party -- Shining Path] "commanders." 
  A1AA0043 is supported only by the direction of a penal 
institution that has decided to isolate him from the rest of the 
Shining Path following. His case shows the rigidity of a prison 
system that has began to yield positive results. 
  A1AA0043 emphatically said that "many of those imprisoned 
here have started to realize what Shining Path really is here in 
jail." 
  "The situation is such thanks to Col. Cajahuanca Parra, who 
has reestablished discipline and has taken control away from the 
old Shining Path leadership," A1AA0043 said. 
  Other reports heard by LA REPUBLICA before support this 
assertion. 
  Another one who repented said: "In the past, the Shining 
Path commanders made us work for them. Now their power has been 
taken away by the isolation into which they have been forced, 
and this has brought us great peace." He added: "Their abuse 
made us understand that we were nothing to the commanders." 
  The same source, who pretended to be the "supervisor" of a 
wing in the penitentiary which is also called Canto Grande, 
revealed that in the past the "commanders" had physically abused 
the inmates by beating and raping them if they did not support 
Shining Path. 
  Now everything seems to have changed in the prison. [passage 
omitted] 
  Now nothing looks like the old courtyards where the Shining 
Path members had their murals, rabbit hutches, pigeon lofts, 
plants, and cubbyholes where they hid their weapons, and where 
they competed with the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] 
with bright colors and subversive slogans. 
  That is now gone. Everything has been covered by concrete 
and heavy paint. 
  One of the supervisors said: "The only time there is noise 
here is in the morning, when groups of inmates come down to the 
first floor to fill their containers with water. As far as 
their hygiene is concerned, they clean themselves in the showers 
in the courtyards and when they come out into the open." 
[passage omitted] 
  Policemen permanently watch all activities in each cell, in 
each floor, in each wing. This is controlled strictly by 
Colonel Cajahuanca Parra, who visits the wings every day. 
  This officer, a hardliner, is identified by his personnel 
and 
the inmates as the one responsible for the changes made. 
  "We want to thank the director for the treatment we get. It 
is true there is extreme security, but I have been here for the 
last four and a half years, and I can assure you that life here 
was worth nothing," said Victor Manuel Miranda, delegate of wing 
5B, where the 148 inmates sentenced for drug trafficking are 
kept. 
  He added: "Now, however, we are calm. There are no longer 
drugs, liquor, police corruption, and killings." [passage 
omitted] 
  The discipline and strict security measures are so extensive 
that there have been no escapes from the penitentiary. [passage 
omitted] 
  Under the same discipline, the inmates sentenced to life in 
prison, who number around 50, and the 35 who have repented are 
kept under special protection. 
  We also entered the wing of those who have repented and 
those 
who are kept isolated, which includes former Congressman Yehude 
Simon Munaro, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for 
terrorism. 
  Munaro said: "I was isolated because the subversives accuse 
me of being a pacifist, and the government of being subversive." 
He added: "The documents for my defense will be submitted to 
the United Nations in the next few days." [passage omitted] 
  Only time will tell if the new antisubversive penitentiary 
policy will contribute to the pacification of the country. In 
any case, the first step and the hardest was already taken by 
the director of the Miguel Castro Castro penitentiary.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 28 Jan, CANA -- Guyana has 
announced the divestment of four state companies, including the 
Guyana Sugar Corporation's dairy and milk production plants. 
Prime Minister Dr. Cheddi Jagan also announced Thursday that the 
government had concluded the sale of the Guyana Stores retail 
outlet chain; the Guyana National Engineering Corporation, a 
company reputed for shipbuilding; and government's shares in the 
Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry. 
  Addressing donors from more than 30 countries and 15 
international lending institutions, President Jagan restated his 
government's commitment to a healthy private sector. The 
Guyanese president acknowledged that government's pace in 
privatisation had been slow, but he defended this on the grounds 
that the process of identifying state companies suitable for 
divestment could not be short circuited. 
  "There is absolutely no ground for scepticism as regards the 
orientation... And commitment to a strong and healthy private 
sector," the prime minister said. "Whatever we do, the people of 
the nation will not be compromised," he added.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 28 Jan, CANA -- Guyana's main 
parliamentary opposition group, the People's National Congress 
(PNC), has urged the international donor community to withhold 
aid to the country unless it agrees to stay clear of the 
Marxist/Leninist ideology. 
  The PNC, in a message aimed at the World Bank-organised 
Conference of the Caribbean Group for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (CGCED) here, also said further support for the 
government would be fruitless unless it was accompanied by good 
governance and sound economic policies. 
  The party says the donor community must insist that the 
Cheddi Jagan administration formulate, publish and table in 
Parliament a policy paper committing itself unreservedly to a 
free and open society and a market-oriented economy. 
  "They should require of the government a firm undertaking to 
eschew Marxist/Leninist ideological considerations in the 
determination of economic reforms," the PNC said. 
  About 70 supporters of the party, including several former 
top government ministers, picketed the opening of the two-day 
CGCED and chanted "broken promises" when former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter arrived at the forum. 
  The umbrella Trades Union Congress (TUC), the Amerindian 
People's Association (APA), the Guyana Human Rights Association 
and the Guyana Consumers Association also picketed the 
conference. 
  The PNC, in the lengthy statement, accused the government of 
spending too much time "bemoaning" the state of the country's 
economy, harassing and dismissing black public servants, of 
reneging on promises and displaying a lack of enthusiam for free 
enterprise and market policies. 
  The Jagan administration, the opposition party said, has 
"dithered with respect to privatisation. After some 15 months 
in office, no state-owned enterprise has yet been privatised". 
  It also accused the government of unnerving businessmen and 
investors with unfavourable statements, shown hostility to 
private investment, mismanagement, bad faith and corruption.

<F P=106> [Report by Colin King] </F>
  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 28 Jan, CANA -- Guyana has 
received enough commitments of finance from bilateral and 
multilateral donors to cover projected financing gaps for 
1994-96, the World Bank said here Friday. 
  New commitments of US320 million dollars, about US70 million 
dollars in escess of earlier expectations, were received from 
representatives of donors meeting here in a special sub-group 
gathering on Guyana under the Caribbean Group for Co-operation 
in Economic Development (CGCED). 
  The World Bank in a statement coming out of the consultation 
said Guyana's prospects for sustained development are 
"promising" but reiterated a theme of the meeting -- the need 
for deeper reform, a clear developmnt agenda, and consistent 
signals to the private sector. 
  "Good result," conference chairman Yoshiaki Abe of the World 
Bank summarised for reporters Friday at the end of the two-day 
meeting. An effusive Guyana Finance Minister Asgar Ally said the 
objectives of the meeting had been achieved. 
  World Bank officials declined to provide detailed breakdowns 
of the commitments received but among them was US20 million 
dollars from the Caribbean Development Bank, in addition to US35 
million committed last year, well-placed sources told CANA. 
  The United States and Britain also signed agreements here 
Friday extending further assistance to Guyana. 
  The U.S. package, a PL480 commodity agreement, covers three 
years and provides US6 million dollars for 1994, while the 
British assistance under the Overseas Development Administration 
is for five million pounds sterling over three years to the 
public sector reform programme. 
  The commitments from the various donors are intended to fill 
the gap remaining in Guyana's projected US500 million dollars 
financing requirements in the 1994-96 period after accounting 
for international trade, transfers, and already committed 
inflows. 
  During the meeting here, attended by 100 representatives of 
27 countries and international organisations and addressed for 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the invitation of the 
Guyana Government, the government presented its economic 
policies and programmes for consideration. 
  "I think that basically what we have set out to achieve we 
have achieved.... One of the objectives of this conference was 
to close the financing gap in 1994 and that gap has been closed. 
We have also had commitments beyond 1994," Ally told reporters. 
  The meeting, the first such to be hosted by the country 
making the pitch to the financing community, was billed as an 
important milepost along the country's economic recovery 
programme, started in 1988. 
  "The meeting recognised the significant progress achieved 
since the country embarked on its economic recovery programme in 
1988. The donors, however also acknowledged the huge constraints 
Guyana faces in view of the high external debt, the dilapidated 
economic and social infrastructure and pervasive poverty," the 
Bank said. 
  "Guyana's prospects for further sustained growth and poverty 
alleviation are promising. 
  "To achieve them will require a deepening of the reform 
programme, the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework, 
the elaboration of a clear development agenda, and consistent 
signals to the private sector," the Bank added. 
  Ally said the Guyana presentations during the meeting laid 
the basis for "the donors to better understand the problems of 
Guyana." 
  "I come out of that meeting very reassured that we have 
friends overseas, both among the (international financial 
institutions) and among the donor countries. Guyana is really 
lucky to be in a position where it has so many firends that are 
prepared to help us at a time when the availability of aid and 
soft loans is drying up. 
  "I think that for Guyana to be able to come out with this 
kind of success is indeed remarkable to the country and to the 
people and to the government. 
  "The conference has been a success and the foundations are 
now being laid for sustaining growth and to sustain democracy."

  [Excerpts] On 27 January, several dozen people demonstrated 
without incident, in front of the Haitian parliament in 
Port-au-Prince, against the embargo and for the installation of 
a government of public security. The demonstrators, who included 
some from the provinces, especially the Plaine Central, used as 
their authority the recent people's congress held at the 
initiative of notables in the north. They chanted slogans 
hostile to the parliamentarians and the international community, 
demanding the lifting of the embargo. Uniformed and armed police 
were inside the parliament [words indistinct]. Since the 
congress, Haitian deputies have rejected a petition demanding 
the installation of a ruling triumvirat and the dissolution of 
the parliament. Jean Luckenson reports: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Luckenson] On Thursday, 25 
January at about noon, dozens of young men and women 
demonstrated in the streets leading from Rue des Miracles and 
Rue des Casernes to the Haitian parliament. They were protesting 
the embargo and the return of the president elected on 16 
December, and demanding the dissolution of the parliament while 
calling on [national founder] Father Dessalines to return to 
help them. The demonstrators said they would block the country 
if their demands were not satisfied. [passage omitted] 
  The demonstrators, parading before the front and rear gates 
of the parliament, carried a big Haitian flag and placards that 
expressed the demands of their home areas. We saw several 
pickups, filled with policemen, parked a few meters from the 
demonstrators to ensure their safety. Deputy Pierre Francois 
Vital, in reaction, supports the objectives of the demonstration 
and emphasizes the parliamentary dissolution demanded by the 
demonstrators. According to the Alliance [for Parliamentary 
Cohesion], nothing has been accomplished in the chamber for 
three years. 
  [Vital] As long as this chamber is there, nothing can be 
done 
in Haiti because whoever is at the palace as president or in the 
government of Haiti will always have problems with this chamber. 
In my opinion, unavoidably, regardless of whether one has worked 
well, whether or not one has some money saved up, I see that the 
parliamentarians must leave in order to give the country a break 
because they are like a band of children who are always joking. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Luckenson] Deputy Denis Saint-Fort believes it is normal 
for 
the demonstrators to express their opinions. It is democracy, 
and there must be pressures for anything serious to be 
accomplished. As for dissolution of the chamber, the deputy has 
reservations; but regarding the [lifting of] the embargo, he 
agrees 100 percent because it is one of the biggest cancers 
gnawing our society. [passage omitted] 
  I must tell you that a few minutes after the demonstration 
began, the members of the National Front for Change and 
Democracy Parliamentary Bloc hastened to run off, one after 
another. But there was an important safety device inside the 
parliament grounds. Several other deputies and senators, who 
arrived two hours later while the demonstrators were in front of 
the gate, got out of their cars with gun in hand to enter the 
parliament. [end recording]

  [Text] The General Command of the Haitian Armed Forces 
[FADH] denounces the motive behind the 26 January statements by 
by the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Haiti, which announce the 
cancellation, over the next few days, of officers' visas. This 
calculated measure is shameful blackmail aimed at destabilizing 
another national Haitian institution and taking it hostage, the 
General Headquarters press release adds. 
  The communique issued by FADH General Headquarters stresses 
that the ideal of the Haitian military, nourished by the lessons 
of its national history, is concerned with duty to country, thus 
enablling the unified military institution to continue defending 
the ideals of freedom, sovereignty, and greatness, which have 
always roused the Haitian people.

  [Text] The Haitian parliament solicits the trust of the 
population and condemns the embargo. In a press release 
supporting the initiative of the business sector to halt all 
activities for a two-week period, the president of the new 
office of the chamber has called on the international community 
to lift the embargo. Frantz Robert Monde considers that by this 
measure the international community is killing, impoverishing, 
and destabilizing the basic institutions of democracy and is 
marginalizing the Haitian people. Through the resolution of the 
Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Chamber of Deputies 
thinks that the Haitian private sector has denounced the embargo 
and has sounded an alarm.

<F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros; from the "The Morning Paper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar, Honduran 
Armed Forces spokesman, said the military had to handle a report 
that turned out to be a false alarm before the inauguration of 
the new government. 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] The Public Security Forces were 
alerted to an unidentified object, near the Camosa area, I 
understand. Specifically, it was located on the route to 
Toncotin Airport. The bomb squad went to the site and 
determined it was an empty box. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the catcalls heard at the Tegucigalpa National 
Stadium during the inauguration the moment the Honduran Armed 
Forces General Staff members entered, Santos said: 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] We regard this in a positive 
light. This definitely shows you rifles have not served only to 
crush the people. The people at any given time are totally at 
liberty to express themselves without the fear of being crushed. 
We believe this is a situation.... [pauses] We look at it 
under a positive light. These situations definitely merit 
analysis. This did not happen four years ago, and it happened 
now. We hope that in the next four years corrective measures 
are taken. That way the situation will be totally different 
four years from now. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Colonel, why do you think the people 
in the stadium jeered you? 
  [Santos] The fact is these things happen to express 
disapproval of certain actions that are not conducted by 
institutions but are often isolated incidents by individuals who 
commit actions that fall outside the law. [end recording] 
  Santos maintained the catcalls were not directly aimed at 
Luis Alonso Discua, the Armed Forces chief. 
  [Begin Santos recording] This is not a situation against the 
Armed Forces chief. It shows disapproval of some actions that 
we have acknowledged at the opportune time and have sought to 
correct. At any given moment, the important thing is to analyze 
them with the goal of amending them so these things do not 
happen. [end recording]

  [Text] Brasilia, 27 Jan (EFE) -- Official sources said in 
Brasilia today that the Cuban Government will repay part of a 
$10 million debt to Brazil with medicines produced on the island. 
  Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Santillo and Cuban Health 
Vice Minister Jose Ignacio Goicoechea on 26 January signed a 
contract for the supply of 40 different types of medicines 
during the next four months. 
  The operation is worth $30 million and will include diverse 
medicines -- antibiotics, pain relievers, collyriums, 
anesthetics, and blood pressure regulators -- that will be 
supplied to the public system for three months. 
  A clause in the contract says the Brazilian Government is 
authorized to retain a sum of money -- the amount has not been 
specified yet -- to serve as compensation for part of the total 
Cuban debt. 
  The sources said the amount to be withheld will depend on a 
Brazilian Planning Ministry evaluation of the rules on foreign 
credit. Brazil [as received] committed itself to pay the rest of 
the money in two installments. 
  According to official sources, Cuba owes Brazil about $10 
million, although in August 1993 it reached $6.5 million. 
  Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila, who is responsible 
for his country's economic policies, will make an official visit 
to Brazil between 2 and 7 February. During his visit, Lage will 
meet President Itamar Franco. 
  The Cuban vice president will meet government officials and 
representatives of the Brazilian private sector to promote the 
strengthening of economic and commercial relations between the 
two countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergio Leo] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The presidential election campaign and 
speculations about the possible presidential candidacy of 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso had great influence 
on the defeat suffered yesterday by the government in the voting 
on the provisional measures of the stabilization plan. That was 
the opinion in Congress yesterday, which is also shared by 
Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the Senate, and by 
Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
leader in the Senate. The blocs faithful to presidential 
hopefuls Paulo Maluf from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], 
and to Jose Sarney and Orestes Quercia from the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party], were notoriously absent from the 
voting session. 
  "They were all talking about that in the Senate plenum: the 
presidential hopefuls estimate that if the stability plan is 
successful, no one will be able to compete with Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso," Pedro Simon told O GLOBO. 
  "There is no need to launch a formal candidacy. No event 
this year can avoid being influenced by the election campaign. 
And it has been this way from the start," Senator Mario Covas 
said. Covas, who supports the candidacy of Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, asserted that if he had been beside Cardoso on the 
rostrum when he denied being a candidate, "I would have kicked 
him in the ankle." 
  Yesterday afternoon, when it was evident that the government 
would not obtain a quorum for approving its measures without the 
help of the PPR -- which declared it would obstruct the voting 
session, and abandoned the hall -- Covas sought out Deputy 
Armando Pinheiro (PPR-Sao Paulo), a Maluf supporter, to try to 
obtain his support. The officialist congressmen believe that 
the intransigent attitude of the PPR bloc simply reflects the 
campaign strategy of presidential hopeful Paulo Maluf. 
  The thesis that former President Jose Sarney also helped 
block the approval of the stabilization plan was based on the 
nearly total absence of Maranhao deputies from the Chamber -- as 
confirmed by the appearance of Deputy Sarney Jr. (PFL-MA) 
[Liberal Front Party -- Maranhao] who crossed the chamber 
smiling, without voting or abiding the role call. 
  "The launching of the Fernando Henrique's candidacy and the 
lack of political coordination has led us to this result," said 
Deputy Gonzaga Mota (PMDB-CE) [PMDB-Ceara], rapporteur for the 
stability program in the lower house.

  [Text] Varadero, 31 Jan (DPA) -- Cuban President Fidel 
Castro considers U.S. President Bill Clinton as a "man of peace" 
and trusts he will lift the economic embargo Washington imposed 
on Cuba more than 30 years ago. 
  In a discussion with German journalists during the predawn 
hours today at the Cuban beach resort of Varadero, Castro added, 
nevertheless, that Cuba, despite the boycott, is capable of 
"surviving these more difficult times." 
  "Clinton seems to be a man of peace," especially concerned 
by 
his country's domestic problems, "but U.S. presidents have huge 
power limitations," the Cuban president said. 
  Castro said Cuban exiles in the United States exert great 
pressure on the Washington Government. The Cuban president said 
for the United States "the problem with Cuba is a domestic 
problem, not a foreign one." 
  Castro expressed gratitude for European economic aid, 
particularly German aid to Cuba, during the official 
inauguration of a new Cuban hotel operated by Germans. "Germany 
is a very important player in today's world, not only for Cuban 
economic interests but also for Third World interests," Castro 
said.

  [Text] According to figures obtained by AFP from the city's 
hospitals today, at least five people died and 15 were wounded 
in a shootout between Somalis and U.S. soldiers in southern 
Mogadishu. 
  The shootout occurred as two U.S. diplomatic cars were 
driving along the avenue that links the U.S. Embassy to the 
Mogadishu airport, when their escorts opened fire on a crowd. 
The soldiers fired -- even using heavy-caliber weapons -- 
because they thought the Somalis were trying to block the road 
along which the caravan was to pass, when in reality the crowd 
was just waiting in front of a food distribution center. 
  The massacre followed statements by the general 
undersecretary for UN operations in Somalia, (Kofi Annan), who 
criticized Washington's decision to withdraw its troops before 
31 March. The UN official said he considered that decision a 
mistake because it might encourage violent actions aimed at 
sabotaging the peacekeeping operations.

  [Text] Nine persons -- including five children -- died when 
a group of irresponsible individuals who tried to leave the 
country illegally from Puerto Padre aboard three fragile craft 
suffered a shipwreck. They were trying to go to the United 
States. 
  On the morning of 28 January, a group of five who reached 
land in the vicinity of Nuevitas explained that they had wrecked 
off the north coast. 
  The rapid mobilization of vessels of the Border Guard Troops 
and other institutions permitted us to rescue another five 
people, two of whom had to be hospitalized quickly. An infant 
just a few months old was also hospitalized, and his life is in 
danger. 
  The individuals who risked their lives and those of innocent 
children were attracted by the criminal propaganda from the 
United States that encourages them; now, in addition to whatever 
legal responsibilities may befall them, they will have on their 
consciences the tragic results of their actions. 
  This is the result of the work of those in the United States 
who are doing everything possible to encourage an illegal exodus 
and who welcome as heroes those who, risking their lives, take 
to the sea -- while the U.S. authorities apply an ever more 
restrictive policy in granting visas to people who take steps to 
travel legally. 
  It has also just been reaffirmed in Havana that the United 
States has repeatedly failed to comply, by a big margin, with 
the agreement signed with Cuba in 1984 under which they were 
supposed to authorize the legal immigration of up to 20,000 
people each year. Therefore, Washington must shoulder its share 
of responsibility for incidents such as this.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], participated in the military 
council of the Eastern Army held in Camaguey, after which he 
toured areas of that province. The last point to be discussed by 
the military council was the fishing industry. The last point of 
the 30 February visit was the People's Fish Breeding Center in 
Sibanicu municipality, reflecting the importance with which the 
country's leadership regards this sector, which is decisive in 
increasing the food levels of the population. (Enrique 
Ortosqui), vice minister of the fishing industry, presented the 
current situation and goals in the development of artificial 
breeding of fish on the island. 
  In the same manner, Division General Carlos Fernandez 
Gondin, 
first vice minister of the interior, presented a detailed 
analysis, which is being made throughout the country against 
criminal activities and social indiscipline. He pointed out 
advances made, as well as difficulties, and expressed his 
conviction that with the participation of the masses, the 
perfection of the Unified Vigilance and Protection System, and 
the required action of the judiciary power within the framework 
of existing laws or those that need to be established, this 
struggle will be won by the Revolution. 
  In his tour of the Oriente Rebelde community in Sibanicu, 
Raul visited the Salvador Cisneros Betancourt elementary school, 
which was completed in just 45 days by FAR combatants and by 
instruction from the second secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC]. At the facility, which has capacity for more than 
200 children, Raul received detailed information on the 
characteristics of the center. At the nearby plaza, the children 
presented an art show, which reflected the different stages of 
our history, including the uprising of Ignacio Agramonte in 
November 1868 at the Oriente sugar Mill, very close to the place 
where the community is established today. 
  Emilia Betancourt, president of the people's council and 
deputy to the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP], explained to the visitors aspects of this cattle-raising 
zone in self-sufficiency, services, the defense tasks, and among 
other things, the fight against crime. A plaque at the school 
reads: With great satisfaction I have come to learn the 
experience of Oriente Rebelde. Everything I have seen has been 
very interesting, including conversations with the workers and 
cadres. We have analyzed agriculture in general, enterprises, 
farms, Basic Cooperative Production Units, self-sufficiency, 
subsidies that must be eliminated, [words indistinct] seek 
efficiency and productivity, and work hard to increase the food 
levels in the fields [words indistinct]. Signed: Fidel Castro. 
  At the historical sugarmill, which is destined to become a 
museum of the sugar industry, Raul conversed on the 
characteristics of the installation, the largest in the province 
in the second half of the last century. He expressed his 
admiration for Ignacio Agramonte, one of our most important 
historical figures, and the fact that in the war of 1895, in 
their advance towards the West, Maximo Gomez camped there also. 
  Fish Breeding is one of the main objectives for Sibanicu. In 
1993, the municipality caught more than 300 [words indistinct] 
and this year they hope to exceed that figure. [words 
indistinct] in half hectare each they can produce [words 
indistinct] and at the same time, the cattle can take advantage 
of the water in these small dams. After listening to the 
exposition of Omar del Risco, first secretary of the PCC in 
Sibanicu, Raul congratulated him for the exemplary work of this 
municipality in the development of the fishing industry, which 
is currently the cheapest and fastest means of production of 
animal protein, and states that it would be very useful if 
representatives from other provinces could come here to gain 
experience in this important task. 
  In his tour of Sibanicu, Raul was accompanied by the first 
secretaries of the six provinces that are part of the Eastern 
Army, Ramon Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army; and Vilma 
Espin, president of the Federation of Cuban Women.

  [Text] The paper TRABAJADORES, on some of whose articles we 
have reported today, calls on everyone to focus discussions on 
the efficiency of each workplace. That is the title of an 
article in which TRABAJADORES announces that as of today, the 
Parliament in the Workplace is being held throughout the nation. 
Numerous such assemblies were held as trial runs throughout the 
month of January. 
  The most important aspect of this process, which is to 
continue until 15 March -- the most strategic and most 
potentially profitable for the nation -- is the analysis of the 
economic efficiency of each body, i.e., how to produce more with 
fewer expenses, thereby increasing profitability. Exactly this 
was at the center of the discussions of the recent seventh 
plenum of the National Committee of the CTC [Cuban Workers 
Federation], of which journalist Rosa Maria Godoy has details: 
  [Godoy] How to be more efficient, economizing human and 
material resources, was the prevailing concern during the 
seventh plenum of the CTC's National Committee while discussing 
the status of the domestic economy. At this event, held at the 
(Ernest Telman) Hall of the CTC national headquarters, the 
policy of reducing personnel rolls was also emphasized. In this 
connection, Carlos Lage pointed out that in order to carry out 
this rationalization, we must rely on the unions and must 
relocate, to other tasks or other work groups, those workers who 
may be unneeded. 
  Also discussed was the unfolding of the assemblies, the 
Parliament in the Workplace, which Lage called an unprecedented 
political process: 
  [Begin Lage recording] It is a real process, quite deep and 
significant. I think it is truly something of exceptional value, 
of exceptional significance and political importance; and it 
would also be good for us to be able to convey to the workers 
that the nation is facing a very difficult situation at present, 
and that it is taking whatever measures it has to take along 
with the workers, with their participation, and is following a 
process such as this one that has been begun, a process that we 
really expect will have a great impact: first, by creating 
awareness on everyone's part of the need for whatever measures 
will, in the final analysis, be taken; and, second, in that they 
are going to render whatever measures may be taken down the road 
much more effective and greatly reduce the margin of error that 
could result from the great wealth of opinions, judgments, and 
views that have come out of this process. 
  With this, I want to tell you that there is today a great 
responsibility, a great economic chore weighing on the CTC, on 
the unions: this political process, a process which -- I repeat 
-- is unprecedented and is something that, I would say, gives 
the Revolution a great deal of certainty as regards the measures 
that will have to be taken in the future, based on what has been 
said and explained here, what you people have been discussing. 
[end recording] 
  The CTC plenum approved the progress report on the extent to 
which the agreements and resolutions of the 16th CTC Congress 
have been fulfilled; in addition, the report presented by Daniel 
Fajardo, vice minister of agriculture [title as heard], was 
discussed. Fajardo reported on the progress of the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units in the agriculture sector and on 
the possibilities for increasing production levels of tubers and 
vegetables this year.

  [Text] The Eastern Army Military Council is meeting in 
Camaguey with the participation of Raul Castro, Army General and 
Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar]. The meeting 
is being chaired by Division General Ramon Espinoza Martin, 
Chief of the Eastern Army. 
  The council analyzed a broad agenda, which in addition to 
several defense preparation aspects, included other subjects 
such as the fight against crime and the increase in food 
production. 
  Several council members and the first secretaries of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] of the six provinces that comprise 
the territory defended by the Army are also participating in the 
meeting. They are Politburo members Esteban Lazo and Julian Rizo 
who are also first secretaries in Santiago de Cuba and Camaguey, 
respectively; Juan Carlos Robinson from Guantanamo, Alfredo 
Enriquez Pina from Granma, Francisco Garcia Ferrer from Holguin, 
and Julian Lopez from Las Tunas, all members of the PCC Central 
Committee. 
  The report by Army chief of staff, Brigade General Urbelino 
Betancourt, conveyed the satisfactory fighting capacity of the 
forces deployed to this extensive territory, which is 
demonstrated by the successful fulfillment of the FAR's main 
objectives. 
  The preparation of the commanders, officers, and soldiers of 
the territorial troops militia, both from the regular forces and 
the reserves, as well as the production and defense brigades, 
was considered good. This evaluation applies to the operational 
and tactical levels -- to shooting ability, physical fitness, 
and their Marxist-Leninist education, following the example of 
Marti. 
  The refurbishing of the military theater of operations has 
progressed considerably over the past year, surpassing all 
plans, including the most important engineering works and the 
defense tunnels. The work carried out in Santiago de Cuba, which 
surpassed the annual plan by 85 percent, has also been 
emphasized. This plan also seeks to achieve full protection for 
the heroic town, the country's second most important town. 
Holguin and Camaguey Provinces also shine in the work they 
accomplished. 
  The plan to maintain weapons in good condition, that is, the 
plan for the preservation, diagnosis, prophylaxis, mobilization, 
and loading tests of the fighting instruments demanded a 
tremendous effort, which is reflected in the following figures: 
over 4,600,000 pieces of equipment, from heavy 36-ton tanks to 
antigas masks, were tested. 
  The experience accrued by the Army in this type of work is 
now being transferred to civilian organizations that have great 
quantities of unused equipment, such as Micons [Construction 
Ministry], the Agriculture Ministry, and Minaz [Sugar Industry 
Ministry] following the recent guidelines of the party's second 
secretary on the importance of maintaining and preserving the 
tremendous amount of capital invested by the country, equipment 
which is today not used, but which can be essential tomorrow, to 
the extent that we bail out of this special period. The 
discipline was also considered satisfactory, having reduced the 
number of infractions or crimes. 
  Concerning the nutrition program, in 1993 and in the 
previous 
year, the Army increased its production of meat, eggs, milk, 
tubers and vegetables, grain, honey, coffee, and others, by more 
than 30 percent, reaching a total of 20,000 tons, a figure which 
surpasses the troops' self-sufficiency needs by 23 percent. This 
has allowed the Army to hand over more than 5,000 tons of food 
to the people of the eastern region and to begin a modest 
assistance plan of food for the officer corps' family groups. 
  Fish production increased 75 percent as compared to 1993. 
The 
reforesting program by the Army forces and by the six provinces 
was surpassed by 21 percent; that is, by 49 million trees. 
  The conclusion reached by the military council is that 1993 
was a successful year for defense in the Eastern Army, the 1994 
objective of which is to maintain the same level of activities, 
achieving better results, with the hope of retaining Camilo 
Cienfuegos' machine gun, a rotating trophy of the FAR, following 
the Army's example. The trophy is today in the hands of the 
people of the eastern region. 
  At the closing of this report, the council was assessing 
other points of the agenda. Also present at the meeting as 
special guests were Alfredo Jordan, agriculture minister and 
member of the politburo; Jorge Fernandez Cuervo, the fishing 
industry minister; Division Gen. Fernandez Gondin, first vice 
minister of the interior; and Enrique Oltuski, the fishing 
industry vice minister.

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 28 Jan, CANA -- The Barbados 
Labour Party and a smaller opposition group, the National 
Democratic Party, on Friday called for the resignation of a 
minister who has lost the tourism portfolio to Prime Minister 
Erskine Sandiford. 
  They said Minister of Culture and International Transport 
Evelyn Greaves should resign because of the way the government 
treated him. 
  The BLP, the parliamentary opposition group, also called for 
the resignation of the board of the Barbados Tourism Authority 
(BTA), a government-run agency. 
  On Thursday, Prime Minister Sandiford, who is also minister 
of economic affairs, assumed responsibility for the Ministry of 
Tourism. 
  In announcing the move, the government said that Greaves, 
who assumed the tourism portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle last 
September, would retain responsibility for culture and 
international transport. 
  BLP spokesman Dr Richard Cheltheham called for Greaves' 
resignation, saying the industry could be severely hampered 
under Sandiford's leadership. 
  "Minister Greaves has been humiliated and robbed of eighty 
per cent of his portfolio.... The only self-respecting thing 
for him to do is to resign," Cheltheham said. 
  "We would like to remind the prime minister that the aim 
should be to get the best man in the national interest and that 
no other consideration should matter." 
  Leader of the National Democratic Party, Dr Richie Haynes, 
also called on Greaves to resign. 
  Haynes, a former finance minister, said the reshuffle 
indicated there was a crisis in the national cabinet.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 31 Jan (EFE) -- Half of the Dominican 
Army is guarding the border with Haiti to prevent the shipment 
of contraband fuel, Major General Ivan Hernandez Oleaga today 
reported in the border town of Jimani, southwest Dominican 
Republic. 
  In statements to the newspaper ULTIMA HORA, Army Chief of 
Staff Hernandez Oleaga indicated that the Dominican Government 
is ready to enforce the petroleum embargo imposed by the UN 
Security Council against the Haitian military coupists to 
pressure for deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return 
to power. Hernandez Oleaga said that in the last few months, 
there has been an increase in the number of people with access 
to Haiti, the country which shares the island of La Espanola 
with the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic and Haiti 
share close to 350 km of border. There are three border posts, 
and the rest is mainly forests and mountains. "When the embargo 
began we had the 3d and 4th Infantry Brigades in the area. We 
now have one more, and we have reinforced the two previous 
ones," he said. Although he did not state the exact number of 
soldiers in a brigade, he estimated that one has from 5,000 to 
7,000 members. 
  Nearly a month ago, the Army seized a fuel truck that tried 
to take thousands of liters of fuel to Haiti. Through the 
Dominican Red Cross and as humanitarian aid, the Dominican 
Government permits shipments of bottled gas to Haiti, mainly for 
use in hospitals.

  [Text] Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe Parish priest, 
denounces the exterminating maneuvers by the former and current 
U.S. Administrations aimed at ruining little countries. The 
Fermathe priest thinks President Clinton and the U.S. State 
Department want to reduce President Aristide's power because 
they fear his popularity. Father Massac adds that the U.S. 
Presidents are more concerned with U.A. interests in all their 
relations with the little countries. 
  [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The U.S. Presidents have 
closed their eyes to the sufferings of the poor countries to 
consider first the interests of the United States in all their 
relations with those peoples. In Haiti, for instance, everybody 
can see that the cause of the sufferings of all Haitians, who 
cannot live at all at this time, is the willingness of President 
Clinton and the State Department to prolong the crisis in order 
to weaken Aristide's power because they fear his popularity. 
  It is time for Americans to stand up to protest the policy 
of 
their rulers who are weighing down several little countries. 
What happened in Los Angeles may be a [word indistinct] warning 
from God so they will be more caring about the sufferings 
imposed on deprived peoples by the United States. It is time for 
President Clinton to release the refugees who are in jail, to 
stop sending them back to the Haitian hell of the coup d'etat.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The main stores 
and banks in the Haitian capital remained closed today as they 
joined the strike decreed by the business associations in 
protest of the international community's embargo. 
  The Banking Association joined the strike by offering its 
services only three days a week during this period, even though 
they did not attend the meeting where the private sector 
organizations decided to step into the political scene by 
staging the strike. 
  "If we do not close now, for several days, they will impose 
on us a definite shutdown. We must demonstrate that we are 
decided on playing an important role in our country," one of the 
strike's promoters declared. The strikers explained: "This is 
not a political action, we only want to express our indignation 
for the international community which has imposed on us an 
unfair embargo." 
  The Industrialists Association that did not respond to the 
first strike call continues to keep its distance. Nevertheless, 
some of its members were present at an assembly that was held on 
the first day of the strike, 28 January. The Association 
leaders said they do not understand what this movement is 
seeking, as according to them, no clear goal has been set. The 
politicians in charge are asked to reach a settlement but the 
strike's promoters do not indicate with whom that settlement 
must be made. 
  The Chamber of Commerce as well as the great majority of 
those who participate in the meetings, supported the coup d'etat 
staged in 1991. Nevertheless, according to explanations given by 
participants in the meeting that prepared the strike, some of 
these have changed their position and currently they criticize 
the Army, accusing it of being corrupt and incapable of 
negotiating the Haitian political crisis. 
  The supermarket owners agreed today to open their stores 
four 
days a week while the pharmacies work normally. Hotels have 
decided to "make the foreigners feel the weight of the embargo" 
by closing down the bars and reducing electricity supply. 
  Meanwhile, the nation's five most important union 
organizations have rejected the private sector strike. "They 
have made a unilateral decision. The businessmen only want to 
dodge their responsibilities with the workers," declared a union 
leader.

  [Text] The Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP] is 
thumping the table with its fist. In a press communique, the 
Senate, [especially] the ACP and the members elected 18 January 
[1993], has ordered the executive to choose a new prime minister 
within 48 hours after the 28 January publication of the 
communique. 
  The Senate of the Republic reminds the Haitian nation that 
on 
15 December 1993 the government of former Prime Minister Robert 
Malval officially tendered its resignation. The courageous 
Haitian citizens battling with misery and all kinds of 
calamities have vainly expected the designation of a new head of 
government who would truly look into their problems. The 
communique says that up to now, instead of constitutional 
actions aimed at putting the Republic back on track, our 
brothers who are our official representatives at the parliament 
have experienced trickery designed to perpetuate the unhealthy 
situation in which the country is still immersed. An example is 
Colin Granderson's letter of 12 January, sent to Robert Malval 
to inform him of his decision to have the initial elements of 
the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission return to Haiti. 
  The Senate of the Republic energetically protests these 
tricks that Haiti's so-called friends have had fun playing, and 
focuses on Article 98.3 of the Constitution that requires 
international treaties and conventions to be submitted first to 
parliament for approval or rejection. 
  The Senate reaffirms its determination as a responsible 
institution to control closely the actions taking place in the 
country, especially in this period of executive power vacuum. It 
believes it must also point out to the other powers and 
concerned authorities that if the executive power does not 
designate, within the next 48 hours, a new prime minister, who 
will have to be received shortly by parliament, the latter will 
be obliged to make the necessary decisions to safeguard national 
sovereignty. 
  This note is signed by 14 senators, including ACP members, 
and 18 elected parliamentarians, excepting Senator Serge Gilles.

  [Text] The Senate first secretary has called the resigning 
prime minister to order. In a news release issued 26 January, 
Senator Ebrane Cadet reminds Robert Malval and the members of 
the resigning government that they must limit themselves to 
dealing with day-to-day matters. 
  The legislator, a member of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion, accuses the government of continuing to compromise 
national sovereignty. Sen. Cadet quotes the letter from Colin 
Granderson, seeking logistic measures in view of the return of 
about 30 UN/OAS observers to the country.

  [Text] FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement 
and Progress] asserts that it is preparing a huge mobilization 
for 4 February. The organization denounces the return to the 
country of the UN/OAS civilian mission. The party led by Louis 
Jodel Chambelain also asked for the lifting of the embargo: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] There is one group of people 
making money on the embargo and another team fighting for power. 
Meanwhile, the population is dying of hunger. There are no 
health services or education. 
  Haiti is about to become a reservation on which all Haitians 
are locked. The private sector asserts that it has provided 
supplies to the people. Watch out for crooked dealers. The black 
market will stop. Respect yourselves. For two and a half years, 
the foreigner has realized that there is no worthy, 
nationalistic Haitian, and who is defending Haiti because 
Aristide alone is too small to make the foreigners humiliate 
Haitians and Haiti [as heard]. There are still many more 
Aristides in Haiti. 
  FRAPH firmly supports Senator Sansaricque's statements 
regarding the UN and the OAS. They have started coming in in 
another way. FRAPH, on behalf of the Haitian people, states that 
it does not want all those foreign settlers from the civilian 
mission who are the avant-garde of foreign intervention in 
Haiti. The people are asking the country's authorities if they 
are not in charge of the country's situation. Who gave the 
authorization? Haitian people, keep calm, be alert. 
  On 4 or 5 February, FRAPH will stamp its foot, will ask all 
the country's social classes, the youth, and all Haitians to 
join together in a revolution. Forward, Haitian people! Forward, 
Haitian people! [repeats] We are going to tell the foreigners: 
Down with the embargo, down with hunger, down with misery, down 
with unemployment! [end recording]

  [Text] Commercial activities have slowed since the work 
stoppage on 28 January by employers. Department stores and 
institutions in the capital are respecting the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry's call to shut down business from 28 
January to 9 February in order to demand the lifting of the 
embargo and compel the protagonists to find a quick solution to 
the political crisis. However, the paralysis will not be total. 
Capital supermarkets will be open to customers on Saturdays, 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Meanwhile, the employer 
sector issued a statement encouraging the business people to 
remain mobilized and united in order to thwart the embargo. Here 
is the business sector statement: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The times are grave. 
Our country is facing the most painful moment of its history. 
The imposed embargo is proving to be an inadequate measure 
doomed to failure. It is leading to total ruin, dividing the 
nation and is not offering any solution to the crisis. 
Twenty-eight months are too many. When, then, will a total, 
general embargo take place? What would happen to our children? 
What would happen to our environment? What would happen to our 
economy? 
  As a first step, let us close our firms and let us stand as 
one man to demand loudly and strongly the definitive lifting of 
this destroying embargo. Through this ultimate sacrifice, let us 
jolt national and international awareness. Let us continue to 
unite ourselves in this movement of protest. Employees, workers, 
state employees, professionals, you are a party to it. Your jobs 
are threatened. Together, let us raise our voices of protest. 
Join the groups and associations which have already shown their 
solidarity. Together let us save our country, Haiti. [end

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 28 Jan, CANA -- St. 
Kitts-Nevis authorities on Friday were still assessing damage 
following a demonstration here on Wednesday by opposition 
supporters, protesting the minority People's Action 
Movement/Nevis Reformation Party Coalition Government at the 
opening of a new session of parliament. 
  In the aftermath of the St. Kitts-Nevis labour 
party-organised demonstration, police confirmed numerous reports 
of damage to property due to fire and other causes. The damage 
includes some 20,000 tons of sugarcane destroyed by fire in the 
island's sugar belt. 
  Desmond Mallalieu, general manager of the St. Kitts Sugar 
Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC), said with harvesting of the 
1994 crop not yet underway, some of the burnt cane will be lost 
due to spoilage. Fire also gutted an unoccupied wooden building 
-- the property of the National Caribbean Insurance Company -- 
close to government headquarters, scene of the demonstration. A 
primary school, run by the Methodist Church, was also burnt. 
  Informed sources have indicated that damage to government 
headquarters itself where several windows were smashed, could be 
in the region of 3,000 dollars (one EC dollar = 37 cents U.S.). 
The state car used to transport the governor general suffered 
damage to the extent of 10,000 dollars, officials said. The 
vehicle was extensively damaged while it was parked in the 
garage at government headquarters. Police investigations are 
continuing. 
  Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds has termed the 
demonstration a "disgrace and a discredit" to all those who 
participated in it. Simmonds said it is clear from last month's 
experience that such lawlessness can do great harm to the 
economy and affect the lives and livelihood of people in every 
sector of society. A state of emergency was imposed here on 
December 2 after opposition supporters rioted following the 
installation of the Simmonds-led coalition which won five of the 
11 parliamentary seats in general elections on November 29. 
  Simmonds said he was pleased that his party supporters who 
came out to cheer their representatives, had behaved admirably, 
had obeyed police instructions, and did not get into any 
confrontation with Labour Party supporters or the police.

  [Text] San Salvador, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Attorney 
General Romeo Melara Granillo accused the U.S. Embassy here of 
concealing evidence in a crime involving a U.S. military officer. 
  Jose Cresencio Diaz, a 54-year old Salvadoran who worked as 
a 
security guard for U.S. Major Ismael Lopez, was killed on 21 
January and Lopez was involved in the crime. 
  Melara Granillo said the U.S. diplomatic mission hid the 
weapons reportedly used by Lopez, who, according to reports from 
the prosecutor's office, was transferred to one of the U.S. 
bases in Panama. 
  The U.S. Embassy argued Lopez had diplomatic immunity in 
order to refuse delivering the evidence to Salvadoran 
authorities, and therefore he was transferred from the country 
without having to go through the legal Salvadoran immigration 
procedures. 
  The attorney general noted: "The right thing to do would 
have 
been for the embassy to notify local authorities of this and to 
have held him in custody according to the law." 
  Meanwhile, National Civilian Police Director Jose Maria 
Monterrey said the diplomats want to misconstrue immunity with 
impunity. 
  Salvadoran authorities did not rule out the possibility of 
requesting the U.S. military officer's extradition through the 
Salvadoran Foreign Ministry.

Santamaria with unidentified moderator and local and foreign 
reporters in San Salvador on 31 January; broadcast in progress 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Santamaria] ...in these cases, special matters such 
as the case of all diplomats assigned to a country. It means a 
diplomatic mission should not interfere with the investigations 
involving one of its members. Once we have the information 
given to us by the attorney general and the director of the 
National Civilian Police [PNC], as an official report for us, we 
would submit it to the Foreign Ministry, which is the 
appropriate office to review it. It will then depend on what 
they decide. If the laws have been violated by the mission, the 
Foreign Ministry will make it known at the proper time. What 
we can say now, as you said, is that both the PNC and the 
Attorney General's Office have deemed that certain members of 
the U.S. Mission, who were involved in this case, have violated 
Salvadoran laws. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could the extradition of this 
gentleman be requested? 
  [Santamaria] The extradition process is a different matter. 
If a person is being tried for a certain case when these types 
of situations occur, the extradition institution is reviewed to 
determine if the person will be tried according to the national 
laws in the presence of the indicted person. That is a phase 
that will be determined once the process reaches the point of an 
arrest warrant being issued. 
  [Moderator] Jose Gerardo Lopez from LA PRENSA GRAFICA. 
  [Lopez] Last week, opposition sectors asked the PNC to 
report 
the weapons that were being confiscated since the law on bearing 
weapons will now go into effect. They want to know about the 
weapons that are being confiscated. 
  [Santamaria] The PNC is a legal institution in the country. 
It is not a private person who is confiscating the weapons. 
The weapons that are meant for the exclusive use of the Armed 
Forces are subjected to certain procedures. There are weapons 
that are confiscated and once it is determined who their owner 
is, the PNC would return them to their rightful owner as long as 
the legal procedures are followed. We believe the PNC is acting 
according to the country's laws. If there are doubts as to what 
is done or what is not done with the weapons, I can tell you 
that in the case of weapons for the exclusive use of the Armed 
Forces, they are submitted to the appropriate institution 
according to previously established procedures. When we talk 
about weapons illegally in the hands of private individuals, 
then we follow procedures established by the law on the 
possession of weapons. 
  [Moderator] Jorge Barahona from Teleprensa. 
  [Barahona] I have two questions. The first question is why 
is President Cristiani not with us. Perhaps you know why he is 
absent. Secondly, as for the case of the U.S. Embassy, we know 
that the U.S. Embassy is pressuring the government and is 
imposing quotas on textile products and coffee. In this 
situation, added to the situation of the PNC, why has the 
government not taken any action? Why has the Salvadoran 
Government not filed a protest? 
  [Santamaria] I would like you to explain it a little better 
because you said the U.S. Government was imposing quotas and 
then you talk about the PNC. What are you talking about? 
  [Barahona] There is interference in both areas, both in the 
police system as well as in the economic field. That is why I 
ask, if you are being pressured, why not take action? 
  [Santamaria] First, the president could not be here this 
morning for personal reasons. He has asked us to hold this news 
conference as he usually does on Mondays. I have already spoken 
previously and I said we would probably be participating in the 
Monday news conferences depending on the president's agenda. 
  We must note, however, that should any U.S. Government 
institution adopt certain attitudes or positions to pressure us 
into following specific guidelines, by conditioning the 
treatment our country will receive, as we have always said, we 
are sovereign, autonomous, independent, and will not be subject 
to pressures from any country. As we have said, countries that 
wish to cooperate with us can do so under the terms established 
by international laws. 
  As for aid or cooperation for specific purposes, 
particularly 
the assistance we have received recently in connection with the 
peace agreements, there are no conditions. As you know, the 
peace agreements practically determine the way in which each 
party will comply with the commitments. I mentioned the PNC 
because the former question implied that some authorities or 
members of the U.S. Mission interfered with the investigation of 
a case involving a member of the mission. The attorney general 
also referred to that situation as meddling or interfering in 
our affairs. What we ought to do here is apply the country's 
laws. When we believe some action is against the laws of the 
Republic, we must apply the law. We should not evade that 
responsibility. We must guarantee respect for the country's 
institutionality. 
  We believe in other cases when the aid is conditioned, it 
will depend on what the donor country or the country giving the 
assistance determines. We do not know whether the conditions 
are right now for establishing quotas or not. Generally, U.S. 
commercial policies in some areas are based on quotas. I do not 
know if this was the case. Maybe the economy minister could 
clarify this point. The truth is that within the framework of 
normal relations among countries and within the principle of 
respect for the sovereignty of each country, relations must be 
based on mutual respect. That is what our country has always 
demanded in its international relations with all countries. In 
no way will we act differently. 
  [Moderator] Guillermo Valencia, of EL NOTICIERO. 
  [Valencia] I understand that [words indistinct] a report on 
the possible admission of former Treasury Police [PH] and 
National Guard [GN] agents directly into the PNC without a 
previous evaluation. I would like to know if this report was 
completed and presented to Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] 
and if the report was confirmed or not. 
  [Santamaria] Well, first of all, I must clarify that it was 
not as you said. We are working with Onusal on compliance with 
the peace agreements on aspects related to the incorporation of 
the UEA into the PNC, in other words the Drug Interdiction 
Executive Unit, and the CIHD, the Commission to Investigate 
Criminal Actions. The decrees for the transfer and merger were 
already issued and approved by the Legislative Assembly, and 
therefore they became laws of the Republic. What is still 
pending is the government's compliance with an aspect concerning 
an evaluation of the members based on the agreements reached on 
22 December 1992 between the government and the FMLN in the 
presence of the United Nations. The government, however, does 
not handle this unilaterally. It is handled based on agreement 
between both sides in the presence of the United Nations. Both 
parties agreed on what the evaluation would consist of, and on a 
course that members of those units must take at the Public 
Security Academy on humanist subjects, and on the new doctrine 
and philosophy of the PNC. Those are the only two requirements 
that must be met. After those two requirements are met, the 
merger will be made within the framework of the agreements. We 
have not incorporated any GN or PH member in this. Those are 
the two institutions that were functioning: the UEA and the 
CIHD, which according to the agreements were to be incorporated 
into the PNC. The FMLN agreed and signed those agreements, and 
the United Nations was present to witness those agreements. 
That is my opinion, which I believe is correct. I do not know 
if there has been any subsequent statement within a different 
context, which would not correspond to reality. 
  [Valencia] It has been said that former agents of those 
security agencies received very low grades in the academy, but 
were admitted in the PNC due to government pressures. 
  [Santamaria] No, that is not true. We have not enrolled any 
GN or PH members in the academy. All those who have enrolled 
are members of the National Police, as stipulated in the peace 
agreements. The only ones entitled to enroll in the Public 
Security Academy are the members of the National Police. 
  This is done based on their background history or sworn 
statements, it is not based on a simple personnel list sent by 
the government. There is a prior evaluation, then it is 
established if their application meets the entry requirements. 
If they meet the requirements they are accepted. This is what 
we have done up until now. 
  [Mediator] Antonio Alvarado, Cuatro Vision. 
  [Alvarado] I have two questions: first, will there be an 
official protest by the government with regard to the murder of 
the bodyguard? The second question is: Yesterday you were 
talking about the current problems with the peace agreements. 
The UN chief also mentioned some of these. He said that the 
reintegration problem was delayed to the extent that only 
one-third of the persons who were to participate have benefited 
from this program. He also mentioned delays in land 
distribution and in the training of the former combatants. We 
would like to you to tell us what is the solution to these 
considerations. 
  [Santamaria] Yesterday we mentioned that the reintegration 
program for former combatants is being implemented based on the 
work plans that were presented, previously approved by the FMLN 
and the United Nations. These were presented by the government 
at the negotiating table as part of the commitment made. True, 
there have been some delays, we have never denied that there 
have been some delays in implementing the program. 
Nevertheless, as foreseen, the program continues to be 
implemented. Work continues in each of the areas of the 
reintegration program. True, as [UN] Ambassador Ramirez Ocampo 
said, there have been some difficulties. We have never denied 
this. Some of these cases have been due to the lack of 
resources for the programs to tee off with the speed required. 
  In another turn of events, I have said that the FMLN has 
included other contingents to be benefited by those programs. 
These persons were not originally included in the programs. 
Many times this has destabilized the program's implementation. 
Also, at times the FMLN has not sent the information required, 
and on certain occasions the information has been altered or is 
untrue. It is very difficult to work with this kind of input 
for the implementation of a program. This is a program of 
specific actions, there is no rhetoric here; specific actions 
are required here. 
  To give you an example: If a 600, 1,000, or 1,500 former 
combatants are to be benefited one must know how many resources 
are available, to what area each person is to be assigned, and 
what is that program's cost. These references must be 
established in advance. If, however, at the time of 
implementing the program someone completely changes all the 
information or increases the number of persons benefited, that 
upsets the program that had been set up. Based on this, we have 
been experiencing a number of setbacks in this regard. Other 
times, there have been some difficulties in the operating phase. 
  Nevertheless, we want it known that in September we 
presented 
a land distribution plan. This was a plan to speed up the PTT, 
that is the Land Transfer Program. This is a program that has 
given some of the best results; thus was voiced by the United 
Nations. You all recall that Marrack Goulding [UN under 
secretary general] was here in November. He was the first to 
acknowledge that a significant contribution had been made with 
the PTT presented by the government, as it had a managing 
capacity that perhaps the program did not previously have. This 
has allowed us to increase land transfers to a number of 
beneficiaries that otherwise would not have been possible. This 
we have achieved. This means that the program, in the case of 
the PTT, has been giving us those results, however, we have also 
come up against difficulties there. The difficulties have been 
that when the time comes to draw up the land deeds, many times 
the persons who have to sign the documents do not show up. They 
give excuses, they give a long story why they could not come. 
But what happens then? Well, the date you had slated to meet 
that commitment is wiped out. 
  I truly do not want to be accusing anyone specifically, but 
when the PTT and the reintegration programs are analyzed, this 
should be done broadly. 
  I believe we have done enough and proof of this is that we 
have advanced to where we stand today. I said yesterday that the 
accumulated result of all the work done with the reintegration 
program for the former combatants and the beneficiaries of the 
reintegration program has allowed us to advance and we now 
manage the program completely. The land problem has not 
destabilized the current political situation because we have 
attended each specific issue and each problem has been given a 
response. We have -- I repeat -- encountered situations that 
have prompted interruptions and sometimes a delay in the 
program's implementation. However, I am sure we are managing 
the program adequately and am totally sure that we will 
satisfactorily conclude it within the established time schedule. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] protest by the government? 
  [Santamaria] On the.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] On the bodyguard's murder by the 
U.S. citizen. 
  [Santamaria] I have already said that we are waiting for the 
information from the organizations involved in the initial 
investigation, including the PNC and the Prosecutor General's 
Office. They have already publicly reported that several 
members of the U.S. diplomatic mission interfered in the 
investigation. Once we get an official report on the case we 
will send it to the Foreign Ministry so that it can present the 
case to the U.S. Government using the established diplomatic 
channels and procedures. 
  [Moderator] The last question, Mr. Minister, will be by 
Oscar 
Rene Lopez of Mayavision. 
  [Lopez] Good day, Mr. Minister. Two questions. One refers 
to the land problem. You talked about the dismantlement of the 
operational program for the transfer of land. At a given 
moment, will the government relocate the existing program to 
solve the deadlock, get up to date, and conclude its work on the 
established dates? 
  [Santamaria] Well, as I just mentioned, that is the work we 
have been doing permanently. We are constantly adjusting and 
readjusting the program to the existing situation. Different 
causes prompt the changes we make. However, the program -- I 
repeat -- is being implemented in conformity with the agreed 
time schedule. The time schedule was agreed to collectively. 
The government is not implementing those programs -- I repeat 
-- simply because it believes this is the way they should be 
done. No, we reached an agreement and have the approval of, in 
this case, the beneficiaries and the former combatants, both of 
the FMLN and the Armed Forces. The United Nations also 
supervises the program readjustments. However, our activities 
have had to be interrupted on several occasions and the program 
has been delayed. I repeat, this happens when we are unable to 
accomplish an activity programmed for a specific date. The 
program is interrupted and we have to make changes and take 
several complementary actions which throws the schedule off. We 
report this to the United Nations. We, as well as the FMLN, 
meet with the United Nations representatives once a week. The 
FMLN meets with the United Nations representatives and we also 
meet with them to review and evaluate the program on a weekly 
basis. Based on this evaluation, a number of pointers and 
concrete suggestions are presented to make the program more 
effective. Thus, the land program has had some difficulties and 
delays but we have been overcoming them. 
  [Lopez] The second question: Copaz [National Commission for 
the Consolidation of Peace] was established about two years to 
deal with peace agreement compliance issues. This past week, 
however, it was reported that Copaz has serious administrative 
problems, especially of an economic nature. Will the government 
support this commission and contribute so that it can continue 
to verify compliance with the peace agreements as it has been 
doing up to now? 
  [Santamaria] Copaz is involved in a transition period, in 
which its role is to verify compliance with the peace agreements. 
  To verify, at the local level, that each party complies 
constitutes Copaz's fundamental role. Its role, I reiterate, is 
played within what we call the transition period. When Copaz 
has experienced financial setbacks, it has resorted to foreign 
cooperation sometimes, but from the beginning, the government 
has provided funds to Copaz. To date, the government has not 
stopped giving funds to Copaz. Based on the needs of 
organizations, they prepare a budget, present it to the 
pertinent authority -- the Finance authorities, in this case -- 
and based on whatever commitment they have, those authorities 
decide on the resources that are to be allocated to their plan. 
I do not know whether or not they have worked on this already, 
in addition to the statement you have mentioned [words 
indistinct]. Apart from that, their actions are in agreement 
with what we have done previously. When there has been a need 
for resources, the government has granted them. 
  [Moderator] Mr. Minister, here is another question by Amadeo 
Cabrera of "The News." 
  [Cabrera] Good Morning, Mr. Minister going back to the topic 
of the United States. Your government is awaiting the final 
report on the investigations. However, we would like to know if 
your government condemns the U.S. interference in the legal and 
police investigative process in this case? 
  [Santamaria] What we have said is that if there is any 
interference or intervention in the investigative process -- 
which is nothing other than the implementation of our laws -- 
that is a case that must be determined, and the investigations 
have not concluded. Once the investigations are over, we will 
issue an official report, which will be sent to the Foreign 
Ministry. We must remember that the government has an 
organization to deal with cases of this kind -- the Foreign 
Ministry. The Foreign Ministry will have the responsibility to 
determine the causes, the circumstances of this interference so 
that we can present the case properly to the U.S. Government. 
  [Cabrera] However, there is a PNC communique, which says 
that 
the U.S. interference took place with consent in this case? We 
would like to know the government's position, does it condemn 
the U.S. actions? 
  [Santamaria] As far as I understand, the PNC has issued a 
public statement. 
  [Cabrera] Is there a fax that is addressed to you for you to 
take care of this case? 
  [Santamaria] Well, if Commissioner Pena Duran sends me the 
fax, he would have to act through official channels. I have not 
received any fax from Pena Duran yet. As I said before, as soon 
as I receive the official report, which must be issued by the 
director of the PNC, we will send it to the Foreign Ministry, 
which in turn will decide on any future actions with regard to 
the U.S. Government. I am not in any way saying whether it will 
or will not be done. What I am referring to is the usual 
procedure that is followed in these cases. 
  [Moderator] Now, Fausto Valladares will ask you a question. 
  [Valladares] Mr. Minister, in the past weeks, Fenastras 
[Salvadoran Workers National Union Federation] has indicated 
that the new labor code does not have the consensus of workers. 
Fenastras has pointed out that the new code, and Fenastras has 
begun also a wave of protests. [sentence as heard] 
  [Santamaria] This topic concerns the economic and social 
forum. What I can tell you is that the forum drafted an entire 
bill on labor legislation as a part of the agenda discussed by 
the three sectors. We understand that there was a moment in 
which there was a disagreement over some provisions or articles 
of the labor reform. However, there were many articles within 
the same framework that had been agreed upon, and were 
eventually sent to us. We, through the pertaining draft bill, 
sent it to the Legislative Assembly. I do not know if Fenastras 
is trying to voice a position as a sector by saying that it does 
not share the view expressed by all the sectors that 
participated in the forum. Perhaps they have a different view 
on what the labor reform should be, and therefore, they are 
making a value judgment by not agreeing with the reform. 
However, we would wait until they sent it to the Legislative 
Assembly. We know the bill is in the hands of a commission, and 
one the Assembly's duties is to listen to the sectors. What I 
do not know is whether Fenastras will be one of the sectors to 
present its position to the Assembly. 
  [Reporter] Is the forum fulfilling the goals for which it 
was created? 
  [Santamaria] Well, the forum is precisely one of the 
organisms created to sponsor a consultation. At a given moment 
the labor issue went beyond what was originally planned in the 
forum but what I want to say is that, regardless of the 
dispositions adopted by consensus -- meaning based on a 
consultation in which the parties reached an agreement -- there 
were apparently six or seven dispositions on which they did not 
reach agreement. 
  The option was clear concerning the six or seven 
dispositions 
on which they failed to reach an agreement. Remember the 
Inter-Union Association sent a draft code to the assembly; the 
(Fesinconstrans) Construction and Transportation Workers Unions 
Federation sent a draft code to the assembly; and everyone 
expected the government would be able to state its position on 
certain parts of the labor code that would be subject to a 
revision. Since no agreement was reached, everything dealing 
with a consultation at the forum level has been left in a 
quandary. 
  This does not mean each participant cannot personally do 
what 
he considers or believes appropriate. However, I think the 
essential thing is that an agreement was reached on most of the 
dispositions, and this indicates the forum was a success. 
Hence, it would have to be assessed from that point of view. 
The government has stated its position and we will see what the 
assembly says. 
  [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
  [Santamaria] Well, I also want to thank the media for the 
opportunity to talk with you. Thank you, everyone.

  [Text] Quito, 31 Jan (EFE) -- Several student groups and 
riot police clashed today, 31 January, in several areas of Quito 
during the fourth day of protests over the increase of up to 
71.2 percent in the price of gasoline. 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced the price increase on 
28 January, but the disturbances had begun a day earlier when 
the media reported the measure. 
  At least four policemen and an unspecified number of young 
people were wounded in skirmishes from 27 to 29 January, and 
more than 20 students were arrested. Leaders of trade unions 
and other groups announced today they will promote a nationwide 
strike and demonstrations on specified days this week to protest 
the increase in the price of gasoline. 
  "The government must understand the people cannot bear any 
more adjustments," Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers 
Front (FUT), the country's largest union, said. 
  Ponce predicted the government's economic policy will cause 
"social outbursts" as the ones that took place recently in 
Chiapas (Mexico) and Santiago de Estero (Argentina). The price 
of many staple products began to rise in public markets as a 
result of the gasoline increase, local television stations 
reported. 
  The government ordered a 71.2-percent increase in the price 
of the most widely used gasoline and stated it was forced to do 
so to ease the drop in the international price of oil, which is 
the source of half of its revenues. 
  Cesar Robalino, finance and public credit minister, 
announced 
one gallon (3.8 liters) of "extra" gasoline--which, despite its 
name, is the most common and most widely used--would rise on 29 
January from 1.46 sucres to 2.50 sucres (from $0.70 to $1.20). 
  A gallon of higher quality "super" gasoline rose 25 percent, 
from 2.40 sucres to 3.00 sucres (from $1.14 to $1.43), and a 
gallon of "eco" gasoline, which has fewer pollutants, rose by 47 
percent, from 1.90 sucres to 2.80 sucres (from $0.90 to $1.33). 
  Robalino also announced "drastic" cuts in government 
spending, the suspension of investment programs, dismissal of 
tens of public employees, and a 15-percent ceiling on state 
employee pay increases in 1994.

<F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A report indicates that various student groups have 
engaged in confrontations with riot police in several 
neighborhoods in Quito during the fourth day of demonstrations 
to protest a 71.2-percent price increase in fuel prices. The 
government announced the increase on 28 January. However, 
disturbances began on the eve of the announcement when the media 
leaked the news. Between 27 and 28 January at least four 
policemen and an undetermined number of students were injured 
during riots, while over 20 students were arrested. 
  Union leaders and other important Ecuadoran leaders 
announced 
that they will promote a national strike and demonstrations this 
week to protest the increase in fuel prices. They have not 
specified dates yet. Edgar Ponce, the president of FUT [United 
Workers' Front] -- the largest workers' organization in Ecuador 
-- said that the government must understand that the people 
cannot take any more price increases. Ponce anticipated that 
the government's economic policy will trigger social explosions 
in Ecuador, such as the recent conflicts in Chiapas, Mexico, and 
Santiago del Estero, Argentina. 
  In the public markets the prices of many basic necessities 
have begun to increase as a result of the increase in fuel 
prices. The government ordered a 71.2-percent price increase 
for the fuel with the highest demand and argued that this 
measure was necessary in order to counter the fall of 
international oil prices. Oil is the source of half of the 
government's revenues. An increase in the prices of basic 
necessities was confirmed in the markets yesterday. The price of 
milk, for instance, increased by 150 sucres compared to a week 
ago. In addition, food stores and supermarkets altered their 
prices eight days ago, without any response from Quito's Police 
Intendancy. 
  Meanwhile, union leaders said that Ecuadoran workers unions 
were calling for a 24-hour general strike on 3 February to 
protest the economic adjustment measures implemented by the 
government. Edgar Ponce announced that FUT urged all 
organizations to participate in a preventive strike to request 
that the government reconsider its decision to increase fuel 
prices. On 28 January the government announced a 70.2-percent 
increase in fuel prices to counter, according to the government, 
a fiscal deficit estimated between $200 and $500 million. Ponce 
added that the strike is considered as a preventive measure, but 
it could become a progressive one if the government does not 
withdraw its decision. 
  In addition, Gustavo Teran, a teachers union member, said 
that the National Union of Teachers, the Ecuadoran Student's 
Front, the Federation of Ecuadoran University Students, and 
Indian organizations will participate in a 24-hour strike on 2 
February. Teran stated that the country's mass organizations 
reject the government's economic measures and will ask for 
Finance Minister Cesar Robalino to resign and for Congress to 
issue a statement repealing the measures. 
  This morning, (Teresa Minuchet), a government deputy, asked 
Finance Minister Robalino to resign. Ponce pointed out that the 
workers' strike is being called because Ecuadorans have lost all 
hope that they can have a halfway decent standard of living. 
Ponce said that they are calling on all organizations to join 
the struggle by the country's stategic sectors -- Ecuadoran 
State Petroleum Enterprise, public employees, the Confederation 
of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, the Agricultural 
Coordinating Board, teachers, farmers, drivers, homemakers, 
students, and the people in general. Ponce added that all 
Ecuadoreans are angry, and this has become increasingly obvious 
in the past days. He mentioned that a precedent was set in 1982 
when the government yielded to protests and did not increase 
fuel prices. 
  Today, hundreds of students continued protesting against the 
measures, and received support from the population, especially 
in southern Quito. Since this morning, students engaged in 
heavy confrontations with police in both Quito and Guayaquil, 
where they blocked several roads and caused traffic jams. 
Students in Guayaquil seized a bus, despite the fact that the 
drivers unions said they have not increased fares yet. A 
student leader said that the students will not allow any 
increase in transportation fares. Police responded to rocks 
being hurled by students with tear gas. 
  Student leaders said that during the demonstrations on 28 
January, 15 students were arrested while the students kidnapped 
a policeman. A student leader suggested an exchange of 
prisoners. Police spokespersons said that demonstrations spread 
in neighborhoods in southern, central, and northern Quito, most 
of them in high schools. The police have not reported any 
student arrests during today's demonstrations. Demonstrations 
have decreased somewhat due to a heavy rain in Quito and a drop 
in temperature, although some are still occurring in southern 
Quito.

<F P=106> [Report by Octavio Cogley from the Christian Democratic </F>
Party headquarters in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] Good evening. We interrupt this program to 
announce an item of general interest. This is Octavio Cogley, 
live from the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] headquarters. 
The PDC officially announced this evening its presidential 
slate for the May elections. The slate is led by Engineer 
Eduardo Vallarino as the presidential candidate; Raul Ossa, 
first vice presidential candidate; and Rene Orillac, second vice 
presidential candidate. 
  We repeat, the PDC revealed this evening the slate that will 
represent it in the May elections. The slate is led by Eng. 
Eduardo Vallarino, as the presidential candidate, with Raul Ossa 
as the first vice presidential candidate, and Rene Orillac as 
the second vice presidential candidate. 
  The PDC also revealed a medical certificate issued by Dr. 
Fernando (Groce), a clinical neurologist, who states that Dr. 
Ricardo Arias Calderon suffers from a chronic injury to a 
vertebral disc and a recent fracture of the third lumbar 
vertebrae. For this reason, Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon declines 
the presidential candidacy. 
  The party has decided to participate alone in the elections, 
but it leaves open the possibility of being joined by other 
parties before the 8 May elections. 
  It was also reported that a special congress will be held on 
6 February to ratify the presidential slate chosen by the PDC to 
participate in the next elections.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister </F>
Sergio Abreu by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EL PAIS] What are the premises and the principles 
upon which the Foreign Ministry based its action in 1993? 
  [Abreu] The current administration has chosen continuity and 
the development of a foreign policy of state as its general 
guiding principles. Thus the foreign policy, which is conducted 
by the president and the foreign minister, is inspired by the 
need to put its objectives at the service of permanent national 
interest and of medium- and long-term guidelines, which are 
beyond domestic political circumstances. 
  In line with this continuity, and seeking consistency in our 
foreign policy, our traditional observance of the principles of 
international law has been maintained. 
  The principles of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of 
nations, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of 
controversies, which our country has upheld throughout its 
history as a sovereign, independent nation, have been endorsed 
during the current administration. Transformations on the 
international political stage and the dynamic changes we are 
witnessing today have emphasized the role of the law in 
international relations. 
  [EL PAIS] What is the Uruguayan foreign policy strategy? 
  [Abreu] Foreign policy decisions are not made on the basis 
of 
isolated stages or circumstances. Instead, they reflect the 
strategy with which the Foreign Ministry rates the country's 
foreign policy objectives. 
  Our foreign policy has been conducted on the basis of the 
strategy of "concentric circles," with priority areas designed 
on the basis of the country's geopolitical location: First, 
bilateral relations with neighbors, followed by the subregion, 
the region, the continent, the Iberoamerican world, and the rest 
of the world. The Foreign Ministry made major efforts during 
1993 toward attaining the above objectives in each of those 
circles. 
  First, the strategy sought to promote the competitive 
advantage of the country in a regional and subregional context, 
in which Uruguay's main partners are its neighbors, Argentina 
and Brazil. 
  [EL PAIS] What have been the main accomplishments within 
this 
framework? 
  [Abreu] Among our achievements we can mention the promotion 
of bilateral relations with Argentina and Brazil. This includes 
major achievements in physical and economic integration, 
excellent political relations, and bilateral consideration of 
the more sensible topics of the relations with our neighbors, 
like areas along the country's borders. 
  This first priority circle of the state foreign policy is 
supplemented by our active presence at a regional and 
subregional level. We have sought to promote the role of a 
supplier of goods and services at a regional level, which our 
country might play because of its privileged geopolitical 
location as the natural exit port of Latin America's richest and 
most densely populated basin. Among the specific actions that 
have been undertaken we mention: 

  -  Improvement of the navigability of Uruguay River, which 
was jointly arranged with the Argentine Government. This action 
is particularly important for the development of our ports and 
for the waterway project because it allows better ship access 
from Nueva Palmira to Salto, thus promoting the revitalization 
of the ports on the lower Uruguay River. 
  -  Actions, also with the 
Argentine Government, to dredge, place buoys, and maintain the 
River Plate channels, for which an agreement has been 
reached. 
  -  the impulse toward concluding an agreement for the 
Colonia-Buenos Aires bridge project, which for Uruguay will be 
the first stretch of the Highway Axis. This emphasizes the 
position of our country as a key area for land transportation 
between the region's large urban and industrial centers. 
  -  The 
steps taken for granting institutional status to the 
negotiations for constructing the Highway Axis joining Sao 
Paulo, Porto Alegre, Uruguay, and Argentina, a project that is 
specially significant for Uruguay and that will promote 
integration of the economies of the three countries. 
  -  The 
development of the Cuareim River basin, including the 
enforcement of the Statute of the Uruguayan-Brazilian Mixed 
Commission for that basin. 
  -  The promotion of development in areas 
along the Brazilian border, through the activities of the 
binational commission and through the strengthening of the 
importance of the existing border committees. Such activities 
fall within the framework of the border policy, which is a 
priority among our major foreign police objectives, aiming at 
consolidating national culture and national identity in border 
areas in conjunction with economic development, which is being 
jointly promoted with neighboring countries. 
  -  The actions aimed 
at enforcing the multilateral agreement on the Paraguay-Parana 
Waterway (Puerto Caceres-Nueva Palmira) and, considering the 
importance of the project's work schedule, the promotion of 
joint actions by the five countries to agree on the 
implementation of the Technical Cooperation Agreement signed 
with the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank], which seeks to 
determine the feasibility of this river way. 

  -  In turn, political relations with our main neighbors have 
been strengthened through reciprocal visits of top government 
officials. Among them we should note the visit by Brazilian 
President Itamar Franco in May 1993, the first visit by a 
Brazilian president since 1985. In addition, the Uruguayan 
foreign minister visited Brazil in November 1993. 
  -  We emphasize 
the diplomatic efforts that Uruguay has made to revitalize the 
role of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, 
Paraguay, and Bolivia], as an instrument to promote renewed 
cooperation and coordination among its members. 
  -  The relations 
between Bolivia and the subregion have been a priority for the 
Foreign Ministry, which has proposed an analysis of the way we 
can develop closer ties with Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. 
  [EL PAIS] What about actions at a regional level? 
  [Abreu] Another foreign policy objective has been to 
guarantee the Uruguayan presence in the Latin American region as 
a whole, though bilateral and multilateral ties. 
  The approval of NAFTA by the U.S. Congress, which marked the 
creation of an economic bloc of great significance for the rest 
of the continent, has made it essential for us to promote our 
relations with Mexico. The promotion of our relations with that 
country, in all areas, has been one of our foreign policy 
objectives. To this end an important presidential visit was 
paid to that country in March 1993, during which agreements on 
several areas were signed, including the commercial area. 
  Meanwhile, relations with Chile were also considered a 
priority objective, particularly in the economic-commercial area. 
  From a multilateral viewpoint, the Latin American 
integration 
process implemented through LAIA [Latin American Integration 
Association] has been firmly supported. Proof of this is 
Uruguay's active engagement in the resolution of the issue 
involving Mexico's participation in NAFTA and the enforcement of 
Article 44 of the LAIA Agreement, that is, the Most Favored 
Nation Clause. This situation had produced a major disagreement 
between member countries. Our country promoted agreement 
formulas that led to the settlement of the discrepancies, thus 
preserving the organization from a conflict that could have 
seriously affected it. 
  In the political area, Uruguay has promoted the 
consolidation 
of the Rio Group as a permanent mechanism facilitating 
consultation and agreement between Latin American countries on 
issues that affect the common interest of the region. The Rio 
Group, whose members advocate the principles of democracy, 
pluralism, and respect for human rights, is an auspicious fact 
for Latin America. It is totally coincident with our foreign 
policy principles, which Uruguay has always sought to strengthen. 
  Uruguay has also maintained a major presence within the 
framework of the OAS, reaffirming the importance of this forum 
for the preservation of democracy in the continent, and 
endorsing -- as in the case of Haiti's institutional crisis -- 
measures to restore institutional democracy in that country. 
  [EL PAIS] With what countries have we made bilateral 
progress? 
  [Abreu] This government attached importance to the promotion 
of relations -- especially in the economic field -- with 
countries or group of countries with major weight in 
international commerce. Three very important presidential visits 
were made in 1993: to Belgium and to the European Community in 
April; to Great Britain in June; and to the PRC in December. In 
each case the objectives were fully achieved because the visits 
made it possible for us to inform the relevant sectors of those 
countries about existing commercial opportunities, possibilities 
for investment, and mutual benefits to be derived from 
strengthening exchange in various fields.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle by Barret </F>
Puig at the presidential residence in Montevideo, 23 December: 
"President Lacalle Supports Only Economic Policy That Benefits 
Social Progress"; first three paragraphs are LA NACION editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the end of 1993, during an 
interview with LA NACION, President Lacalle presented an overall 
view of relations with Argentina and the challenge created by 
Mercosur [South American Common Market], among other matters of 
major interest to Uruguay. 
  President Luis Alberto Lacalle received a LA NACION 
representative at El Prado, his official residence on Avenida 
Suarez and spoke about relations with Argentina, Mercosur, Latin 
America in general, and the election year in Uruguay, from the 
perspective of the end of 1993. 
  Following are the most important matters raised in the 
interview. 
  [Puig] What are the principal problems with Argentina at 
this 
time? 
  [Lacalle] I think that, rather than problems, we might refer 
to them as questions. I would say that the central question, 
which is being resolved but which still presents some 
difficulties, is ensuring that work on the Martin Garcia Canal 
(an Uruguayan project) is compatible with work on the Emilio 
Mitre Canal (in Argentina). As you know, these are complementary 
projects in Uruguay's view. However, in the view of some 
Argentine groups they are almost conflicting projects. 
  President Menem has personally recognized this fact, and I 
must say a few words in recognition of the sympathy and 
affection with which he has always considered Uruguayan views. 
However, there have been some difficulties in handling these 
matters. 
  Sometimes we have a commercial question to deal with. 
However, I would say that this sort of thing has been 
overshadowed by the matters which we have in common: the bridge 
from Buenos Aires to Colonia, in particular, and the super 
highway. These are the two major public works which we have at 
hand. A contract for the construction of the bridge project will 
certainly be awarded in the course of 1994. The super highway is 
its natural consequence, because it is going to connect Buenos 
Aires with San Pablo by way of the bridge. 
  We are awaiting ratification by the Argentine Congress of 
the 
treaty on the waterway system, which has already been approved 
by Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay, leaving Brazil and Argentina 
to accept it. The matter of the waterway system is very 
important, and I will take advantage of this occasion to 
underline its significance and the need for the Argentine 
Congress to approve it. 
<H5>  Mercosur </H5>
  [Puig] On 1 January 1995--barely one year from now--Mercosur 
should be in full operation. Meanwhile, in the countries which 
will be members of it there are inflations ranging from a single 
digit, at best, to 50 percent annually, to 50 percent monthly. 
How will all of that fit together? 
  [Lacalle] Making it fit together will be difficult. I know 
that Mercosur will not be easy to handle, but there is no other 
choice. If we cut off our legs to avoid losing our way on the 
road, we would not have signed the Treaty of Asuncion, because 
Argentina was in too strong a financial position. 
  Brazil has major problems, but it also has a major 
potential. 
I think that the economic plan which it has adopted for 1994 
will be an effective one. The proposal made by the Brazilians 
themselves to study some way of linking our currencies 
demonstrates the will to deal with these matters. 
  [Puig] Uruguayan and Paraguayan industrialists have just 
asked their Argentine and Brazilian opposite numbers to request 
their governments to agree to a delay in the implementation of 
Mercosur. 
  [Lacalle] I think that a delay is about the only thing that 
we could not agree to because, since we know what kind of people 
we are, an extension would be continued forever. Therefore, I 
consider that the major advantage of Mercosur is that, because 
the date for its entry into effect cannot be changed, it has 
caused a major industrial renovation program. 
<H5>  Military Concern </H5>
  [Puig] I would like to change the subject: 1993 was a year 
which was characterized by concerns about the military. Let us 
not go into them in detail, but they are clear enough. There is 
the case of the Chilean, the case of the microphone, some 
transfers, the restructuring, and even the matter of pensions. 
What is the situation now? 
  [Lacalle] I would not call them concerns. I would call them 
problems, which is a different matter. We have asserted our 
position as the supreme authority of the armed forces. We have 
not seen acts of disrespect, as unfortunately happened a few 
years ago in the history of our country. There has been 
continuing respect for duly constituted authority. 
  In our country legal authority over the military hierarchy 
is 
fully in effect. 
<H5>  Economic and Social Policies </H5>
  [Puig] A few days ago, when you dedicated construction work 
which had been completed at the Pereira Rosell Children's 
Hospital, you said that you can have good economic policies with 
good social policies as well. 
  [Lacalle] You have heard it said, until you are tired of 
hearing it, that the so-called neoliberal policy was being 
implemented to the detriment of social policy. I always remember 
a remark made by Jaime Paz Zamora: "With inflation at the 25,000 
percent rate, there are no social policies. They do not exist. 
They are only on paper. With inflation at 8 percent annually 
Bolivia has been able to deal with social policy." If I might 
transpose these remarks, which is not quite correct, I would say 
that Uruguay has been able to follow very important social 
policies at the same time that it was putting its economic house 
in order, reducing the deficit, lowering inflation, and, more 
specifically, reorganizing the external debt. I will give you 
two figures. We have practically doubled the budget for health 
and education. We have raised the health budget from $90 to $170 
million. The education budget has been raised from $180 to $300 
million, not taking into account other kinds of social 
investments. And this has been done at the same time as we have 
achieved a noticeable reduction in inflation and in the deficit. 
<H5>  Elections </H5>
  [Puig] Over a period of 12 months elections will have been 
held in 11 Latin American countries. They have already been held 
in Honduras, Venezuela, and Chile. And consider how curious this 
is: three former presidents and four sons of former presidents 
are candidates. Are the people voting out of a sense of 
nostalgia? 
  [Lacalle] I do not know about the other countries, but I 
would say that we are substantially different from that. If 
there is something in the rest of America which cannot be 
applied to Uruguay, it is in political terms. 
  We have the oldest party system in the world. From 1836 
until 
now there have been two political parties in Uruguay which are 
inextricably united. Their very existence alongside each other 
is conditioned in a way unlike any other system in the world. 
Certainly, this is without prejudice to the emergence of the 
other political groups. However, there is no doubt that the 
traditional parties are a unique phenomenon. 
  This is a country with a well-developed electoral culture. I 
do not believe that I would vote for anyone because he is the 
son of this person or a relative of that one. It has not been 
much of an advantage for me to be the grandson of one of the 
greatest leaders that Uruguay has had. I had to make my own way. 
<H5>  Election Programs </H5>
  [Lacalle continued] What is happening in Uruguay--and you 
can 
see in that the impact which Herrera has had, that is, in my 
sector of the National Party [PN]--is a recognition of the 
importance of election programs and their implementation. We are 
very proud of the great extent to which we have implemented our 
election program. And I am sure that this is going to have an 
enormous effect on the next election campaign, because people 
are going to be asking the parties to do something similar to 
what we did: that is, to advocate appropriate actions which can 
actually be accomplished. 
  [Puig] Can you comment on the issue of constitutional 
reform? 
  [Lacalle] Look, I believe that there is a critical mass, as 
we would say in terms of physics, in favor of constitutional 
reform. I do not know if there are historic moments to do that, 
because today is 23 December, and I see that there will be a 
delay. I do not want to make a judgment about this. I believe 
that there is a critical mass of people who understand. I am the 
man who can speak about this subject with the greatest freedom, 
first, because I am not a candidate in the next elections, and, 
secondly, because I have lived through the difficulties of not 
being able to form a government. We are aiming at constitutional 
reform while at the same time we would like to give the next 
president better means of governing the country in a better way. 
  [Puig] Are you disappointed about that? 
  [Lacalle] Yes, because I believe that the contrast between 
the things which many political groups have said and what they 
did afterwards has led to great disappointment among the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senator Alvaro Uribe Velez by Gilda </F>
Sarmiento; place and date not given -- first two paragraphs are 
EL ESPECTADOR introduction] 
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota--Regarded as the key man in the 
reform of social security in Congress, Alvaro Uribe Velez was 
chosen senator of the year in 1993, supplanting such old 
political operators as Victor Renan Barco. 
  Uribe Velez spoke with our economics section about these 
past 
18 months in politics, during which time he has had to put up 
with lobbying, criticism, threats, and even impertinent 
questions from a reporter in Armenia, who asked him what pension 
fund he owned. 
  [Sarmiento] What is the most important thing about the 
social 
security reform? 
  [Uribe] It contains mechanisms for expanding coverage to 
improve health care; over the long run these mechanisms will 
mean steady growth for social security service in terms of 
broader coverage and a major improvement in quality. It also 
contains a capitalization mechanism that will boost national 
savings appreciably, and this should have very favorable 
macroeconomic ramifications in the medium term. 
  [Sarmiento] The feeling in the country is that the law 
boosted contributions but reduced pensions, which is not at all 
good for Colombian workers.... 
  [Uribe] Setting up state-run institutions was in vogue in 
Colombia in the 1960's, as it was all over the world. The 
creators of these institutions did not realize how inefficient 
an all-powerful State would become. In recent years we have seen 
a totally opposite vogue: the neoliberal vogue of dismantling 
the entire State. The reform's major virtue is that it balances 
State participation very well with the participation of private 
citizens and social entities. The State is involved as a 
regulator, as a monitor, and also as a provider of social 
services; private citizens and social entities deliver services. 
We are devising a major synthesis here. We are placing the 
system at a happy medium between the two extremes of total 
nationalization, as in the 1960's, and the complete transfer of 
these public services to market forces, as some champions of 
neoliberalism advocate. We are placing ourselves at a social 
center of great importance. 
  Unlike countries such as Chile and Peru, among others, in 
Colombia contributions are not going to be paid exclusively by 
the workers; on the contrary, employers are going to pay the 
larger share. And why are contributions being increased? As far 
as pensions are concerned, we are moving up to 1996 the increase 
to 13.5 percent that we would have to have in place by around 
2010. The very likely consequence is that if we have a 13.5 
percent rate as of 1996, we will not have to order further 
increases to pay pensions during the next generation. The 
advantage of an increase now is not only that it will avoid 
future increases but also that it will enable us to gradually 
resolve the government's problem of its huge debt to future 
retirees. The average length of service of workers is 12 years, 
and moreover there are no reserves. As the State begins to 
collect these higher contributions, like any private sector 
employer, they will guarantee enough reserves to meet these 
obligations. 
  We are not boosting contributions for health care. We are 
simply leveling them out at the top to extend coverage to the 
worker's family. 
  The eligibility age is being raised very little. Whereas 
other countries have put it at 65, which was the 
administration's initial proposal, Congress raised it to just 62 
for men and 57 for women, and only as of 2014. In other words, 
the age has been raised conservatively and far into the future. 
  [Sarmiento] Why do you regard this reform as the most 
important of the past half century? 
  [Uribe] Because this country delivers social security 
services to a very small percentage of the population, barely 21 
percent, whereas coverage in the industrialized countries is 
close to 100 percent and the average is between 40 and 50 
percent in Latin America. Colombia, at 21 percent, is barely at 
Haiti's level. This reform provides all of the mechanisms for us 
to start expanding coverage. 
  [Sarmiento] Isn't it utopian to think that by the year 2000 
all Colombians will have health care? 
  [Uribe] The goal is a very ambitious one, and in this 
connection I am less optimistic than the health minister, but we 
have to make an effort to come as close to it as we can. The 
first step is to fulfill the legal obligation that in a year's 
time the ISS [Social Security Institute] has to offer family 
coverage to all its affiliates. This will be an essential 
element for credibility in enforcing the new law. Second, the 
public funding for health care in coming years is going to rise 
from 2 to 4 percent of the GDP. Third, one quarter of the 
revenues of the departments and municipalities must go to health 
care. And fourth, some of the revenues of the territorial 
entities that will come from Cusiana and Cupiagua will expand 
the health-care budgets as of 1997. 
  [Sarmiento] The comment that laws do not bring votes but 
that 
social security could cost votes is making the rounds in 
Congress. Aren't you afraid that it may jeopardize your 
aspiration to be governor of Antioquia? 
  [Uribe] The governorship is an aspiration, but now is not 
the 
time to bring it up. Let's see what happens in 1994. I think 
that Colombia, like so many other Latin American countries, has 
been banishing populism. I think that populist harangues bring 
applause but do not speak to Colombians' deep-seated 
rationality. I believe much more strongly in the good sense of 
people, who prefer serious reforms to simple populist harangues. 
Reforming is very hard and initially causes headaches, but in 
the end it is one of the few things that make politics 
gratifying. 
  [Sarmiento] Do you consider this a perfect reform? 
  [Uribe] This law will no doubt have to be reformed in the 
future. It is not perfect, but it establishes very important 
institutions that are destined to last for a very long time in 
Colombia. We cannot aspire to perfection because social security 
is very complicated. There is a social security crisis the world 
over; all countries are seeking a model. We have developed a 
very Colombian model, based on our own experience and our own 
idiosyncrasies, but unlike in Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, this 
reform was not adopted either by a dictatorial government, or a 
strong Executive without Congress, or an Executive without a 
deliberative public. We have adopted it here with a pluralistic 
Congress, four months before elections, with a vigilant public, 
and in a democracy with an opposition. 
  [Sarmiento] What worries you about the law? 
  [Uribe] I am worried that in the area of health care the 12 
percent rate may not be enough. But to the extent that the 
system works well, in a year or two political and social 
conditions conducive to an increase will have been created. I am 
also worried that the hike will be hard on small and mid-sized 
business, but this problem will be felt just in the first few 
years. They will then begin to reap the benefits of better 
health services and a substantial growth in savings. 
  [Sarmiento] The administration says that in adopting the 
reform it was thinking more about our poorest citizens. How will 
it affect these segments of society? 
  [Uribe] The reform provides a very important instrument for 
the members of the informal economy and poor peasants: the 
possibility that the family allowance funds and the cooperative 
sector can organize themselves as health promotion enterprises. 
As family-allowance funding is rechanneled to bring health care 
to these groups in our large cities and on small peasant farms, 
we are going to make headway in extending services to people who 
have long been ignored. 
  [Sarmiento] How would you convince the country that the law 
is not a bad one, when some think that the next administration's 
first task will be to reform it? 
  [Uribe] I believe strongly in the practical effects of the 
reform. We have altered 50-year old social security legislation 
that had brought us to very low levels of coverage. It is only 
fair to call for a reasonable period of lead time before 
evaluating the practical results. 
  [Sarmiento] The academic sector feels that in seven years or 
so the pension contributions will have to be increased again 
because the reform was an equation that Congress broke because 
hiking the contributions was not enough. 
  [Uribe] Congress was conservative in tightening the 
requirements, to the extent that a pluralistic Congress could do 
so. Many people there said that raising contributions meant that 
requirements did not have to be tightened or certain benefits 
cut. The projections of the actuaries tell us that this equation 
improves into the future and that the ISS and the system in 
general may make it to the year 2020 with a large cushion of 
reserves. 
  [Sarmiento] In the final accounting, who does this law 
cover? 
  [Uribe] The main dividing line in the reform is, by and 
large, age, with exceptions. A minimal part will apply to males 
over 40 and females over 35. Everyone will have to make larger 
contributions, however. 
  [Sarmiento] In one sentence how would you describe the 
social 
security reform? 
  [Uribe] As a reform with major challenges. 
  [Sarmiento] We are about to have a change in administration. 
Is there any guarantee that the next one will implement the 
reform? 
  [Uribe] I do not think that President Gaviria's reformist 
spirit, which was a fundamental factor in this reform, is going 
to go for naught. I am certain that whoever the next president 
of Colombia is, he will take up the task of implementing it. It 
will be excellent for the next administration to find the 
legislative part clearly defined and all set to be implemented. 
  [Sarmiento] Doesn't this law privatize pensions and health 
care? 
  [Uribe] The major virtue of this law is that it follows 
neither the nationalization wave of the 1960's nor the 
privatizing wave of neoliberalism. It aims for a sensible happy 
medium. It tells the State: you monitor and regulate. And it 
tells private individuals and the social sector: you cooperate 
with the government in delivering these services and in steadily 
expanding social security. 
  [Sarmiento] Since this law is not perfect, what are its 
shortcomings? 
  [Uribe] So far I would point out two minor problems. In the 
early years contributions are going to be very heavy for small 
and midsized businesses. And the health-care contribution is 
inadequate for now. 
  [Sarmiento] Was there a great deal of pressure to get this 
reform out? 
  [Uribe] Not pressure, but everybody had ideas about the 
reform. Political parties, employer and labor unions. All 
economic, social, and political sectors voiced opinions. And I 
would say that the purpose of the reform was not to apportion 
discontent equitably, as Saint Thomas put it, but rather to 
develop common ground that is good for the country. 
  [Sarmiento] Have there been threats against your life? 
  [Uribe] I have not been threatened. Politics entails risks, 
and you have to face up to them with patriotism. When you enter 
politics, you have to choose between trying to preserve the 
entire established order, the political modus vivendi, and 
helping to transform it. I believe that as long as I am in 
politics, I have to help transform it and work patriotically, 
with thoroughgoing devotion for Colombia and to be very prudent 
during the difficult times in political life.

  [Text] Managua, 31 Jan (DPA) -- The Nicaraguan police 
command and the National Transportation Commission [CNT] agreed 
on a truce tonight to avoid clashes and open the door for a 
negotiated solution to end the transportation strike, which has 
adversely affected the country's activities for the past week. 
  After Police Chief Fernando Caldera announced he would evict 
hundreds of members of the transportation sector, who had 
gathered on the Metro Centro highway, the busiest in Managua, 
the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] asked Tomas 
Borge, interior minister during the Sandinist government, to 
mediate to avoid a conflict. Representatives of the CNT agreed 
to avoid confrontation by removing the vehicles that were 
obstructing traffic, while the authorities promised to remain at 
a prudent distance. 
  Former Interior Minister Borge said the most important thing 
is to reach a negotiated solution between the government and the 
transportation sector. Meanwhile, the FSLN issued a communique 
supporting the transportation sector demands, which include a 
decrease in fuel prices and a law regulating the Nicaraguan 
transportation system. 
  The police released two members of the transportation sector 
who had been arrested, while a soldier, who had been kidnapped 
by the strikers, was released. The police were about to 
implement an operation to evict the strikers, which would have 
led to a bloody confrontation, according to some media. 
  The CNT reiterated its call to the Violeta Chamorro 
government to resume negotiations, because the strike is very 
costly for the country. 
  The Transportation Ministry said there are no plans to 
negotiate with the CNT because it has reached agreements with 
four transportation organizations, which represent nearly 75 
percent of the sector, that are not participating in the strike. 
  On the streets of Managua, thousands of people have had to 
walk to work since the strike began or have had to pay high 
prices for service provided by substitute drivers. It is 
believed that 20 percent of the transportation sector in Managua 
is not heeding the strike call.

<F P=106> [Report by Pedro Chamorro] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Colonel Javier Carrion 
MacDonough, second in command of the EPS [Sandinist People's 
Army] General Staff, held an extensive news conference on Army 
activities in 1993 and plans for 1994. 
  According to Carrion, as of January 1993, there were between 
2,300 and 2,400 rearmed men among the various groups operating 
primarily in the Nueva Segovia and Jinotega Departments. 
Approximately 1,700 irregular troops have been demobilized as a 
result of the amnesty, and as a result of the closure of the 
security zones or enclaves this past October. The EPS began 
several operations aimed at curbing those groups that decided 
not to take advantage of the amnesty and who chose to carry out 
activities like burning ranches, kidnappings, and robberies, 
thereby endangering the coffee harvest instead. 
  In recapping the irregular groups' activities in 1993, 
Carrion explained that 2,388 operations had been executed; of 
this amount, 761 had a political-military nature and 1,627 were 
strictly against criminal activities. 
  Carrion pointed out the EPS sustained 129 casualties in 
clashes against irregular groups, of which 49 were fatalities. 
  As of October 1993, the 3-80 Northern Front began to expand 
throughout Nueva Segovia, and "El Chacal" [Jose Angel Talavera] 
crossed the border into Honduras. The high-ranking military 
officer said "El Chacal's" presence in the region along the 
Honduran border caused the EPS General Staff to fear that 
tensions could develop with Honduras. The Army also believed he 
could be using Honduras to regroup his forces considering the 
fact there were no longer any security zones in Nicaragua. 
  Carrion explained that another important EPS activity 
included protecting produce growers by offsetting the so-called 
"Matches Plan" [plan fosforo], "El Chacal's" plan of blocking 
the 1993-94 northern region coffee harvest. 
  In recapping the 1993 accomplishments as relates to 
pacification efforts, Carrion said 1,700 armed irregulars had 
been disarmed and more than 8,000 rifles had been seized as part 
of the BED [Special Disarmament Brigade] program. Other weapons 
of war seized during 1993 include 150 machine guns and more than 
1,000 kg of plastic explosives. This entire arsonal was 
destroyed. With these 8,000 rifles, the total amount of war 
equipment seized and destroyed since 1990 is 51,409 pieces. 
  Twenty-two groups were disbanded and more than 100 people 
were placed at the disposal of judicial authorities as part of a 
joint program with the National Police. 
  With respect to 1994 activities, Carrion indicated they will 
basically be similar to those carried out in 1993 -- in other 
words, to continue fighting the irregular groups and protecting 
farmers. According to the EPS officer, both undertakings will 
utilize 79 percent of the troops. 
  He also referred to activities like military training and 
upgrading, where 42,000 man-hours were invested during 1993. 
  Carrion talked about several other 1993 activities: 
supporting the "Glass of Milk" program; helping to transport 
turtles from Najapa's La Laguna lake when it dried up; 
establishing a permanent presence along the San Juan River, 
particularly in the southern area near the Si-A-Paz forest 
reserve where tourists from Costa Rica continue to fish 
illegally; and the prevention of animal contraband in the 
aforementioned reserve. 
  He referred to support of communities stricken by natural 
disasters, like the 1993 floods of Malacatoya and some Managua 
neighborhoods; the prevention of illegal fishing, which in 1993, 
despite insufficient ships, resulted in the capture of 77 pirate 
sea vessels operating in the Atlantic side. 
  These activities encompassed the fight against drug 
trafficking, including tackling this sensitive problem together 
with the civilian population and the National Police, thereby 
dealing some heavy blows to the mafia; projects carried out in 
several of the country's production areas, including locating 
land mines which killed five EPS soldiers, including a 
specialist officer. 
  He also talked about building housing units for the officers 
corps; preparing an EPS inventory to be given to the OAS as part 
of international agreements; formulating an officers retirement 
plan and a military bill proposal which will regulate the 
institution once it is approved by the National Assembly. 
  With respect to social conflicts which have affected the 
country, such as the current transportation system strike, 
Carrion indicated the EPS will only intervene if these events 
turn into armed conflicts like the Esteli takeover, which the 
National Police was unable to control. He added that permanent 
communication is being maintained between the EPS and the 
National Police.

<F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President-Elect Rafael Caldera in </F>
Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Venezuelan people, I fulfill with pleasure the offer 
to announce this evening the names of the Venezuelans who make 
up the work team that will accompany me in the government tasks 
we will begin on Wednesday. I promise the viewers I will not 
take one minute from their opportunity to see the historical 
game that will start at 1900 in Valencia, where the two 
traditional rivals -- the Caracas and Magallanes teams -- will 
participate in a traditional game and decide who will represent 
Venezuela in the Caribbean games. 
  I proceed to indicate the names of the cabinet ministers and 
personalities who will accompany us in the government tasks, 
which shall be difficult but which we will take on with great 
faith in Venezuela, great love for the country, and great hope. 
  The Interior Ministry has been accepted by Ramon Escovar 
Salom, whom, suffice it to say, earned the Venezuelan people's 
admiration and respect as prosecutor general of the Republic 
during five years of the administration which is about to end. 
  I have appointed Dr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, a diplomat 
with great experience and an important politician, to the 
Foreign Ministry. He was presidential candidate with a 
substantial number of votes; and he is respected and appreciated 
by the Venezuelan people in general. 
  Julio Sosa Rodriguez has accepted the post of finance 
minister. He is a man who refused, although he was insistently 
asked to do so, to occupy any ministry in previous 
administrations. During my first administration he was an 
excellent ambassador to the United States of America, and he was 
an efficient negotiator for Venezuela's admission to the Andean 
Pact. Julio's experience, his reputation, his moral stature 
qualify him to handle the tremendous fiscal and economic 
problems Venezuela will face. 
  Army Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette will be 
defense minister. He is a 49-year-old military officer with a 
brilliant service record who is currently inspector general of 
the Army. He will be accompanied by a distinguished list of 
officers in the military High Command: Rear Admiral Rafael 
Huizi Clavier, Armed Forces inspector general; Air Force 
Division General Maglio Montiel Arguello, chairman of the Joints 
Chiefs of Staff; Army Division General Moises Antonio Orozco 
Graterol, Army commanding general; Rear Admiral Carlos Ramos 
Flores, Navy commander; Air Force Division General Otto Garcia 
Rivera, Air Force commanding general; and Armed Forces of 
Cooperation [FAC] Division General Egberto Arruza Delgado, 
National Guard commanding general. 
  The Development Ministry will be occupied by Architect Luis 
Carlos Palacios, a university professor, a man with a vast 
knowledge of economic issues, and an honest and hard-working man. 
  The Education Ministry will be occupied by Dr. Antonio Luis 
Cardenas, former rector and founder of the Libertador 
Pedagogical University, a teacher with a vast experience who 
recently has been in charge of the Education Directorate in 
Merida State, where he conducted some experiments that earned 
the admiration and approval of experts in education issues. 
  The Health and Social Welfare Ministry will be occupied by 
Dr. Vicente Perez Davila, 39 years old, a brilliant doctor with 
a post-graduate degree from the United States. Furthermore, he 
will be supported by a National Health Council which includes 
Dr. Fernando Ruben Coronil, who will act as chairman, Dr. Pedro 
Rincon Gutierrez, Dr. Jacinto Convit, Dr. Pablo Pulido, Dr. 
Alberto (Guidan) Baldo, Dr. Hernan Mendez Castellanos, Dr. Blas 
Bruni Celli, Dr. Luis Manzanilla, and representatives of the 
most important organizations in the health sector: the medical 
schools, the pharmaceutical schools, and professional 
organizations. They will meet on an ad honorem basis at least 
once a month to advise the Ministry on critical issues 
pertaining to health. 
  For agriculture and livestock minister, I have chosen Ciro 
Anez Fonseca, a man who is also well-known in economic sectors, 
specializing in agricultural problems. He has been president of 
Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry] and Pro-Venezuela. He has broad 
support from business sectors, especially from the small and 
medium business sectors. 
  For labor minister, I have chosen Dr. Juan Nepomuceno 
Garrido, with broad academic training, with post graduate 
studies in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. He has been my 
closest aide in drafting the basic labor law, in passage of the 
bill through the legislative chambers, and topics dealing with 
labor issues. 
  For transport and communications minister, I have chosen 
Engineer Cesar Quintini Rosales, who also has several post 
graduate degrees from U.S. universities. He has undertaken 
specialized studies on transportation and has a solid reputation 
in his professional area. 
  For justice minister, I have chosen lawyer Ruben Creixems, 
the youngest in the cabinet at 36. He is currently director of 
the law school of the Andres Bello Catholic University. 
  For the Energy and Mines Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Erwin 
Jose Arrieta Valera. He has been president of the Mining 
Chamber and secretary general of the Petroleum Chamber. He is 
deeply concerned about and involved in petroleum issues. He has 
gained interesting experience by being ambassador to Kuwait and 
the United Arab Emirates in the past six months. 
  For the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources 
Ministry, 
a specialist fully dedicated to these problems, especially to 
the problem which is so important, serious, and essential for 
the Venezuelans: the supply of water not only in the 
metropolitan and rural areas but in the neglected areas of 
cities which suffer so much due to this lack of water. [No name 
provided by Caldera; Madrid EFE at 0003 GMT on 1 February in a 
report on the cabinet announcement indicates that Roberto Perez 
Lecuna is the environment and natural resources minister.] 
  For the Urban Development Ministry, I have chosen Eng. Ciro 
Zaa, from Barquisimeto. He is currently a member of the board 
of directors of the Yacambo dam project. He is 44. I hope that 
in the area of housing, especially lower-income housing, he will 
carry out important tasks. 
  For the Family Ministry, I have chosen Dr. Mercedes Pulido 
de 
Briceno. She is well-known in media circles and well linked to 
the university sectors. She is very concerned about social 
issues. She will have to work hard due to the importance of 
this Ministry which in a future state reform will become a 
social development ministry. 
  For the Secretariat of the Presidency, I have chosen a team 
that has my most absolute trust. Andres Caldera will be 
minister; Fernando Egana will be deputy minister; Fernando 
Febres Villalba will be private secretary; Guillermo Alvarez 
Bajares will be chief of the Central Information Office, with 
rank of minister of state; and Enrique Alvarado will be director 
of presidential relations. 
  For chief of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning 
of the Presidency, Cordiplan, I have chosen Enzo del Buffalo, a 
young economist, well respected, well-known, and well viewed in 
the circles involved in the national economy. 
  I note that we have returned to the original situation when 
Cordiplan was created. At that time, Manolo Perez Guerrero and 
the comrades who helped him in creating this organization 
insisted that this should not be a ministry, rather it should be 
an office under the umbrella of the Presidency to be removed 
from the differences that exist between the diverse ministries. 
  Asdrubal Batista, 46, minister for the reform of the 
national 
economy; professor of Yesa [not further identified]; professor 
in [word indistinct], and Harvard professor. He will be in 
charge of the study and planning of long-term measures for the 
in-depth reform of the Venezuelan economy. We believe that the 
government, through the economic institutions, must face the 
current situation, it must take immediate measures, it must look 
for ways to solve for Venezuela the difficult situation it is 
experiencing. We cannot be satisfied with this, we must look at 
the petroleum policy, at the economic policy in general, new 
horizons, new ways to mark the road for Venezuela toward the 
21st century that is at our doorstep. 
  Decentralization Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza, professor 
of Constitutional law; secretary of the commission that drew up 
the 1961 Constitution; adviser of the bicameral commission that 
presented the draft bill for the general reform of the 
Constitution in 1992. He is a man of great experience and 
authority on this subject. This subject is undoubtedly very 
sticky as we must find satisfactory solutions so that the 
coordination between the central government and the regional and 
municipal institutions is not broken. In this way these 
decentralization tendencies will be channeled positively toward 
what the people are demanding: the solution to their grave 
problems. 
  As youth minister: Sociologist Pilarica Iribarren de Romero. 
I have asked Pilarica to accept this task with the desire to 
have the presence of the younger generation felt at all times, 
through the national government's concerns and actions. I have 
perceived that the younger generation complained that during 
political campaigns they are praised and courted. Nevertheless, 
once the campaigns are over, once the elections are over, the 
government has so much to do, it has neither the time nor the 
willingness to take them into account. I have asked Pilarica 
Iribarren to take up this task and I am certain she will be 
successful. 
  I have appointed a state minister for higher education, 
science, and technology. This does not imply, if this is 
decided, that there cannot be a [word indistinct] director who 
of course would be under the direction of and with the 
representation of the state minister. [sentence as heard] The 
Education Ministry is undoubtedly too big. The work load the 
education minister has does not leave him time for anything 
else. The problems and the demands to find adequate solutions 
in higher education are very serious. This is why I have take 
this initiative. When I announced this decision to the 
presidents of the national universities, they were very pleased. 
That is, to appoint a state minister for higher education, 
linking him with science and technology so as not to increase 
excessively the number of ministers. The candidate chosen is 
Guido Hernan Arroyo, who was, I think, president of the Andres 
Bello Catholic University Andres Bello for 18 years. He solved 
many difficult situations there and he won the admiration and 
appreciation not only of the Catholic University community but 
also of the university community in general. 
  Special Minister Pompeyo Marquez, who has, according to what 
is provided for in the Constitution, the task of advising the 
president and assisting him in whatever duties with which he may 
be entrusted. I believe that Pompeyo will be a link between me 
and the political sector. At the same time he will take over 
enthusiastically, with the dedication for work that has always 
characterized him, a series of very important matters. For 
example, he has mentioned to me overhauling the national border 
council which has been very neglected lately; this would be 
dealt with. Another matter would be to find a way to stimulate 
small and medium industry, the handicraft industry, which can 
and should be a very important part of the solution to the 
economic and social problems of Venezuela. 
  Economist German Luis Soriano has been appointed president 
of the Tourism Corporation. I must say that I believe that 
tourism is one of the activities that we should immediately get 
involved in because that task, that sector has great 
possibilities of solving Venezuela's current deficit. German 
Luis Soriano is a very capable man, he has held important posts. 
He was vice president of Santa Maria University. He is a 
capable, intelligent, and enthusiastic person. I have also 
appointed him as a state minister to give the tourism industry 
all possible support from the Executive Branch. 
  Economist Abdon Vivas Teran has been appointed president of 
the Venezuelan Investment Fund. He is well-known in political 
and economic circles. 
  Alberto Poleto, 46, has been appointed to the Foreign Trade 
Institute. 
  Abdon Vivas Teran is another younger member of the 
government 
team. In this team I have insisted on achieving what I call 
generational gap solidarity as there are very important senior 
citizens who are still very active, there are also very young 
members in whose performance I have a great deal of hope. 
  I must explain that these presidents of institutions who are 
appointed state ministers do not represent for the state, for 
the national budget, any additional expense. While they are 
presidents of those institutions they do not need to have 
another or a special remuneration as state ministers. As state 
ministers, however, they are given the opportunity to attend the 
cabinet meetings. It may be said that the cabinet is quite 
large but if the sessions are conducted orderly and 
constructively, I believe there is no danger that these meetings 
will become boring and unfruitful. 
  Ricardo Conveias, appointed president of the Presidential 
Commission for State Reform, Copre, is currently president of 
the National Association of Constitutional Law professors. He 
is closely linked to this subject and he will undoubtedly give 
this matter of constitutional reform a high level of importance. 
  To conclude, I have appointed Asdrubal Aguiar Aranguren, 44, 
federal district governor. He is young but his life has been 
full of diverse activities; he has a great deal of ability, 
intelligence, and has a thorough understanding of the nation's 
problems. Currently, Asdrual is a member of the Inter-American 
Court for Human Rights. This undoubtedly promises that he will 
have the human rights problems and its surveillance present as 
governor. 
  I have kept my promise to the fans of the dramatic game 
between Caracas and Magallanes that will take place shortly in 
Valencia. I hope that the game will match the hopes and 
expectations of the public. I hope that the winner will also 
reward us by winning the Caribbean Series at Puerto La Cruz. 
Thank you and good night. [applause]

<F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Members of the executive cabinet of President-elect 
Rafael Caldera will work in coordination in order to reactivate 
the country's productive apparatus. Here is a report on the 
plans of the new ministers, to whom we wish lots of success. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] First, we will 
interview Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. What are 
your first measures going to be? 
  [Burelli] Work. 
  [Reporter] What are your plans? 
  [Burelli] Reinforce or restore Venezuela's image abroad, 
which has recently deteriorated. 
  [Enzo del Buffalo, nominee for chief of the Central Office 
of 
Coordination and Planning of the Presidency] We will try to 
conduct profound reforms in the basic industries and oil 
sectors. We will try to complement those reforms with policies 
consonant with the current circumstances in order to stabilize 
the foreign exchange rate, control inflation, and reduce fiscal 
deficits through austerity measures already announced. 
  [Rafael Angel Montero Revette, nominee for defense minister] 
We will review the Armed Forces plans and above all, we will 
reactivate and improve the Armed Forces social welfare plan. 
This includes the areas of health and housing, so our soldiers 
can live and work under better conditions. 
  [Abdon Vivas Teran, nominee for president of the Venezuelan 
Investment Fund] We will strengthen the privatization process. 
We will try to promote it on the basis of solid, technical, 
conceptual, and at the same time participative plans. We 
believe that participation will serve to increase the state's 
efficiency, distribute wealth, and make the productive apparatus 
more efficient. 
  [Ciro Anez Fonseca, nominee for agriculture and livestock 
minister] My priorities will be based on the president's 
interest to encourage productive sectors, particularly the 
agricultural sector, which has suffered difficulties during the 
past few years which we hope to resolve in the near future. 
  [German Luis Soriano, nominee for tourism minister] One of 
the most important activities in the country's economic 
development in the next few years will be developing tourism as 
an activity that not only will create new jobs but will also 
help develop important regions in the country that have been 
neglected in the past. 
  [Juan Nepomuceno Garrido, nominee for labor minister] The 
social welfare plan must be defined by the president of the 
Republic. So far we have not.... [pauses] I know his opinion 
and he knows mine, we both know what the country's current 
situation is. You can be sure that President Caldera will have 
in me a faithful, loyal minister, who is willing to work, follow 
his policies, and lead the country to a path of well-being. 
  [Ruben Creixems, nominee for justice minister] What was not 
done in 20 years cannot be done overnight. We must, however, 
work hard to attain our goals. 
  [Julio Sosa, nominee for finance minister] I believe 
balancing the budget is fundamental to curbing inflation, or at 
least reducing it to an acceptable level. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 31 Jan (AFP) -- General Moises Orozco 
Graterol took office today as commanding general of the 
Venezuelan Army, replacing Jorge Tagliaferro de Lima after 
President-elect Rafael Caldera's decision to remove the entire 
military High Command, military sources reported. 
  General Tagliaferro de Lima is the first member of the 
military High Command to leave his post. It is expected that the 
other members, including Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz will make their resignations official today or Tuesday. 
  After learning of Caldera's decision to remove them from 
their posts, the members of the High Command announced they 
would resign and request their retirement from the Armed Forces 
prior to the presidential inauguration on Wednesday. Caldera, a 
78-year-old Christian Democrat, should announce his new cabinet 
in the next few hours. Caldera will be in office from 1994 to 
1999. He had previously been president from 1969 to 1974.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Ramon Diaz] </F>
  [Text] Given the likelihood of changes in the military High 
Command once Rafael Caldera becomes president, all active 
generals and admirals of the National Armed Forces [FAN] agree 
that the new president should ratify the current commanders in 
their posts, headed by Defense Minister Admiral Radames Munoz 
Leon, in respect for seniority and merit. On 5 July all these 
general officers will retire as a result of time in service. 
Then the picture will change. 
  According to the military leaders, moving high command 
figures is a constitutional act and, furthermore, a prerogative 
of the president and commander in chief of the FAN. They added 
that relieving the general command posts and the defense 
minister is part of the normal military procedure. They added 
that this clearly shows the normal atmosphere reigning at 
military headquarters and confirms that such changes cause no 
disruptions in the business of state, as long as such changes 
are in accordance with current military regulations. If 
otherwise carried out, said changes might create an unnecessary 
crisis within the armed institutions. 
  One high-ranking Army officer pointed out that seniority -- 
which some politicians have tried to overcome so many times 
before and has recently been treated with very little respect -- 
still has its place within the FAN. 
  As we all know, the High Command and the commanding general 
officers of the Armed Forces are, firstly, Vice Admiral Radames 
Munoz, whose command post is at the Ministry of Defense; 
Division Generals Miguel Angel Andara Clavier and Ismael Antonio 
Guzman, inspector general and chief of the Joint General Staff 
of the FAN, respectively. 
  Commanding the services are Gen. Jorge Isaac Tagliafierro de 
Lima, the Army commander; Gen. Freddy Yanez Mendez, the Air 
Force commander; Gen. Pedro Romero Farias, of the National Guard 
(GN); and Vice Adm. Julian Mauco Quintana, the Navy commander. 
  The first three commanders are to retire on 5 July. They 
belong to the class of 1964, each in his own command academy. 
Munoz Leon is a graduate of the "Gran Mariscal Ayacucho"; the 
old Venezuelan Naval Academy in Maiquetia. As such, he -- like 
his fellow commanders -- will have completed 30 years of active 
service, according to the FAN Organic Law. 
  Regarding the commanding general officers of the individual 
forces, the oldest soldiers in the force are Army Commander 
Tagliafierro de Lima and Air Force Commander Yanez Mendez. 
These two officers also graduated from their forces' academies 
in 1964. Gen. Romero Farias (GN) and Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana 
(Navy), however, are still relatively new to active service. 
  Along this same line of thought, what would happen if 
President Caldera were to remove the current command staff and 
replace the defense minister with the young and brilliant Army 
Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, the current inspector general 
of the Army? In their words, "this would be the worst political 
decision the chief of state could make," although they are sure 
such a thing will never happen. Caldera, they say, is a 
seasoned public figure and statesman, and knows how the pieces 
move on the FAN chess board, to use a metaphor. They also 
believe that it would be even worse if the president were to 
decide to appoint one of the division generals -- such as Nestor 
Lara Estrano, the current director general of the Defense 
Ministry, Moises Orozco Graterol or Alberto Emerich Esquea 
Torres, the executive secretary of the National Security and 
Defense Council -- above Gen. Montero Revette. 
  In any case, the top commanders believe that if anyone 
"tries 
to get rid of Adm. Munoz Leon," which is the new president's 
prerogative, the logical thing would be to appoint Andara 
Clavier (Air Force), the current inspector general of the FAN, 
as new defense minister until 5 July. Then Army Gen. Guzman, 
chief of the FAN Joint General Staff, would replace Andara in 
normal rotation. Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana, commander of the 
Navy, would replace Guzman. 
  There are other formulas that they call "logical," but the 
wisest thing for President Caldera to do is reaffirm Munoz in 
his post until next 5 July, even though he is the supreme 
commander in the end. 
  Munoz Leon, who would seem to be the president's current 
"target," would not mind going home. He thinks that command 
rotation is necessary, now more than ever, in times of crisis. 
  There is a generation eager to work, to continue with the 
preset plans and carry out the ideas they have been kneading all 
their lives. It is the FAN's rotation policy at the minister of 
defense's office and the reverence for seniority that has 
honored the institution and has been a source of hope for the 
military command component. It has been an effective mechanism 
to prevent one force from prevailing over the other and the 
difficulties such a situation would entail. 
  In summary, for the members of the military High Command, 
balance is the important thing in delegating the various Defense 
Ministry posts. That is, that no single force should have an 
advantage over the others and the men be place in accordance 
with their skills and qualifications and, above all, their 
ability to render the best possible service to the FAN, with the 
desire to equally distribute the missions to be accomplished.

  [Text] Violent student demonstrations continued in the 
Caracas metropolitan area yesterday, although the actions were 
limited to spilling trash on the streets to block traffic around 
several educational centers. In an incident related to the 
disturbances, however, an elderly lady suffered a heart attack 
and died. According to a Military Police source, the incident 
occurred at Dos Caminos subway station, where secondary school 
students sought refuge while fleeing from police after 
participating in a protest. As the result of the nervousness 
caused by the students' arrival, the woman, some 70 years old, 
suffered a heart attack and, although paramedics at the subway 
station gave her first aid assistance, she died shortly 
thereafter. 
  The disturbances occurred at the Rafael Urdaneta and Santos 
Michelena Secondary Schools early in the morning. Both schools 
were vacated and the Military Police forced the students to 
scatter. Some of them, however, put garbage bags on the pavement 
and set them on fire. Similar protests were staged in front of 
the Carlos Soublette Secondary School, located in the San 
Bernardino neighborhood, where Special Brigade members helped 
restore order. 
  In Sucre, students from several secondary schools started a 
march. When they were dispersed by the police, however, they 
sought refuge in the subway stations, where the elderly woman's 
death occurred. Traffic was interrupted near the Andres Bello 
School on Mexico Avenue, Gustavo Herrera School on Libertador 
Avenue in Chacao, and in front of the Caracas Instituto 
Pedagogico, located on Paez Avenue in El Paraiso. At all of 
these places, students placed garbage and obstacles in the 
street while the police cordoned off the areas to prevent an 
aggravation of the situation. In the afternoon, hooded 
individuals from Ciudad University tried to commandeer a cargo 
vehicle, but police thwarted the attempt. Later, the same hooded 
men confronted police in the Tres Gracias sector. 
  [Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish on page D-12 of its 28 
January edition publishes a related 800-word report that adds 
that hooded individuals who infiltrated student demonstrations 
set three trucks on fire near the Central University of 
Venezuela in Maracay and near the Technological University in La 
Victoria. The report says the students were protesting the 
arrest of Juan Valladares, a young worker and student at the 
Libertador Pedagogical University in Maracay. The newspaper 
also reports that Mario Popoli, third judge for preliminary 
investigations on crime, has ordered an expeditious 
investigation because six trucks have been looted and set on 
fire in less than a week.]

  [Text] The Government of Venezuela yesterday informed the 
contracting parties of GATT of a formal appeal for consultation 
that, within the framework of the procedures for settling 
differences within that organization, it presented recently to 
the U.S. Government concerning improved gasoline [gasolina 
reformulada]. 
  Such consultation is specifically related to the 
"Regulations 
on Fuels and Fuel Additives -- Rules for Improved and 
Conventional Gasoline," which the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency adopted last 15 December. For Venezuela, this regulation 
clearly violates GATT provisions, because it places controls on 
imported gasoline different from those placed on U.S. gasoline. 
  By bringing this issue up with GATT, Miguel Rodriguez 
Mendoza, minister-president of the Foreign Trade Institute 
[ICE], explained that this is "a matter of great importance for 
Venezuela and a matter that requires special attention because, 
once more, we are faced with the use of environmental 
regulations with disguised protectionist intentions." 
  Meanwhile, Rodriguez noted the discriminatory character of 
the aforementioned regulation and the adverse effects it will 
have on the export of improved gasoline to the U.S. market. 
  According to preliminary estimates, approximately 50 percent 
of the export volume of Venezuelan improved gasoline will be 
affected by that measure, causing an economic impact for 
Venezuela to the tune of $150 million over a two-year period. 
  Rodriguez also referred to the modernization program of 
Venezuelan refining plants that the national petroleum industry 
has undertaken with a view to adjusting to the new environmental 
demands, which contemplates investments of over $1 billion. 
  The ICE president presented the aforementioned petition to 
the 49th Session of GATT Contracting Parties, the highest body 
of that organization held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 and 26 
January. According to GATT procedures, consultation must begin 
by 14 February at the latest, namely 30 days after the request 
is presented. Additionally, there is a 60-day term for 
processing said request. 
  The statements by Rodriguez regarding the ties between trade 
and the ecology were also addressed by B.K. Zutshi of India, 
president of the meeting, who in his opening speech warned of 
the need to prevent the conservation of the environment from 
becoming a new form of commercial protectionism.

  [Text] The Central Bank Board of Directors met on Sunday 
and approved a general assistance program for the national 
banking system. Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva -- who 
held talks with Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy yesterday 
-- made this announcement. 
  Although he did not explain the type of measures involved in 
the implementation of this program, he said that they are joint 
efforts by the Central Bank, the Deposit Guarantee Fund 
(FOGADE), and commercial banks. 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that liquidity will be injected into 
the financial system? 
  [Silva] Obviously, because I do not think that withdrawals 
are being made at this time. 
  The minister said he did not know the quantity of resources 
to be made available for this plan. He also denied knowledge of 
the possibility that the government, through FOGADE, will 
capitalize Banco Latino stocks, which is one of the options 
under study. 
  Asked about the exact date when Banco Latino will reopen its 
doors and start returning their money to depositors, he noted 
that matters concerning Banco Latino were already entrusted to a 
board of auditors [Junta Interventora] on Friday. This board is 
made up of Julio Santodomingo, Hernan Oyarzabal, and Tesalio 
Cardenas. 
  The board of auditors is the top authority in handling that 
institution, Silva said. He added: I understand that they are 
assessing the patrimonial status of the bank in order to make a 
decision. 
  The finance minister was also asked about the decree that 
suspended the Value-Added Tax (VAT) and he replied: "Let's not 
talk about that." 
  However, it was learned that the decree in question has not 
been published in the official gazette because of the legal 
difficulties that would result from suspending a law by decree, 
a decree that was not approved by the Attorney General's Office 
and the finance minister who will not sign the decree.

  [Text] Everything here is calm in terms of the 
referendum--except for an almost total abstentionism. There are 
16 booths located in this municipality, and a few moments ago 
there were tables where nobody had gone to vote. It may be due 
to the fact the media's power of persuasion was not effective. 
  The teachers of Peten held a general meeting on 28 January 
and decided to urge the rest of the people not to vote. The 
teachers issued a communique, which states at the end: The 
teachers urge the citizens in general not to be deceived by the 
publicity campaign to vote yes or no in the upcoming referendum. 
Do not go vote in the referendum. This was one of the 
arguments raised by the teachers to El Peten residents. 
  The few individuals who have gone to vote are Indians. They 
were trucked into Poptun Municipality. We had the opportunity 
to listen to Benedicto Lucas, municipal mayor, who spoke in 
dialect to those who arrived, telling them to vote yes, because 
that was the thing to do. Everything has taken place normally. 
Only the UCN [Union of the National Center] installed its 
delegates but no other delegate at the polling booths. We will 
report on what is taking place throughout the rest of the 
department during the remainder of the day.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] suspended for a few hours the vote 
count of yesterday's referendum after 85.7 percent of the votes 
cast had been tallied and the "yes-vote" had received 67.6 
percent, with an abstention rate of 83.9 percent. 
  The TSE announced at 0100 (0700 GMT) that it would not 
provide further information for several hours, because "most" of 
the votes had been tallied, and only 843 out of 5,897 polling 
stations had not been counted. 
  According to this latest official report, which politicians 
and authorities have recognized as practically unequivocal, the 
negative votes added up to 12.95 percent, with null or blank 
votes at 19.3 percent. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said he 
was satisfied with the "yes" victory and downplayed the 
abstention, although he admitted it was "worrisome." 
  The 43 approved amendments make it possible to hold 
anticipated elections this year to name a new Congress and 
Supreme Court, two branches that de Leon has wanted to purge due 
to the charges of corruption that were leveled against those 
institutions. Unexplained bomb attacks that had begun in the 
past few weeks continued on voting day. Two devices exploded in 
Guatemala City, and the police defused three others.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Sunday's 
constitutional referendum reforms package was approved by yes 
votes totaling 67.65 percent, although there was an abstention 
rate of 83.9 percent, according to preliminary figures disclosed 
after midnight last night. 
  A total of 3,439,405 Guatemalans cast their votes on 30 
January to approve or reject 37 articles of the Constitution. 
Among other things, the reforms shorten the legislative and 
presidential terms and restructure Congress and the Supreme 
Court of Justice. 
  After accounting for the votes cast in 280 of the country's 
330 municipalities, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] 
confirmed early today that barely 16.01 percent of registered 
voters had participated in the referendum. 
  After the preliminary results were released, President 
Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio, during a news conference held at TSE's 
computation center, called for a "national agreement" to 
overcome the country's political, economic, and social crisis. 
De Leon admitted the results indicate an exhaustion of the 
democratic system, which demands from political, 
entrepreneurial, union, and popular sectors, as well as the 
Church, greater responsibility and participation in the 
country's leadership. 
  Hours earlier, before arriving at the TSE, de Leon expressed 
his satisfaction over the yes vote's "triumph" and said, albeit 
minimum, this result was an expression of the people's will and 
must be respected. 
  According to the TSE, 5,054 polling sites had reported, and 
843 were pending at 0100 (0700 GMT). The reported 5,054 sites 
had produced 319,550 yes votes, 61,212 no votes, 84,820 void 
votes, and 6,768 blank votes. 
  Electoral authorities said the results of all polling sites 
will be reported in a few hours, because the votes of many 
distant villages with scant communications have yet to be 
accounted for. 
  Speaking to the press at 0030 (0630 GMT), de Leon demanded 
the establishment of a "Governability Pact" to overcome the 
country's serious backwardness. He urged the guerrillas to sign 
peace to make it possible for the country to move forward. The 
president pledged to sign peace with the rebel National 
Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity [URNG], establish economic and 
social peace, and launch a moral "bloodless" revolution. 
  De Leon Carpio stated that henceforth Guatemala will begin 
to 
march on the path of stability and governability, after pledging 
to strongly promote economic plans and security measures. 
  The head of state affirmed the referendum met the Guatemalan 
people's expectations, but he expressed regret over the high 
rate of abstention, something that must be of concern to the 
political parties, he said. He reiterated, however, that 
"regardless of the result, democracy is getting stronger." 
  Regarding the possibility that the Social Multisector Forum 
(Foro Multisectorial), which represents unions, mass, and 
business groups, may challenge the vote result, de Leon warned 
it is uncalled for, because the law does not demand a percentage 
in the referendum. 
  Sunday's voting took place under a tense climate due to 
terrorist threats and bomb explosions, as well as due to the 
rejection of political and social organizations that urged the 
people to vote "No" or cast a blank vote. 
  Upon arriving at the TSE last night, the president admitted 
voter abstention "happens everywhere in the world," but he 
attributed the low turnout to last week's attacks,. 
  With the approval of the amendments, the term of the 
president and the Legislative Branch is cut from five to four 
years, and the Supreme Court term from six to five years. The 
president's confidential expenditure and the shared vice 
president's responsibility in the president's activities will be 
eliminated. The amendments ban the Monetary Board, the 
regulator of the economy, from authorizing the Bank of Guatemala 
from finance state, decentralized, autonomous, and private 
nonfinancial entities. Budget allocations for the country's 333 
municipalities went from 8 percent to 10 percent of fiscal 
revenues. 
  The government's ability to transfer funds from its 
investment programs to its operations plans or to repay the 
public debt will be eliminated. In addition, extraordinary 
expenses related to the national budget will be suppressed. 
  Concerning the Judicial Branch, the Supreme Court of Justice 
will consist of 13 magistrates instead of the current nine, and 
this institutions' practice of nominating its own candidates to 
magistrate positions will be annulled. 
  The District Attorney's Office (MP) will no longer represent 
the state, which from now on will be represented by the Attorney 
General's Office. In addition, the Guatemalan Prosecutor 
General's Office is created. 
  The legislative reforms are expected to become effective 
within 60 days; fifteen days afterward the TSE will summon 
elections to renew the current Congress within a 120-day period. 
  Newly elected deputies will be sworn in one month after the 
elections and will replace the current deputies whose term was 
scheduled to concluded on 14 January 1996, the date when the 
congressmen elected during the 1995 general elections were 
slated to take over. 
  Eighteen months after the new reforms have entered into 
effect, the president must forward a bill to Congress aimed at 
modernizing the government system. 
  Congress, in turn, will determine the mechanisms to modify 
the Comptroller General's Office, the District Attorney's 
Office, and the Supreme Court of Justice. 
  Sunday's referendum, which entailed a $2-million 
expenditure, 
was held under strict security and military patrols, and public 
transportation was halted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio </F>
by unidentified reporter at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
facility at the Industrial Park in Guatemala City; from the 
"Telepress" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. De Leon, do you believe the 
country's institutional problem has been resolved with the 
victory of the yes vote? 
  [De Leon] I think the yes vote has resolved the 
institutional 
problem we had been experiencing since 25 May. The very fact 
that a popular consultation was held is an advantage for the 
Guatemalan people. The very fact that it happened in spite of 
the obstacles [word indistinct] and terrorist acts consolidates 
the process, because in the eyes of the Guatemalan people and 
the world, we resolved a problem that had existed since 25 May 
through peaceful, constitutional, and democratic means. What 
events? The people wanted a purge, and with the victory of the 
yes vote over the no vote, they managed to purge three branches 
of state. The deputies will go and there will be a new Congress 
and a new constitution. Therefore, the branches of state will be 
reorganized. 
  But to answer your question, I say yes, the institutional 
problem has been resolved because there was an impasse. The 
solution came late, because the people wanted this situation to 
be resolved earlier. But today the Guatemalan people can have 
peace of mind because we have turned this page of Guatemala's 
history and we can now deal with profound issues such as the 
country's economic and social problems. 
  [Reporter] Did the abstention say anything to you? 
  [De Leon] Yes, of course. First I must point out that 
today's electoral event was marked by some very special 
characteristics that led to abstention. I am not making 
excuses, but the situation must be examined. This was a very 
special, unprecedented event in Guatemala. From the electoral 
standpoint, no local authorities were being elected. Residents 
of municipalities, for example, are interested in electing their 
mayors, deputies, and president. In this election they were 
voting for something that was not clearly understood by 
everyone. There was a lot of confusion, misinformation, or a 
shortage of information. In other words, the circumstances 
surrounding the event were adverse. If we couple that with the 
terrorism, blackmail, and numerous obstacles confronted by the 
voters, abstention was to be expected. In any electoral event 
anywhere in the world, abstention is natural and was to be 
expected in Guatemala. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan people 
should acknowledge the high rate of abstention and should be 
concerned about it because, in my opinion, it shows that the 
democratic system is somewhat exhausted. 
  [Reporter] Do you dismiss the possibility that it was a form 
of protest against the format of the consultation? 
  [De Leon] I do not think it was precisely against the format 
of the consultation. I tend to think that on one hand it shows 
the Guatemalan people's exhaustion, and on the other their 
rejection of the (?democratic) system. The Guatemalan people 
are tired and indifferent, and that is dangerous. That is why I 
say we should all be concerned about the democratic system's 
failure to give the people the answers they wanted. We have had 
this system since 1986 when the first constitutional period 
began following a constituent assembly, and Guatemalans still 
have not seen an improvement in the situation. On the contrary, 
in some ways the situation has grown worse. Herein lies the 
danger, and that is why I believe we should be concerned over 
today's abstention rate. We must think about the congressional 
elections that will be coming up within five months and the 
general elections within a year. I don't think we should have 
such a high abstention rate. 
  [Reporter] From now on, taking for granted the victory of 
the yes vote, of course, do you believe the deadlines 
established in the reforms will be respected? 
  [De Leon] Of course. They must be. First, Article 33 of 
the constitutional reforms states that the reforms will go into 
effect 60 days after being confirmed by a popular consultation. 
  These measures correspond to the government agenda for 1994 
and 1995, the present circumstances, and the government policy 
to meet the goals proposed for 1994 and 1995. I cannot give 
details ahead of schedule, but I can say that they are of a 
monetary, fiscal, political, and economic nature. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] enjoys full 
credibility. It is about the only institution enjoying the full 
faith of the Guatemalan people and the international community. 
The TSE does its duty. The constitutional reforms will go into 
effect 60 days after the referendum. The TSE then has 120 days 
to convoke congressional elections; that is, the TSE could hold 
the elections for a new congress around 30 July. All the 
executive has to do is enforce the law and defend the Guatemalan 
people's interests. But the law cannot be mocked. The 
Guatemalan people know about the TSE's principles and commitment 
to duty and that the TSE will do what it must within the 
deadline. I don't think we have any reason to worry about this. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] In the first place, it is their right to use any 
legal instrument or resource and to take any actions to oppose 
the event for this or any other reason. I can tell you in 
advance, however, that such a move does not stand a chance 
because the law is very clear. Approval does not require a 
specific and greater percentage. This was a relative majority. 
The yes vote won over the no vote by approximately 100 to one. 
There is no doubt. The high abstention rate is the 
responsibility of those who did not cast their votes. Those who 
did represented the rest, therefore there can bae no challenge 
from a legal viewpoint.

<F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon </F>
Carpio with unidentified reporters at the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal facility at the Industrial Park in Guatemala City; from 
the "Telepress" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] Regarding the results, as I said a moment ago, 
results are what matter in politics. Here the results are that 
the yes vote won over the no vote; that is what matters. What 
is worrisome, not just for the government but for the entire 
country, is the high abstention rate. We must strengthen the 
political parties system through a purge and a reorganization. 
We must think about this situation because it means that 
somehow the system may be exhausted or that many Guatemalans may 
feel that it is. 
  However, we must also take into consideration the fact that 
the consultation was an unprecedented electoral event marked by 
a number of very special situations. No local authorities were 
elected. Voters usually pay more attention when they are 
electing a mayor, deputy, president, or vice president. Added 
to this are the vicissitudes that preceded today's electoral 
event as well as the terrorist incidents the day before the 
consultation. Abstention exists in Guatemala and anywhere there 
is an electoral event, but in this case it was rather justified. 
  Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the abstention rate 
was too high. We should all be concerned about this because, in 
my opinion, it is either a sign of exhaustion in the democratic 
system or of the Guatemalan people's desperation because they 
have yet to see any positive results since 1986, when the 
democratic process in Guatemala began with a number of problems 
and attempts to disrupt institutional order, and the actual 
disruption of that institutional order on 25 May. 
  So we should be concerned. Every leader, every person who 
represents some level of power should take action so in five 
months the congressional elections will not see such a high rate 
of abstention, much less the general elections to be held within 
the year. It would be even more serious if that were to happen 
in a general election. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] The people's clamor began with the 25 May events. 
We managed to meet some of their demands by purging the 
executive branch and appointing a new president, vice president, 
and ministers. We are still working on the purge. Much remains 
to be done. We are still making changes and we are about to 
finish the process. However, the Guatemalan people are not 
satisfied with that and they are demanding that the president 
purge the two other branches of state. We have been discussing 
this for almost eight months. 
  The president of the Republic has implemented legal, 
democratic mechanisms, being the eminently democratic president 
that he is. During the initial phase he asked the branches of 
state to conduct a self-purge and demanded the resignations of 
deputies and justices, but those resignations were not 
forthcoming. In view of this initial failure, the president 
introduced the second phase by calling for a popular 
consultation. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal determined that it 
would be held on 28 November. The months went by and, of 
course, the people encountered other problems and concerns. 
Although they continued to make demands, they became justifiably 
desperate. 
  The Constitutionality Court interrupted and suspended the 
popular consultation in a decision with which I did not at all 
agree but which I had to uphold because ours is a de jure 
system. In response to the crisis that was already emerging, 
the Court reached an agreement that has been criticized but 
which, in the opinion of the president of the Republic, 
constituted an effort by the state to prevent an even greater 
crisis. We reached an agreement which, in the end, led to the 
same goals: a purge, reorganization, and the departure of the 
deputies, albeit not as quickly as the people wanted, but their 
departure nevertheless, which was decided today by the 
Guatemalan people. 
  Meanwhile, the time that passed -- and this is my opinion, 
because a much more thorough examination must be conducted -- 
led to the people's disillusionment and to the lack of 
enthusiasm that existed at the outset. In response to the 
conclusions, the misinformation, and the lack of information, 
the people had to cope with a very confusing consultation. This 
can happen anywhere, and in this case it happened in a country 
where there is no deeply rooted democratic or civic culture. On 
the contrary, we are just now establishing such a culture, and I 
think that is why we have seen this change. That is why we have 
seen such a high percentage of abstention. However, that does 
not mean that the people who did not vote did not want the 
deputies to go. You can rest assured that their intentions are 
the same, but the circumstances surrounding the consultation, 
the formal part of it, may have prevented a massive turnout for 
the elections. That is my opinion. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] That will be revealed when the measures are 
adopted. If I reveal them now, they will not make an impact. 
  In other words, within 60 days the reforms will be part of 
the Constitution, and within 120 days there will be a call to 
elect the new Congress. 
  [Reporter] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] president 
said that 120 days was the minimum term, not that the call had 
to be made within the 120 days. 
  [De Leon] It is the minimum, but according to what has been 
discussed and according to what must be done, it means that once 
the constitutional reforms go into effective, there is no reason 
not to issue the summons. Elections for Congress will come 120 
days later. There should be no reason for the TSE not to obey 
the summons the Constitution must make during a minimum term of 
120 days. What is not allowed is to issue a summons prior to 
120 days. We can assume it will be after 120 or 121 days; in 
other words, another four months. 
  [Reporter] What would your position be toward possible 
delays 
by members of Congress or other organizations that might set 
back this timeframe? 
  [De Leon] This will not take place at a political party 
level 
or at an institutional level. There is an agenda, a commitment, 
an agreement that includes electoral and political party 
reforms, which must begin to be drafted next week. The same 
holds true for the (?in-house) rules. There could be several 
individual deputies who may try and stall things. My position 
has nothing to do with justice tribunals. Instead, it will be 
dealt with by the appropriate authorities. In view of the way 
the vote took place -- this I say as a lawyer, not as president 
-- I do not think there is room for any sort of legal challenge. 
However, any deputy could do so. 
  [Reporter] Would you say we will have a new Congress this 
year? 
  [De Leon] Definitely. A new Congress must be installed this 
year. Otherwise it would be another blow to the Guatemalan 
people, which I would say is dangerous -- more dangerous than 
what we just spoke about. The Guatemalan people have been very 
patient, but there are limits. You can't play around with the 
people. The people should feel satisfied from today that they 
have achieved their objectives and their petitions have been 
resolved or will be resolved in a matter of months. There 
cannot be any more playing around with the people. 
  [Reporter] Some deputies plan to and have even issued 
communiques saying that they plan to lodge appeals of 
unconstitutionality, especially regarding the article that deals 
with cutting their mandate. Do you think that is possible? Do 
you think this could set everything back? 
  [De Leon] I sincerely do not think so. There is no legal 
basis for this, and there have already been legal studies of the 
issue. Politically speaking, if some legal entity dared to issue 
a ruling, I don't know what would happen in Guatemala. Only 
time will tell what will happen if someone wants to take this 
risk. I do not think there is a legal entity that would dare. 
Anyway, it has no legal basis. 
  [Reporter] How will you work with Congress from now until 
the 
end of their term? 
  [De Leon] Considering all that has taken place since I 
became president, I think there has to be an interrelationship 
of tasks between the three government branches. There has to be 
an interrelationship because the state's goals are the same. 
There is only one state, therefore everyone must have the 
necessary awareness and maturity to do their jobs until the end 
of their term. They have a legislative agenda. I think they 
are aware of this and will try to recover their lost prestige, 
improve their image a bit, and carry out their legislative work. 
In my case, it means achieving goals and fulfilling the 
government plan with the available funds and with the 
decisionmaking authority that I must have. 
  [Reporter] What about the relationship? 
  [De Leon] The relationship must be an interrelationship. It 
might be nothing more, but it cannot be anything less. 
  [Reporter] Some of them [not further identified], including 
a 
political leader who is involved in one of these organizations 
involved in the reform process, spoke about a governability 
pact. Would you enter any sort of governability pact with these 
people? 
  [De Leon] I think the governability pact should involve all 
sectors of Guatemalan society. In this sense, of course, it is 
the duty of the president, who, according to the Constitution, 
represents national unity. 
  Now is the moment to reach agreements -- agreements between 
the various sectors that make up Guatemalan society, but most 
especially a great national agreement. We are working precisely 
to attain these great agreements that allow a governability 
pact, which is essential to a transition government such as this 
one. It is essential in order to survive until the next 
administration which will have long-term plans or at least 
medium-term plans and which could have a much more favorable 
environment than the one I had to deal with when I became 
president. 
  [Reporter] Much criticism was leveled on the talks between 
the Legislative and Executive Branches, which resulted precisely 
in the constitutional reforms. Aren't you afraid that speaking 
at this moment of a governability pact could be seen as a new 
pact with these people? 
  [De Leon] That is why I mentioned a great national 
agreement. 
When I speak of a great national agreement I refer mostly to the 
first stage, which should be the country's productive sector -- 
capital and labor, entrepreneurs and workers -- and start there. 
When I speak of entrepreneurs and workers, I also refer to the 
public sector: help restructure the public sector and hold 
dialogues to attain efficiency in the public sector, attain 
reduction, even attain salary increases, but not through a 
larger payroll, rather by restructuring the public sector. In 
the case of the private sector: reach agreements between 
entrepreneurs and workers that will give the government time to 
take up the measures it needs to take. Afterward, the months 
will pass and with a new Congress and a restructured state 
within certain government organizations, then we can possibly 
involve the political sector to avoid precisely what worries you. 
  Mind you, before this takes place I believe there should be 
an understanding, I repeat the term once again, an interrelation 
of tasks between both branches of government that will allow 
Congress to develop a legislative agenda and carry out its work.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Despite voter 
abstentionism bordering 83 percent, Guatemalan President Ramiro 
de Leon expressed his "satisfaction" with the "yes" victory of 
today's constitutional referendum. 
  Nevertheless, in statements to the media, de Leon 
acknowledged that the "yes" victory--which garnered 84 percent 
of the votes when only 51.5 percent of the total votes have been 
tallied--did not reach the expected magnitude. 
  "In politics, what really matters, however, are final 
results," the president said, downplaying the 82.8-percent 
abstentionism evidenced by preliminary Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal [TSE] results. 
  "The Guatemalan citizen voted and represented those who 
decided not to vote," the president said. 
  The head of state attributed low voter turnout to the 
peculiarities of the referendum as well as to fears of possible 
terrorist attacks, such as ones the that occurred today and in 
the previous weeks during which dozens of bombs exploded, 
killing one, injuring 18, and causing numerous property damage, 
especially to the country's electrical system. 
  De Leon said in 60 days the reforms will become effective, 
and afterward the country's Supreme Court magistrates and 
deputies will have to resign. Last year, the president went 
through a power struggle with Supreme Court magistrates and 
deputies when he attempted to purge both institutions due to 
charges of corruption. 
  The president believes today's referendum marks a new page 
in 
the country's history, and he announced that once the 
Legislative and Judicial Branch problems were solved, he will be 
able to direct his efforts to the struggle against corruption 
and impunity. Both the Legislative and Judicial Branch will be 
changed once general elections, which have been rescheduled for 
an earlier date as contemplated in the constitutional reforms, 
takes place.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal (TSE) today confirmed victory for the "yes" 
vote in Sunday's referendum with 83.95 percent of the votes cast 
by 15.87 percent of Guatemalan voters. 
  When the count was finished in the 5,897 polling stations in 
330 municipalities, the TSE confirmed high abstentionism which 
reached 84.13 percent in the referendum on 30 [number as 
received] constitutional reforms. There were 370,044 "yes" 
votes; 70,761 "no" votes; 97,107 annulled ballots; and 7,982 
blank ballots. Of the ballots that were to be handed out to 3.4 
million Guatemalans eligible to vote, 2,890,533 were not used. 
  The results confirmed the predictions of political analysts 
about the people's indifference to the referendum, which favored 
the "yes" vote. 
  The TSE indicated that Sunday's abstentionism was the 
highest 
ever in any general election or referendum in this country, 
whose history is marked by dictatorial regimes and traditional 
electoral apathy.

<F P=106> [From the "Teleprensa" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said today 
Guatemala's aspirations at the next UN Human Rights Commission 
meeting are not limited to being transferred from one category 
to the other among the nations that are a matter of concern to 
the international community on this issue [sentence as heard]; 
on the contrary, according to the Guatemalan president, 
Guatemala seeks to be included among the nations that do fully 
respect human rights. 
  The president's statements were made after he was asked to 
give his opinion on the report presented yesterday to Congress 
by Jorge Mario Garcia La Guardia, the human rights ombudsman. 
De Leon Carpio answered reporters questions shortly after 
swearing in Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, the new foreign minister 
who replaces Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. Here is what President 
de Leon Carpio said: 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon Carpio] I am very pleased with 
this report, particularly regarding the right to life, which is 
a fundamental right. I have been unable to read it all, but, 
according to the comments I have read in the press and the 
document that I have--although I have been unable to read it 
all--there is a marked disagreement in the number of 
extrajudicial deaths, in the number of missing individuals, in 
the number of illegal arrests. Even though it has been 
spotlighted that there are more violations--that is, more 
accusations, 13,000 as opposed to 9,000 last year--half of the 
year or seven months correspond to the current government. As 
far as the numbers are concerned, I am satisfied. 
  I can say sincerely that I am satisfied that the most 
credible institution--the institution that within the state is 
in charge of the defense, protection, and fostering of human 
rights--has issued a report in which although reality has been 
highlighted, it demonstrates progress; it demonstrates effort in 
these first seven months of my government. 
  The numbers, as I said, are very satisfying. True, there are 
still serious problems with individual human rights; there are 
multiple accusations of human rights abuse, of violations of 
human economic, social, and cultural rights. Nevertheless, the 
current government does not want to be satisfied with the fact 
that out of those thousands of accusations, a lesser number of 
violations were proven regarding the previous year. 
  The current government has the political willingness for the 
nonviolation of human rights in Guatemala; this is considering 
the qualitative side of human rights. At this phase and given 
that the former human rights ombudsman is now the president of 
the Republic, we cannot be satisfied that quantitatively we are 
better off than last year. Now is the time to consider the 
issue qualitatively. One cannot say human rights are being 
violated more or less; this is why we must prepare the necessary 
measures this year, after having consolidated the nation's 
institutions, after having consolidated the democratic system, 
which is still fragile. Nevertheless, we have made great 
progress. 
  For example, one of these is the return of Communities of 
Resistance People under commissions that will be made public to 
you subsequently. Another example is the peace agreement that 
will be signed this year, in keeping with the framework 
agreement signed in Mexico. In this agreement both parties have 
agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. This demonstrates 
the political willingness that has to be made reality. We must 
eliminate the main source, something I always mentioned as human 
rights ombudsman; that is, the internal armed conflict which has 
been ongoing for more than 30 years. Once this armed conflict 
ends this year, fulfilling our commitment, the main cause, the 
main source of human rights violations will disappear. This is 
particularly true of the violations of the right to life, 
integrity, physical integrity, dignity, liberty, security and so 
on; therefore, there is progress. 
  Yesterday you witnessed the fulfillment of another 
commitment: the departure of the military detachment from Tercer 
Pueblo. They departed from the urban area, leaving it for those 
who returned after being refugees for so many years in Mexico; 
that is, we are progressing, fulfilling our commitments. This 
does not mean we are not objective, that we do not accept the 
reality that exists in Guatemala. 
  I reiterate: I am pleased with the report. We will analyze 
the report, read it more carefully; nevertheless, in principle, 
given the quantitative data, we are satisfied. This does not 
mean we do not have to initiate many actions and efforts so that 
Guatemala is not only analyzed if human rights are respected 
more or less here. Qualitatively, the situation should reach a 
level of absolute respect; this respect first should be of 
individual human rights, followed by the respect of economic, 
social, and cultural human rights. This is more difficult and 
does not depend totally on the government's political 
willingness, as their violations are the result of legal, 
political, economic, and social structures that have prevented 
the respect of these human rights. 
  Meanwhile, I want to say that now that the study and 
analysis 
of Guatemala by the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva is 
drawing near, our goal is for Guatemala not to moved from one 
point to the other on the agenda. Our goal is for Guatemala to 
be considered as a nation where human rights are going to be 
fully respected. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The report, it appears, has asked 
for 
or requested the dissolution of the Self-Defense Patrols. What 
is your position? 
  [De Leon Carpio] This has a great advantage. In practice we 
are already doing this. In those areas in which these are no 
longer required--that is, the self defense committees or 
patrols--they have been converted into peace and development 
committees. Given their organization, once they do not have to 
have weapons, it is convenient, if they wish, to continue 
organizing, developing, and helping the community. This is part 
of what is being done this year, and I have issued orders in 
this regard. We will make public the number of patrols that 
have already been turned into peace and development councils; 
subsequently, this will continue to take place. In addition, 
there is the advantage, or we have the advantage, of the 
resumption of peace talks, where the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity and my government will definitely broach 
this issue. Given the commitment we have to sign peace this 
year, at this time there will have to be a demobilization, a 
disarmament of all the patrols that could still exist at that 
time. 
  You will recall that in Huehuetenango a leader of the 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols handed me a rifle that meant, in 
his words, that the moment the peace agreements are signed, he, 
in a symbolic gesture, would hand me the rifle because it meant 
there was no longer a need for them to be armed. 
  In the meantime, following recommendations not only by the 
human rights ombudsman, but by the independent UN expert adviser 
Dr. Monica Pinto, we have instructed that the full force of the 
law be used in cases where patrolmen break the law or abuse 
power through the patrols and that impunity not be encouraged or 
made easy, which is often the case with these types of abuses 
committed by certain patrolmen. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [De Leon Carpio] I appreciate the question because right 
here 
I have a note from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] 
requesting that the president of the Republic give Monday off 
because many public employees are working at the polling tables. 
It also allows many public employees who do not vote here, but 
in other municipalities instead, to cast their ballot. 
Regarding this, the presidency secretary general has sent the 
TSE a reply note to that request and suggestion. Not only will 
special permission be granted for Monday for those who work at 
the polling tables, but for all public workers. This will 
facilitate the comfortable move without problems, to their 
respective municipalities on Monday, in addition to celebrating 
the yes vote. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] that you have been in direct 
contact with President Salinas. We want to know if there has 
been an official communication; if the Guatemalan Government has 
offered military help, in this case [words indistinct] in 
Chiapas? 
  [De Leon Carpio] The relationship between President Salinas 
de Gortari and myself has always been very direct. This 
situation was strengthened even more at the meeting we held in 
Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, at the Ibero-American presidential 
summit. Given the situation the Guatemalan, sorry, the Mexican 
people are suffering, I immediately contacted him to express my 
solidarity, to express through him to the Mexican people, the 
Guatemalan people and their government's grief. We know about 
this because we have been suffering these consequences for more 
than 30 years and we believe it is regrettable and unfair that 
the Mexican people now must endure the consequences of an 
insurgent force, of an armed conflict that only leaves behind 
widows, orphans, destruction, death, desolation, hate, and 
hostilities. We think it is unfair that the Mexican people 
should endure this, as in the end it is the people who suffer 
the greatest consequences. Therefore, we have been in contact; 
we have indicated to him that we have full faith in his 
capacity, we have faith in his government's ability. 
  We hope that shortly, through dialogue and measures taken by 
the government, those who have mistakenly taken up arms will 
reconsider their position and realize that road is obsolete 
here, in Mexico, and in any part of the world. The road for 
changes, the peaceful, silent revolution, is that of the 
struggle, although no longer between brothers. Rather, now it 
is the struggle against corruption, the struggle against 
poverty, the struggle for economic and social development, and 
the struggle for an overall peace with social justice for all. 
We hope that this road can be reached. In this regard, there 
is a close relationship. There is no offer on the part of the 
Armed Forces or of the government to participate. We are very 
respectful of nations' sovereignty; in this case, a neighboring, 
friendly nation such as Mexico. What is certain is that we are 
prepared on our side of the border, on the Guatemalan side, to 
avoid any incursions by the subversive groups that have sprung 
up in Mexico. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Juan Carlos Ruiz and Leonel Gutierrez] </F>
  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio threatened truck 
drivers yesterday and said that he would intervene "if they 
continue with their blackmailing practices." 
  Interviewed following the Honor Guard anniversary 
celebrations, de Leon said that "the members of the 
transportation sector agreed not to adopt illegal positions but 
they failed to keep their word, which shows irresponsibility." 
The president said that "fortunately" all gasoline stations are 
working normally and that his government is not willing to 
accept these types of pressures. He even went on to say that if 
it became necessary he would take legal measures and "if it were 
required he would resort to intervention because the 
Constitution gives him the authority. Therefore, they should 
accept the consequences." 
  He noted that the Constitution states that when public 
services are adversely affected the government may intervene, so 
the people can rest assured they will have fuel without any 
inconvenience. "That is what they are trying to provoke. They 
are trying to blackmail the government by taking advantage of 
the referendum situation." 
  Ramiro de Leon, however, said that once the referendum 
process is over, the president will act firmly on behalf of all 
people and "not on behalf of a small group of irresponsible 
people." He added that of all the demands made by the 
transportation sector some have already been resolved and the 
rest are in the process of being resolved. That is why the 
strike announcement by transportation sector members to frighten 
the population is illegal, inappropriate, and shows their 
irresponsibility. 
  De Leon said the intercity and international freight 
transportation bills have already been drafted. As for other 
types of transportation bills, legal rulings have determined 
that they are unconstitutional, which have prevented them from 
passing. 
  As for cement price changes, he pointed out that the 
Communications Ministry has already drafted an agreement to deal 
with this request, which means it is being resolved. As for a 
4-percent tax retention by the internal revenue office, it was 
determined that it is applicable to all persons who provide any 
kind of service and do not hand out authorized receipts. That 
is why the transportation sector must pay this tax. 
  Finally, de Leon Carpio said that as for transportation 
fares, members of the transportation sector were invited to meet 
with the economic cabinet on 2 February, as is government 
policy, in order to find a viable solution to the problem. 
<H5>  Transportation Sector: Decision To Strike Remains Firm </H5>
  Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Luna Gamboa, president of the 
National Transportation Coordinating Board [CNT], said he was 
surprised to hear the president's statements and reiterated that 
the entire land transportation sector is determined to go ahead 
with the strike. He added that the movement they are promoting 
is not politically oriented. Proof of this is that during the 
electoral event they will work nonstop. That is why "the 
president's statements are unfair." 
  What happened, he said, is that the president is trying to 
mix economic and political problems, but the CNT reiterates that 
its demands are administrative in nature. "If the problem is 
not resolved it is because there is no presidential, 
ministerial, or political willingness to solve it," Luna Gamboa 
said.

  [Text] Guatemala appears on a list of nations that have 
filed suits against the United States before GATT for imposing 
restrictions on its tobacco imports, causing serious distortions 
to the economies producing that agricultural product. 
  It was reported that after two days of discussions in 
Geneva, 
the GATT signatories said they will form a panel to debate U.S. 
protectionism for the tobacco market. The long dispute initiated 
by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, 
and Zimbabwe is aimed at modifying U.S. legislation regarding 
the use of imported tobacco by domestic industries. 
  At this moment, 75 percent of the tobacco that is used for 
U.S. cigarette production comes from U.S. suppliers.

  [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio swore in the new 
minister of foreign relations during a ceremony held Wednesday 
morning. Marithza Ruiz de Vielman assumed the position that had 
been held since June by Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. 
  Ruiz de Vielman is the second professional to join the 
cabinet in less than 24 hours, after the president swore in Ana 
Ordonez de Molina as new finance minister on Tuesday afternoon. 
The changes within the cabinet correspond to the new direction 
adopted by the president as part of his work agenda for the 
current year, according to De Leon Carpio. 
  [Begin De Vielman recording] [Words indistinct] to achieve 
satisfactory results. Guatemala is a country that is struggling 
to consolidate its democracy, strengthen its Constitution, 
attain peace, and gain openings in international trade. To that 
end, we need the assistance of a team and the confidence that we 
can carry out that task. 
  We are a country that, just as any other developing country, 
has very limited economic resources. Consequently, we must 
increase the effectiveness of our missions abroad and the effort 
of the people who work here at the Foreign Relations Ministry to 
achieve all said objectives. As I said before, these objectives 
must be achieved with very limited resources, but we are hopeful 
and confident because Guatemala deserves it. 
  In addition, I want to thank Dr. Fajardo for the cooperation 
and assistance he is giving me. All persons who preceded me in 
this difficult position have done a great job. Dr. Fajardo has 
expressed his willingness and desire to cooperate because in 
this ministers' change, there is only a change of persons. 
However, the state [word indistinct] and the interest of the 
country also [words indistinct]. Then I want to ask for the 
cooperation of all of you and once more thank the president for 
his trust in me. [applause] 
  I also want to announce, with the authorization of the 
president of the Republic, that in the task I now assume I will 
have the cooperation of two persons who are well-known and 
appreciated in [word indistinct]. In the work I have done in 
the area of international trade, I learned to respect their 
ability and I realize that accepting the post of foreign 
minister, which is in fact a difficult task, I have the 
advantage of counting on very valuable staffers at the Foreign 
Relations Ministry. Two of them will accompany me as deputy 
ministers, but there are many more officials. The Foreign 
Relations Ministry has professional personnel that I am sure 
will also help me. 
  With the authorization of the president, I would also like 
to 
announce and confirm to the media that the deputy ministers who 
will be appointed are Dr. Bernardo Arevalo and Carlos Ramirez 
Martinez. [end recording]

  [Text] Ana Francisca del Rosario Ordonez de Molina, former 
executive secretary of the Presidency of the Republic, yesterday 
took the oath of office as new minister of finance replacing 
economist Richard Aitkenhead Castillo, who held the position for 
the last three years and who was the last minister from the 
Serrano administration remaining in the cabinet. 
  De Molina said that Guatemala is facing difficult moments so 
the austerity policy will continue to increase fiscal revenues 
by improving the efficiency of the functioning of the Ministry 
of Finance. 
  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio thanked the outgoing 
minister 
and deputy ministers for the work done and the cooperation given 
to the president during the seven months working for his 
administration. 
  Meanwhile, Richard Aitkenhead made a brief recapitulation of 
the evolution of the Guatemalan economy during the time he 
served as minister of finance. 
  Regarding economic stabilization, during the three years 
Aitkenhead served as finance minister, the overall government 
public debt with the Bank of Guatemala was reduced from over 3 
billion quetzals in 1990 to approximately 2 billion quetzals 
until January of 1993; while the level of deposits went from 300 
million to 900 million quetzals. 
  Regarding economic growth, Aitkenhead expressed that in the 
last three years the economy grew by 4 percent, which means that 
during this period the economy grew more than during the 1980's. 
Aitkenhead explained that the greater macroeconomic stability 
permitted an increase in investment and confidence in the 
economic agents, which coupled with the growth in public 
investment from 600 million quetzals in 1990 to about 1.5 
billion quetzals in 1993 has allowed a new cycle of improvement 
to begin in the per capita income of Guatemalans. 
  Another accomplishment was that, through the Tax 
Modernization Program, tax revenues went from 2.360 billion 
quetzals in 1990 to 5 billion quetzals in 1993. The new 
minister confirmed the appointments of Estuardo Mendez Herbruger 
and economist Arnoldo Escobedo, who resigned his post four 
months ago, as first and second deputy finance ministers, 
respectively.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Pedro S. Boggiani] </F>
  [Text] Fray Bentos -- President Luis Alberto Lacalle said 
yesterday that he has maintained the predominance of civil 
society over any other power, and that in making unpleasant 
decisions he had sought "the common good." 
  During a break in his tour of the riverside region, the 
president agreed to answer some questions from reporters during 
an informal news conference at a century-old school. 
  Asked about his opinion on the fact that he is the president 
who ordered the largest number of arrests after the military 
regime, Lacalle replied that "it is not a matter of counting 
episodes which, if considered in an isolated manner, have no 
significance in themselves." 
  "We proudly assumed the post of commander of the armed 
forces, and because of family tradition and because of my own 
ideas, I feel deep respect for the military profession," he said. 
  "I visited all the military units of the country, I entered 
them through the front door, I have had a frank relationship 
with the commanders, and I have always observed hierarchy," he 
noted. 
  He added that his decisions in the military area were 
motivated by a high republican objective. "When I had to make 
decisions -- which at times were unpleasant -- I made them 
taking into account the common good, which is what I have to 
safeguard, and the predominance of civil power, which was 
elected and made legitimate by the votes," he said. 
  He also addressed the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, 
in which he admitted the existence of difficulties, although he 
did not rule out the possibility of finding solutions. 
  "There are difficulties, yes. Just think, if Germany and 
France still have difficulties in achieving unity after almost 
40 years of integration negotiations, imagine how difficult it 
will be for us to pin the tail on the donkey," he said. 
  He admitted that there are difficulties between "the 
Argentine and the Brazilian economies, or because of the 
difference in size and magnitude between Uruguay and Brazil, or 
Argentina." 
  "Yet in June we will have something certain. This is, in my 
opinion, the most valuable result of the Mercosur summit in 
Colonia," he said. 
  The president ruled out the possibility of problems with 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco, who last Monday left before a 
lunch that Lacalle hosted for his Mercosur colleagues. 
  "First, President Franco is a man of a certain age. He was 
with us in Anchorena, and needs regular resting periods. He 
does this at all meetings, so do not try to make anything else 
out of it, do not try to see nonexistent things, because there 
aren't any," he added. 
  Asked about the electoral campaign, the president said he 
would prefer a short campaign. 
  "We want no contradictions between the electoral year and 
the 
work year. I believe both things can and should be done," he 
said. 
  He added that it is necessary to have "more time to do 
things, and time is necessary to advertise the proposals, the 
names, and to explain why people are being asked for their 
votes." 
  Asked about the contents of his message to the General 
Assembly on 15 March, the president said he is satisfied "with 
being able to show very good achievements which -- obviously -- 
we hope will be surpassed in the future." 
  He said the government has received much criticism, but 
noted 
that he is not in a sports game -- "to see whether we win three 
to two, or five to one" -- and that he has always tried to 
choose the positive side. 
  "I believe the current government, despite its limitations 
because of its lack of a majority, as everyone knows, will 
present a very good account of its term," he noted. 
  Asked about the constitutional reform project, he said it 
will surely be approved, and despite the fact that it is not the 
ideal project it is major news. 
  "The news I have that the Broad Front will in principle 
support the initiative leads us to the conclusion that there 
will be a comfortable two-thirds majority at the General 
Assembly, which also leads us to conclude that the plebiscite 
will also 'obviously,' as people usually put it, approve it," he 
emphasized. 
  He said that the proposed reform "is not the reform we would 
have liked. Some issues were sidelined, but the single 
candidacy of parties is one of the most important issues." 
  "This will strongly promote party unity," the president 
said. 
  Lacalle also emphasized the significance of the bills that 
the Executive Branch submitted to Congress at the conclusion of 
the interpellation of the ministers of industry and finance this 
week. 
  The atmosphere leading to the interpellation showed that 
several sectors were demanding the adoption of new measures. 
Well, now the initiative is in the hands of Congress, not the 
Executive Branch. We are sure there will be a rapid answer," he 
predicted.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister </F>
Sergio Abreu by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EL PAIS] What are the premises and the principles 
upon which the Foreign Ministry based its action in 1993? 
  [Abreu] The current administration has chosen continuity and 
the development of a foreign policy of state as its general 
guiding principles. Thus the foreign policy, which is conducted 
by the president and the foreign minister, is inspired by the 
need to put its objectives at the service of permanent national 
interest and of medium- and long-term guidelines, which are 
beyond domestic political circumstances. 
  In line with this continuity, and seeking consistency in our 
foreign policy, our traditional observance of the principles of 
international law has been maintained. 
  The principles of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of 
nations, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of 
controversies, which our country has upheld throughout its 
history as a sovereign, independent nation, have been endorsed 
during the current administration. Transformations on the 
international political stage and the dynamic changes we are 
witnessing today have emphasized the role of the law in 
international relations. 
  [EL PAIS] What is the Uruguayan foreign policy strategy? 
  [Abreu] Foreign policy decisions are not made on the basis 
of 
isolated stages or circumstances. Instead, they reflect the 
strategy with which the Foreign Ministry rates the country's 
foreign policy objectives. 
  Our foreign policy has been conducted on the basis of the 
strategy of "concentric circles," with priority areas designed 
on the basis of the country's geopolitical location: First, 
bilateral relations with neighbors, followed by the subregion, 
the region, the continent, the Iberoamerican world, and the rest 
of the world. The Foreign Ministry made major efforts during 
1993 toward attaining the above objectives in each of those 
circles. 
  First, the strategy sought to promote the competitive 
advantage of the country in a regional and subregional context, 
in which Uruguay's main partners are its neighbors, Argentina 
and Brazil. 
  [EL PAIS] What have been the main accomplishments within 
this 
framework? 
  [Abreu] Among our achievements we can mention the promotion 
of bilateral relations with Argentina and Brazil. This includes 
major achievements in physical and economic integration, 
excellent political relations, and bilateral consideration of 
the more sensible topics of the relations with our neighbors, 
like areas along the country's borders. 
  This first priority circle of the state foreign policy is 
supplemented by our active presence at a regional and 
subregional level. We have sought to promote the role of a 
supplier of goods and services at a regional level, which our 
country might play because of its privileged geopolitical 
location as the natural exit port of Latin America's richest and 
most densely populated basin. Among the specific actions that 
have been undertaken we mention: 

  -  Improvement of the navigability of Uruguay River, which 
was jointly arranged with the Argentine Government. This action 
is particularly important for the development of our ports and 
for the waterway project because it allows better ship access 
from Nueva Palmira to Salto, thus promoting the revitalization 
of the ports on the lower Uruguay River. 
  -  Actions, also with the 
Argentine Government, to dredge, place buoys, and maintain the 
River Plate channels, for which an agreement has been 
reached. 
  -  the impulse toward concluding an agreement for the 
Colonia-Buenos Aires bridge project, which for Uruguay will be 
the first stretch of the Highway Axis. This emphasizes the 
position of our country as a key area for land transportation 
between the region's large urban and industrial centers. 
  -  The 
steps taken for granting institutional status to the 
negotiations for constructing the Highway Axis joining Sao 
Paulo, Porto Alegre, Uruguay, and Argentina, a project that is 
specially significant for Uruguay and that will promote 
integration of the economies of the three countries. 
  -  The 
development of the Cuareim River basin, including the 
enforcement of the Statute of the Uruguayan-Brazilian Mixed 
Commission for that basin. 
  -  The promotion of development in areas 
along the Brazilian border, through the activities of the 
binational commission and through the strengthening of the 
importance of the existing border committees. Such activities 
fall within the framework of the border policy, which is a 
priority among our major foreign police objectives, aiming at 
consolidating national culture and national identity in border 
areas in conjunction with economic development, which is being 
jointly promoted with neighboring countries. 
  -  The actions aimed 
at enforcing the multilateral agreement on the Paraguay-Parana 
Waterway (Puerto Caceres-Nueva Palmira) and, considering the 
importance of the project's work schedule, the promotion of 
joint actions by the five countries to agree on the 
implementation of the Technical Cooperation Agreement signed 
with the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank], which seeks to 
determine the feasibility of this river way. 

  -  In turn, political relations with our main neighbors have 
been strengthened through reciprocal visits of top government 
officials. Among them we should note the visit by Brazilian 
President Itamar Franco in May 1993, the first visit by a 
Brazilian president since 1985. In addition, the Uruguayan 
foreign minister visited Brazil in November 1993. 
  -  We emphasize 
the diplomatic efforts that Uruguay has made to revitalize the 
role of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, 
Paraguay, and Bolivia], as an instrument to promote renewed 
cooperation and coordination among its members. 
  -  The relations 
between Bolivia and the subregion have been a priority for the 
Foreign Ministry, which has proposed an analysis of the way we 
can develop closer ties with Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. 
  [EL PAIS] What about actions at a regional level? 
  [Abreu] Another foreign policy objective has been to 
guarantee the Uruguayan presence in the Latin American region as 
a whole, though bilateral and multilateral ties. 
  The approval of NAFTA by the U.S. Congress, which marked the 
creation of an economic bloc of great significance for the rest 
of the continent, has made it essential for us to promote our 
relations with Mexico. The promotion of our relations with that 
country, in all areas, has been one of our foreign policy 
objectives. To this end an important presidential visit was 
paid to that country in March 1993, during which agreements on 
several areas were signed, including the commercial area. 
  Meanwhile, relations with Chile were also considered a 
priority objective, particularly in the economic-commercial area. 
  From a multilateral viewpoint, the Latin American 
integration 
process implemented through LAIA [Latin American Integration 
Association] has been firmly supported. Proof of this is 
Uruguay's active engagement in the resolution of the issue 
involving Mexico's participation in NAFTA and the enforcement of 
Article 44 of the LAIA Agreement, that is, the Most Favored 
Nation Clause. This situation had produced a major disagreement 
between member countries. Our country promoted agreement 
formulas that led to the settlement of the discrepancies, thus 
preserving the organization from a conflict that could have 
seriously affected it. 
  In the political area, Uruguay has promoted the 
consolidation 
of the Rio Group as a permanent mechanism facilitating 
consultation and agreement between Latin American countries on 
issues that affect the common interest of the region. The Rio 
Group, whose members advocate the principles of democracy, 
pluralism, and respect for human rights, is an auspicious fact 
for Latin America. It is totally coincident with our foreign 
policy principles, which Uruguay has always sought to strengthen. 
  Uruguay has also maintained a major presence within the 
framework of the OAS, reaffirming the importance of this forum 
for the preservation of democracy in the continent, and 
endorsing -- as in the case of Haiti's institutional crisis -- 
measures to restore institutional democracy in that country. 
  [EL PAIS] With what countries have we made bilateral 
progress? 
  [Abreu] This government attached importance to the promotion 
of relations -- especially in the economic field -- with 
countries or group of countries with major weight in 
international commerce. Three very important presidential visits 
were made in 1993: to Belgium and to the European Community in 
April; to Great Britain in June; and to the PRC in December. In 
each case the objectives were fully achieved because the visits 
made it possible for us to inform the relevant sectors of those 
countries about existing commercial opportunities, possibilities 
for investment, and mutual benefits to be derived from 
strengthening exchange in various fields.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle by Barret </F>
Puig at the presidential residence in Montevideo, 23 December: 
"President Lacalle Supports Only Economic Policy That Benefits 
Social Progress"; first three paragraphs are LA NACION editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the end of 1993, during an 
interview with LA NACION, President Lacalle presented an overall 
view of relations with Argentina and the challenge created by 
Mercosur [South American Common Market], among other matters of 
major interest to Uruguay. 
  President Luis Alberto Lacalle received a LA NACION 
representative at El Prado, his official residence on Avenida 
Suarez and spoke about relations with Argentina, Mercosur, Latin 
America in general, and the election year in Uruguay, from the 
perspective of the end of 1993. 
  Following are the most important matters raised in the 
interview. 
  [Puig] What are the principal problems with Argentina at 
this 
time? 
  [Lacalle] I think that, rather than problems, we might refer 
to them as questions. I would say that the central question, 
which is being resolved but which still presents some 
difficulties, is ensuring that work on the Martin Garcia Canal 
(an Uruguayan project) is compatible with work on the Emilio 
Mitre Canal (in Argentina). As you know, these are complementary 
projects in Uruguay's view. However, in the view of some 
Argentine groups they are almost conflicting projects. 
  President Menem has personally recognized this fact, and I 
must say a few words in recognition of the sympathy and 
affection with which he has always considered Uruguayan views. 
However, there have been some difficulties in handling these 
matters. 
  Sometimes we have a commercial question to deal with. 
However, I would say that this sort of thing has been 
overshadowed by the matters which we have in common: the bridge 
from Buenos Aires to Colonia, in particular, and the super 
highway. These are the two major public works which we have at 
hand. A contract for the construction of the bridge project will 
certainly be awarded in the course of 1994. The super highway is 
its natural consequence, because it is going to connect Buenos 
Aires with San Pablo by way of the bridge. 
  We are awaiting ratification by the Argentine Congress of 
the 
treaty on the waterway system, which has already been approved 
by Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay, leaving Brazil and Argentina 
to accept it. The matter of the waterway system is very 
important, and I will take advantage of this occasion to 
underline its significance and the need for the Argentine 
Congress to approve it. 
<H5>  Mercosur </H5>
  [Puig] On 1 January 1995--barely one year from now--Mercosur 
should be in full operation. Meanwhile, in the countries which 
will be members of it there are inflations ranging from a single 
digit, at best, to 50 percent annually, to 50 percent monthly. 
How will all of that fit together? 
  [Lacalle] Making it fit together will be difficult. I know 
that Mercosur will not be easy to handle, but there is no other 
choice. If we cut off our legs to avoid losing our way on the 
road, we would not have signed the Treaty of Asuncion, because 
Argentina was in too strong a financial position. 
  Brazil has major problems, but it also has a major 
potential. 
I think that the economic plan which it has adopted for 1994 
will be an effective one. The proposal made by the Brazilians 
themselves to study some way of linking our currencies 
demonstrates the will to deal with these matters. 
  [Puig] Uruguayan and Paraguayan industrialists have just 
asked their Argentine and Brazilian opposite numbers to request 
their governments to agree to a delay in the implementation of 
Mercosur. 
  [Lacalle] I think that a delay is about the only thing that 
we could not agree to because, since we know what kind of people 
we are, an extension would be continued forever. Therefore, I 
consider that the major advantage of Mercosur is that, because 
the date for its entry into effect cannot be changed, it has 
caused a major industrial renovation program. 
<H5>  Military Concern </H5>
  [Puig] I would like to change the subject: 1993 was a year 
which was characterized by concerns about the military. Let us 
not go into them in detail, but they are clear enough. There is 
the case of the Chilean, the case of the microphone, some 
transfers, the restructuring, and even the matter of pensions. 
What is the situation now? 
  [Lacalle] I would not call them concerns. I would call them 
problems, which is a different matter. We have asserted our 
position as the supreme authority of the armed forces. We have 
not seen acts of disrespect, as unfortunately happened a few 
years ago in the history of our country. There has been 
continuing respect for duly constituted authority. 
  In our country legal authority over the military hierarchy 
is 
fully in effect. 
<H5>  Economic and Social Policies </H5>
  [Puig] A few days ago, when you dedicated construction work 
which had been completed at the Pereira Rosell Children's 
Hospital, you said that you can have good economic policies with 
good social policies as well. 
  [Lacalle] You have heard it said, until you are tired of 
hearing it, that the so-called neoliberal policy was being 
implemented to the detriment of social policy. I always remember 
a remark made by Jaime Paz Zamora: "With inflation at the 25,000 
percent rate, there are no social policies. They do not exist. 
They are only on paper. With inflation at 8 percent annually 
Bolivia has been able to deal with social policy." If I might 
transpose these remarks, which is not quite correct, I would say 
that Uruguay has been able to follow very important social 
policies at the same time that it was putting its economic house 
in order, reducing the deficit, lowering inflation, and, more 
specifically, reorganizing the external debt. I will give you 
two figures. We have practically doubled the budget for health 
and education. We have raised the health budget from $90 to $170 
million. The education budget has been raised from $180 to $300 
million, not taking into account other kinds of social 
investments. And this has been done at the same time as we have 
achieved a noticeable reduction in inflation and in the deficit. 
<H5>  Elections </H5>
  [Puig] Over a period of 12 months elections will have been 
held in 11 Latin American countries. They have already been held 
in Honduras, Venezuela, and Chile. And consider how curious this 
is: three former presidents and four sons of former presidents 
are candidates. Are the people voting out of a sense of 
nostalgia? 
  [Lacalle] I do not know about the other countries, but I 
would say that we are substantially different from that. If 
there is something in the rest of America which cannot be 
applied to Uruguay, it is in political terms. 
  We have the oldest party system in the world. From 1836 
until 
now there have been two political parties in Uruguay which are 
inextricably united. Their very existence alongside each other 
is conditioned in a way unlike any other system in the world. 
Certainly, this is without prejudice to the emergence of the 
other political groups. However, there is no doubt that the 
traditional parties are a unique phenomenon. 
  This is a country with a well-developed electoral culture. I 
do not believe that I would vote for anyone because he is the 
son of this person or a relative of that one. It has not been 
much of an advantage for me to be the grandson of one of the 
greatest leaders that Uruguay has had. I had to make my own way. 
<H5>  Election Programs </H5>
  [Lacalle continued] What is happening in Uruguay--and you 
can 
see in that the impact which Herrera has had, that is, in my 
sector of the National Party [PN]--is a recognition of the 
importance of election programs and their implementation. We are 
very proud of the great extent to which we have implemented our 
election program. And I am sure that this is going to have an 
enormous effect on the next election campaign, because people 
are going to be asking the parties to do something similar to 
what we did: that is, to advocate appropriate actions which can 
actually be accomplished. 
  [Puig] Can you comment on the issue of constitutional 
reform? 
  [Lacalle] Look, I believe that there is a critical mass, as 
we would say in terms of physics, in favor of constitutional 
reform. I do not know if there are historic moments to do that, 
because today is 23 December, and I see that there will be a 
delay. I do not want to make a judgment about this. I believe 
that there is a critical mass of people who understand. I am the 
man who can speak about this subject with the greatest freedom, 
first, because I am not a candidate in the next elections, and, 
secondly, because I have lived through the difficulties of not 
being able to form a government. We are aiming at constitutional 
reform while at the same time we would like to give the next 
president better means of governing the country in a better way. 
  [Puig] Are you disappointed about that? 
  [Lacalle] Yes, because I believe that the contrast between 
the things which many political groups have said and what they 
did afterwards has led to great disappointment among the people.

  [Text] Mexico City, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Defense 
Secretariat has reported new attacks on civilians in Ocosingo 
Municipality, Chiapas State, although the Army is observing a 
cease-fire. Defense Secretariat Communique No. 27 stated that 
armed groups attacked Indian villages that refused to cooperate 
with the self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army. The 
communique added that 56 families were evicted with excessive 
violence from Santa Elena, La Soleda, San Francisco, and San 
Miguel Villages. The families were later given shelter by the 
Rural Association of Common Interest [Asociacion Rural de 
Interes Colectivo] in Ocosingo Municipality in eastern Chiapas. 
  The 7th Military Region Command received 27 complaints from 
cattle ranchers in Ocosingo and Altamirano of looting by 
aggressor groups. The office reported that on 27 January the 
person in charge of one of the ranches attacked in Ocosingo had 
stated that a group of 50 armed persons destroyed the ranch he 
was guarding. 
  Near the Miguel Hidalgo ranches in Ocosingo, some 500 armed 
individuals have surrounded 1,460 residents of nearby villages, 
asking them for food and a "war tax" and threatening to kill 
them if they do not join the armed movement. 
  A report received on 29 January stated that armed groups 
burned four wooden houses and used mallets to destroy three 
brick houses located close by the San Cristobal de las 
Casas-Ocosingo highway near Nuevo Oxchuc village, the communique 
added. 
  Residents of the 10 April and San Bartolo Ejidos went to 
military installations in Comitan on Sunday to ask for help in 
evacuating the refugees and to ask for food since armed groups 
are blocking the roads.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 31 Jan (NA) -- The U.S. Government 
today agreed to sell Argentina a total of 36 combat planes with 
their respective radars. The deal had been stalemated due to 
England's opposition. This is the first large weapons sale to 
our country since the Malvinas war. 
  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who is in New York for a 
series of meetings with White House and UN officials, this 
afternoon talked with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS on the telephone 
confirming the news. 
  Di Tella said: "The planes' sale shows the level of trust 
the United States has in our country." The foreign minister 
said the event was "important political support" for the 
democratic and economic process living Argentina. 
  For the past two years the government has been insisting on 
purchasing a total of 36 Skyhawk A-4M planes from the United 
States to replace, in part, the planes lost during the 1982 
Malvinas war. 
  These planes, which the United States stopped using in 
combat 
because they are a generation older than the Phantoms, must be 
equipped with ultra-sophisticated radars in order to be 
effective. 
  The British conservative government repeatedly has opposed 
Argentina's rearming, even though the current rapprochement 
policy made their position more flexible. "The news is still 
too fresh. We still have not heard of any reaction from the 
British Foreign Office," Di Tella said. "Any way we look at it, 
the sale of the planes and the radars is a show of trust in our 
country and, therefore, I do not think there will be any 
problems." 
  Di Tella admitted that the Argentine Government "was 
anxiously waiting" to learn about the U.S. decision, and that 
England "has slowly changed its opinion about us and I am sure 
they will understand the situation." 
  "I do not want to look victorious in front of England, 
nothing of the kind, but I repeat that the sale of the planes 
and radars as well as the possible invitation to join NAFTA are 
indications of a lot of trust in our country," Di Tella stressed. 
  Referring to NAFTA, Di Tella said: "We should wait until we 
receive the formal invitation. Then we will stop and think about 
it carefully to see if it is advantageous to us." Di Tella said 
Argentina's possible entry into NAFTA "will not imply a 10-page 
treaty. The treaty will need hundreds of pages. Argentina must 
not separate itself from Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
Argentina must add Mercosur to NAFTA." 
  The minister then talked about the possibility of U.S. 
investments and the increase in Argentina's exports. He said: 
"We will not see sharp increases because the U.S. economy is 
slowly changing." 
  Di Tella then returned to the issue of the planes, saying 
"the political impact of the U.S. decision will undoubtedly help 
the investment process." 
  Regarding opportunities for the Argentine "Pampa" advanced 
training plane, Di Tella said the U.S.' purchase of the plane 
"does not have any political component. It is a bidding and 
only technical questions matter." 
  Defense Minister Oscar Camilion revealed two weeks ago that 
the "Pampa" plane "has been classified for the finals" among the 
foreign bids. On that occasion Camilion did not reveal what 
other country is also in the finals to sell the training plane. 
  On 25 January, Di Tella travelled to the United States, 
where 
he met Secretary of State Warren Christopher, U.S. Trade 
Representative Michael Kantor, and security representatives.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Pedro S. Boggiani] </F>
  [Text] Fray Bentos -- President Luis Alberto Lacalle said 
yesterday that he has maintained the predominance of civil 
society over any other power, and that in making unpleasant 
decisions he had sought "the common good." 
  During a break in his tour of the riverside region, the 
president agreed to answer some questions from reporters during 
an informal news conference at a century-old school. 
  Asked about his opinion on the fact that he is the president 
who ordered the largest number of arrests after the military 
regime, Lacalle replied that "it is not a matter of counting 
episodes which, if considered in an isolated manner, have no 
significance in themselves." 
  "We proudly assumed the post of commander of the armed 
forces, and because of family tradition and because of my own 
ideas, I feel deep respect for the military profession," he said. 
  "I visited all the military units of the country, I entered 
them through the front door, I have had a frank relationship 
with the commanders, and I have always observed hierarchy," he 
noted. 
  He added that his decisions in the military area were 
motivated by a high republican objective. "When I had to make 
decisions -- which at times were unpleasant -- I made them 
taking into account the common good, which is what I have to 
safeguard, and the predominance of civil power, which was 
elected and made legitimate by the votes," he said. 
  He also addressed the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, 
in which he admitted the existence of difficulties, although he 
did not rule out the possibility of finding solutions. 
  "There are difficulties, yes. Just think, if Germany and 
France still have difficulties in achieving unity after almost 
40 years of integration negotiations, imagine how difficult it 
will be for us to pin the tail on the donkey," he said. 
  He admitted that there are difficulties between "the 
Argentine and the Brazilian economies, or because of the 
difference in size and magnitude between Uruguay and Brazil, or 
Argentina." 
  "Yet in June we will have something certain. This is, in my 
opinion, the most valuable result of the Mercosur summit in 
Colonia," he said. 
  The president ruled out the possibility of problems with 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco, who last Monday left before a 
lunch that Lacalle hosted for his Mercosur colleagues. 
  "First, President Franco is a man of a certain age. He was 
with us in Anchorena, and needs regular resting periods. He 
does this at all meetings, so do not try to make anything else 
out of it, do not try to see nonexistent things, because there 
aren't any," he added. 
  Asked about the electoral campaign, the president said he 
would prefer a short campaign. 
  "We want no contradictions between the electoral year and 
the 
work year. I believe both things can and should be done," he 
said. 
  He added that it is necessary to have "more time to do 
things, and time is necessary to advertise the proposals, the 
names, and to explain why people are being asked for their 
votes." 
  Asked about the contents of his message to the General 
Assembly on 15 March, the president said he is satisfied "with 
being able to show very good achievements which -- obviously -- 
we hope will be surpassed in the future." 
  He said the government has received much criticism, but 
noted 
that he is not in a sports game -- "to see whether we win three 
to two, or five to one" -- and that he has always tried to 
choose the positive side. 
  "I believe the current government, despite its limitations 
because of its lack of a majority, as everyone knows, will 
present a very good account of its term," he noted. 
  Asked about the constitutional reform project, he said it 
will surely be approved, and despite the fact that it is not the 
ideal project it is major news. 
  "The news I have that the Broad Front will in principle 
support the initiative leads us to the conclusion that there 
will be a comfortable two-thirds majority at the General 
Assembly, which also leads us to conclude that the plebiscite 
will also 'obviously,' as people usually put it, approve it," he 
emphasized. 
  He said that the proposed reform "is not the reform we would 
have liked. Some issues were sidelined, but the single 
candidacy of parties is one of the most important issues." 
  "This will strongly promote party unity," the president 
said. 
  Lacalle also emphasized the significance of the bills that 
the Executive Branch submitted to Congress at the conclusion of 
the interpellation of the ministers of industry and finance this 
week. 
  The atmosphere leading to the interpellation showed that 
several sectors were demanding the adoption of new measures. 
Well, now the initiative is in the hands of Congress, not the 
Executive Branch. We are sure there will be a rapid answer," he 
predicted.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Gonzalo Sanchez de </F>
Lozada; place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] My dear fellow Bolivian citizens: The reason 
that moved me to talk to you this evening is that I have good 
news to give you -- tomorrow we will submit to Congress a bill 
on the government's project to turn state-owned enterprises into 
mixed corporations under government control. This bill will 
enable us to keep our promise to create 500,000 new jobs for 
Bolivians during our administration. I am sure you are well 
aware that a privatization drive is under way all over the 
world. Even Russia and East European countries are privatizing 
their public companies. But Bolivia has chosen another path. 
Rather than selling its assets, Bolivia has decided to invite 
foreign and domestic capital to invest in our state-owned 
enterprises an amount of money that is comparable to the value 
of the companies' equity. In other words, instead of having one 
YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits], we will have two YPFBs. 
We will incorporate new and needed management techniques and 
technology. Principally, the capital inflow will create 
investments which will in turn generate new openings and create 
new jobs. We are well aware that the biggest problem in Bolivia 
is the shortage of openings. This is why we give so much 
importance to this bill and consider it of paramount importance 
for the future of our country. The remaining part of these 
enterprises, which will be owned by the government, will be 
apportioned among Bolivians. We will establish between five and 
10 pension funds so that each Bolivian may have his own savings 
and be covered for his old age. We estimate that this will 
happen in 1995. [passage omitted] 
  We cannot disregard the importance of this bill. You may 
wonder why we took so long to draft this bill that only 
comprises four chapters and 11 articles. Well, we took our time 
because we had to discuss it with foreign and domestic 
investors, and with the Bolivian people -- we have conducted 
public opinion polls and established task forces to make an 
in-depth study of the project. We consulted everyone because it 
would be totally worthless to draft a bill that is rejected by 
everybody and that yields no results. I ask you to bear this in 
mind. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign and domestic private investors in our state-owned 
enterprises will have their profits, their returns, but the 
Bolivian people will also stand to gain because all those over 
18 will have access to the aforementioned pension funds that 
will provide them with a sure pension for their old age. 
  It is my considered opinion that this bill will be 
instrumental in creating new jobs and establishing the first 
social security system in South America to provide coverage for 
all Bolivians, without exception. I think the new investments 
will constitute a driving force to spur domestic growth and 
benefit all Bolivians. I think we can double our growth rate to 
a pace similar to that of Chile, rather than at our current pace 
which only serves to cover our basic necessities while leaving 
unemployment unsolved. 
  We have an agenda. By Carnival Sunday [16 January] -- within 
two weeks -- we will have submitted to Congress an educational 
reform bill. Thank God, we have been able to reach a consensus 
on a basic project. We will draft a bill on this project. This 
law will not be controversial because we have discussed it with 
all sectors -- the church, teachers, parents -- and we deem it 
very important because -- while Bolivia urgently needs new jobs 
-- one cannot overlook the need for a better education system. 
We can no longer endure the present education standards -- they 
are a complete disaster and a disgrace. We want to change our 
education system by consensus, we want all Bolivians to become 
involved in it so that nobody feels obliged to accept something 
against his will. But we must effect this change. 
  Moreover, we are also studying the popular participation 
project. We are not sure if this will be a law or a supreme 
decree -- we will seek the people's advice on this issue even if 
we are accused of dragging our feet. We take our time because a 
sense of responsibility guides all our actions. Our 
administration is not arrogant and despotic; we seek other 
people's opinions, we discuss things so as to avoid instituting 
policies that wreak disaster on the country like in the past. 
  Finally, we are working on the national budget, which will 
have a deficit of only 3 percent, as agreed during our 
negotiations with the IMF. We estimate that inflation in 1994 
will be 7.5 percent and that the country will grow by 4 percent. 
We intend to invest at least $450 million in the public sector. 
We are putting together a budget that is based on austerity. 
We will implement cutbacks in government spending instead of 
increasing taxes. There will be no tax increases. We will 
modify the tax system so that it is more productive and less 
damaging, but we will not increase taxes. 
  One thing that I do want to make clear is that it never 
crossed our minds -- and it never will -- to freeze savings or 
bank accounts. I do not know where this rumor originated, but 
it is an evil rumor that is very damaging to our country. 
[passage omitted] 
  I want to state very clearly that as long as I am the 
president of the Republic, savings, whether in dollars or 
bolivianos, will not be touched. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Managua, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro said today that the National Transportation 
Commission's (CNT) attitude was "inhumane." The CNT has upheld 
a strike for the past eight days to demand that fuel prices be 
reduced. 
  A climate of tension prevails in the city, where the main 
avenues continue to be blocked by hundreds of buses and taxis. 
Police surveillance was reinforced in several conflict areas in 
Managua although no major incidents have taken place. 
  According to police reports, the striking transportation 
workers and those who do not support the measure clashed in a 
sector of the northern highway, which leads to the Managua 
international airport, and the windshield glass of three 
vehicles were destroyed. 
  Chamorro said today that the strike could have political 
undertones. She said the CNT continues the protest because its 
affiliates "are tough and who knows who is inciting them." 
"What they have to do is work," the president said, after she 
accused them of pressuring and threatening those who do want to 
work and of carrying out an "inhumane" task that leaves people 
without a vital service. The economic losses caused by the 
eight days of transportation strike amounts to many millions but 
has not been added up yet. 
  The four [number as received] other cargo and transportation 
organizations that signed agreements with the government last 
Friday, have renewed their work. However, the service has not 
been totally reestablished. According to the agreement between 
government authorities and the Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo 
Transportation (Fetracanic), the National Chamber of 
Transportation (Canat), and the National Association of 
Transportation (Anatra) the fuel prices will be frozen until 
next May. Additionally, the agreement gives taxi and 
commercial cargo cooperatives a subsidy for the next four months 
and other concessions and tax exonerations.

  [Text] The Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP) and the 
Democratic Convergence (CD) fear possible fraud in the popular 
referendum scheduled for 30 January. 
  Nery Barrios of UASP said that "without a doubt, we want the 
people to judge and issue their own opinions, but there are 
certain facts causing us to fear possible data manipulation 
[parcializacion] in violation of the law, for example, electoral 
fraud. Because of this, we reaffirm our stand of urging the 
population to abstain from participating in the 30 January 
referendum," Barrios added. 
  CD Representative Ricardo Cifuentes yesterday said that "the 
referendum only promotes permanent corruption and fraud by the 
designated President Ramiro De Leon. The Computation Department 
of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) was eliminated and a 
private company was hired for the elections. This leads us to 
think that there will be fraud and irregularities in the 30 
January referendum," Cifuentes added. 
<H5>  Government Refutes the Claims </H5>
  President Ramiro De Leon criticized the position of popular 
groups for confusing the general public. "There is no fraud and 
will be no fraud in the 30 January referendum," De Leon added. 
The leader said that the people should vote and participate and 
not allow others to interfere with their constitutional right. 
He pointed out that he is urging people to vote yes because he 
thinks that this constitutes the legal solution to the crisis 
that has been facing the country's institutions since 25 May 
1993.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio warned today that he would 
intervene in urban freight and passenger transportation if the 
transportation sector initiates a strike tomorrow, 1 February, 
to pressure the government into approving new fares. De Leon 
said he would not allow the transportation sector to go on 
strike and that he would take legal measures, including 
intervention. 
  A truck strike could lead to a lack of fuel and losses for 
the industrial and commercial sectors, but Energy Minister Jose 
Luis Terron has guaranteed gasoline and diesel supplies. 
  Miguel Luna, president of the National Transportation 
Coordinating Board, reiterated today that the decision to stage 
a strike on Tuesday remains firm if the government does not find 
a solution to the sector's demands. Luna has not revealed the 
amount of fare increase they are demanding for cement and fuel 
transportation, but he reiterated that the decision to strike is 
firm.

  [Text] Mexico City, 30 Jan (DPA) -- According to a document 
written by one of the rebel leaders, which was published in 
Mexico City today, the Zapatist guerrilla movement that took up 
arms in the southern Mexican State of Chiapas on 1 January is 
preparing for direct dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis, the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. In the 
letter addressed to LA JORNADA newspaper in Mexico City, 
"Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatist National Liberation Army's 
(EZLN) spokesman, revealed that the so-called Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Committee [Comite Clandestino Revolucionario 
Indigena] had recently met to appoint its delegates to the 
meeting. 
  At San Cristobal de las Casas yesterday Camacho Solis 
announced his formal acceptance of the negotiation agenda 
proposed by the guerrilla movement. The agenda includes the 
assessment of the economic, social, and political problems that 
prompted the Indian revolt, a search for solutions, and a 
permanent cessation of hostilities. The peace commissioner, who 
was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, also 
stated that he is willing to negotiate with the guerrillas as a 
"political force in the process of being organized" in response 
to the rebels' request that they be accepted as a "belligerent 
force." 
  In his letter dated 26 January, "Subcommander Marcos" 
reveals 
that in the past few days the top rebel directorate discussed 
the appointment of its delegates to the meeting with Camacho 
Solis, which indicates their willingness to hold a dialogue even 
prior to Commissioner Camacho's announcement. 
  "The conditions for the dialogue have been given," Camacho 
Solis stated yesterday. He also warned the guerrillas that the 
current "dilemma" is to "agree to peace with democracy" or 
suffer the consequences of a "toughening" of the conflict. In a 
confidential letter, Camacho Solis had already proposed to the 
EZLN the possible cites, established guarantees, and necessary 
logistics for the meeting. There is still no date for the 
meeting, but, according to Mexico City media, it is imminent. 
  Meanwhile, General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the 
counter insurgency troops in Chiapas, reiterated today his 
support for the Army and the negotiation policy implemented by 
the Salinas de Gortari administration. "When we received the 
order to stop (the unilateral cease-fire), we did so immediately 
because we understand that we are fighting Mexicans who are our 
brothers. It's good that the cease-fire happened, and it opened 
the door to negotiation," he told a Mexico City newspaper. It 
is also good that those people (the EZLN) accepted the dialogue 
and that our top authorities have decided all the necessary 
measures to further this dialogue and obtain peace through 
political means and not with weapons," he emphasized. He added 
that when the rebel leaders and Camacho Solis -- whom he called 
"a very brave man" -- meet, Army planes will not overfly the 
area to avoid misunderstandings and to contribute to "holding 
the dialogue in a clean and above-board manner."

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 Jan (AFP) -- The armed rebellion 
that broke out on 1 January in southern Mexico "will not affect" 
the flow of foreign capital into Mexico, it was asserted by the 
Secretariat of Commerce when announcing it would sponsor 500 
foreign investment projects in 1994. 
  In a 26 January statement to the local media, Pedro Noyola, 
deputy secretary of foreign commerce and investment at the 
Secretariat of Commerce, said foreign investors are still 
interested in this country despite the military conflict in 
Chiapas. 
  "Investment projects are still strong," Noyola said to 
refute 
newspaper reports which claimed at least 100 programs were put 
"on hold" in the Secretariat of Commerce because of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion. 
  Pedro Noyola announced the government and business groups 
were sponsoring nearly 500 foreign investment projects aimed at 
strengthening the textile, agro-industrial, tourism, commercial, 
and manufacture sectors starting this year. The plan foresees 
the promotion of investments through a litany of projects, and 
it includes the participation of the Secretariat of Commerce, 
the Foreign Trade National Bank, and the Mexican Businessmen's 
Council. 
  The political crisis in Chiapas, yet unresolved, has created 
uneasiness among financial groups, tourism companies, and 
powerful local businessmen who stated fears about Mexico's 
economic future during the first week of the armed conflict. 
  Referring to Mexico's foreign trade, Noyola said this sector 
experienced a growth rate of 325 percent over the past eight 
years, surpassing the United States, Germany, Japan, and the 
Pacific Rim countries. The growth rate achieved by the United 
States during that period was 170 percent; Germany 125 percent; 
Japan 130 percent; and "the Asian Tigers only achieved 270 
percent," Noyola said. 
  Mexico has maintained an annual productivity growth rate of 
between 6 and 7 percent since 1989 while the United States 
barely achieved "between 2 and 4 percent," he added. In another 
area, he said Mexico registered a participation in excess of 6 
percent in the United States' total manufactured imports, as 
compared to 3.2 percent registered in 1985.

  [Text] Mexico City, 28 Jan (DPA) -- Judicial authorities in 
the southern Mexican State of Chiapas today authorized the 
release on bail of 38 Indians who were arrested under the 
charges of belonging to the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) guerrilla group. 
  In confirming the release, the Chiapas government explained 
in a communique that the measure has no relation to the Amnesty 
Law decreed a few days ago by the state and federal governments, 
"which was implemented at a different time and under different 
procedures." 
  The Indians, who were held prisoner at a jail in Cerro 
Hueco, 
near Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, faced charges for 
criminal association for their alleged links with the armed 
rebellion that broke out in the state on 1 January. 
  During a recent visit to the jail, members of Amnesty 
International interviewed approximately 70 prisoners. Most of 
them said they were held incommunicado and that they had been 
tortured to force them to confess their participation in the 
EZLN rebellion. They also claimed that they received no medical 
attention. 
  Several journalists who were allowed to visit the Cerro 
Hueco 
jail for the first time last Wednesday to interview the presumed 
guerrillas said they heard the same testimonies. The detainees 
showed reporters the marks left by the blows they received from 
the soldiers and said they spent between four and seven days 
without receiving any food. They were also blindfolded and had 
their hands and feet tied. All of the prisoners who were 
interviewed denied belonging to the EZLN.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, met today with President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari in Los Pinos. Afterward, he met with senators 
and deputies from the Plural Group [grupo plural) in his office 
to follow-up on events in Chiapas. The congressional Standing 
Committee created this group, and it comprises 10 legislators 
representing the six registered political parties. They talked 
about the need to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the 
Chiapas conflict above any partisan stand. 
  Camacho said the conditions for dialogue exist, and he 
highlighted three points that will be discussed with the armed 
groups. These points are: 
  1. Economic demands relating to the material conditions of 
the Chiapas Indians. 
  2. Social demands relating to racism, neglect, poverty, 
disrespect, expulsions, and attacks on culture and traditions. 
  3. Political demands relating to the Chiapas Indians' lack 
of 
legal room for true participation. Camacho will make a public 
announcement tomorrow.

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 1 Feb (AFP) -- 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho announced in this city on 
Tuesday the creation of two "buffer zones" on Wednesday in the 
towns of San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac, Chiapas State to 
"create detente areas" following the armed conflict. 
  Camacho read a communique to the media which stated that 
free 
access will be allowed to two "buffer zones" in Ocosingo and Las 
Margaritas "as long as weapons are not carried." 
  San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac are villages located far 
from San Cristobal and to which the Army has never had access 
during the conflict because of local guerrilla resistance. 
  Camacho also said that armed members of the Zapatist 
National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), which began a military uprising in 
southern Mexico on 1 January, should not be present in the area, 
either. 
  Camacho, who announced a series of actions in support of the 
"life and dignity" of the people in Chiapas, did not talk about 
the possibility of a dialogue with the rebels, which remains at 
a standstill. 
  The communique read by Camacho and addressed to the EZLN 
General Command said "these will be the first two buffer zones" 
to be established in the state, and he added that "the Mexican 
Army from its positions will offer facilities for the movement 
of residents, supplies, and medicines to each one of these 
villages." 
  "The Mexican Army has already left all areas where it had a 
presence in Chiapas State," said Camacho in his message to the 
guerrillas. 
  He said that "traffic will be allowed through the access 
routes" to the buffer zone towns "as long as no weapons are 
carried." He added that the perimeters proposed for these 
places "must be respected." 
  "In these areas there must be no armed presence of the 
EZLN," 
stated the commissioner, and added that the Mexican Red Cross 
will provide in both towns "humanitarian health services and 
will assist with supplies." 
  Camacho added that "everyone will receive health care," but 
"only the civilian population" will receive supplies. 
  Camacho said the services provided at the two places will 
consist of health brigades to fight malaria and cholera, to 
provide universal vaccinations and first aid, and to support the 
transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas State or in 
other places in the country in the cases that may so require. 
  Regarding the supplies, the commissioner announced that 
warehouse and distribution centers for supplying the civilian 
population will be "gradually" installed and that humanitarian 
organizations may support the effort in coordination with the 
Red Cross. He added that the effort "will have full public and 
private support." 
  "With these actions, we all support the life and dignity of 
individuals over all forceful actions and military presence," 
the commissioner stressed.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Feb (AFP) -- The EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] rebels announced today an "imminent" 
dialogue with the Mexican Government. 
  The communique, which was issued from "the mountains of the 
Mexican southeast," is addressed to the national and 
international media and is signed by guerrilla subcommander 
Marcos. 
  The document lists a number of local and foreign media that 
the EZLN will accredit to cover the negotiations to solve the 
armed conflict in Chiapas State that began on 1 January. 
  "The initiation of a dialogue for peace between the EZLN and 
the federal government at a yet to be determined place and date 
is imminent," states the document, which adds that the Indian 
Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) 
[Comite Clandestino Revolucionario Indigena-Comandancia General] 
has already reached "basic agreements" with Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho. 
  It added that "some details are yet to be settled and some 
previous agreements are yet to be fulfilled, but the basic 
points have already been defined." 
  The EZLN asserted that "there is an open-door policy" toward 
the local and foreign media which, according to the rebels, 
"carry out their task objectively without taking sides." 
  In this sense the communique stated that "all the written 
press" shall be allowed, as far as the EZLN is concerned, "to 
cover the dialogue for peace and reconciliation," but in the 
case of televised media, the guerrillas "will veto the 
participation of only the national private television stations 
Televisa and Television Azteca." 
  According to the rebels' report, Televisa "does not need to 
seek news because they invent it at their will and convenience," 
while the reporters of Television Azteca "have shown a lack of 
professionalism by offering money to our fighters" to make 
statements. 
  The communique added that several media "have flatly refused 
to report with objectivity" and have "particularly attacked our 
cause and that of the Chiapas Indian people." 
  The EZLN also publicized a "special invitation" to nine 
newspapers and four television stations, both Mexican and 
foreign, three Mexican magazines, five Mexican radio stations, 
and five international news agencies -- including AFP --to cover 
the government-guerrilla dialogue. 
  The report from the Zapatists stated that accreditation of 
the press will be carried out through San Cristobal de Las Casas 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the national commissioner for intermediation 
(appointed by the EZLN).

  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 1 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace in Chiapas, today 
described as "an important step" toward peace a recent 
communique issued by the armed group [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army, EZLN] operating in Chiapas. The EZLN 
communique states that a direct dialogue is "imminent." 
  The message is "an important step toward meeting and 
advancing the process for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas 
State," Camacho Solis said in a communique released to the media 
in San Cristobal, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. [passage 
omitted] 
  Camacho Solis, in his second communique issued on 1 
February, 
termed as an additional advancement the fact that the group is 
willing to broaden media coverage of the possible direct 
dialogue. 
  The armed group also agreed today to Camacho Solis' proposal 
for national and foreign journalists to cover the eventual 
negotiations, but the group excluded the private Mexican 
television networks Televisa and Television Azteca. 
  Camacho Solis responded: "My stance is not to exclude anyone 
and to make accreditation and access to the talks subject only 
to the appropriate security measures." 
  The commissioner deemed "appropriate the EZLN's suggestion 
for the registration of the media and the procedures for 
coverage to be carried out through the group's mediator, Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz Garcia." 
  Camacho Solis, in his first communique today read this 
morning in San Cristobal de Las Casas, proposed to the armed 
group the creation of two "buffer zones" without an armed 
presence to ease the situation and help the civilian population. 
  Camacho Solis also announced that the Mexican Army has 
withdrawn from the towns in the conflict area.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent "B. de la G." in Mexico: "Alain </F>
Juppe Sought To Downplay Magnitude of Chiapas Rebellion During 
Official Visit in Mexico"] 
  [Text] During an official visit to Mexico from 26 to 29 
January, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe judged that the 
natives' rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas "was not 
liable to threaten the country's political stability" and had no 
bearing whatsoever on "the long tradition of friendship" between 
Paris and Mexico. He also declared himself satisfied after his 
Thursday meeting with the head of state and praised "President 
Carlos Salinas' determination to resolve the crisis through 
dialogue rather than force." 
  Fully accepting the official line of the Mexican 
authorities, 
which is challenged by a majority of the country's political 
class, Juppe said that the violent incidents which have racked 
the Chiapas state since 1 January were "outbursts which affect 
four towns" on the Guatemala border. "I may be wrong in my 
analysis," he said, "but I do not think we should blow out of 
proportion (a local issue) that does not affect the whole 
country." 
  Meanwhile, the Mexican Army seems to be taking more 
seriously 
risks of the conflict spreading to the Federation's other 
states, since it has asked several foreign governments, 
including France, to help it fight terrorism after several bombs 
exploded in a number of cities, including the capital. 
According to a source directly involved in the talks, Mexico's 
Defense Ministry wishes to obtain training support for personnel 
specializing in the neutralization of explosive devices. 
  France, which -- apart from a few Ecureuil marine patrol 
helicopters supplied last year to the Navy -- has not sold any 
military equipment to Mexico since 1984 (Sagaie wheeled armored 
vehicles and Panhard light armored vehicles, currently in use in 
the Chiapas conflict), has yet to answer Mexico's request for 
help with mine clearance. 
  Insisting on Mexico's achievements with respect to inflation 
reduction (less than 10 percent in 1993 compared with 159 
percent in 1987), deficit cutting, and renegotiation of the 
external debt -- which should let the country become soon an 
"active member" of the OECD (Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development), among others thanks to France's 
support -- Mr. Juppe concluded that "economic recovery has not 
solved every social issue, but it remains essential in order `to 
avoid'" explosions such as the Chiapas rebellion. 
  According to Juppe, the Chiapas conflict should affect 
neither foreign investments in Mexico (France is the fifth 
foreign investor in Mexico with nearly Fr9 billion and 228 
firms, behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, 
and Japan) nor foreign trade, which is largely dominated by the 
United States (70 percent of Mexico's trade involves its 
northern neighbor, compared with a little over 2 percent for 
France). 
  Mr. Juppe judged that "French firms understand they could 
benefit" from the free trade agreement in force since 1 January 
between Mexico, the United States, and Canada, provided the 
three partners "do not pass legislation that discriminates 
against third- party countries." One of the topics he discussed 
with Mexican authorities -- he met with Finance Minister Pedro 
Aspe -- had to do with supporting French investment in sectors 
such as environmental protection (liquid waste reprocessing) and 
public transportation, especially with respect to equipment for 
a 10th subway line currently under construction.

<F P=106> [Statement by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio on </F>
31 January; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear Guatemalans: Yesterday the Guatemalan people 
took a very significant and unprecedented step in the nation's 
history by consolidating our democratic process. The results of 
the popular consultation prove that the Guatemalan people have 
left behind the sad pages of their history, especially the pages 
pertaining to confrontation, bloodshed, and corruption. 
  The indisputable yes-vote victory, with 377,044 yes-votes 
and 
70,761 no votes, clearly proves the Guatemalan people support 
the moral revolution initiated by the president of the Republic, 
and thereby they are paving the way for a renewal phase through 
peaceful means, with respect for the legal and institutional 
framework and, in this case, the most powerful weapon democracy 
has: the citizens' vote. 
  Much has been said these past few hours about the abstention 
phenomenon. The truth is, as one of today's newspaper editorials 
states, the fact that a high percentage of citizens did not 
participate in the election does not mean abstentionism won. 
Although every citizen had the option of abstaining, the 
democratic process only considers the number of yes and no votes 
and in the country's 330 municipalities, the yes vote won. In 
other words, the yes vote is the option that won. 
  The issue is that the law and the result of the popular 
consultation must be respected because that is the very essence 
of the de jure state we hope to consolidate in Guatemala. With 
the approval of the constitutional reforms from yesterday's 
popular consultation, it is now up to the Congress of the 
Republic to fulfill its pledge to reform the Electoral and 
Political Parties Law and the Congressional Internal System Law 
as soon as possible so new deputies can be quickly elected with 
the participation of civic committees and other organizations. 
The entire country is awaiting the fulfillment of these reforms. 
At any rate, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will schedule the 
election of new deputies very soon. 
  The results of the popular consultation will allow us to 
continue purging the branches of state. The yes vote has won, 
but there are no winners or losers. The winners are the 
Guatemalan people, who with their participation have proven that 
regardless of the misinformation generated by certain groups 
they know what they want: to live in peace and democracy. 
  The electoral event was conducted in a peaceful manner 
despite the terrorism and blackmail perpetrated on the eve of 
the consultation in an effort to surround the process with 
insecurity and instability. Consequently, the democratic system 
has been saved and strengthened. This is the first time in 
Guatemalan history it is possible to reform the political 
Constitution without resorting to the traditional coup d'etat, 
which confirms we are paving the way for a better future. The 
results of the popular consultation mark the beginning of a 
truly democratic culture. 
  As we conclude this phase, I must emphasize that we are 
making a different scenario possible. A country seeking and 
working for peace must not foster confrontations, impunity, and 
corruption. Therefore, the popular consultation was the 
mechanism used to purge the branches of state. It took more 
time, but it adhered to the law and was peaceful, which is how 
things should be in a de jure state. 
  Now, the people and government must work together in a 
spirit 
of solidarity for our country. The time has come to leave behind 
our personal interests. Guatemala has lost many years because of 
its fragmented and confrontational positions. We must not lose 
the opportunity that is now available to us. 
  This is why as president, committed only and exclusively to 
the Guatemalan people, I call for national unity to work in 
solidarity for a single goal, to consolidate a national project. 
Political, economic, and social sectors should adopt national 
commitments that foster the right scenario for the country's 
governability. Elections are already a handsome page in our 
history. Now we must continue to move ahead. As president, I 
have the responsibility to keep the commitments established in 
the government agenda that allow for laying down the 
irreversible basis for a more modern economy and a society with 
equality. I know this is a challenge, but my mind is set to 
achieve it. 
  I want to tell you that I am proud of the demonstration we 
have given the world, because slowly but surely we are 
confirming that we prefer to solve our problems with words and 
not with violence. Proof of this was the responsible attitude of 
the public workers who, understanding the political moment we 
were living, ignored summonses to paralyze the public 
administration this past weekend. This shows we are maturing. 
  I firmly request the National Transportation Coordinating 
Board to put aside its differences and continue talks aimed at 
solving the stated problems. We cannot continue with this 
political agitation. We must resolve these differences at the 
dialogue table and spend our time working for Guatemala. 
  Our government starts the year with a tight-knit team, a 
strengthened team bent on reaching a single goal: to execute the 
government agenda. We cannot continue to ignore or pretend to 
ignore the tremendous social and cultural reality of our 
society. We have no ties to any political party or any other 
ambitions. That is why, I repeat, our only commitment is to the 
people of Guatemala. I am convinced that all the sacrifice and 
all the blood that has been shed during our country's history 
has not been in vain, because the seed of peace and democracy 
flourishes in the hearts of all Guatemalans. 
  Let us work so that Guatemala may at last achieve peace and 
grow free and strong for the sake of our children's happiness 
and that of future generations. Guatemalans, this is the moment 
for all of us together to say: Go ahead, Guatemala! Many thanks 
and good night.

<F P=106> [From the "Guatemala Flash" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Rodolfo Rosales Garcia Salas, Revolutionary Civic 
Alliance leader, termed yesterday's referendum results a 
political earthquake. The yes vote won over the no vote by a 
minimal margin, which means that the Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
government, and especially the politicians, received one of 
their worst setbacks because most of the population did not vote. 
  The controversial politician said the president should 
abstain from making decisions to solve the country's crisis 
because it is obvious that the Guatemalan people have rejected 
the package of constitutional reforms that Congress approved. 
These constitutional reforms were also backed by presidential 
scheming, which translates as a deep rejection of the 
traditional political classes and the maneuvers of President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Feb (EFE) -- The Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today termed the Guatemalan 
Government's referendum held on Sunday as a government failure. 
  The URNG General Command, based in Mexico City, said in a 
communique that the large abstentionism of 84 percent proves the 
lack of credibility and legitimacy "of the counterinsurgency 
model" implemented with the "self-coup" of former President 
Jorge Serrano Elias. 
  The unprecedented abstentionism in the country reflects the 
rejection of the constitutional reforms, which were faulty in 
origin. The reforms are the expression of deals reached between 
corrupt politicians and show the extent of a regime devoid of 
political support, the URNG communique states. "The 
government's attempt to present as a triumph the scant yes 
garnered at the polls constitutes one more imposition on the 
Guatemalan people," it states. 
  The result of the referendum to reform the Constitution and 
to purge the Congress does not resolve the crisis. On the 
contrary, it prolongs and heightens it, the URNG states. The 
URNG says that this situation will permit the sectors opposed to 
a political solution of the crisis and which support armed 
conflict to harden their positions and seriously endanger 
efforts to build democracy in Guatemala. 
  "The constitutional and institutional reforms and 
socioeconomic transformations the country needs, that society 
demands and wants, can only be achieved by a government of unity 
and national salvation, which is the democratic expression of 
the country's majority," the URNG communique concluded.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has again visited the Oriente 
Rebelde Cattle Enterprise in Sibanicu Municipality, Camaguey 
Province, where the 300-student Salvador Cisneros School was 
built in 45 days. Raul congratulated the teachers and students 
for a rewarding cultural performance, which included scenes of 
contemporary relevance as well as epidoses from the wars of 
independence. 
  Later on, Raul met with Emilia Betancourt, president of the 
Oriente Rebelde People's Council, who told Raul that the local 
economy depends primarily on milk production, two Basic 
Cooperative Production Units, two credit and service 
cooperatives, and one farming cooperative. She added that 
self-sufficiency in vegetable and meat production is being 
promoted. Raul mentioned that Fidel had visited the area in 
November. Betancourt also told Raul about efforts to expand 
domestic fish farming in minidams and water tanks. 
  The tour included the Oriente Mill, the most well preserved 
in Cuba, which is being restored as a sugar industry museum. 
Raul also viewed the plaque marking two important historic 
moments: Ignacio Agramonte's uprising, and General Maximo Gomez' 
battle camp in 1896. 
  Omar del Risco, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba in Sibanicu, gave Raul a detailed briefing on the potential 
of fish farming as a food resource and added that there are 
plans to attain 500 metric tons of fish in 1994. 
  Raul also talked with fishing Vice Minister Enrique Oltuski, 
who pointed out that compliance with technical specifications 
will allow the region to produce large quantities of fish. Raul 
stressed the rationality of the minidam program because it 
produces higher yields within a smaller area and brings the food 
closer to the consumers. Politburo member Julian Rizo agreed 
with Raul, adding that 7,000 liters of milk are distributed 
within Camaguey without the need for long-distance transport. 
  Raul concluded that he will follow up on the development of 
this program, which will undoubtedly contribute to increasing 
food supplies for the people. He noted that this experience 
should be made available to other municipalities in the country.

  [Text] The Navegacion Caribe Enterprise of the Isle of 
Youth will this year seek new lines of work aimed at ending 
subsidies and becoming profitable. This was announced at the 
enterprise's annual assessment meeting. To achieve this, the 
enterprise will increase ship-repair services at tourist hubs in 
Cayo Largo del Sur and the Colony Hotel, and will charge for any 
type of assistance to organizations and individuals. The 
participants in the assessment meeting discussed measures to 
ensure passenger transportation, which has been effected by the 
shortage of spare parts, primarily for Cometa hovercrafts. 
  Despite these shortages and additional ferry trips between 
Batabano and Nueva Gerona, over 1.3 million people were 
transported by this enterprise in 1993.

  [Text] Havana, 31 Jan (EFE) -- The Cuban Workers Federation 
(CTC), which is the sole union in the country, today warned that 
the payroll reduction required at many work centers "should be 
done gradually to avoid traumatic consequences." An editorial 
published by the "TRABAJADORES" weekly, which is the CTC 
mouthpiece, asserted: "We have to end the negative situation of 
inflated payrolls." Nevertheless, it added that factors other 
than excess personnel have a greater impact on the inefficiency 
of firms. The weekly said: "The payroll is certainly an element 
to be considered in the search for efficiency, but it is not the 
only one. Currently, it is quite possible that it is not the 
most important one in many places." 
  In this way, the newspaper referred to the future 
reorganization of the government system, which will include 
ministries as well as firms. The reorganization, which was 
announced at least three months ago and still has to be 
implemented, would leave thousands of workers without a job. 
  With this editorial, the union seems to be distancing itself 
from top government officials who have publicly expressed that 
the problem of excess personnel has to be given foremost 
attention because it is the key to improving productivity and 
profitability. 
  According to the CTC, more damaging than excess personnel 
are 
"the huge shortages" experienced in several firms. This 
includes thefts, the squandering of raw materials and fuel, the 
low quality of various products, and employee absenteeism. 
  The editorial concluded by saying: "We cannot streamline any 
process without the unions. They are a requirement and a 
condition for the process to be implemented effectively, 
especially if it is to be an orderly and well-handled process." 
  Payroll reductions and other pending economic reforms will 
be 
debated at some 80,000 assemblies called by the CTC all across 
the nation starting today. The main issues to be discussed at 
these assemblies are: the creation of a tax system, the 
elimination of a number of gratuities and subsidies to 
unprofitable firms, formulas to reduce the surplus of currency 
in the people's hands, and ways to get the peso to recover its 
buying power. However, according to an official poll, what 
worries CTC members most "is the future of the superfluous 
workers who could be fired when the payrolls are streamlined." 
  Once the assembly debates end, it is expected that a special 
National Assembly meeting will be called to start approving 
measures -- most of which will have a negative impact on the 
people -- that had been announced since last summer.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 27 January and 1 
February. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 27 January reports that Isle of 
Youth investors have drafted their main investment goals for 
1994. Maintaining the current construction projects and 
completing projects under way are among the main objectives. 
Food production, tourism, and defense programs are among those 
with greater impact on the economic and social development of 
the island. Basic services to the people will also be improved. 
  Radio Reloj at 2054 GMT on 27 Jan reports that approximately 
2,600 housing units were completed in Pinar del Rio in 1993. Of 
the 14 municipalities, 13 built more housing than in 1992. The 
province has a 600-house plan for 1994, and is seeking to build 
in materials-efficient ways. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 28 January reports that 
miners in Moa received a donation from British miners of shoes, 
shirts, and gloves valued at $15,000. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 28 January reports that the 
Bio- 
Alimentos research center in Moron, Ciego de Avila, has 
developed a new high protein feed for pigs and chickens; 
production will begin soon at the 1 January center in Moron 
Municipality. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 January reports that 
Valencia 
and Havana City have signed an agreement for a supply of Pegasus 
buses as a cooperative gesture of solidarity to improve 
transport in Havana. Garbage collectors, street cleaners, 
containers, spare parts, and specific tools for the repair of 
these vehicles will also be provided. Pedro Chavez, president of 
the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government, stressed the 
importance of the agreement and announced that 30 garbage 
collectors, 10 street cleaners, and some 4,000 containers will 
begin arriving in February. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 29 January adds that the Carisol 
and 
Los Corales hotels were officially dedicated this morning in 
Santiago de Cuba and Varadero. The exploitation of these hotels, 
considered symbols of Cuban tourism development, will be shared 
by Cubanacan and the German chain LTD. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 31 
January report that the Che Guevara Plant in Moa, Holguin 
Province, has saved more than 1.7 million pesos since September 
by burning oil instead of coal. This was achieved through the 
research carried out by Engineer Hector Agotis de Ansana, who 
has been conducting oil- burning tests since 1992. Fifteen kg of 
oil replaces a ton of coal. 
  Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 31 January reports that an 
experiment in minifarms is being expanded in Cienfuegos Province 
because results have been good. There are 180 such farms in 
Cienfuegos for tending cattle. Each farm has two workers only -- 
and sometimes their families -- who are responsible for 30 cows. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January announces that an 
eight- week master class in business law and its economic and 
international implications began on 31 January in Havana, under 
the joint auspices of the Autonomous University of Madrid and 
the University of Havana, sponsored by the Guitart hotel chain. 
Gabriel Garcia, legal director of the university, explained that 
"the main objective of the course is so Spain and Cuba can 
exchange legal experience and cooperate in the process of 
legislative change that could eventually take place in Cuba as a 
result of an increase in certain kinds of businesses, such as 
the tourist business." The course targets lawyers responsible 
for negotiating foreign investments in Cuba. Garcia explains 
that such a course is timely because of the "large Spanish 
investment in Cuba," and also because of the many other foreign 
investments, since there are "probably" ongoing negotiations 
with foreign firms that intend to set up branches in Cuba. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January reports that Las 
Tunas is attempting to increase the 300 mini-dairy farms in the 
province to 1,000 in 1994 to increase milk production. Las Tunas 
Province produced approximately 33 million liters of milk in 
1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that Pedro 
Ross said in a meeting with workers from the 14 de Julio Sugar 
Mill in Cienfuegos Province that only 1,000 of the 7,000 
caballerias of sugarcane scheduled for planting nationwide 
between January and April have been planted to date. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that AIDS 
patients at the sanatorium in the city of Cienfuegos will be 
trained to make articles of leather and fabric. "This activity 
joins the efforts by the Ministry of Public Health and other 
Cienfuegos Province institutions and organizations to 
incorporate these patients into a socially useful life and 
contribute to their personal fulfilment. The AIDS patients will, 
through this work, cooperate in making the sanatorium 
self-financing." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 1 Februrary reports that 
Ernesto 
Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic 
Cooperation, upon opening the fifth meeting of the regional 
committee for the development of subcontracting in Latin 
America, said that in the past three years, Cuba's trade with 
the region rose from 7 to 30 percent. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 1 February reports the 
following: 
  Dominica Coconut Production has donated five tons of laundry 
and toilet soaps to Cuba. The firm's representative called the 
donation "another gesture of solidarity with the Cuban people 
and government, which are struggling to get through the complex 
moment of the special period and repercussions from the weather." 
  A new France-Cuba flight has been inaugurated. The first 
joint flight by the companies (OM) and Cubana de Aviacion took 
place on 31 January. (Michel Taillant), the French airline's 
marketing director, explains that an increase in the number of 
flights between France and Cuba over the past few months led the 
two companies to schedule joint flights to supplement the 
regular flights of each. He adds, "This is probably a prelude to 
additional regular flights....This new airline, with a weekly 
Havana-Paris-Havana flight, will develop and expand French-Cuban 
tourism relations...." Flights will leave Havana for Paris on 
Sunday and return on Monday. 
  Pinar del Rio Province expects to harvest over 0.5 million 
quintals of tomatoes from the 150 caballerias that have been 
planted. Eighty percent of these tomatoes will be earmarked for 
consumption in Havana and Pinar del Rio, the rest for industry 
and for seeds. Workers from Pinar del Rio and from the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces "35th Anniversary of the Triumph of 
the Revolution" group are responsible for harvesting these 
tomatoes. 
  A report from Camaguey says Cuba has begun producing hog 
cholera vaccine with which to vaccinate all the nation's 
livestock. Camaguey Province is a priority, under the existing 
program.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F>
Sanchez de Lozada by an unidentified EL PAIS reporter during his 
visit to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay for the Common Market 
of the South, Mercosur, summit on 17 January] 
  [Text] [EL PAIS] You have often said that Bolivia is trying 
to be like "Dona Flor and her two husbands" [reference to novel 
by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado]. What exactly does that mean? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all, 
Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate 
region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the 
Pacific Ocean. I think that beyond this remark, our presence 
here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny 
linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one. Our 
immediate and future realities are closely linked to the 
Parana-Paraguay River Waterway. We hope that, based on 
agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two 
countries can establish with the others that will join them in 
this waterway an organization that can integrate them all. For 
Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea. It will 
protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great 
potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans. In 
this regard river transportation is really decisive. Our 
presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a 
priority. Just like Dona Flor, we would like to have two 
husbands (Mercosur and the Andean Pact). It seems, however, 
that our priority is Mercosur. This is why we want to hold 
bold, but prudent, talks. We want to become part of the 
locomotive instead of waiting to be run over by it. We believe 
that the locomotive is here, that it is the critical argument 
that will allow us to negotiate with the other economic blocs. 
In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this 
river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of 
a diversity. 
  [EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate? 
Institutionally, they are two different things. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from 
its roots. The whole thing begins here. We can separate the 
two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and 
cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other 
parts of the world. It is the destiny of all countries, 
particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet. This 
cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is 
not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, 
Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and 
needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now 
have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving 
an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several 
other international river systems. It would be an 
administrative support to this exceedingly complex system. 
  [EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very 
close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after 
decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco 
War. In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan 
leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been 
achieved by our peoples. I also believe that our landlocked 
situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and 
socioeconomic realities. 
  [EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way 
of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade 
zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account 
that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the 
political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is 
consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: 
By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit 
uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade 
zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a 
common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like 
getting to the point where the other countries already are. And 
as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade 
agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic 
conditions to become a full member. But we must move with great 
prudence and care, because we have other relations and 
commitments. I came here above all seeking the political will of 
the four countries to make Bolivia become a Mercosur member, 
seeking a greater commitment. I believe there is a will; 
otherwise I would have not been invited. But there is still a 
long way to go. It is a way to open the path. 
  [EL PAIS] Is your visit to Uruguay next March related to 
this 
issue? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It has to do with this issue, but also 
with the relations with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which 
are very important to us. 
  [EL PAIS] Another issue proposed by Bolivia is the revival 
of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, 
and Bolivia]. What use would you have for this group, which in 
some ways already failed during the decade of the sixties? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another 
time. I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it 
involves three small countries. Uruguay is in another stage of 
its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia. 
But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact 
under current conditions. I believe this is like a hand with 
five fingers. And the three of us have to face the pressures 
from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed, 
the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many 
ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on 
international issues. There are historical interests, and 
therefore it is a great advantage to have a common area. This 
is something very informal, thank God, it is a wish, but 
sometimes that is the most effective. Sometimes a friendship is 
more valuable than an event. 
  [EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special 
treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept 
integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs 
are proposed for some products to protect an industry? Would 
your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed 
low tariffs? Would it pay that price? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What 
we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations 
that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their 
industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but 
a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that 
protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. 
Because it is only human nature -- when a businessman is 
protected, he will not seek competition. And one of the reasons 
why we want to participate is because we believe that sometimes 
logic, explanation, and experience have a great deal of 
influence, especially in countries which are facing very 
powerful sectors. It is like the case of an angel speaking in 
one ear and the devil speaking in the other, but one must 
listen. The exchange of experience is obviously important; if 
one wants something valuable an effort must be made to get it. 
But I believe one of the reasons why we want to participate 
fully in Mercosur is because this process could stop. Bolivia 
cannot force anybody, but it may have ideas for the future to 
help this process come to a happy conclusion. 
  [EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president, 
what 
is the future of the Andean Pact? Apparently there is a bloc 
that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were 
left behind. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation. 
Remember that for various reasons our activities and attention 
have been especially dedicated to Chile and to Mercosur. We are 
planning to start in the next few months to look at the real 
situation of the Andean market. What happened is that the 
domestic political struggle is so intense that I am only now 
beginning to look at the world and the context in which the 
country is living since I was inaugurated. Based on the 
activities in which we are involved, we know there is a long way 
to get there. But we are trying to get closer to Mercosur 
because we believe it is more valid and hopeful. 
  [EL PAIS] And how do you see the "Amazon Initiative" started 
by Brazil? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Brazil believes that this should be 
enlarged, and that impulse should be given to a Latin American 
free trade common market. But we believe this will not occur 
until a locomotive exists. And the locomotive is Mercosur. 
  [EL PAIS] How are current relations between your country and 
Chile? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I believe substantial changes have 
occurred. My visit to Santiago, Chile, last October was very 
important. Bolivia and Chile are changing a lot, and we do not 
know what that means. But they are no longer the countries they 
were. It is an irony, but sometimes countries change more 
quickly than their leaders. We are carrying out polls in 
Bolivia and Chile, and it seems that our people have left us 
behind. We continue to look at the past, and they are looking 
at the future. But sometimes deep inside people there are still 
attitudes that only time will change. But we see changes among 
people, such as Frei's election, and my election, representing 
countries that are changing. Perhaps this means that problems 
that had no solution will have one now, but I cannot guarantee 
anything. One should be careful. 
  [EL PAIS] Are there still talks on the issue of diplomatic 
relations between Bolivia and Chile? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I would say not. Some people in Chile 
and Bolivia believe that the best of relations is not to have 
relations, and there are other people who believe it is very 
difficult to fight with someone if no relations exist. I 
believe relations could be established very soon, or they could 
be delayed. We want the steps to be taken to be not only 
symbolic, but truly effective. We are not putting forward 
conditions or demands, but want to move with boldness, but at 
the same time prudence.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus considers Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria's hope of getting elected to the OAS general 
secretariat post has failed following the "no" he received in 
Central America. 
  Niehaus, who is also working to replace Brazilian Joao 
Clemente Baena Soares at the head of the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that 
Colombia's intense efforts at the inauguration ceremony of new 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina were their "last 
attempts" in this direction. Central American support for 
Niehaus was, he asserted, "absolute and total." "I feel that 
this (the efforts made in Honduras) was the decisive point and 
that the Colombian foreign minister (Noemi Sanin) will recommend 
that the president desist from running as an official candidate, 
because he has no possibility of winning the race," Niehaus 
added. 
  Alfredo Cristiani, president of El Salvador, Ramiro de Leon, 
of Guatemala, and the new Honduran chief of state publicly 
expressed support of Niehaus for the OAS post. Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro, who also attended Reina's 
inauguration, termed "perfect" Gaviria's desire and, showing a 
change of position, did not say who she would support alleging 
that "the vote is secret." 
  Niehaus told ACAN-EFE that Nicaragua has reiterated its 
support and that the Nicaraguan president's expressions appear 
to be "diplomatic words" in view of Gaviria's presence in 
Tegucigalpa. The Colombian chief of state was the only non 
Central American president who attended the Honduran 
inauguration and took advantage of his visit to make a stopover 
in Panama and to visit El Salvador today. Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara, who did not go to Honduras, reiterated last 
week that Panama will vote for Niehaus. He said so during the 
visit by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to sound out possible 
support for Gaviria to the OAS post. 
  The Costa Rican foreign minister said that he has 23 votes 
guaranteed for the 27 March election while only 18 are needed to 
win. 
  Former Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, a 
third candidate to the post, told ACAN-EFE that the figures 
cited by Niehaus "are inflated." 
  For his part, the Costa Rican foreign minister insisted 
today 
he has the support of the six Central American countries, the 13 
countries of the Caribbean, who are committed to him in a letter 
of the regional economic cooperation organization, Caricom 
[Caribbean Common Market], and also the support of the Dominican 
Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. Niehaus insisted that 
it is a "just" desire based on the principle of rotation, that 
Central America and the Caribbean occupy, for the first time in 
history, the OAS secretariat. 
  Burelli said that to try to "subregionalize" the 
organization 
and impose a numeric force of small countries on the democratic 
importance and economic support of the large countries could do 
away with the OAS or promote a "small security council" with 
UN-style veto power. 
  Niehaus, however, rejected the power that the large 
countries 
have had in OAS executive posts and recalled that the 
organization is based on the equality of states, regardless of 
their size and population. Although he considered it acceptable 
that Burelli vie for the post since Venezuela has never held it, 
he stated it would be "unacceptable" to give it to Colombia "for 
the third time." 
  Regarding the possibility of Gaviria as a candidate, 
something that has not been made official, he agreed with 
Burelli that there would be an anomaly to elect him secretary in 
March for him to take office in June when he is not scheduled to 
leave his post until August. 
  Niehaus said that he hopes to leave the Foreign Ministry on 
8 
May, when the new Costa Rican Government that is elected 6 
February takes office. "We must give an opportunity to other 
countries and other subregions, and not only South America," 
Niehaus said, expressing his intention not to go up for 
reelection after the first five years in the secretariat in 
order to give a chance to other nations. "After Central 
America, a Caribbean country should be next to occupy the 
secretariat, then a South American one," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Balmore Parada from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] After having claimed there was no violation 
whatsoever of Salvadoran sovereignty in the case involving the 
death of a Salvadoran bodyguard -- a death blamed on U.S. 
Embassy employee Major Mike Lopez -- Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Salaverria today condemned the incident. Foreign Minister 
Salaverria read a six-point official communique which cited the 
Vienna Convention that guarantees complete immunity from 
judicial punishment, which in this case favors the U.S. officer. 
  According to the communique, Maj. Lopez is not subject to 
any 
sort of detention or arrest by Salvadoran authorities, and can 
be summoned to give testimony regarding this case. [sentence as 
heard] According to Salaverria, this same diplomatic immunity 
applies in similar cases involving diplomats in any country 
which has signed the Vienna Convention. Nevertheless, the 
foreign minister condemned the incident: 
  [Begin Salaverria recording] This incident is condemnable 
from every angle, and it is regrettable because it involves a 
person's life. Whether the life of a Salvadoran or a foreigner, 
all life is priceless, and no monetary compensation that may 
eventually be paid to the family can offset this loss. One must 
consider other family aspects, such as the effect this man's 
absence will have on his children, as well as how this will 
affect them for the rest of their lives. These are just some of 
the considerations. I, however, can assure you that no one can 
be happy about this incident, and the one who feels most ashamed 
is the U.S. Government. This is one problem it does not need, 
and I am sure that the U.S. Government will prosecute this 
gentleman under the full force of the law. [end recording] 
  From the very start, the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry has 
received the U.S. Embassy's assurances that Maj. Lopez will face 
a U.S. court martial. The foreign minister reported that Maj. 
Mike Lopez, a U.S. Embassy employee, on 21 January killed 
bodyguard Cresencio Diaz Alvarado in the Guadalupe neighborhood 
in Soyopango, on the outskirts of eastern San Salvador. 
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria reiterated 
that there has been no violation whatsoever of national 
sovereignty in the case of the death of this bodyguard.

<F P=106> [Article by Pieter Den Hollander: "Assessment Condemns </F>
Person in Charge of St. Martin"] 
  [Text] Philipsburg -- The person in charge of St. Martin, 
R. Voges, is unsuitable for his task of combatting the 
administrative chaos on the Netherlands Antillean island. His 
checks on the government apparatus, which has become derailed, 
are a failure. Also he has not proved able to play the 
pioneering role which could lead the St. Martin Government to a 
healthy future. 
  This was the conclusion of the Joubert commission, one year 
after Justice and Antillean Affairs Minister Hirsch Ballin put 
the island under legal restraint when he introduced his Higher 
Supervision regime. Voges reacted furiously to the 
recommendations, which could cost him his job because Hirsch 
Ballin has in the meantime let it be known that he wanted to 
adopt Joubert's proposals. 
  "I completely reject this attack on my person," Voges said. 
"I have not failed, but I have been abandoned by the civil 
service apparatus in St. Martin at every stage. I was given 
completely insufficient support in my attempts to restore order." 
  Hirsch Ballin also received some indirect criticism: His 
controversial policies for fighting the considerable financial 
disorder, administrative chaos and faulty checks on government 
policies have not achieved the desired results one year after 
they were started, the advisory committee under the leadership 
of E.L. Joubert noted. Joubert is rector-magnificus of the 
University of the Netherlands Antilles. 
  Joubert suggested a number of far-reaching measures, the 
most 
important of which was to put St. Martin under a new period of 
legal restraint of at least two years using a general Measure of 
Central Government Administration. 
  Last summer Hirsch Ballin announced his Higher Supervision 
regime, which included strict financial curbs on the island (to 
be carried out by Voges, the person in charge who has now been 
challenged). These policies had produced only meagre results, 
according to Joubert. The worst evils had been removed, but as 
yet little improvement could be seen, the advisory committee 
said. 
  Joubert and his camp now want to intervene in three ways: 
The civil service should be drastically reorganized and 
strengthened under the leadership of an interim manager with 
exclusive powers, who will be appointed for a period of two 
years to succeed Voges. 
  St. Martin's Island Council should also be forced to set 
policy plans within one year in the fields of the economy, 
welfare, traffic, tourism, town and country planning, 
environmental management and public health. 
  The Island Council, if necessary under pressure from the 
Netherlands Government, should also pass provisions to increase 
government income (there is still a budget deficit of many tens 
of millions of guilders), improve financial management and 
guarantee effective and democratic decision making procedures. 
  The Island Council is accused of taking a wide range of 
decisions and approving expenditure, despite Hirsch Ballin's 
Higher Supervision regime, without providing any adequate 
justification of these decisions. 
  In a reaction to the report, Hirsch Ballin spoke of "proper 
recommendations" which he "would adopt in general lines." In 
the near future he will present them to the central government 
cabinet and parliament and hopes to be able to take decisions on 
18 February under the slogan "Now Let's Get To Work."

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Cox] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 1 Feb, CANA -- Although the 
global recession appears to be ending, Caribbean economies did 
not perform satisfactorily last year mainly because the region's 
major countries had a less than spectacular performance. This 
assessment came Tuesday from president of the Barbados-based 
Caribbean Development Bank [CDB], Sir Neville Nicholls, who said 
the impact of the minimal progress of the larger economies will 
be felt by the whole region. 
  Sir Neville said: "With regard to the actual economic 
outturn in the 17 borrowing member countries, the Gross Domestic 
Product of seven of these was higher than in 1992. In five 
others, there was positive growth of the GDP, although less than 
in 1992 and mainly marginally so. Three countries registered no 
change from the previous year; and in the last two, there was no 
growth, only declines in 1993 GDP." The CDB president suggested 
that a return to buoyancy by the main economies would have 
considerable meaning to the region as their markets were 
critical to the restoration of some prosperity to intra-regional 
trade. 
  Trinidad and Tobago retreated from very marginal growth in 
1992 to a negative position in 1993 with a - 1-percent growth 
rate. The Bahamas stagnated at the 1992 level which was itself 
half a percentage point below the level attained in 1991. 
Jamaica recorded a 1.5-percent growth which, while better than 
the 1.2-percent in 1992, was still extremely low; and Barbados, 
after three years of significant decline, turned itself around 
with just a 1-percent growth. 
  Sir Neville revealed: "The information available so far 
shows 
the year's top performers to have been Anguilla with 7.5-percent 
growth; Guyana, between 7 and 8 percent; Cayman Islands, 4 
percent; St. Kitts and Nevis, 4 percent; Belize, 3.9 percent, 
which is a substantial drop from the 7.4-percent of 1992, and 
the British Virgin Islands, 3.5 percent." The CDB president 
offered a number of reasons for the less than stellar 
performance of the Borrowing Member Countries (BMC's), which did 
little to offer any relief for the 200,000 thousand unemployed 
in the region. 
  He said: "With the exception of Guyana and Trinidad and 
Tobago, the others are fairly strong tourist-oriented economies. 
And last year, the region, insofar as tourism is concerned, 
continued to suffer from the slow recovery from the recession in 
North America." In addition, many of the European countries, 
because of the depreciation of their currencies in relation to 
the United States dollar, and their own problems with the global 
recession, did not provide the Caribbean with many visitors. 
  As well, Sir Neville explained that "some of the countries 
in 
the region, particularly Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and 
Tobago, are suffering from what can best be termed as 
foreign-debt overhang." A substantial proportion of their 
financial resources, especially with their earnings of foreign 
currency, continues to be spent on servicing foreign 
indebtedness. Another problem for these countries is that 
manufacturing entities are beginning to feel the effects of 
trade liberalisation. This in turn has resulted in reduced 
output and increased unemployment. 
  "This is in many respects an inevitable process that is 
taking place. The trend towards liberalisation of trade is a 
worldwide one and our countries, this region, is finding it 
increasingly difficult to protect their industries, particularly 
manufacturing industries, from competition from outside," Sir 
Neville told reporters at a news conference. The overall 
position with most of the major economies of the Caribbean is a 
relative shortage of foreign exchange. "Once you have that 
situation," Sir neville said, "governments find it virtually 
impossible to stimulate the economy because of the shortage of 
foreign exchange." 
  An analysis of the main performing sectors of the region's 
economy offers some hope contingent upon a resumption of 
sustained growth in the global economy, and on restructuring of 
individual economies to enable them to respond competitively to 
the new situation they face. In tourism, for example, figures 
show that the number of stopover arrivals and cruiseship 
visitors in the tourism- oriented BMC's increased in 1993. Sir 
Neville explained that "as would be expected, consequent upon 
the recovery in North America, tourism growth was strongest in 
those economies which traditionally get the overwhelming 
majority of their tourists from North America." As far as the 
banana industry was concerned in 1993, a number of factors 
adversely affected it. Principal among these was the exchange 
rate of sterling which depreciated, giving producers less in 
domestic currency for every pound sterling earned. 
  The bank president said: "Moreover, uncertainty about the 
future deepened as a result of significant changes in the 
arrangements for marketing Caribbean bananas in the European 
Union." Belize and Jamaica had offsetting effects of the lower 
prices by expanding output through production efficiencies. 
Although like Jamaica, Belize experienced a fall in unit 
earnings, it nonetheless was able to increase total earnings. 
For St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, there were 
substantial declines in both production volumes and export 
earnings. 
  Sugar production dipped by about 3 per cent from 732,000 
tonnes produced in 1992, with St. Kitts and Nevis alone 
recording an increase in production by about 4 percent, while 
Barbados suffered a falloff of approximately 10 percent, 
continuing the slide in the industry for this island over the 
past few years. Jamaica's production was 7,000 tonnes less than 
in 1992. As far as Guyana was concerned, production fell 
slightly compared with previous years, but was still 50 percent 
above the 1991 level. Belize also recorded a drop in sugar 
production, but this was deliberate since a greater percentage 
of its increased output in sugarcane was used for the production 
of molasses. And in Trinidad and Tobago, sugar production was 
estimated at 4 percent less, although there were quite 
remarkable increases in other areas of export agriculture, such 
as cocoa and citrus. 
  With regard to bauxite production, figures up to the end of 
September suggest that the decline was about 1.2 percent. Guyana 
recorded a slight increase, but this was offset by the decline 
in Jamaica, which is the bigger producer. The industry's 
prospects continued to be affected by weak international markets 
although the CDB approved a U.S.16.5 million dollar loan for the 
industry in Jamaica. There were also disappointing performances 
in the region's petroleum industry. The decline continued in 
Trinidad and Tobago during 1993 with output falling by about 8 
percent. In Barbados as well, there was a decline of 4 percent 
to nearly 460,000 barrels.

  [Text] St. John's, Antigua, 1 Feb, CANA -- Political leader 
of Antigua and Barbuda's main opposition United Progressive 
Party (UPP), Baldwin Spencer, has rejected claims that his party 
is seeking to create a confrontation with its opponents and 
incite violence ahead of general elections. 
  The ruling Antigua Labour Party, campaigning for elections 
constitutionally due by March, has accused a UPP candidate and 
his supporters of disrupting an ALP public meeting. The party 
also accused UPP supporters of blocking the path of ALP 
supporters last Sunday in the St. John's rural West constituency 
(represented by Spencer). But Spencer charged that the ruling 
party, feeling the weight of the opposition, was "clearly 
looking for sympathy." 
  "They realise that their power in this country is eroding 
and 
they are trying to create a situation where they would want to 
put the UPP in bad light," he added. 
  The UPP leader said the ALP's allegations were "clearly not 
true." 
  "There was no attempt on the part of a UPP candidate to 
disrupt any meeting. There was no attempt... to block the 
motorcade of the ALP that was going through my constituency," he 
said. "What I believed frightened the ALP and their entourage 
was the outpouring of support by the people of my candidacy in 
that constituency and the total rejection of the ALP," Spencer 
added. 
  The UPP leader said his party would "not allow the ALP to 
use 
fear and intimidation to derail us. We are fighting this 
campaign openly without fear. We are taking the issues to the 
population. We are campaigning aggressively. We make no bones 
about that. We do not have the media, so we have to reach there 
to the public by other means," Spencer said.

  [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, 1 Feb, CANA -- Opposition leader 
Sir Lynden Pindling and his Progressive Liberal Party [PLP] 
Monday night tabled a motion of no confidence against Prime 
Minister Hubert Ingraham, over the recent resignation of Justice 
Ira Rowe from the Bahamas Court of Appeals. 
  He also tabled a resolution condemning the justice minister 
and the attorney general. Pindling claimed that new evidence had 
surfaced in the abrupt resignation of the Jamaican judge. 
Additional information, he claimed, has convinced the opposition 
that the 17-month-old government, through Justice Minister Janet 
Bostwick, interfered with the judicial process. 
  Pindling, former prime minister of 25 years, also claimed 
that Attorney General Orville Turnquest presented a misleading 
position in a television interview, and that Ingraham misled 
parliament in a communication on the matter. 
  Ingraham branded Pindling's allegation an "outright lie." He 
said he had no problem with such a debate and offered to change 
the House of Assembly's agenda on Wednesday and Thursday to 
accommodate the PLP. 
  "It is dead wrong for Sir Lynden Pindling to seek to mislead 
the Bahamian public and bring into contempt the judicial 
system," Ingraham said. The government, he continued, was 
completely satisfied that it acted in the best interest of the 
people and consistent with its oath of office to uphold the laws 
of The Bahamas. 
  Rowe resigned in December after the Ministry of Justice, 
through the registrar of the supreme court, told him that it was 
not prepared to facilitate his presence in Nassau to hear an 
appeal challenging the lawfulness of a commission of inquiry 
appointed to investigate allegations of misuse of public funds 
under the former Pindlng regime. The appeal was lodged by 
Maurice Glinton, lawyer for Phillip Herman Bethel. The inquiry 
was told that Bethel indirectly received a substantial amount of 
maoney that had been paid by Boeing of Canada as commission on 
the sale of Dehavilland aircraft to the state-owned Bahamasair. 
Bethel is the son of Philip Bethel, a former Bahamasair chairman 
and PLP minister. During the recent hearing, Justice Vincent 
Melville, chairman of The Bahamas Court of Appeals, stated that 
he was telephoned by Justice Rowe last December 4. Justice Rowe 
informed the president that he had an application for Glinton. 
  Justice Melville said he informed Justice Rowe not to deal 
with the matter as there was someone in The Bahamas who could 
deal with it. Glinton had flown to Jamaica to get Justice Rowe 
to entertain his application. Ingraham said that the chief 
justice of The Bahamas has always dealt with applications of 
appeal since the court of appeal was established in The Bahamas 
28 years ago. 
  Ingraham said that his government was sworn to uphold the 
laws of The Bahamas and not to allow anyone "under any cloak" to 
subvert the laws of the country.

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 1 Feb, CANA -- Barbados and 
South Africa have established diplomatic relations, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs here said Tuesday. The act was formalised 
Tuesday through an exchange of notes between representatives of 
the two countries in the U.S. capital, Washington. 
  On January 4, Barbados Foreign Minister Brandford Taitt and 
South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha had exchanged letters 
indicating their intention to establish formal relations. 
  For over 30 years, Barbados had maintained a firm distance 
from South Africa because of apartheid. The thaw in relations 
occurred after South Africa started dismantling the system of 
racial segregation. This process will lead in April to the 
country's first all-race elections, expected to be won by Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress (ANC).

  [Text] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
challenged his U.S. counterpart by expressing his preference for 
the Dessalinian [from Dessalines, Haitian freedom fighter, 
credited with winning independence for Haiti] methods. In a 
statement last week during his Canadian tour, Aristide, elected 
on 16 December 1990, reiterated what his recommendation of the 
previous month: Apply `Operation Iron Cuts Iron' and opt for 
Dessalinian methods to dislodge the military from command. 
  President Clinton and his colleagues keenly disapproved of 
these statements, believing that the crisis should not be 
resolved through violence. President Aristide responded that so 
far, diplomacy has not yielded the expected results and it is 
now time to forego the Toussaint Louverture [former Haitian 
general known as the father of Haitian independence] methods, 
and adopt those used by Dessalines.

  [Text] A national conference held without the participation 
of all sectors risks being just one more conference, according 
to the National Congress of Democratic Movements, CONACOM. 
  In a press release published 31 January, CONACOM called for 
the holding of a true national conference and proposed a 
schedule, including five steps, for the holding of this 
conference. 
  CONACOM says that such a conference must be preceded by: 
  A. The formation of a political coalition among the 
political 
  groups that agree to work jointly for a way out of the 
  crisis; 
  B. The designation by President Aristide of a new prime 
minister; 
  C. The formation of a government of national concord; 
  D. The holding of a sociopolitical rally; and 
  E. The holding of a national conference following Aristide's 
return to Haiti. 
  CONACOM rejects an arrangement precipitated in form and time 
[as heard] and invites all the country's sons to be aware of the 
seriousness of the crisis.

  [Text] The various national conference projects are not 
well regarded by some political parties. Hubert De Ronceray is 
still in favor of the application of Article 149 of the 
Constitution to solve the political crisis. The leader of MDN 
[Mobilization for National Development] warns against what he 
calls the newborn national conference industry. Professor De 
Ronceray who reviewed news highlights for the month of January, 
stopped on three facts: 
  First, the congress at the national theater. Second, the 
decision of Haitian employers to shut down commerce and industry 
from 28 January to 9 February. Third, the new industry of 
national conferences. 
  Hubert De Ronceray expressed his concern that certain 
initiatives have the effect of surgery that immediately kills 
the patient instead of saving him. While condemning the embargo 
which, according to MDN, has wrecked the economic and social 
institutions and is forcing 5 million people to despair or 
revolt, Hubert De Ronceray has urged the country's powerful 
forces to remain vigilant around Article 149 of the 1987 
Constitution and avoid the false path born of confusion and 
despair.

  [Text] ...December 1993 that the assassination of Antoine 
Izmery [Haitian businessman and Aristide supporter killed on 11 
September 1993] was allegedly worked out meticulously at the 
home of former Senate President Thomas Eddy Dupiton, an 
out-and-out [Aristide] adversary close to Colonel Joseph Michel 
Francois. 
  According to the weekly [JEUNE AFRIQUE], Senator Dupiton 
allegedly accommodated the killers the day before the crime. 
  Ebrane Cadet, first secretary of the legitimate office of 
the 
Senate of the Republic, says in a letter to Colin Granderson, 
head of the international civilian mission, that he is alarmed 
about a document prepared by a special UN unit according to 
which Sen. Dupiton allegedly prepared the assassination of 
Antoine Izmery. Cadet asks Granderson for an explanation 
regarding this document.

  [Text] Part of the Senate of the Republic does not favor 
the return of the civilian mission to Haiti. Senator Bernard 
Sansaricque acts as spokesman for this faction of the Senate, 
which is composed of legislators from the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion and those elected during the contested 18 
January elections. Bernard Sansaricque also supports the 
formation of a new office in the Senate to expedite a solution 
to the crisis, considering that the current office has thus far 
worked to block the institutions: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] [Sansaricque] Between 10 August 
and the present, Firmin Jean-Louis held two sessions in the 
Senate. He cannot blame that on the 18 January senators. They 
all respected the New York pact until 11 January. So he cannot 
blame anyone but himself. I think he was a senator with a 
well-defined mission, the mission of obstructing the country, 
blocking the Senate of the Republic, because one cannot be a 
president of the Senate -- in addition to his regular salary, he 
is earning an additional $1,500 a month. He just obstructs 
progress. He travels to see Aristide abroad while the country is 
collapsing. 
  It is therefore a situation that must be solved quickly in 
the Senate of the Republic. There is an ad hoc office, led by 
Sen. Ebrane, working right now to find a solution to unite the 
Senate and solve the problem that the country is facing. 
  [Reporter Renois] Bernard Sansaricque, when you say unite 
the 
Senate, do you mean to unite it with the legislators who were 
elected during the 18 January elections, which are still being 
contested? 
  [Sansaricque] They are contested. However, even the UN and 
the OAS recognized them, since they asked them: Will the 
legislators elected on 18 January please remain outside. Those 
legislators remained outside the crisis until the New York pact 
was no longer valid for them, at which time they returned to 
parliament. They kept their word. 
  [Renois] Does the New York pact officially exist today? Are 
we still under the New York pact in parliament? 
  [Sansaricque] Certainly some senators will tell you that the 
New York pact exists. If you ask me, the New York Pact never 
existed and still does not exist. 
  [Renois] Another aspect in the Senate question: I read in 
the 
December issue of JEUNE AFRIQUE, an African magazine, that some 
senators, namely Thomas Eddy Dupiton, was involved in the 
assassination of Antoine Izmery. Has the Senate considered this 
case? 
  [Sansaricque] Of course we are studying this file. I just 
brought the letter that we wrote to Colin Granderson to Radio 
Metropole to let it be known that there really is a UN/OAS file 
on the Izmery case which involves Sen. Dupiton. The Senate will 
want to have it for necessary purposes. If there is a file, they 
must present it. A magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, or any other 
magazine cannot just accuse senators... 
  [Renois] Did JEUNE AFRIQUE quote the UN report on that 
matter? 
  [Sansaricque] They spoke of the UN report which they say was 
given to the U.S. intelligence service. For such a serious 
matter, the Senate of the Republic should study this file. The 
UN and the OAS should therefore give it to us for our own use. 
  [Renois] Last question, Sen. Bernard Sansaricque: There is a 
crisis. How and when do you, as a senator of the Republic, see 
this crisis being solved? 
  [Sansaricque] I see that the crisis can be solved as soon as 
the Senate has a serious office. The senator named Firmin 
Jean-Louis, who was appointed by Caputo and applauded by some 
senators, and who had the defined mission of blocking the Senate 
of the Republic, blocking the country as a whole and making the 
people suffer as they are now suffering, must be stopped. We 
must have a decent office, a working office that respects the 
mandate granted to us. [end recording]

  [Text] On 31 January, downtown Port-au-Prince's big stores 
widely adhered to the call for a 12-day strike issued by more 
than a dozen employers associations to demand that the embargo 
be lifted. The stores selling luxury goods, located mainly in 
the area between Bonne Foi and Pavee Streets, adhered to the 
strike, whereas most of the stores specializing in the sale of 
electronic parts, fabrics, and shoes conducted business as 
usual. For the informal businesses and open-air marketplaces 
too, it was business as usual; the grocery stores and banks, 
which adhered to the spirit of the movement, respected the new 
work schedule that had been set. 
  One of the nation's principal employers associations, the 
Haitian Manufacturers Association, ADIH, publicly dissociated 
itself from the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's 
movement, explaining that the movement did not have precise 
objectives -- or alternatives in case of failure. 
  In Les Cayes, Haiti's third biggest city, stores conducted 
business as usual. A Les Cayes businessman told the HAITI PRESS 
AGENCY that he was not at all involved in the events that led to 
the imposition of the strike.

  [Text] Over 8,000 gallons of fuel are currently stored at 
the UN/OAS mission garage in Delmas. When interviewed by Signal 
FM on 31 January, Eric Falt, the UN spokesman in Haiti, said 
this fuel is not humanitarian fuel but rather the mission's 
reserve. 
  Asked where this fuel comes from and where it is stored, 
Falt 
said the administrative and garage service controls the storage 
of such products. He explained that the UN mission does not have 
any particular facility to be supplied with fuel. Falt (?denied) 
any connection between this operation and the arrival in 
Port-au-Prince last week of approximately 30 members of the UN 
mission. This is not a redeployment of the mission in Haiti, he 
stated.

<F P=106> [Report by Ericka Ramirez from the "National" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta pointed out 
that the National Police are capable of ensuring unrestrained 
traffic and will provide all necessary protection to every 
transportation sector worker who decides to continue providing 
service to the community. 
  Minister Mendieta added that the National Transportation 
Commission [CNT] must honor agreements signed between the 
government and the various transportation chambers and 
federations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta indicated that 
the National Police will work toward completely normalizing the 
capital city. As an example of regions where unrest persists, 
the government minister pointed toward Rubenia, Ciudad Sandino, 
and, as of today, the Metro Center sector where the interference 
of Tomas Borge, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Force] 
National Board member, has been proven. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] I believe that since it was Mr. 
Borge himself who pointed to the need for a demonstration, such 
as the one that took place today and which was supported by 
Sandinist groups, he should then also guarantee, just as I 
personally requested, that there will be no further protests 
such as those that have been occurring. Therefore, I believe 
that if he is willing to defend the demands of these groups, 
then he must also be willing to prevent these groups from 
overstepping boundaries established by the law. [end recording] 
  Mendieta confirmed having confiscated weapons from the 
transportation sector workers currently supporting the strike. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] This morning we seized several 
weapons and arrested several people. We know they are also 
using some type of homemade mortar. The police have very 
specific information on this issue. We hope they do not attempt 
to use these weapons and that we can end this situation without 
further problems. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  The government minister indicated that CNT spokesman Gustavo 
Aguiluz could face charges because of his constant calls to 
violence, thus threatening citizens' safety. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] If necessary, he will have to 
answer for that decision to the courts. I also understand that 
some of the persons who were directly mentioned by Mr. Aguiluz 
are preparing to file lawsuits against him, forcing him to prove 
the charges he made. [end recording] 
  The National Police have coordinated security measures for 
the members of the federations and chambers who are still 
operating in order to guarantee their safety and security. 
  [Begin Mendieta recording] We are in a position to guarantee 
the free movement of their vehicles and the assurance that their 
offices will be secure. I would like to be absolutely clear in 
stating that we are going to act as forcefully as the law allows 
to prevent any attempts against these persons just because they 
decided to sign an agreement with the government. The 
government is not going to take any steps beyond these 
agreements; on the contrary, I repeat, the CNT must abide by 
these commitments. [end recording] 
  Public order will be diligently guarded by the state's 
security organizations.

  [Text] Managua, 1 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Sandinist 
transportation sector, organized under the National 
Transportation Commission (CNT), today continued to block some 
of Managua's main streets and avenues, where incidents have 
caused damage, according to various sources. 
  The tension surrounding the indefinite transportation 
strike, 
which is in its 10th day, decreased at dawn today after strike 
leaders promised police not to cause disturbances during their 
demonstrations. The Sandinist transportation sector is 
insisting on its demands that the government "freeze" fuel 
prices, abolish the sector's taxes, and execute the plan to 
reorganize transportation in the nation. 
  Hundreds of buses and taxis are still parked at the four 
entrances to the traffic circle at the Metro Center on the 
southwestern periphery of the capital, blocking the normal flow 
of private vehicles. Some 200 meters from the traffic circle 
are Nicaragua's main police headquarters and the Metropolitan 
Cathedral. The concentration of buses and taxis in this area has 
forced the suspension of bus services which, since last Sunday, 
had provided the public with almost five routes. 
  Gustavo Aguiluz, CNT spokesman, which called the strike on 
24 
January, today asserted that the CNT will continue trying to 
work out with the government the possibility of a dialogue to 
end the protest. Nevertheless, Aguiluz said the strike will 
continue if the government refuses to fulfill the agreements 
signed in September, which ended a nationwide transportation 
strike that had resulted in two deaths, dozens of casualties and 
arrests, and the loss of some $16 million.

  [Text] Managua, 1 Feb (ACAN EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government today announced it had reached an agreement with 
Sandinist transportation leaders to end the strike initiated 
nine days ago. The Sandinist transportation workers agreed 
tonight to end the national transportation strike "to contribute 
to the nation's stability." Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo 
said the workers' agreement came in exchange for the 
government's willingness to negotiate in the coming days the 
demands that prompted the strike. 
  The minister agreed to hold multilateral and bilateral 
meetings with the sector's businessmen to discuss the strikers' 
demands, which include freezing fuel prices and restructuring 
the transportation sector. 
  Lacayo, President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law, and leaders 
of the National Transportation Commission (CNT-Sandinist), 
announced the end of the strike tonight during a news conference 
at the Presidency.

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by Panamanian President Guillermo </F>
Endara from the Palace of the Herons in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] Good morning, everyone. After spending several days 
and weeks contemplating the one issue that interests you so very 
much -- an issue you ask me about each and every day -- last 
night, I came to a decision. That is when I wrote a letter 
addressed to all ministers of state. This letter was sent to 
all ministers early this morning -- first by fax, and then 
followed by the original. 
  The letter says the following: I must begin by stating what 
I have said many times: The current cabinet members are not only 
exemplary officials, but I have also developed a close 
friendship with each of them. Nevertheless, circumstances of 
which you all are aware have prompted me to take this action, 
which I would have preferred to avoid. 
  After thinking about this issue, I have concluded that I 
must 
reorganize my cabinet. In other countries and for other 
countries, this is a frequent procedure. For me, however, this 
situation cannot be described in terms of my personal feelings. 
Therefore, I, as president of the Republic, ask that you resign 
from your post as minister of state, thereby enabling me to have 
the chance to appoint a cabinet which, under the circumstances, 
would better serve the interests of the Republic of Panama. 
  Because I am not naming a new cabinet at this time, I would 
be most grateful if you could remain in your post and attend to 
your duties, for which you will have my support. 
  I thank you in advance, and I reiterate my friendship. 
  Now, before taking your questions, I would like to answer 
two... [pauses] some of them. First, you probably are wondering 
when I will appoint the new cabinet. The answer is I do not 
have a deadline for appointing a new cabinet. This is an issue 
I will think about constantly over the next few days, and I will 
make an announcement to the media when I decide on the new 
cabinet. 
  The second question I am sure you will ask -- indeed, I want 
to save you the trouble of asking it -- is whether I already 
have some candidates to fill the posts. The answer is no; I do 
not have any names to give you officially. 
  This whole time I have been mulling over this issue. I have 
thought about some people, but I have not made a decision. At 
this point, I am unable to give you any names. I will announce 
all of the names when I select my new cabinet. 
  I will now be glad to take your questions, but first I must 
say that nearly all of the ministers have tendered their 
resignations. All of them are exemplary citizens who are my 
friends. I appreciate them very much. This is a situation 
that, as I said before, is normal in some countries. I never 
like making cabinet changes, as you are well aware. 
  [Unidentified moderator] We will now begin the question and 
answer period. We will begin with colleague Luis Alberto 
Henriquez of RPC Radio. 
  [Henriquez] Good morning, Mr. President. First, I would like 
to ask this: What is the objective of your new cabinet? Will 
the new ministers be members of your party of [word indistinct]? 
  [Endara] You are all aware of the reason. It is a situation 
we have been experiencing for a number of days. You have all 
awaited anxiously for me to make a decision. 
  I told all of you that at the opportune time... [pauses] I 
first told you I was mulling over the matter. Then I told you 
that at an appropriate time I would inform all of you together, 
as I am doing now. The reasons are obvious. These are the 
changes that have taken place within the political scene. I 
would have preferred that these situations did not affect my 
government, but as in any government or any democratic 
government in the world, political changes have repercussions 
within the government. 
  As to whether all of the cabinet members will be members of 
my party, I reiterate that I have not made a decision on the 
names of the people I will pick for my cabinet. In principle, 
it is not my intention that all cabinet members belong to my 
party. My intention is that independent individuals and those 
from some other parties should participate. This is my 
intention, but I have not made the final decision.

  [Text] The entire National Unity Mission [MUN] leadership 
organized a news conference this morning to call on political 
parties such as Papa Egoro and Solidarity, as well as civic 
organizations and other business groups, to support an agreement 
that would lead to urgently needed changes. In addition, MUN 
called for an alliance that would continue not only up to the 
elections, but all through the 1994-1999 period. It also called 
for the government to adopt programs prepared jointly by the 
parties and aimed at developing the country. 
  [Begin MUN presidential candidate David Guerra recording] 
[words indistinct] has decided to make an urgent and direct call 
to all those new political parties that decided to organize with 
the intention of bringing some type of hope to this country. We 
urge them to take on the historical commitment the country 
demands and to come forward with their respective programs to 
make up one single driving force, free of any politics, party 
interests, resources or power dealings, and guided by the 
socio-economic development this country -- which is shouting for 
an opportunity -- desperately needs. 
  MUN would also like to call on every group, including all 
those unions who have looked in vain for concrete answers to 
their just and unpostponable demands, the teachers union, the 
IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] and 
INTEL [National Institute of Telecommunications] workers, 
transportation sector workers, doctors, students, nurses, and 
all other citizens groups to abandon all neutral and silent 
positions which, if they persist, will only bring more harm to 
this country. We urge these groups to make up their minds today 
to actively participate in an agreement that will determine this 
country's fate. 
  We would like to call on the country's economic forces to 
join this historic effort to save democracy and establish the 
foundations of an administration that will really understand the 
people's needs. This will ensure social stability, which is so 
needed if the country expects to accomplish the economic 
development it deserves. 
  MUN, as one of the new parties hinted, opens its doors to 
that national agreement the country desperately needs. MUN is 
aware that it is a big risk for any political party to 
participate in the elections on its own. Although we are not 
apprehensive about participating on our own, MUN is responsible 
enough to acknowledge that every new party is obligated to 
provide the country with the new answers and alternatives it 
needs. 
  That is our communique and position at this time. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast; passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential candidate 
[for the Arnulfist Party, PA], would be willing to decline her 
candidacy in favor of a great alliance of all civilist parties 
of the country. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber thus reiterated what 
she proposed weeks ago in David when she called for a great 
alliance against the Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] "I don't think Panamanians want to 
return to the past. We must therefore call for this great 
alliance of all parties. Let's sit down and discuss what is 
best for Panama, not what is best for personal or economic 
interests." 
  Apparently the difficulty lies in the absence of identifying 
a person to unify all these forces. 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] "Let's all sit down and look for this 
person, just as we did in 1989. 
  [Alvarado] "Even if it is not you? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] "Even if it is not me." 
  Moscoso de Gruber said it is time to leave behind the 
arguments and political ambitions that have so harmed democracy. 
If we must hold a new convention, we are willing to hold it, 
added the leader. 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] "There are seven candidates for the 
presidency of the Republic, and we think there should be only 
two." 
  Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber made these statements during a 
meeting of the parties that form the so-called Democratic 
Alliance, alliance representatives commented later. 
  [Alfredo Arias of the PA; identified by caption] "I think 
that when we talk about a great national alliance, it has to be 
based on the alliance's majority party. 
  [Alvarado] "What do you think of a possible unification of 
criteria? 
  [Roberto Aleman of the Liberal Party; identified by caption] 
"The truth is that I do not know. Right now I think it would be 
very difficult, but it could happen. 
  [Alvarado] "Would you support it? 
  [Aleman] "I don't know. I would have to propose it to the 
party's national executive committee. 
  [Joaquin Franco of the Authentic Liberal Party; identified 
by 
caption] "I see no such possibility at this time. Mrs. Gruber 
represents the Democratic Alliance. She made some statements 
this morning, which you have already heard. We are still 
awaiting responses to those statements."

island also might be interested in wooden prefabricated houses, 
several varieties of lumber, and soybean flour and oil. 
  Misiones, in turn, might send to that country people who 
need 
a very highly developed medical system, and Cuban professionals 
would advise the province's doctors. 
  The aspects of the agreement are being studied by Cuban 
officials and a Misiones Province delegation headed by 
provincial Health Minister Victor Hugo Martinez. 
  During his stay in Cuba, which will last one week, Puerta 
plans to meet President Fidel Castro.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces leadership 
are watching with concern the extensive visit being made to 
England by Chilean Defense Minister-designate Edmundo Perez Yoma. 
  Sources close to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and the top 
military commands told CLARIN there is "some surprise" over the 
official invitation made by the British Government to a minister 
who has not been installed yet. 
  When Eduardo Frei is inaugurated in Chile in March, Perez 
Yoma, who is one of the future president's right-hand men, will 
replace current Defense Minister Patricio Rojas. The sources 
said it is unusual for a minister-designate to be officially 
invited by London. 
  The sources also said that the extension of Perez Yoma's 
visit to London, which is a seven-day visit that ends on 2 
February, "is somehow improper." 
  In contrast to such an extensive visit, it should be 
recalled 
that the future Chilean minister was in Argentina for only a 
brief time, a protocol visit. 
  Perez Yoma also held high-level meetings in London, 
including 
a meeting with British Secretary of State for Defense Malcolm 
Rifkind and top military officials. 
  The sources added that Perez Yoma was also in Parliament, 
visited military units, and gave a lecture in Canning House that 
was attended by the main economic groups linked to arms 
production. 
  The Defense Ministry sources took note of Perez Yoma's 
comments in public during his tour. Analysts close to Camilion 
detected that, in general, Perez Yoma gave "known points of 
view" on Chilean foreign policy and put emphasis on some 
economic aspects such as the Chilean desire to join NAFTA, the 
free trade agreement sponsored by the United States. 
  Such concern by the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces 
over the Chilean minister-designate's visit reveals that the 
consequences of Chilean behavior during the 1982 Malvinas war 
and the differences over the border conflicts with Chile still 
prevail. 
  The sources indicated, however, that the latest meetings 
with 
Chilean Foreign Minister Patricio Rojas within the framework of 
the joint declaration signed by Presidents Carlos Menem and 
Patricio Aylwin in 1990 contributed to strengthening relations 
between the two countries in the military field. 
  The sources also linked Perez Yoma's long visit to England 
with the recent visit to the Malvinas by five Chilean 
congressmen. 
  On their way to the Malvinas, the Chilean congressmen 
stopped 
in the Lago del Desierto region, which is under international 
arbitration as a result of a border conflict between Argentina 
and Chile.

  [Text] Dissident Colorado Deputy Walter Bower yesterday 
harshly criticized President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and warned 
that it would be "a crime against the fatherland" for us to 
reject "this type of aid, in a country like ours, which is in 
dire need of everything" (alluding to the offer for U.S. 
military engineers to build schools, roads, and a clinic in San 
Pedro). 
  Bower was thus criticizing Wasmosy for planning to reject 
the 
offer made by the United States, which in turn has asked to be 
allowed to stage long-range military deployment exercises in our 
country. 
  Bower said: "In a country in dire need of everything, where 
the people lack basic standards of living and where any handout 
can bring relief, it would be absurd and extremely foolish for 
us to pointlessly indulge in the luxury of turning down this 
type of aid." 
  Bower added: "Formal topics (regarding the Paraguayan-U.S. 
draft agreement) may be resolved, and questions may be addressed 
to the U.S. Embassy. We cannot, however, deprive our people of 
$12 million in aid, which would bring education, water, and 
health to them." 
  "It would be a crime against the fatherland to reject this 
aid from the American people. Congress has the moral obligation 
to make this aid possible, because it would bring relief to 
those fellow countrymen who are living under inhuman conditions." 
  Deputy Bower is a notary public who is a member of the Luis 
Maria Argana-led Colorado faction. He dismissed rumors that 
either alleged intelligence work or a drug enforcement operation 
would be surreptitiously conducted during the deployment of the 
U.S. forces. 
  Bower said: "There is nothing behind this. What could 600 
men do there, except work? If some people are afraid of the 
U.S. presence here, it is perhaps because they have something to 
hide." 
  Bower also reported that he and other lawmakers had talked 
to 
some senior officers who conveyed their support for Washington's 
request. 
  Boser said: "We have talked to several senior officers who 
fully endorse this operation. In this case we cannot even raise 
the issue of violation of sovereignty, because we are not at war 
with the United States." 
  He added: "And if they want to snoop around for drugs, let 
them do so. We are tired of wearing the label of drug 
traffickers only because of two or three criminals who act as 
though they own this country."

  [Text] Lima -- The governments of Paraguay and Peru agreed 
to combat the improper use, production, and illegal trafficking 
of drugs and psychotropic substances. This agreement was signed 
on 31 January by Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez 
Boettner and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg 
Schreiber. 
  The agreement's purpose is to promote cooperation between 
the 
governments of Paraguay and Peru in order to prevent and combat 
with greater efficiency the illegal trafficking and abuse of 
drugs and psychotropic substances by harmonizing their policies 
and developing coordinated actions and programs. 
  In order to fulfill the agreement's objectives, the two 
countries' pertinent services will exchange information about 
preventive measures against drug abuse in their respective 
territories. 
  They also will prepare joint strategies to prevent drug 
abuse, the illegal production of drugs, and to repress drug 
trafficking. They also will exchange information about illegal 
trafficking and the use of precursors and basic chemicals, 
illegal trafficking routes, and the modus operandi of drug 
traffickers. 
  The two countries' foreign ministers have likewise signed 
another agreement for the reciprocal protection and promotion of 
investments, wishing to intensify economic cooperation to the 
two countries' benefit. The document states that each country 
will guarantee the investments and free transfer of payments 
connected with these investments, especially profits, loan 
mortgages, and others made by the other country. 
  Ramirez Boettner and Goldenberg Schreiber also signed a 
cooperation agreement between the Diplomatic and Consular 
Academies of Asuncion and Lima. In turn, Presidents Wasmosy and 
Fujimori signed a joint declaration in which they reasserted the 
friendship between the governments and peoples of Paraguay and 
Peru.

  [Text] Celedin -- President Alberto Fujimori denied 
meeting Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman Reinoso in his cell 
at the Callao naval base, as was reported in the media a few 
days ago. 
  The press report states that during the meeting it was 
agreed 
that from now on the government will use the criminal 
organization's financial resources for purposes other than 
subversive activities. [sentence as publsihed] 
  Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold 
a 
meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and 
ill-intended," but did not refer to the media. 
  Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal 
of Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was 
established he had clear connections with terrorist groups, 
especially the Shining Path. 
  He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean 
Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its 
investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations 
will continue simultaneously." 
  The chief of state had a busy agenda in this province in 
Cajamarca Department, where he arrived at noon on 24 January 
with the Canadian ambassador and Transportation Minister Dante 
Cordoba and Agriculture Minister Absalon Vasquez. 
  The president dedicated an irrigation canal the region's 
farmers have been longing for for 56 years. Some 2,000 farmers 
will benefit from the system that will expand the agricultural 
zone toward the mountain range. 
  Fujimori also offered an ambulance to the local health 
center 
and to repair schools that are in a poor shape.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Secret Document: Shining Path Uses </F>
Peace Agreement to Stall for Time," which was "approved" by the 
Shining Path Central Committee -- first 10 paragraphs are 
introductory editorial explanation] 
  [Text] For the sole purpose of reporting the events 
occurring in the country, LA REPUBLICA publishes the following 
Shining Path document which reveals the intentions of [Shining 
Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso's followers with respect to 
the peace treaty that they are negotiating with government 
officials at the Callao Naval Base prison. 
  The Maoists believe that just because they are talking with 
government representatives does not mean they have to lay down 
their arms, and that the cease fire is only temporary until 
conditions are ripe for restarting hostilities. 
  Specialists believe the following document may have been 
written by Abimael Guzman himself. It was approved by Central 
Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote 
Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez, and 
Angelica Sala, who are all imprisoned. 
  The contents of the document, the quotes from books, and the 
reference to recent facts -- like the referendum and Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan, reveal that the author -- or authors 
-- have been allowed to watch television, to read newspapers and 
magazines and, as in the case of Guzman, allowed to consult a 
library. 
  The manuscript serves to compel the majority of prisoners 
endorse the "fight for a peace agreement" slogan. The document 
reveals that the bases of a popular war have not been 
specifically abandoned. On the contrary, referring to the 
murders and attacks that stained the country with blood over the 
past 13 years, Guzman boasts having directed "the largest 
revolutionary social movement in Peruvian history." 
  He defends his current decision to "fight for a peace 
agreement" on the grounds that the first stage of the "world 
revolution" has ended. This may be a strategy to gain time, 
through "diplomatic language," and to temporarily suspend 
terrorist actions until the "new stage" of the world revolution 
begins. 
  The document is also a call to his followers "to stick very 
close" to the masses in the style of the political work carried 
out by the Shining Path in Ayacucho during the 1960's and 
1970's, which served as the basis for the start of the armed 
struggle in May 1980. 
  The document gives the predictions of Abimael Guzman about 
the probable split of his organization as well as the call "to 
set the basis" for the Shining Path Second Congress (the first 
congress was held in 1988). 
  LA REPUBLICA discloses this important and unusual Shining 
Path document, making clear that it does not share its content, 
so that the country may learn the proposals by Shining Path 
leaders during the negotiations for the Peace Agreement. 
<H5>  Key Ideas </H5>
  1. The MLM-PG [Marx, Lenin, Mao - Thoughts of Gonzalo] is 
undefeated and imperishable (it was never defeated), because it 
is the ideology of the last class of history. 
  2. We are Communists, Maoists, soldiers of the proletariat, 
our essence is Maoism, wherever we fight and with the arms that 
we have. 
  We should carefully bear in mind what Mao has taught: "The 
next 50-100 years... new things, new problems, which must 
consequently be resolved." 
  It is necessary to continue to play our role, there is fear 
of making a decision. 
  Those who have always fought us still do so. Why? 
  3. The MLM-PG is our special weapon... Bear in mind what was 
agreed upon at the Third Plenary Session (III S.P.). We are 
confronting new problems, which should be resolved by using the 
Thoughts of Gonzalo (PG). 
  4. Adopt the new decision and the new definition, and fight 
for them. 
  These four key ideas should be at the foundation of our 
conception of things. 
<H6>  TEXTS AND DOCUMENTS </H6>
  Our conception, our ideology has a base: Marxism. It should 
be used in our concrete circumstances. 

  -  Quotes of Mao. 
  -  Chapter V ("War and Peace"). This should be 
studied and applied. 
  -  "...This ML [Marxist-Leninist] Principle of 
the Revolution: Has Universal Validity." 
  The principle is not being questioned. The point is how to 
apply it in concrete circumstances. (Bear in mind the experience 
of the 1960's and 1970's). 
  The party, the organized masses, and the public have created 
the conditions for the Beginning of the Armed Struggle (ILA). 

  -  Quote No. 1 from Chapter V: "War is the highest level of 
struggle to resolve the contradictions between the classes..." 
  "War begins and develops in specific circumstances. If 
circumstances change, the method of struggle should be changed. 
[no closing quotation marks as published] 

  -  Quote No. 3 [order as published] from Chapter V: "The 
classification of fair and unfair wars, what to do when there is 
an unfair war... The way to oppose an unfair war is to prevent 
it from breaking out, and -- if it breaks out -- wage a fair war 
to counter the unfair war, whenever possible." The "whenever 
possible" is also valid for us when we face an unfair war (even 
if it is a response to our action). This should not be read 
just from an abstract point of view, its application should also 
be understood). 
  -  Quote No. 2 of Chapter V: Relation between War 
and Politics: "Until the obstacle is totally removed, war will 
continue..." (text of 34 [not further specified]; contradictions 
are analyzed in 37). See Chun Chin's conversations in 1946, 
Volume IV; it implies continuing with the democratic revolution. 
  Did Mao Zedong deny The Principle? No, he applied it in a 
creative way in the wake of the war against Japan. Public 
opinion was in favor of peace. Mao taught that public opinion 
had to be taken into account. Thus, he decided to hold talks. 
Important concessions were made. Where did the problem lie? 
Following the signing of the agreement between Mao -- who did 
so on behalf of the PCCh [Chinese Communist Party] -- and the 
KMT [Kuomintang, the People's National Party] led by Chiang 
Kai-Shek, the latter violated the agreement and launched a 
counteroffensive. But he did not violate any principle. In 
general one should not read without trying to see the practical 
application of what one is reading. It is therefore possible to 
say that politics is a bloodless war whereas war is bloody 
politics. 
<H5>  The People's Law: "Fight, fail, ... cause social unrest." </H5>
  This great Class Struggle Law takes precedence over the Laws 
of Imperialism and reaction, and the People. [sentence as 
published] 
  Class struggle is the great and ongoing class war waged 
against politicians that has two types: 
  1. Bloodless -- "politics is a bloodless war." 
  2. Bloody -- "war is bloody politics." 
  These are different aspects of the great political war, 
which 
is the class struggle. Class struggle is now the development of 
a contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution, the 
essence of which is to fight and cause social unrest. These two 
laws constitute the great Class Struggle Law, which is a 
contradiction, the terms of which are -- on one hand -- to cause 
social unrest, which sows the seeds of ruin and -- on the other 
hand -- to fight, which in turn leads to victory. Failures are 
sure to be met in both cases -- while old ideas lead to ruin, 
new ones lead to victory. This is a great inexorable law. One 
should not be afraid of failure, the important thing is to fight 
-- hence the importance of the great Marxist truth -- 
"Revolution is Worthwhile." It is of utmost importance to study 
this and then put it into practice. 
  Quotes -- page 237 [as published] 
  Quotes -- page 225 [as published] It is of paramount 
importance not to be subjective, unilateral, and superficial. 
  Subjective = not taking circumstances into account; only 
consider the overall picture. 
<H6>  Chapter VIII. Left-wing Movement: Communism's Infantile 
Disease </H6>
  "Communists are Communists because throughout the 
intermediate stages and throughout all the commitments -- not 
the ones taken by them but by the progress of the historical 
development process -- they clearly see and unerringly strive to 
achieve their final objective, namely, the abolition of classes 
and the establishment of a society in which private ownership of 
land and the means of production no longer exist." 
<H5>  Six Slogans </H5>
  1. Let Us Struggle for a Peace Agreement! (Leading 
political guideline) 
  2. Become the Standard-Bearers for Our Cause! 
  3. Take on and Combat for the New Great Decision and the 
Great Definition! 
  4. Close Ranks behind the PG and the Central Leadership! 
  5. Become the Standard-Bearers for the New Great Decision 
and Definition! 
  6. Glory to M-L-M [Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]! 
  What is a Communist? 
  Do we understand the historical process, are we objective or 
subjective people? Are we in control of what is happening or 
does reality have us in its grip? Communists see clearly 
(though there may be disorder, confusion). 
  "... The 33 Blanco followers [not further identified] are 
Communists because they think they can skip intermediate stages 
... and that the seizure of power will happen in the next few 
days -- they are absolutely certain about this. Once power is 
seized, Communism will be imposed the following day. If this 
cannot be effected at once, then they are not Communists." 
  What childish naivete it is to use one's impatience as a 
theoretically convincing argument! 
  Naturally, very young and inexperienced revolutionaries, as 
well as little bourgeois revolutionaries --even those of a very 
respectable age and with vast experience -- believe it is 
extremely dangerous, incomprehensible, and erroneous to "reach 
agreements." 
  Many sophists, petty politicians ... think along the same 
lines, what do they do every day? -- commitments to capitulation. 
  "And yet, proletarians who have gone through the school of 
numerous strikes ... are able to assimilate the deep truth." 
  "PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH" = Corresponds to contradiction; it is 
a 
winding road. 
  "HISTORICAL TRUTH" = Development process of revolutions, 
like 
class struggle. 
  "POLITICAL TRUTH" = The day-to-day struggle to come to 
power, 
it expresses this need. 
  "PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH" = How it is understood from a class 
standpoint; To see the difference between commitments derived 
from the present state of affairs ... commitments that do not 
lessen in the least the revolutionary negation or the 
willingness to continue with the struggle as a result of the 
commitment that the workers have taken. To differentiate the 
latter from subjective commitments that serve a particular 
interest, commitments of traitors who seek to safeguard their 
own interests ... 
  Strike breakers also make commitments! Their cowardice, 
their desire to adulate.... for crumbs... seeking the praise of 
the capitalists. 
  Not all commitments are simple, there are international and 
national commitments. We must assess the two situations! 
Lenin's words are more directly applied to our case: "No 
Commitment" is absurd. 
  What is a mature Class Party that deserves to be called 
such, 
and which has leaders who deserve to be called such? .... It 
consists of winning over, through prolonged efforts, all 
representatives of a given class who are capable of thinking. 
Lenin: In any class there are and always will be ... 
representatives of that class that do not think, that are 
incapable of thinking for themselves, otherwise Imperialism 
would not be the oppressor of classes that it is. The leaders 
are the ones who have more knowledge, more experience, and the 
necessary political sagacity to achieve a prompt and fair 
solution to complex political problems (To have the necessary 
self-sacrifice to do so; not just to know things, but also to 
make decisions).

<H6>  I. A NEW DECISION AND A NEW DEFINITION </H6>
  1. A stage of the Revolution is over. We must fight for 
a future wave of the World Proletariat Revolution (R.P.M.). A 
grandiose and unforgettable stage of the R.P.M. is over. 
  There is an International Political Withdrawal (Strategic 
and 
Global), this stage has left us with three great banners: 
Marx-Lenin-Mao, which show that the MLM is unwithering, 
unconquerable. 
  Engels in 1891 in his "Introduction to the Civil War in 
France", taught us that there would be an R.P.M. withdrawal and 
that it was impossible to conquer power. It was necessary to 
resolve the issues through new forms of struggles and 
organization, mainly military issues. He makes an assessment of 
50 years of R.P.M.; there was a general political withdrawal. 
This is what Marx refers to when he established the First 
International (Workers International Association). The 
Communist Party Manifesto and the Workers International 
Association are different. 
  In 1891, imperialism was being established, a new division 
of 
the world was underway. For 30 years, power could not be 
conquered, and the issues concerning the forms of struggle and 
organization could not be resolved. Things are different now. 
In 1917, Lenin resolved this, and in 1949 Mao resolved the 
problem of the road to the Revolution in semi-feudal, 
semi-colonial, and bureaucratic capitalist countries. In the 
Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution (1966-76) he resolved the 
problem of the continuation of the socialist revolution under 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 

  -  Mao: Chapters on charts in the first quotation proposes 
the training of people to continue. 
  -  In that way we previously 
maintained that the World Revolution Offensive Strategy 
[Ofensiva Estrategica de la Revolucion Mundial] (OERM) started 
in the 1980's. Today we have developed and we believe that the 
period 1976-80 is a very short time. The OERM starts with the 
Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution because it occurs at the 
height of the R.P.M. and the National Liberation Movement 
[Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional] (MLN), under the leadership 
of the proletariat. In so doing, Mao seeks to develop and 
expand the R.P.M. 
  -  See Mao, Quotes chapter on Imperialism, page. 
83: There are two kinds of wind, the East wind prevails. In 
1957, page 80: "Imperialism Will Not Live Long." 
  Make the effort to understand the great stages, and remember 
Mao: "The next 50 to 100 years...," that is from the year 2010 
to the year 2060; therefore, a new wave is developing. It must 
be understood within the framework of the development of the 
contradiction between Restoration and Counter Restoration. We 
must consider the historical background, the Development of the 
Class Struggle Law. It took the Bourgeoisie Revolution 300 
years to take hold. In the 16th Century the Revolution took 
hold in Holland. It was later crushed by Spain in the 17th 
Century. In England the victory of the Bourgeoisie Revolution 
was achieved in two stages: The Revolution led by Oliver 
Cromwell in 1640 (he failed); and in 1688 the "The Glorious 
Revolution" was victorious: Just 48 years separate the first 
revolution from the second. In the 18th Century, there was the 
U.S. Independence in 1776; in France the revolution succeeded in 
1789. England became the First Power of the World after the 
defeat of the "Invincible Armada" (Naval Battle); It took almost 
90 years for the bourgeoisie to impose and consolidate itself in 
England. 
  If it took the bourgeoisie 300 years to conslidate itself as 
a class power, the proletariate cannot be expected to do the 
same in the 66 years (two-thirds of century) that it has 
exercised its dictatorship over the state through the Socialist 
Revolution. 
  The difference with the RGR [General Withdrawal of the 
Revolution] of 1891 should be noted (Engels made the balance). 
  The current RGR stems from the process of restoration, 
because an unfavorable public opinion has developed about this 
stage of the revolution (140 years). Three years have already 
passed since RGR. From the point of view of Maoism -- which is a 
decisive, key factor in designing the strategy of the RPM [World 
Proletariat Revolution] in the New Great Wave -- we understand 
why this period is the transition between the crowning point of 
one stage of the RPM and the future Great Wave of the RPM. This 
is the foundation of the general political withdrawal, among 
other things. 
  Lenin: "Karl Marx taught us to analyze tactical problems." 
To dare to think, to dare to act, to dare to decide. Going 
against the stream is a Marxist principle. Does everything we 
have been analyzing oppose what we have maintained, that "The 
Revolution is the Main Trend!?" One should see the difference. 
  1.- TREND. It is unquestionable and inexorable that, from a 
historical viewpoint, the revolution is the main trend. It 
would be sufficient to invoke the process of development of new 
things, and the contradiction. Bear in mind the example: "The 
Pampas River is born and, after a long and winding course, it 
reaches the sea. It should be understood that history does not 
go back, that development is a spiral, uneven process. Time is 
measured in decades, not in years, and historical steps are not 
so brief." 
  2.- THE REVOLUTION AS A POLITICAL TREND (Study very 
carefully). At least five to six years are needed for the 
international stage and the situation to become clear. What 
will be the concrete results of U.S. hegemony? What will be the 
concrete results of Russia's disintegration? What will be the 
strengthening and the role of other powers, Japan and Germany? 
In the revolution, what will be the specifics of the RGR? What 
does the International Revolutionary Movement (MRI) think of 
these matters? Mao taught us that there are many Communist 
parties where Communist only appear in their letterhead. What 
is their situation now? See the situation of periods and the 
organizations of the proletariat. How are the unions? These 
are situations of which we have to make an in-depth analysis. 
What is the situation of class organizations, of peasant 
organizations? What does national and world opinion say? The 
direction of Communist parties is a key factor; the classes, the 
Anti-imperialist Movement. 
  SUMMARIZING, make an in-depth analysis of the development of 
the struggle of classes, its rules, trends, and prospects. The 
old mole about which Marx taught us has not disappeared, it is 
alive. 
  If there were no political trend, there would be no 
historical trend. The political trend is now underground, and 
one should realize this. 
  The debris of disintegration and of restorations (USSR and 
China) has fallen upon our shoulders and we must bear it; yet 
the political trend lies inside Communist parties, among 
Communists, within the class, in the anti-imperialist war. 
Socialism existed and we saw it. The main right is to conquer 
power. Rebellion is justified! Consequently, it has not 
disappeared, it is an underlying political trend. Marx analyzed 
this process. He raised the issue of "The Deep Waters," saying 
that "the old mole again works the land." This is how the trend 
occurs from a political point of view, like underground water. 
The political factor is decisive: the direction of Communist 
parties. One should again study this, it is very important for 
us to reaffirm our position in the revolution, as the main 
historical trend, which operates politically, routinely. At a 
world level, there is a new distribution of the cake and new 
contradictions are being created. 
<H3>  Imperialism is Slowly But Inexorably Agonizing -- Third 
Plenary Session (III SP) </H3>
  What are the current specific signs? It continues, but it is 
inexorably agonizing. (Bear in mind the III SP on the collapse 
of imperialism); yet there is also temporary recuperation. What 
Lenin taught us in "The Imperialist Stage ...," "Socialism... 
and Imperialism," "Revisionism... and Imperialism" is true and 
fully valid. 
  How can we regard imperialism today? We see it in the light 
of the MLM to resolve new problems. 
  What are the material grounds for this situation? The 
economic situation that gave rise to it was the petroleum, coal, 
and iron and steel industry. Today there are new sources of 
jobs, some of them very sophisticated, like informatics, 
electronic communications -- which are great development 
processes -- genetics, monopolies are attentive to genetic 
modifications (plant and animal manipulation), and even with new 
species. This is a new item for exploitation and oppression. 
Always see both sides of the contradiction. All oppressions 
generate an antioppression class movement. 
  If one considers war, the development of strategic weapons 
causes more militarization of industry, larger investments in 
electronic war, costly weaponry and maintenance, which soon 
becomes obsolete. Their economic recession problems and their 
restrictions have made them foster the development of 
conventional weapons. Privatization of state-owned productive 
units is another world phenomenon. How much have the states 
obtained from productive units? All this is being transferred 
to monopolies, strengthening their power. All these matters 
determine the basis for this temporary recuperation. 
  If we analyze the government from the political viewpoint 
we will see there is a tendency to reduce its social functions. 
Who will carry out these functions? In imperialist countries, 
monopolies -- for example -- organize areas of social security 
(the AFP [Pension Fund Managing Companies]), health, and 
education. Something similar occurs in the area of security -- 
not just armed security, but also regarding measures to prevent 
or to develop industrial espionage. All that makes us wonder 
about the reactionary state process represented by the grand 
bourgeoisie's dictatorship (in our case, the grand bourgeoisie 
and the large landowners who obey imperialism). Nowadays, the 
Armed Forces are becoming stronger and have more political 
decisionmaking capacity. 
  Look at the role played by monopolies. In the past, they 
divided the world, currently they perform government functions. 
  Regarding the international situation, the superpowers 
remain the same. Russia continues to be a superpower in view of 
its military power and its strategic atomic power. It has 
problems related to its international influence, it is riddled 
with domestic problems, and it is facing difficulties in 
international security. In Japan, Yeltsin suggested that the 
Japanese Government did not claim sovereignty over the four 
islands in dispute. Russia still has influence. We realize 
that international politics are undergoing a readjustment 
process and we are watching how the United States will structure 
its hegemony. Japan has become the second power, is paying 
increasing attention to its military weakness, and seems ready 
to increase and develop its own military policy. Germany is 
ruining France (its famous ally) to improve its currency. 
  Ideologically, they are not structuring a new ideology, they 
are proving that it is obsolete. They are playing increasingly 
with "the failure of socialism." In spite of all this, they 
support an economic recovery, after having no ideology, and 
support liberalism. These are old banners, updated to manipulate 
public opinion. 
  We must be very attentive and worry about the slow agony of 
imperialism, despite its temporary recovery. We must 
temporarily retreat because if we do not analyze imperialism, we 
cannot fight it. Lenin taught us that imperialism limits the 
development of productive forces. This is the general law. It 
will be decisive and prevail in the end. We can see abundant 
riches, while on the other hand we see 15 million children die 
every year before their first birthdays. We cannot overcome 
these realities because they are contradictory. 
<H5>  How do Empires Sink? (III SP) </H5>
  We realize that these processes occur over long, not short, 
periods of time. During the slavery age, Roman Imperialism was 
the most developed and took more than five centuries to end. 
During feudalism, Spanish Imperialism was the most outstanding 
and took more than two centuries to fall. In capitalist times, 
it took more than a century for England to fall. Yankee 
imperialism consolidated as a superpower after the Second World 
War. This process has lasted more than five decades. We 
predict that it will be a long process, but it will evidently 
last less than the others, although we know it will take a long 
time. 
<H5>  Revisionism and Revolution </H5>
  We have fought two sorts of revisionism: the old one that 
opposed the conquest of power just after World War II and the 
one we are fighting now, the essence of which is restoration. 
Thus, we have always fought revisionism. 
  CONCLUSION: We fight for the large wave of International 
Revolution that will come. Our Guide is Maoism! 
  2. [as published] The bureaucratic path sets its foundations 
and becomes feasible. 
  We begin by analyzing how they are setting their bases and 
developing a coherent strategy in the face of the People's War. 
In the economy it is clear that they set bases, not just by 
drafting laws, but also by implementing them. 
  Since 1988, we have had five years of recession. The GDP 
increased by 6 percent in 1993, after five years of a growing 
recession. Inflation decreased. Seen from a strategic 
viewpoint, the GDP decreased by 26 percent between 1982 and 
1993, while the population increased by 30 percent. If it 
increased by 30 percent, it would still have to increase another 
20 percent even if we disregard the increase in population. We 
must do our best to consider the steps they take and the 
increases as objective deeds. 
  As to "Politics and the Government," after electing their 
constituents and drafting the Constitution, they won the 
referendum and opened the path toward reelection. This is a way 
of setting the bases for reorganization the government. 
  Regarding "Peacemaking" and their antisubversive war, they 
began it through civic action efforts, continued it by 
controlling the people, than they created peasant patrols, 
conducted psychological operations, and used intelligence 
actions to make arrests. 
  This period of bureaucratic capitalism has a goal: To 
concentrate power. This process needs: A long-term plan and a 
long-lasting administration to promote it, lead it, and 
implement it. As a result, there will be a reappearance of 
bureaucratic capitalism. 
  With the fall of our leadership and our central board, 
imperialism sees no need to interfere. 
  During his speech on 24 September [no year specified], 
President Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman] shunted the Program, the FPL 
[People's Liberation Front], the EPL [People's Liberation Army], 
the New State and its relative stability as far as the people's 
war was concerned, the transfer of the center and all that it 
entailed. He then established the basis of the masterly plan for 
a general political withdrawal. 
  The process of a counter-revolutionary war leads to victory. 
  The renewed thrust of bureaucratic capitalism entails a 
greater imperialistic control -- "Reinsertion." 
  Border problems with Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil 
put our nation in jeopardy. 
  What is the situation of bureaucratic capitalism nowadays? 
  There are no powerful people's liberation movements, the 
proletariat and the people's struggle have weakened. Hence, it 
is neither powerful nor strong. Bureaucratic capitalism is thus 
fueled with renewed vigor, its plan is put into practice, and 
social and political rights are further curtailed. This will 
make the deep class struggle awaken the old revolutionary ideals. 
  Knowing how to place and handle the laws of every process 
puts things in their proper perspective and course. 
  The strong point, the most developed one in the democratic 
path is the People's War. 
  3. The People's War cannot be developed; it can only be 
maintained. There are six indispensable conditions for the 
People's War to be victorious: 
  1. Leadership by the proletariat. 
  2. Masses' bases. 
  3. Strategic centralization. 
  4. A new type of Army. 
  5. Prolonged People's War. 
  6. Favorable international conditions. 
  Condition No. 6 does not exist, it is not the main one, but 
it is necessary. The most important is No. 1. The leadership 
should maintain a fair and correct political line, and wage a 
people's war following a course and direction established by the 
Class. 
  We have problems in No. 1 and No. 3. New problems, the 
course is not analyzed (by the foreign leadership). No. 4 must 
be assembled and developed; it is not just the name "EPL." No. 
2 is not handled or managed as it should, given the new state of 
affairs. Who represents the people in the election? Nobody ... 
Thus, everything leads to a prolonged People's War; The problem 
lies in leadership by the proletariat. 
<H5>  What have we achieved? </H5>
  First, we have worked for a long time to bring about an 
armed 
struggle and to further the People's War, a Peasants' 
Revolutionary war, supported by its own bases, means, and 
masses, without being submitted to classes. The People's War 
has lasted 13 years. 
  We have hit our three targets, semi-feudalism is less 
widespread, and the system is crumbling. We combated 
bureaucratic capitalism, proved that the latter fosters 
semi-feudalism; it controls the Peruvian state so that it can 
oppose the revolution. 
  We have fought imperialism head-on. The spread of our 
People's War has been a security problem for the United States 
since 1989. 
  The People's War has generated a New Type of Army. 
  We established a new type of state directed by the Class, 
which has never happened before. This had far-reaching 
implications. 
  In sum, the People's War gave us five successes: 
  1. The People's War is the greatest revolutionary social 
movement in Peruvian history in terms of program, development, 
and length. 
  2. It served to defend Maoism as a third, new, superior 
stage, and particularly to develop the strategic plan at a world 
level. 
  3. It raised the party's prestige to the highest level in 
its 
history, with the highest world's repercussion. 
  4. We accumulated the greatest revolutionary experience in 
Peru, Latin America. It is one of the richest in the world 
today. 
  5. We made a great contribution to the world proletarian 
revolution. It is recognized by the International Revolutionary 
Movement (MRI) as a vanguard theater for the World Proletarian 
Revolution. Today the revolution ends a great period. It is 
the hinge between two waves. It is an example of how to operate 
on our own efforts. It has shown that a People's War is 
invincible. 
  4. The leadership problem cannot be resolved in time. 
  5. New great decision, new great definition; struggle for a 
peace agreement and establish the bases for the second congress. 
<H5>  Concrete Tasks </H5>
  To raise the MLM-PG even more; to struggle for a peace 
agreement and its implimentation; to define the importance of 
the people's war, the greatest Social Revolutionary Movement in 
Peru's history; to develop deeper bonds with the broad masses; 
to develop the international proletarian movement more. Mao 
said: "If a revolutionary party..." which is the single axis and 
the great fortress. We must defend and strengthen it against 
everything because the political and ideological structure is 
decisive in a protracted People's War. 
<H5>  End of the propaganda. </H5>
  6. With masses and a party, anything can be accomplished. 
Let us handle the general military withdrawal, a consequence of 
the general political withdrawal. It is complex, difficult, but 
necessary. 
  Develop other forms of struggle in new conditions. 
  II. Round of talks. 
  1. First contacts. 
  2. Talks. Acts. Peace agreements, first letter, 
guidelines, second letter. 
  3. Current situation. 
  4. Dissemination of agreements petition. 
  5. Prospects. 
<H5>  III.Conclusions and Tasks: </H5>
  1. Assume and fight for the new great decision and 
definition... Struggle for a peace agreement and establish the 
bases... 
  2. Party's concrete tasks. 
  3. Specific tasks. 
<H6>  BASIS FOR DEVELOPING A PEACE AGREEMENT </H6>
  1. The Peruvian people support peace. "It is a necessity..." 
  2. The people favor a solution through diplomatic 
negotiations. Imperialism and other imperialist powers need this. 
  3. The state and the government need it to achieve 
development. Problems with current costs; terms; reelection and 
long-term plans. 
  4. The Party's action. How to assume it and implement it?: 
That depends if conditions can be proposed. Delegates 
Commission. 
<H6>  POLICIES TO BE ENFORCED </H6>
  1. Do not engage in confrontations, neutralize and respond 
measure by measure. 
  2. Change our language, we are engaged in diplomatic 
negotiations which means we must follow them. 
  3. Define today's main target within the current context. 
  4. The issue is to handle sagaciously the objective 
convergence field. R'oo Rx'. [sentence as published] 
  5. It is a peace agreement between the PCP [Peruvian 
Communist Party] and the Armed Forces through the government. 
Our political positions have been confirmed, we told them how 
to resolve PCP-Armed Forces contradictions and this is what is 
happening. 

  -  To develop struggles between two lines, seeking unity, 
strive for the disbandment to be as little as possible; the 
party is politically strong but we must be aware that only a few 
may remain, only the best; the best defense is to attack. Let 
the militants become a revealing mirror of the infamous attacks 
perpetrated by the enemy, not even the Armed Forces act like 
that. 
  -  The other side also has a very clear objective: that we 
will never raise our heads again; that there will never be 
another People's War. No one can deny that it is using this 
issue to win today's referendum and the future reelection 
because the Peruvian State's long-term plan must be restructured 
and promoted. To make definitions and to be alert for strange 
machinations. 
  "We offer uncertain possibilities now in exchange for 
certain 
and real prospects in the future." 
<H6>  PRESIDENT GONZALO'S QUOTES </H6>
  1. "We communists struggle with absolute conviction toward 
the objective: Communism; no matter how many battles we wage, 
how many setbacks or difficulties; not even the defeats we 
suffer in the sinuous path of victory." 
  2. "We are not deterred by risks, we are not frightened by 
danger. What is needed is accomplished." 
  3. "We communists do not expect anything but want 
everything, 
nothing for ourselves as individuals, everything for humanity: 
May Communism shine over the Earth." 
  4. "We communists have a single interest: Communism and in 
its name we sacrifice our only possession; our lives." 
  5. "Outside the party we are nothing, within the party we 
are 
everything." 
  6. "A clear mind, a resolute will and an inextinguishable 
passion." (Trilogy). 
  7. "We communists are free men because we handle the laws 
with which we change reality." 
  8. "We communists struggle tirelessly despite knowing we 
will 
be crushed as individuals and the class from which we derive 
will be extinguished." 
  9. "Man will be truly a man when communism is imposed on 
Earth." 
  10. "Communists are the mortar of communism." 
  11. "To be able to see sudden changes and make great 
decisions." 
<H6>  PRESIDENT MAO'S QUOTES </H6>
  1. "Consequent materialists are intrepid, we hope all those 
who struggle by our side courageously assume their 
responsibilities, overcome the difficulties, the fears of 
reversals and ridicule, and do not hesitate to criticize us 
communists and offer suggestions."

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Lima, 31 Jan (AFP) -- The Maoist organization 
Shining Path has stated it will continue its 13-year military 
struggle. According to its official newspaper EL DIARIO, which 
was sent to the Lima media on Monday, an "impostor" took the 
place of its imprisoned leader, Abimael Guzman, to issue an 
appeal for peace to the Peruvian Government in October 1993. 
  EL DIARIO said, "We know reactionary people have Guzman 
hidden and isolated in the Navy's dungeons. We reject the 
October video, which presents an impostor, a man they prepared 
for over a year to replace Guzman on television." 
  Shining Path thinks the government's campaign for "a peace 
agreement justifies the assassination of President Gonzalo 
(Guzman)," and so it asks that the health of its leader, who was 
arrested in September 1992 and is currently serving a life 
sentence at the naval base in El Callao, "be taken care of." 
  Nevertheless, the opposition magazine SI claims, in its 
Monday edition, an uneasiness prevails among high command 
members of the Navy, who are in charge of Guzman's custody, over 
the meetings held between the Shining Path leader and the 
imprisoned leaders of the organization at the officers' club in 
El Callao Naval Base. 
  According to official information, during those meetings 
they 
wrote the letters from Guzman and his comrade, Elena 
Iparraguirre (one letter remains unpublished), issuing an appeal 
for peace; and another one along those same lines from four 
imprisoned leaders. 
  SI magazine reports, citing reliable sources, that Shining 
Path's demands to achieve a peace agreement include "a general 
amnesty for all of its imprisoned activists," so they can hold a 
congress to establish the groundwork for peace. 
  The magazine, along with all Peruvian media, thinks a 
division prevails within the Shining Path between the group 
which advocates peace, led by Guzman, and a group of 
"hard-liners" who do not want to end the armed struggle, which 
began in 1980 and which is represented by leaders who are still 
at large. 
  Conversely, EL DIARIO calls the division "false" and denies 
Guzman wants peace; it does admit the imprisoned activists 
include a handful of "capitulators, now lackeys of the 
dictatorship (President Alberto Fujimori's Government), who are 
trying to plant the idea of capitulation among the people." 
  EL DIARIO also publishes a statement from female Shining 
Path 
members, currently at the women's prison in Lima, who also 
recognize the existence of "a small revisionist, black group of 
capitulators that wave the flags of peace while shouting threats 
that will have deadly consequences." 
  To conclude, the January edition of the Shining Path 
newspaper, which is banned in Peru and the possession of which 
is proof of active participation in the organization -- a fact 
that may be punished with a life sentence -- is exclusively 
dedicated to proving its total loyalty to Guzman.

  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori have signed a joint 
political, economic, and cultural declaration at the Government 
Palace. The document was signed during the first official trip 
by Wasmosy, who was democratically elected. 
  Wasmosy arrived at the Peruvian Air Force's 8th Group in 
Lima 
at 1050. He was accompanied by the foreign affairs and industry 
ministers. At the 8th Group, he was welcomed with a 21-gun 
salute and met by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, ministers 
of state and congressmen, following which the National Police 
band played the Peruvian and Paraguayan national anthems. 
  After the welcoming ceremony, President Wasmosy and Peruvian 
Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg went to the Heroes of 
Independence Park to place wreaths on monuments to the nation's 
heroes. At the park, Wasmosy extended a message of brotherhood 
to the Peruvian people and reiterated his pledge to strengthen 
Paraguay's ties of friendship with Peru. 
  Wasmosy will lunch with Fujimori at 1330 in the formal 
dining 
room at the Government Palace. He will visit the Democratic 
Constituent Congress at 1600 and then he will attend a solemn 
session of Lima's Municipal Council, during which he will be 
declared an illustrious visitor and will be given the keys to 
the city.

<F P=106> [From the "Undercurrent" section: "Frejolito Reappears"] </F>
  [Text] Over the past few days former Lima Mayor Alfonso 
Barrantes Lingan has been reappearing repeatedly in the media, 
giving opinions about the current political situation and the 
need to renew the leftist sector to allow it to participate in 
the 1995 elections. Frejolito's central proposal is that the 
United Left should become a party. This means eliminating the 
United Left's various factions, reorienting its socialist 
discourse with neatly Peruvian -- "Mariateguist," as he put it 
-- foundations, and leaving aside the dogmas of Moscow or 
Beijing. The leaders of the party, at all levels, should be 
elected democratically by grassroots committees. 
  A few days ago, PAP [Aprista Party of Peru] Secretary 
General 
Armando Villanueva del Campo hinted at the possibility of 
creating a "popular front" between APRA [American Popular 
Revolutionary Alliance] and the leftist parties. Observers 
believe that Frejolito could well be the candidate of this 
alliance.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Partners"] </F>
  [Text] When he arrived in our country Alexander Watson, the 
U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, said: "We 
have to work together, as partners, to meet the challenges 
confronting us, such as the scourge of drug trafficking." 
  This is precisely how it should be. Heroin consumption, for 
example, is on the increase in the United States. This in turn 
triggers the spread of poppy fields in Peru -- in Cajamarca, 
Amazonas, part of San Martin, and Madre de Dios -- thus creating 
problems that our country did not have before. 
  Despite this, rules should be set on how and where this 
joint 
collaboration is to be undertaken. With regard to coca, two 
special reports published by EXPRESO this week clearly state 
that the interdiction policy furthered by the Peruvian Armed 
Forces in the Huallaga region has been quite successful, so much 
so that it has caused the price of a kilogram of cocaine paste 
to plummet from $1,500 in 1993 to its current value of $200. 
  The cultivation of traditional crops like rice, corn, and 
cotton has been partially resumed thanks to the reopening of 
highways. This has nonetheless been a very difficult decision, 
as it entailed the impoverishment of farmers. 
  It goes without saying that the decline in the coca business 
in the Huallaga region does not necessarily mean that it has 
been reduced in the whole of Peru. It has shifted toward other 
areas, with resulting effects in terms of environmental 
devastation and corruption. The government has, however, 
already launched a thrust against drug kingpins. The capture of 
"El Vaticano" has been a great step forward. 
  What merits highlighting for the purpose of our discussion 
is 
that both the mass exodus of drug traffickers from the Huallaga 
region -- the leading coca production center in Peru -- and the 
arrest of "El Vaticano" took place precisely during the year in 
which the United States withdrew nearly all its aid for the 
fight against drug trafficking. The effort has, therefore, been 
made by Peru -- only by Peru. This all goes to prove that, at 
least on a short term basis, one obtains better results without 
U.S. aid than with it. 
  Does this mean that all joint endeavors should be left 
aside? 
Not necessarily. It means that this concerted effort ought to 
revolve around crop substitution rather than interdiction or 
police-related considerations. Peru has managed, of late, to 
develop a relatively advanced, shrewd, and intelligent 
technology that is also respectful of human rights. In this 
area, we would rather work on our own. We do, however, need 
financial resources for crop substitution programs, especially 
as we are channeling all our resources into drug enforcement 
operations. 
  These kinds of subjects are, incidentally, what the two 
partners should today be discussing.

<F P=106> [From the "Undercurrent" section: "Disagreements Within the </F>
Navy"] 
  [Text] Despite efforts to keep secret a meeting that 
President Alberto Fujimori and Vladimiro Montesinos held with 
Abimael Guzman and his friends at the Callao naval base, some 
details were leaked to the Navy, where there was a strong 
quarrel between some admirals who are against these negotiations 
and the politicization to which the institution is being 
subjected. As a result of this, some changes were introduced. 
Vice Admiral Ricardo Villaran Tapia, the chief of staff, was 
transferred to a "meaningless" post in the National Defense 
Secretariat. In 1992, Villaran was in charge of the General 
Command of Naval Zones (Congezonas), a key post with command of 
troops. Villaran is the second most senior on-duty vice admiral. 
  Another Vice Admiral who protested, Luis Giampetri Rojas, 
was 
also punished. He was designated chief of staff, a bureaucratic 
post with little power. Giampietri headed Congezonas in 1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with exiled General Alberto Arciniega by Alberto </F>
Ku King M. in Buenos Aires, date not given: "Drug Trafficking 
Increasing Dangerously in Peru"] 
  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires--Brigadier General Alberto 
Arciniega Huby of the Peruvian Army, considered one of the best 
military strategists in Peru's fight against terrorism and drug 
trafficking, has charged that drug trafficking is increasing 
dangerously in his country. 
  Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government 
advisers for not following through on a single strategy to 
defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern 
jungle of Peru for several years. 
  "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the 
best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they 
have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking 
power," he stressed. 
  Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in 
place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and 
even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time 
when the American Government was willing to engage in joint 
operations." 
  The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in 
Argentina since last January, having left his country on the 
heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually 
turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army, 
General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted] 
  General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the 
alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses 
against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in 
exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru. 
  The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru 
in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army 
as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and 
nine students. 
  Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and 
21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country 
one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in 
his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking. 
  He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even 
though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him. 
However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way 
he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru. 
  Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English 
thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting 
ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug 
strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and 
made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School 
of Government's catalogue. 
  Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding 
officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest 
drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the 
terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was 
implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers 
numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of 
their social base." 
  "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to 
destabilize 
the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal 
Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the 
peasant population," Arciniega recalls. 
  He admits leading his troops into many battles against the 
terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to 
consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants 
rather than drug-trafficking criminals." 
  The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting 
the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other 
products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding 
political and social defeat. 
  "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out 
while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break 
up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) 
between April and December of 1989," he recalls. 
  He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who 
waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman 
finally lost his will to have another army and immediately 
changed tactics." 
  He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence 
reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was 
celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as 
paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had, 
but did not find him...." 
  Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori 
Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April 
1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the 
chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed 
extraconstitutional powers. 
  The former military official maintains that the drug 
traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that 
they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world. 
  When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of 
persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which 
the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American 
affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of 
the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come 
out in a book." 
  The general also leveled criticisms at the presidential 
adviser for intelligence matters, former Captain Vladimiro 
Montesinos, to whom he attributes great influence over the 
Peruvian chief of state's decisions. 
  "The worst thing that could have happened to the Armed 
Forces 
is the presence of that gentleman, Vladimiro Montesinos, who has 
exercised some kind of strange power over the president, whom he 
originally considered as the right person for the times we are 
living in Peru and given the fact that the political parties 
have deteriorated," Arciniega says. 
  He accuses Fujimori's advisers and Montesinos of carrying 
out 
a series of political actions "that have done Peru great damage 
because they followed the wrong strategies." 
  For example, he cites the problem of terrorism, charging 
that 
the government and its advisers "have done precisely what 
Abimael wanted: to launch a campaign to put an end to 
institutions that took many years to create, namely, the 
political parties." "I agree that the political parties were not 
doing their job, but when those parties are given their place, 
they serve to guide public opinion, educating it politically," 
he explained. 
  He labeled the government's statement that the capture of 
Abimael Guzman in September of last year was the result of the 5 
April coup "a lie." 
  "That assertion is false because Military Intelligence had 
Guzman and his entire clique on a list drawn up from the time 
that terrorism started and they were all the targets of an 
intense search," he said. 
  Arciniega laments the fact that a shadow has been cast over 
the figure of Police Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal, who 
executed the plan leading to the capture of Guzman and most of 
his command. 
  "I am not surprised about what is happening to Ketin because 
they also passed me over and froze my status when I returned 
from Huallaga. They apparently look for weaklings to occupy key 
posts so they will be servile to a regime. Otherwise they go to 
prison," he observed. 
  For example, he criticized the current minister of defense, 
General Victor Malca, who he said was "a little bully who only 
fights from his desk, but who has never had a chance to get his 
spats dirty in a combat zone." 
  General Malca signed the Cabinet resolution in January that 
ordered Arciniega's trial by a special military court for 
violating military regulations. 
  It should be recalled that as a military judge, Arciniega 
tenaciously opposed the fact that a group of 30 Army officers, 
including several generals, should be made to serve prison 
sentences in a jail for common criminals for conspiring against 
Fujimori's government in November of last year. 
  Arciniega repeated his accusation against presidential 
adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, noting that his "recommendations" 
to President Fujimori have caused him "to destroy an entire 
institutional structure in the Armed Forces that took years to 
create." 
  He emphatically blamed Montesinos for "hatching" an entire 
scheme to get "many representative and highly qualified 
officers" out of the military. 
  He warned that a "pruning" of the different levels of the 
Army and Armed Forces as a whole occurred and continues to 
occur, a pruning that "poses a threat to the very existence of 
the Armed Forces as one of our nation's guiding institutions." 
  He lamented the fact that an attempt is being made to force 
Army personnel, who were trained at the cost of great sacrifice, 
"to start acting as a Pretorian guard, going on to claim that 
the officers are not thinking about viable, appropriate 
solutions for our people." 
  "President Fujimori and his advisers are governing Peru by 
seeking weekly solutions to every national problem the country 
has," Arciniega said, warning that the government does not get 
at the root causes of the problems, but rather, encourages a 
strategy consisting of making the people dependent on the 
government. 
  "It is an erroneous strategy. I wonder: How long can such a 
strategy be maintained? How long will all of this continue when 
the president ignores the causes of our social problems?" he 
asked, turning his focus to the secular problems that have 
plagued Peru in recent decades. 
  He also wondered about the role of the Armed Forces given 
the 
state of politics in Peru: "How long will they go on adopting a 
political role not suited to them?" "It is destroying the 
military institution," Arciniega said in answer to his own 
question. "What we are seeing now, with the arbitrary 
replacements and retirements, breaks down morale and military 
discipline." 
  "Fabrications are used against many officers to get them out 
of the career path rapidly, without giving them any chance to 
defend themselves," he said. 
  He recalled the experience of the military during the 12 
years of the dictatorial Armed Forces regime (1968-80). "It was 
an experience that taught us to respect democracy. We had been 
trained to respect the democratic system, to think about 
strengthening it." 
  "None of us in the military truly favored what is now 
happening, i.e., a dictatorship," he said. 
  He recalled that the Armed Forces respected the governments 
of Fernando Belaunde Terry and Alan Garcia Perez even though, in 
his opinion, the latter had a poor government that was poorly 
handled. 
  He said the military also respected Fujimori's election. "We 
made sure Fujimori would take office as president," he added. 
  Arciniega bitterly observed that, far from following a 
democratic path, Fujimori had yielded to advice from Montesinos, 
whom he labeled as a "little Pinochet who probably thinks that 
democracy is not a solution for these times." 
  Analyzing Fujimori's ascent to power in the midst of a grave 
economic crisis and the Peruvian people's great disillusionment 
with their political leaders, the former military official said 
the victory had even surprised Fujimori. "I am sure he must also 
have been surprised at becoming president," Arciniega said. 
  Concerning the constitutional referendum called by 
Fujimori's 
government following the coup, Arciniega warned that the people 
"are beginning to realize, are reflecting upon Fujimori's 
authoritarian plans. It all teaches us a lesson." 
  He insisted on blaming Montesinos for the political 
direction 
and institutional crisis that has occurred in Peru recently, 
particularly, he noted, when a president comes to power "without 
any political platform or party." 
  "That is why Fujimori is surrounded by a bunch of rascals 
who 
say `This is ours,' and who assume Machiavellian power over the 
regime," he concluded. 
  "Montesinos is Machiavellian. He is not stupid. Since he 
knows military structure--he was lucky enough to be an aide to a 
foreign minister like General Edgardo Mercado Jarrin--he is 
learning how to destabilize institutions," Arciniega observed. 
  Arciniega said that unlike under the military government of 
the late General Juan Velasco Alvarado, when "there was 
agreement" on committing the Armed Forces as an institution to 
back a government, "the situation is different now because only 
a small group supports the regime." 
  "Today we have precisely the opposite situation because, 
little by little, they are removing the best officers who have 
democratic convictions." 
  "What one foresees for the Armed Forces is not only very 
serious, but dreadful," Arciniega warned, maintaining that Army 
officers are quite bewildered because "future prospects for any 
career military man are disappearing." 
  Echoing his comrade in exile, General Robles, Arciniega said 
there is no need for a coup d'etat to change the current 
political, economic, and social situation in Peru. 
  "I think the people are wise. The people will have to 
marshal 
their own courage because sooner or later they will realize that 
this political platform is barbaric," he said. 
  He said that President Fujimori's "luck is running out" and 
that international pressure after the 5 April "self-coup" forced 
him to redraft his plan and offer a new constitution. 
  Arciniega said the new constitution is an "aberration," 
adding that the argument that the coup was necessary in order to 
change the constitution "is a lie because the 1979 Constitution 
even had its own procedures for modification. The only thing 
needed was a consensus and not an outrage like the coup." 
  In the exiled general's opinion, "it is easy to foresee that 
the new constitution will not last because sooner or later the 
people will reflect and realize that it is a plan to keep one 
group in power." 
  "I do not think that Fujimori and Montesinos ever read the 
history of Peru or took the time to read the important things 
thoroughly, (....) and now they are playing with Peru's fate," 
he emphasized. 
  He said the people will reflect and see "that this is all a 
failure, that this man has been a liar, and they will not vote 
for Fujimori. The next person elected will have to institute a 
proper political trial of him and all of his advisers who have 
tried to destroy Peru." 
  Concerning General Jaime Salinas Sedo, now in prison for 
conspiring against Fujimori, Arciniega claimed that he would 
have advised him "not to attempt the coup" because "it was 
outrageous only two weeks away from the CCD elections. He played 
right into Fujimori's hands." 
  With respect to his political future, Arciniega admits that 
his military career is over, but says another phase is now 
beginning for which "I have to prepare myself, take a course in 
politics, and be ready to face challenges." 
  He said that Peru's future political leaders should be 
transparent, authentic, and not deceitful or mediocre. 
  Arciniega did not conceal his sympathy for a possible 
presidential candidacy of former UN Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar, believing that "he is a man who has 
demonstrated his ability at the highest level of international 
politics." However, he said, the Peruvian people might not 
understand him. 
  At the close of this lengthy interview, Arciniega asked to 
listen to a tape of a band playing the national anthem and the 
Army hymn, "to help me recall the most intense times of my life 
in the military," he said. However, he confessed that he 
occasionally hums the words of a well-known tango: "Remember, my 
brother, the days when...."

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- Political leaders have reacted 
angrily to President Itamar Franco's letter criticizing Congress 
and holding it responsible for the defeat of the economic 
measures. Progressive Party President Alvaro Dias (Parana 
State) said the government "makes too many mistakes, and is 
clumsy." 
  In a conciliatory manner, Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais 
State), PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] leader in the 
Chamber of Deputies, agreed with President Franco, admitting 
that the traditional absence of congressmen in Brasilia on 
Thursdays represents a problem he has been trying to solve: 
  "We are going through a very serious crisis, and the 
economic 
plan should be fully supported by the Congress," he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who was charged 
with 
hindering the voting, said Franco's attitude against a weakened 
Congress was cowardly: 
  "It is cowardly to threaten Congress. Realizing that 
Congress is weakened, Franco wants to force it to approve a tax 
increase. What he doesn't realize is that he is as weak, or 
weaker, than Congress," Magalhaes said. 
  Refuting Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
remarks 
about breaking an accord for the approval of a tax increase, 
Magalhaes said: 
  "I had no agreement with him. From the beginning I made it 
clear that I was against increasing taxes," Magalhaes said. 
  He added that the Congress overcame its fragility by voting 
against the government's proposal to increase taxes to be 
collected from enterprises. He pointed out that Congress is not 
responsible for the tax increase to be paid by individuals, 
because it was proposed by the government: 
  "Cardoso cannot continue fooling the country with his 
stewardess smile. I would like to challenge him to a television 
debate," the governor said. 
  In Magalhaes' opinion, the government presented a plan based 
only on tax increases. It did not propose any measure to hurt 
the interests of the financial system or the oligopolies. The 
Bahia State governor believes that these two sectors of the 
economy would not be affected by an increase in taxes paid on 
enterprises' profits, because the companies would cover this 
difference by increasing prices, the consumers would end up 
paying for it. 
  Magalhaes remarked caustically: "Franco is a fool." 
  Federal Deputy Delfim Netto (Progressive Renewal Party -- 
Sao 
Paulo) said on 29 January that Franco should send a copy of the 
letter he handed to the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies 
and the Senate to each one of the 75 congressmen of the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and PMDB who did not appear 
at Congress last Thursday, 27 January, to vote on the increase 
in the enterprises' income tax. 
  Referring to the last part of President Franco's letter 
calling for congressional support, Delfim Netto asserted that 
the country is not ungovernable: 
  All the president must do is govern. The country has been 
waiting for that. Everything else is empty talk and seeks to 
justify what is not functioning. The country's governability 
depends solely on him.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonio Kandir] </F>
  [Text] Vice President Albert Gore made a proposal for a 
presidential summit conference of the Americas' democratic 
countries during 1994 after the U.S. Congress approved NAFTA. 
The conference will be a first step for eventual and future 
hemispheric integration. 
  Many people see Gore's proposal as a mere word game. These 
people argue that the proposal was too vague and did not define 
a schedule or procedures. They also stress the improbability of 
NAFTA's extension, at least not to the point of accommodating a 
free trade zone covering the three Americas, and note the 
resistance of some American economic sectors that are very 
sensitive to broader integration. 
  These are all valuable arguments, but the question is, what 
are the practical implications? Should Brazil echo Gore's 
proposal or should we pretend not to have heard anything? The 
answer depends on people's position as to whether hemispheric 
integration on Brazil's long-term horizon is in the country's 
strategic interest. 
  We should not take too long to answer this question, even if 
it is only because U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
will come to the country soon, and we must suppose that Gore's 
proposal will be one of the topics on his agenda. 
  In my opinion, there are more than enough arguments to urge 
Brazil to give clear signals about its interest in this 
integration. Besides, we cannot overlook the new market's trade 
potential. NAFTA, in its present form, has a joint GDP of $6.5 
trillion. When extended it will have a joint GDP of nearly $7.3 
trillion, and will be bigger than the EEC ($5.8 trillion), and 
practically equal to the GDP of all the other countries in the 
world together ($7.6 trillion, excluding EEC countries). 
  This does not mean Brazil should abandon its 
multilateralism, 
which was reinforced by the Uruguay Round of talks and the 
efforts to create Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. If 
Brazil looks the other way at Gore's proposal, it will be 
turning its back on a market that is 12 times larger than 
Mercosur without holding links to any bloc of any importance at 
a time when we still do not know which model will prevail in 
international economic relations in the long run. 
  The risk of this lack of participation is aggravated by the 
notorious fact that some or our neighbors, including and above 
all Argentina, our main Mercosur partner, aspire to join NAFTA 
and are taking steps in that direction. 
  Turning our back on eventual hemispheric integration is not 
advisable for a country that needs and is making every effort to 
attract productive investments. From the point of view of 
investors, a refusal to work for integration would increase 
risks at the time of investing resources in Brazil because it 
will reinforce the threat of commercial isolation in case 
multilateral relations deteriorate and economic blocs become 
fortresses closed to the outside (a risk we cannot rule out in 
any way, particularly in the case of the European bloc, because 
of a complicated integration process, and possible steps 
backward in the former Soviet Union). 
  It is obvious that the search for accelerated integration at 
any cost is silly and harmful to national interests. It probably 
will result in the destruction of entire Brazilian industries 
that today are in no condition to compete with U.S. 
manufacturing production. 
  But today's decisions will condition the future and it is 
necessary to look at the problem from a dynamic perspective. If 
our house is cleaned up this year and the process of 
constitutional revision ends with positive results, the country 
will have everything to start an age of sustained growth as of 
1995. And growth and the possibilities of improving Brazil's 
social problems will increase if the country improves its 
prospects for joining other dynamic and broadened markets.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army Minister General Zenildo Gonzaga </F>
Zoroastro de Lucena by Benicio Medeiros and Helio Contreiras in 
Rio de Janeiro; date not given] 
  [Text] [ISTOE] Did you know Itamar Franco before he became 
president? 
  [De Lucena] I knew him by sight when I was serving in Juiz 
de 
Fora and he was working -- if I am not mistaken -- as municipal 
public works secretary. Now I know him better. I like him very 
much. He is an honest man, a very correct person. 
  [ISTOE] Minister Mauricio Correa revealed that there was a 
group of military men who were determined to turn President 
Franco into a local Fujimori. Were you aware of this? 
  [De Lucena] I was. At the time an anonymous document 
containing a project for a military movement appeared in 
circulation inside the barracks. 
  [ISTOE] Did you read the document? 
  [De Lucena] I looked it over quickly. I can tell you that 
within the Army no one paid much attention to the document. 
  [ISTOE] Do you see any possibility of a Peruvian-style coup 
in Brazil? 
  [De Lucena] No possibility at all. 
  [ISTOE] In any case, someone wrote the "military movement" 
to 
which you are referring. 
  [De Lucena] Everybody knows that there are dozens of groups, 
reserve officers' groups, behind these proposals. They are 
well-intentioned individuals, but they do not live the problems 
of those who are in the Army, as I do. These groups do not have 
any relevance. I usually say -- I insist on the matter quite 
often -- that we no longer have parallel or external leaders in 
the Army. The leaders today are those serving in the 
institution, or in the position of minister or commander. 
Anyone from outside trying to lead an internal movement will 
have to depose the minister first. I am not just bragging. 
What I say is based on the Constitution. 
  [ISTOE] Will your leadership end when you leave the Army at 
the end of the government's mandate? 
  [De Lucena] Yes. I will leave behind many friends. But I 
will no longer exercise any leadership function. 
  [ISTOE] Many interpretations were made of a speech by 
General 
Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel in November, particularly about 
his remark on the "anger of the legions." What is the correct 
interpretation of that remark? 
  [De Lucena] I do not think any interpretation is necessary. 
Gen. Leonel copied that phrase from an old Army book. The 
remark does not have any secret meaning. I have known Leonel 
since he was a cadet, and I can assure you he is as good a 
democrat as I. 
  [ISTOE] What is the Army's situation today? 
  [De Lucena] The year 1993 was a much better year than 1992. 
We can still hear complaints about salaries, which are really 
very low, but the Army achieved many things compared to 1992. 
We are purchasing some weapons, our schools continue to operate 
well, and we are pursuing our modernization programs. 
  [ISTOE] Are you also optimistic about what is happening in 
Congress? 
  [De Lucena] I am. I do not like to speak about that, but I 
believe in renewal and democratic improvement. I do not believe 
in tough regimes or dictatorships. I believe in democratic 
regimes, and I believe in people. 
  [ISTOE] Have you experienced any particularly difficult 
moment as a minister? 
  [De Lucena] As a minister, no. I had difficult moments when 
I was at the Eastern Military Command. We had to decide how to 
act if Congress did not impeach former President Fernando 
Collor. Would we go out into the streets to repress the people 
and defend a president who was clearly involved in corruption 
and who did not have the people's support? That was the worst 
moment for us, the military commanders. 
  [ISTOE] Did you discuss the issue with other military 
commanders? 
  [De Lucena] I did. We decided that if there was no 
impeachment, we were still obligated to defend the president. 
Fortunately, the theory that the impeachment process would not 
be approved by Congress was remote. All of us were quite aware 
of that. 
  [ISTOE] For whom did you vote in the last elections? 
  [De Lucena] I voted for Collor in both instances. He 
disappointed me very much. 
  [ISTOE] Had you been aware of what was to take place, would 
you have voted for [Workers Party, PT, leader Luis Ignacio da 
Silva] Lula? 
  [De Lucena] Absolutely. He was the other choice. Brazil 
comes first, does it not? 
  [ISTOE] Your meeting with Deputy Aloizio Mercadante [Workers 
Party -- Sao Paulo] was much discussed. Do you empathize with 
the PT? 
  [De Lucena] I empathize with Deputy Mercadante's father, 
General Oswaldo Muniz Oliva, who is in the reserves. I see no 
problem in meeting with a PT deputy. I also met with Deputy 
Jose Genoino [PT-Sao Paulo], and with deputies from other 
parties. The Army relies on Congress for many things. There 
are amendments, drafts that deserve our respect. I am 
interested in being on good terms with Congress. It is all part 
of the rites of a democratic regime. 
  [ISTOE] Sir, do you believe that the anti-left hysteria 
within the Armed Forces has been overcome? 
  [De Lucena] Yes, it has been overcome. There are only some 
reactions of little significance. 
  [ISTOE] Who are responsible for these reactions? 
  [De Lucena] People who have not developed, who have not 
witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
  [ISTOE] Are there many such people within the Army? 
  [De Lucena] No, not among those on active duty. I assess the 
issue in the following manner: There are two kinds of military 
officers in Brazil -- those who graduated from the Royal 
Military School, and those who graduated from the Agulhas Negras 
Military Academy [AMAN] in Resende. I believe that the opening 
of the AMAN school in 1944 marked a change in the mentality of 
the Brazilian military officer. 
  [ISTOE] Do you believe you represent a generation of 
military 
officers who have a different mentality, a different attitude? 
  [De Lucena] I believe so. The generations that emerged from 
AMAN were trained in more open and modern surroundings. What 
fascinated us in our youth -- and many entered the Army because 
of it -- were the deeds of the Allies in World War II. We were 
fighting for democracy at the time. 
  [ISTOE] Are you the first officer graduated from AMAN to be 
appointed Army minister? 
  [De Lucena] No, the second. The first was General Carlos 
Tinoco Ribeiro Gomez, who was Army minister during the Collor 
administration. 
  [ISTOE] The generation that emerged from the Royal Military 
School chose the Communists as the enemies of Brazil. Who are 
Brazil's enemies today? 
  [De Lucena] As I said after I was installed, I believe that 
the worse enemy we must face today is poverty, because this is 
the root of all our evils. 
  [ISTOE] Is the Army involved in other social assistance 
areas? 
  [De Lucena] In the health sector, we assist in vaccination 
campaigns. In border areas, it is Army doctors who look after 
the local population. Our doctors and dentists are working in 
the Amazon region. The Brazilian Army is multifaceted. In the 
south, we have a more combatant, better trained Army. In the 
northeast, the Army is more involved in social assistance 
activities. In the northeast, we have engineering battalions 
who drill wells and build dikes. 
  [ISTOE] Is the Brazilian Army well equipped? 
  [De Lucena] We have made a great effort to modernize it. 
President Franco obtained some resources, and we will be 
receiving a lot of modern equipment by June. This is a good 
thing, because it motivates young officers and helps us to avoid 
those problems we faced in the past. 
  [ISTOE] Will Brazil sign the missile treaty that the 
Argentine Government has just signed? 
  [De Lucena] I have nothing against it. But all treaties of 
this nature are being reviewed by Congress. The Army is not in 
charge of conducting the negotiations. 
  [ISTOE] The trend in countries such as the United States is 
to reduce the number of military troops and to have professional 
soldiers. Are you in favor or against mandatory military 
service? 
  [De Lucena] Completely in favor. I believe it is a 
necessity, and I also believe it is good for the upbringing of 
young men. I usually say that the Brazilian Army is different. 
It cannot be compared with the American Army. The United 
States has world interests, and has to look after its capability 
and political power. The concept of the Brazilian Army is that 
which prevails in France: that of the citizen-soldier. A lot of 
money is spent to support a trained soldier. The Army must pay 
good salaries if it is to compete in the job market. This would 
not be good for us. Moreover, I do not believe we have a large 
Army. The Brazilian Army has 200,000 men. I believe this 
figure is compatible with our country's needs. 
  [ISTOE] During the Geisel administration, the Army was 
alloted 16 percent of the national budget. Today it is alloted 
only 0.5 percent of the budget. What is your opinion of this? 
  [De Lucena] I believe this is a ridiculous amount. The most 
serious problem is that concerning salaries. And it is not only 
within the Army. Today all officers are poorly paid. This 
month we will get a slight salary increase to compensate for 
last year's loss in purchasing power. We are not happy about 
it, but it helps. It is disturbing to see someone reach the end 
of his career without being able to support a child. 
  [ISTOE] There are officers who want their salaries to be 
equivalent to that of personnel from the legislative and 
judiciary branches on the basis of the principle of salary 
equalization. What is your opinion? 
  [De Lucena] I believe that salary equalization is a utopia. 
It does not exist. What is important is to implement a salary 
policy that reduces today's foolishness. 
  [ISTOE] Many military officers who were involved in the 1964 
revolution believed that corruption in Brazil was monopolized by 
civilians. What is your opinion? 
  [De Lucena] I disagree. I believe that because of its own 
structure the Army is in a better condition to repress 
corruption when it arises. In the Army there is immediate 
punishment. In addition, the admission criteria for the Army 
are much stricter than those for Congress. Nevertheless, I do 
not believe anyone holds a monopoly on corruption. 
  [ISTOE] Do you admire any civilian leaders? 
  [De Lucena] I have always been a fan of good administrators. 
Carlos Lacerda was a great administrator. There are also some 
contemporary politicians whom I greatly admire, such as Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Deputy Roberto Magalahes, 
who was governor of my home state. 
  [ISTOE] Does the Army empathize with current events in 
Congress? 
  [De Lucena] Absolutely. I was disgusted when I learned that 
public resources, which could have been put to good use, are 
serving personal interests. 
  [ISTOE] Are there people in the Army who still believe that 
all politicians are thieves? 
  [De Lucena] Of course there are. But this is also true of 
civilians. Wasn't it Lula who said that there were 300 
swindlers in Congress? That is right. But this is unimportant, 
because the guilty will be punished. 
  [ISTOE] You referred to the extreme poverty issue. Is the 
Army also concerned about violence, particularly that in Rio de 
Janeiro? 
  [De Lucena] Undoubtedly, but this a very delicate issue 
about 
which I would not like to comment. 
  [ISTOE] Will the much discussed Army intervention in the 
hills [of Rio de Janeiro] ever take place? 
  [De Lucena] No, unless either the governor or the president 
requests it. We cannot take on the fight against violence, 
because the Constitution does not allow it. A 19-year-old 
serving in the Army is not trained to climb the hill and fight 
drug traffickers. As I have said, this is a very delicate issue. 
What we can do is what is being done: support the Federal 
Police and the local state police forces. 
  [ISTOE] Was the military regime good or bad for Brazil? 
  [De Lucena] It was good because it built an infrastructure 
that the country lacked. That cannot be denied. But from the 
point of view of political progress, of course it was harmful. 
  [ISTOE] Will you stay in government until the end of the 
Franco administration? 
  [De Lucena] Yes, unless they kick me out before that. 
  [ISTOE] Do you believe there may some antagonism within the 
Army regarding Lula's candidacy? 
  [De Lucena] I do not think so. What I can guarantee is the 
following: Whoever wins, will lead. The Army will guarantee 
the installation of the next president in compliance with the 
Constitution, whoever is elected. 
  [ISTOE] What do you intend to do after the Franco 
administration, when you leave the Army? 
  [De Lucena] I am going to try to be a good grandfather.

<F P=106> [Interview with retired Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, director </F>
of strategic studies at the University of Campinhas, who was 
chosen by the Workers Party, PT, to outline the party's military 
policy for presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva by 
Emanuel Neri; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Neri] If da Silva is elected, does the PT intend to 
enlarge investments in the military area from 0.5 percent to 2 
percent of the GDP? 
  [Cavagnari] The current investment in the military area is 
0.5 percent of the GDP, and it is believed that this is not 
enough to maintain a military force with satisfactory 
operational capabilities. Now that the Armed Forces' 
reorganization and the updating of its equipment with new 
technology have been proposed, that percentage should be 
increased to 2 percent of the GDP if possible. It is made clear, 
however, that this gradual increase over five years must not 
obstruct social priorities. 
  [Neri] Does the PT hopes to restart all the military 
programs? 
  [Cavagnari] Of the programs that must be continued, only the 
nuclear and the Calha Norte programs are considered 
controversial. The first one is controversial by its own nature; 
it is the nuclear submarine. The Calha Norte program because it 
enlarges the military presence in an area sensitive to 
environmentalists. [sentence as published] But the two programs 
are necessary for Brazil. I also will propose the continuation 
of the space, AMX (aircraft), and Antarctic programs. 
  [Neri] Why are the nuclear and Calha Norte programs 
important? 
  [Cavagnari] In addition to developing scientific and 
technological training, the nuclear program will give the 
country the possibility of getting the means (nuclear submarine) 
for a more effective defense of the maritime border. The Calha 
Norte program will help reinforce the defense of the northern 
border region. Currently, both the border region north of 
Solimoes-Amazonas and the maritime border are the two most 
sensitive areas of the national territory, and are poorly 
defended. 
  [Neri] Does the PT hope to create a defense ministry? 
  [Cavagnari] Brazil is the only country in the world that 
does 
not have a defense ministry. Its creation aims to guarantee 
unity for carrying out the defense policy by putting aside the 
confrontation of the specific interests of each force -- Army, 
Navy, and Air Force. It is clear that this initiative also will 
contribute to consolidating the Armed Forces' subordination to 
the civilian power. There is no doubt that this will contribute 
to the rational use of the budget based on a single defense 
policy. 
  [Neri] How are the Armed Forces behaving in the current 
political crisis in the country? 
  [Cavagnari] They have had exemplary behavior. They made an 
explicit declaration that they will make the greatest effort not 
to run away from democracy. 
  [Neri] With the end of the national security doctrine and 
the 
cold war, does the Armed Forces have enemies now? 
  [Cavagnari] Brazil is a country that has threats, no 
question 
about it. But the threats are to the environment, to 
biodiversity. There is no doubt that the obstructions to Brazil 
having access to advanced technology are threats to national 
interests. But they are threats that do not justify the use of 
force. What happens is that those that threaten have a military 
capability so disproportional in relation to us that we cannot 
consider it a threat that must be eliminated by force. 
  [Neri] Do you believe a better use of the Armed Forces could 
be made to prevent them from being inactive? 
  [Cavagnari] The Armed Forces must be used for what they were 
created for -- that is, national defense. They must be prepared 
and trained for that. This does not prevent them, however, from 
cooperating under certain circumstances in other nonmilitary 
activities. They can be used at certain times, under certain 
critical situations, even in public security. They can be used 
in the construction of roads and dams but not as part of their 
main activities but as a complement, as simple civil cooperation. 
  [Neri] What is the current profile of Brazilian officers? 
  [Cavagnari] In technical terms our officers are well 
prepared. Unfortunately, we are experiencing difficulties and 
even the development of that training is jeopardized. In terms 
of political thoughts, I would say that Brazilian officers are 
evolving, maturing. They are losing some authoritarian way of 
thinking in Brazil and they already are admitting that Brazil 
must be thought of within the framework of democracy. 
  [Neri] Do you think the officers are currently more 
democratic? 
  [Cavagnari] I would say there are increasingly more officers 
who accept democracy. Those who do not accept democracy, those 
who are authoritarian by nature, are becoming a minority among 
the military. 
  [Neri] Some Armed Forces members oppose the demarcation of 
Indian reserves. What do you think of this? 
  [Cavagnari] They react because of the size of the land 
granted to the Indians. They react because they cannot accept 
that Indian lands do not allow a military presence in them. They 
cannot accept that national sovereignty cannot be exercised on 
these lands. They are right, especially regarding border areas. 
  [Neri] What do you think must be modified in the 
Constitution 
regarding the Armed Forces? 
  [Cavagnari] We must eliminate the words "law and order." The 
Armed Forces should only defend the fatherland and the 
government powers. In the case of national defense, the objects 
of defense are the national territory and interests. Within the 
constitutional order the objects of defense are the political 
institutions of a democratic state of law. The reference to 
order (foreseen in the current Constitution) allows the 
government to use the Armed Forces against any law-threatening 
movement, sometimes, unjustifiably. 
  [Neri] Is there less Armed Forces resistance to an eventual 
triumph by da Silva? Is there any risk of insubordination? 
  [Cavagnari] There is no risk of insubordination in case of 
his triumph. Da Silva's acceptance rate is increasing while the 
rate of rejection is decreasing. He has an acceptance rate 
higher than in 1989. 
  [Neri] Why have you joined the PT? 
  [Cavagnari] I have been cooperating with the PT since 1987. 
In 1989, when da Silva ran in a second round of voting, I was 
invited, together with other people, to prepare a draft of the 
PT's policy for the military. I maintained that contact. I have 
not officially joined any party, but among all the Brazilian 
political parties, I prefer the PT. I agree with many of its 
policies and disagree with a few others. 
  [Neri] What are the issues you disagree with? 
  [Cavagnari] I do not favor nationalizations as much as other 
PT groups. I do not defend government monopoly as much as other 
PT groups do. As for foreign capital, I am a bit more liberal 
than other PT groups.

  [Text] Maracay -- The National Armed Forces [FAN] will 
respect the decision by President-elect Rafael Caldera, who will 
take the oath of office on 2 February as president and commander 
in chief of the FAN. 
  This was made clear by Major General Angel Rafael Montero 
Revette, inspector general of the Army, who will be the next 
minister of defense according to the statement Rafael Caldera 
made to the nation. Montero Revette presided over a ceremony in 
this city at the Maracay Branch of the Army Noncommissioned 
Officers School, where he was questioned by some journalists on 
whether there would be problems with the Caldera announcement 
regarding changes in the High Command. 
  The next defense minister said he thinks there will not be 
problems in the FAN with the appointment of a new military High 
Command, because President-elect Caldera knows very well the 
military laws and attributions he will have when he takes over 
as commander in chief. According to Gen. Montero Revette, FAN 
personnel will begin observing Rafael Caldera's decisions at the 
very moment he assumes the presidency of the Republic. He added 
that according to the Constitution, FAN personnel are 
subordinated to the civilian rule exercised by the chief 
executive. Consequently, he concluded, there will be no problems 
in this regard.

  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] dissident faction on 24 
January rejected the actions carried out by members of the 
Shining Path leadership to reach "a peace agreement" with the 
government and labeled them "capitulators, informers, and 
cowards." 
  The manifesto is a reply to a letter released on 23 January 
in which many Shining Path inmates expressed their "decided and 
total support for the strategic decision" of Abimael Guzman to 
negotiate peace with the government. 
  The dissident SL faction's manifesto was sent to several 
Lima 
newspapers and signed by a so-called SL Lima Regional Committee 
and a "Committee of Relatives of Peruvian Political Prisoners, 
Prisoners of War, and Missing People." This latter committee, 
which presents itself as a SL military branch for the first 
time, apparently has abandoned its semi-legal status and decided 
to go underground. 
  The dissident faction is headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
alias "Comrade Feliciano," who allegedly is responsible for the 
attacks that took place in Lima in December on the occasion of 
Mao's 100th birthday. 
  The dissidents use violent language against those who 
approve 
of the peace initiative ("revisionist bitch's excrement") and 
accuse them of being "servants of Yankee imperialism." 
  The threats are aimed against the members of the SL 
leadership, including Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay, 
Maria Pantoja, and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, among others. 
  According to the manifesto, those SL leaders want to murder 
Guzman, whom the dissidents continue to respect as their leader. 
According to analysts consulted by this daily, this demonstrates 
the desperate efforts this dissident faction is making to make 
their decimated followers believe that their top leader is not 
aware of the peace negotiations, when it is widely known to the 
public that Guzman himself has sent several letters to the 
government asking for a peace agreement.

  [Text] Henrique Hargreaves, former civilian household chief

  [Text] A few moments ago Army Division General Rafael Angel 
Montero Revette was sworn in as defense minister. Following the 
ceremony Montero and outgoing Defense Minister Radames Munoz 
spoke with reporters. 
  [Begin recording] [Montero] I was just sworn in as defense 
minister. Yesterday and today the commanders of all the 
military forces, the Armed Forces inspector general, and the 
joint chief of staff were also sworn in, and the new military 
hierarchy will be confirmed tomorrow by President Caldera. 
  Initially I will have three priorities at the Ministry: 
social welfare; everything pertaining to sanitation, garrison 
housing, clothing, food, and so on. My second priority will be 
training; I will consider the possibility of conducting joint 
maneuvers by the entire Armed Forces during the course of the 
year. My third priority will be the maintenance and recovery of 
all the installations and equipment that may be damaged. 
  [Munoz] It is my belief -- and I would characterize this as 
a 
piece of advice to the new minister -- that it is necessary to 
consolidate the Armed Forces' spirit of democracy, support the 
country's development and, above all else, within that support 
improve the Armed Forces' efficiency in border areas to give the 
country the reassurance it needs at this time that its food 
supply will be protected. [end recording]

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 1 Feb, CANA -- Guyana's 
president, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, has stated his government's 
commitment to good environmental development and respecting the 
rights of indigenous people. 
  Jagan was responding to an "open letter" and press statement 
circulated here last week by the Amerindian Peoples Association, 
which is linked to the Guyana Human Rights Association. 
  The "open letter" to the just-concluded World Bank Advisory 
Group meeting in Guyana bore the names of representatives of 
several regional and international organisations. It urged a 
freezing of aid to the country. 
  It said that this became important as new logging 
concessions, likely to be granted by the government, could 
affect the "Wai Wai" Amerindian tribe. 
  However, the meeting of the Caribbean Group for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (CGECD) apparently ignored the 
letter. 
  It concluded with firm commitments of 320 million US dollars 
in new economic aid for Guyana for the 1994-96 period, some 70 
US dollars million in excess of what was originally anticipated. 
  President Jagan said: "Aid donors and the governments 
providing aid to Guyana are quite aware of our policies and will 
not be side-tracked by anti-national groups and elements." 
  He told CANA it was "sad that well-meaning regional and 
international organisations that signed the "open letter" in 
good faith, did not seek to first better inform themselves about 
our policies". 
  "They would have found how much they were being misled by 
people here with their own negative agendas about our plans and 
commitment on environmental issues as well as ensuring the 
rights of the indigenous people," he added. 
  Jagan said that "very shortly" his government, which has a 
Ministry of Amerindian Affairs, would be organising a special 
conference of Amerindian representatives to deal with "the 
misrepresentations and mischief being promoted by those with 
their own selfish and opportunistic agendas." 
  He described the APA as "a front group for well-known 
opponents of this government", saying it was "not really 
representative of the broad mass of indigenous peoples." 
  The president also attacked the opposition People's National 
Congress, which had also called last week on the World Bank 
meeting to withhold any aid for the government unless it agrees 
to steer clear of the Marxist/Leninist ideology and end racial 
alleged discrimination. 
  Jagan said the PNC was "anti-national", engaging in what he 
termed "baseless accusations designed to undermine the best 
interest of Guyana."

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Martinez] </F>
  [Excerpt] Quito, 1 Feb (EFE) -- Today, protests over the 
gasoline price increases of up to 71 percent caused renewed 
disturbances in several Ecuadoran cities. Additionally, students 
announced a nationwide strike for tomorrow and another by labor 
unions on Thursday. 
  In Quito and other cities, there have been demonstrations 
every day since last Thursday, prior to the government's 
announcement of the price increases on Friday. At least 10 
policemen and an undisclosed number of youths have either been 
wounded or injured. According to the local press, approximately 
60 students have been arrested during clashes with the police. 
  Several student organizations have scheduled a nationwide 
strike tomorrow and the United Workers Front (FUT), Ecuador's 
most influential labor union, has summoned all sectors to a 
strike on Thursday. Indian associations, teachers unions and 
other organizations support the FUT strike. 
  The transportation sector has also warned the government 
that it will join the strike if state subsidies are not 
increased since the sector has been banned from raising bus 
fares. 
  Thursday's strike will be the third nationwide strike by 
labor unions against Sixto Duran-Ballen's conservative 
government since he took office in 1992. 
  FUT President Edgar Ponce warned that if the government 
refuses to take the protests into consideration and maintains 
its decision to increase gasoline prices, the FUT will call an 
"indefinite" strike on a later date. Ponce says the government's 
economic policy could prompt a "social explosion" in Ecuador 
like those in Chiapas (Mexico) and Santiago del Estero 
(Argentina). 
  Without joining the calls for a strike, business 
organizations, professional associations, opposition parties, 
and even certain deputies from the ruling party have also 
protested. 
  Former President Leon Febres Cordero (1984-88), mayor of 
Guayaquil, the most densely populated city in the country, 
described the increased prices as "crazy," and he said Ecuador 
is now "the poorest country on earth with the most expensive 
gasoline on earth." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Hundreds of students protested today against the 
government after fuel prices were increased by up to 71 percent. 
Despite rain and low temperatures in Quito, university and high 
school students had serious confrontations with the police, 
whose numbers have been insufficient to contain the 
demonstrators. 
  Vice President Alberto Dahik became a target of the protests 
in spite of the public force deployment downtown and throughout 
the city. A group of students threw rocks at the vice 
president's vehicle and broke the windows as he approached his 
offices near the presidential palace. Witnesses said Vice 
President Dahik emerged unscathed from the shower of rocks. The 
police reported that the demonstrators then tried to reach the 
presidential palace but were turned back by tear gas. 
  The Army began increasing security at the Ecuadoran 
presidential palace on Friday in the face of a wave of protests 
against the increase in fuel prices. More than 28 protest 
centers have been pinpointed in the capital. Students in 
Guayaquil held demonstrations during which transportation 
vehicles were hijacked and tires burned. 
  The government has announced the suspension of classes on 2, 
3, and 4 February throughout the nation in light of the general 
protest situation. Education Minister Rosalia Arteaga said: We 
ask the people to remain calm because violent attitudes do not 
solve the nation's internal problems. On the contrary, the 
problems get worse as they create a climate of uncertainty. 
Politicians responded that the Ecuadoran people have at the 
very least the right to protest. 
  Student federations and centers as well as teachers 
associations called for a strike on Wednesday. The workers 
called for a 24-hour preventive national strike on Thursday to 
protest the new prices and to exert pressure on the government 
to rectify the measures. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] 
  COCHABAMBA ENERGY PRODUCTION--The Bolivian Government Oil 
Deposits, YPFB, inaugurated the first gas reinjection plant in 
Cochabamba's Carrasco oilfield. The $2.5-million plant will 
prevent the burning of 20 million cubic feet per day, thus 
saving $22,000 daily. In addition, the installation of a 
thermoelectric plant in Carrasco by February or March will make 
Cochabamba the country's largest producer of energy. The plant, 
with an initial 40-megawatt gas turbine, will be financed by the 
Inter-American Development Bank, the National Electricity 
Enterprise (ENDE), and the Nordic Fund, which will disburse $10 
million for equipment. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 10, 11 Dec 93] 
  CHUQUISACA PETROLEUM, GAS PRODUCTION--According to the YPFB, 
Chuquisaca Department, which until recently ranked second in 
petroleum production, now occupies last place. The change 
occurred after August 1993 when all other departments increased 
production at a faster rate than Chuquisaca. Nevertheless, 
Chuquisaca continues to be number two in gas production behind 
Santa Cruz, and is the origin of 45 percent of natural gas 
exported to Argentina. It is estimated that in 1994 three oil 
wells will be drilled: the Isipote X-1, by the YPFB, with an 
investment of $3 million; Cuevo X-I, by Chevron, with an 
investment of $6 million; and Esmeralda, Algarrobal, or 
Mandeyapecua, by Occidental, with an investment of $5 million 
[La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAIS 19 Dec 93] 
  DONORS' PLEDGES FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION, TOURISM, 
ENVIRONMENT--Following the World Bank-sponsored donors 
Consultative Group meeting in Washington, D.C. on 9 December, 
the International Development Association (IDA)--a World Bank 
affiliate--granted a $40-million loan to assist Bolivia's Social 
Investment Fund (FIS) in health, education, and potable water 
programs in depressed rural areas. In addition, a $50.7 million 
credit line was granted to assist the Integrated Children's 
Development Project in major cities, and another $137 million 
for the FIS will be disbursed in 1994-97. During the 
Consultative Group meeting, it was also decided to finance two 
tourism promotion projects on the order of $27 million. They 
include the establishment of a foundation to promote tourism and 
investments and the formation of a fund to develop the existing 
tourism infrastructure. In addition, Guillermo Justiniano, 
minister of sustainable development and environment, announced 
that projects worth $160 million were presented for his sector. 
The projects include evaluation of various aspects of the 
country's ecosystem such as forests and river basins, as well as 
reforestation projects, especially in the valleys and the 
altiplano. The minister also suggested Bolivia host a conference 
on sustainable development to be attended by heads of state of 
OAS member countries. [La Paz PRESENCIA 9, 24 Dec; EL DIARIO 17 
Dec 93] 
  JAPAN COOPERATION TO COMBAT DROUGHT--The Japanese 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will donate $10 million 
to the Chuquisaca Regional Development Corporation (CORDECH) to 
launch the Underground Water Master Plan, which aims at 
eliminating the persistent annual drought in the Chaco area. The 
project involves drilling wells deep enough to capture water in 
sufficient amounts for agriculture, cattle raising, and human 
consumption. Another JICA team visited Santa Cruz Department and 
promised a donation of $8 million to combat drought in 
Cordilleras and Chiquitos provinces. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 4 Dec 
93; La Paz PRESENCIA DE PAIS 8 Dec 93] 
  AGREEMENTS WITH JAPANESE AGENCY--JICA is recommending a 
credit line of $40 million to assist the Bolivian National 
Railway Enterprise in the acquisition of rolling stock. Japan 
will also donate $8 million worth of heavy equipment to La Paz 
Municipality under an agreement signed with JICA representatives 
and the Bolivian Ministry of Human Development. The equipment is 
to be used for infrastructure projects around the city. [La Paz 
EL DIARIO 10 Dec 93; Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 28 Dec 93] 
  ISRAELI DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE SOUGHT--Jaime Aparicio Otero, 
the under secretary for international political affairs in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced that Bolivia is seeking 
investment and assistance from Israel for various development 
projects. Cooperation is sought in the areas of biotechnology, 
solar energy, educational reform, and the exploitation of water 
resources in the Chaco. Israeli experts and companies are 
already involved in projects to prevent water pollution, recycle 
water, improve seed stocks, and produce chemicals for the mining 
industry. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 9 Dec 93] 
  SWISS SUPPORT FOR EXPORTS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION--Under 
an 
agreement signed between Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio 
Aranibar and Swiss Commercial Attache Max Inhelder, Switzerland 
has pledged $4.36 million to support projects promoting 
agricultural exports and environmental protection. [Cochabamba 
LOS TIEMPOS 17 Dec 93] 
  BELGIUM PROMOTES HEALTH PROGRAMS--The Belgian Government 
will 
allocate $3 million under an agreement signed with the Bolivian 
Government to promote the development of the Local Health 
Networks (SILOS) in Santa Cruz Department. The four-year program 
will provide training for medical personnel and equipment for 
health centers. Belgian aid to the country for 1993-95 is 
expected to be about $18 million. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 30 Nov 
93] 
  ALTERNATIVE CROPS INCREASING IN THE CHAPARE--According to 
the 
Regional Alternative Development Program (PDAR), the cultivation 
of alternative crops in the Chapare has increased 964.5 percent 
in the last seven years from 254 hectares in 1986 to 2,608 
hectares. Principal crops under cultivation include citrus 
fruits, pineapples, bananas, palmetto, black peppers, and 
passion fruit. The area dedicated to grazing has also increased. 
The farmers, while admitting that the change from coca was 
difficult at first, have now increased the quantity and quality 
of their products and expect to export them on the regional and 
international markets. The establishment of processing plants is 
also envisaged. A German firm is studying the possiblity of 
investing $7 million in a plant to process passion fruit juice 
for export to Europe. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 22 Dec 93] 
  ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN COCHABAMBA--The National 
Alternative Development Fund (FONADAL) announced that it has 
financed some $300 million worth of projects and programs aimed 
at eliminating illegal coca cultivation in the Cochabamba 
tropics. One of the principal projects envisaged for 1994, for 
which $100 million is sought from international donors, is a 
training program for 50,000 coca farmers in the Chapare 
province. Other projects include the establishment of processing 
plants for cooking oil, syrups, vinegar, and fruit in Chimore, 
and a milk-processing plant in the Ibergarzama region. The 
Regional Alternative Development Program (PDAR) will invest $15 
million in various projects in the Cochabamba tropics, 
especially the Chapare. Priority will be given to roads, 
bridges, ditches, and sewerage systems, which will require 
financing of approximately $8 million. Overall, the PDAR will 
receive $120 million up to 1997 under agreements signed with the 
United States. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 7, Dec 93; Santa Cruz EL 
MUNDO 23 Dec 93] 
  CAMELIDAE CONSERVATION, DEVELOPMENT--Bolivia will become the 
principal center of a regional cooperation program for the 
management and conservation of South American camelidae 
(alpacas, llamas, vicunas, and guanacos). The project will 
receive support from the Inter-American Institute of 
Agricultural Livestock Cooperation and will receive $800,000 
from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) 
and $500,000 (Canadian) from the Canadian Agency for 
International Development. The program aims at improving the 
lives of 4,800 families in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, and Peru 
who depend on camelidae-raising and occupations deriving from 
it. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 29 Nov 93] 
  MORTALITY, CHILD LABOR, UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS--In a 
commentary entitled "Burning Realities," commentator Dante Pino 
Archondo, cites figures from the Ministry of Human Development's 
statistical analysis unit, UDAPSO, to demonstrate the depth of 
Bolivian poverty and condemn the government's indifference to 
it. He also said that in a democracy, social statistics should 
be "available to all" and not just to a "technocratic elite" 
that "stresses only what is convenient" and suppresses anything 
that "threatens its interests." 

  -  70 percent of Bolivians are poor. 
  -  Of the 2,725,946 
Bolivians who live in rural areas, 95.14 percent are poor. 
  -  As of 
1991, 73.8 percent of the 2,488,800 Bolivians living in major 
cities were of working age. Of this total 36 percent were 
employed, the others were unemployed, or "inactive." 
  -  Mortality 
rates have decreased--75 per thousand in 1992 from 151 per 
thousand in 1976. 
  -  Fertility rates have also gone down--5 births 
per woman in 1992 from 6.5 in 1976. The commentator laments 
Bolivia's status as a "subworld of the Third World." "We extend 
our hands to receive charity from other countries calling it 
donations or nonreimbursable aid because we are unable to pay 
anything back. That is what we have been reduced to. Bolivia 
survives." [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 6 Dec 93] The same concerns 
are further addressed in reports by the Pastoral and Social 
Episcopal Commission's Department of Research and Analysis and 
the Ministry of Human Development. 
  -  Infant mortality remains at 
126/1000, mainly in rural areas. 
  -  Over half of Bolivian children 
are malnourished, especially those between six and 24 months of 
age. 
  -  30.6 percent of Bolivia's work force are children between 
the ages of seven and 19. 
  -  Approximately 40,000 children enter 
the work force each year, according to the 1992 Population and 
Housing Census. The reports conclude that the main challenges 
facing the government in its fight against poverty are increases 
in child and peasant woman labor, and in malnutrition and infant 
mortality. [La Paz PRESENCIA 7, 24 Dec 93] 
  SANTA CRUZ GROWTH PATTERNS--The National Population and 
Housing Census reports that Santa Cruz Department's 4.4 percent 
population growth rate is the highest in the country and that 
the population has reached 1.359 million. Unlike other Bolivian 
departments, the population--living in the province where the 
departmental capital of Santa Cruz de la Sierra is situated--is 
mostly urban (71.9 percent). Other data reveal that the average 
age of a resident of Santa Cruz is 22 years, infant mortality 
has been reduced from 120 per thousand in 1976 to 57 in 1992, 
and illiteracy has been reduced to 11.1 percent. Jorge 
Mirtenbaum, who is responsible for drawing up Santa Cruz City's 
Urban Development Plan, said that the departmental capital has 
700,000 inhabitants and is growing at a rate of 6.42 percent per 
year. Most immigrants to Santa Cruz come from Cochabamba, 
Chuquisaca, and Beni, as well as from other provinces within the 
department. Mirtenbaum added that the informal sector (street 
vendors, bootblacks, etc.) represents the city's largest 
job-producing sector, generating 42.8 percent of its gross 
domestic product. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 19 Dec 93; La Paz 
PRESENCIA 19 Dec 93] 
  EL ALTO DEVELOPMENT--The La Paz Regional Development 
Corporation (CORDEPAZ) will invest $25 million in various 
projects for El Alto, a satellite city outside La Paz considered 
the third largest city in Bolivia, with a population of 405,000 
and a 9.2 percent population growth rate. El Alto's bishop Msgr. 
Jesus Juarez pointed out that the city is experiencing 
"uncontrolled" demographic growth, and that the central 
government cannot continue to ignore basic needs such as potable 
water, electricity, sewerage, and employment. He urged the 
central government and El Alto authorities to seek a 
"progressive and coordinated solution to prevent the outbreak of 
crime and violence." [La Paz PRESENCIA 14, 21 Dec 93]

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 30 Jan 
(NOTIMEX) -- It was reported today that the Mexican Government 
has earmarked 600 million new pesos to meet the most pressing 
needs and demands of Indian and peasant communities in Chiapas 
State. 
  Alejandro Pillar Borja, delegate of the Social Development 
Secretariat in Chiapas, explained that the new resources will be 
channeled for the exclusive support of the two sectors. 
  Approached by NOTIMEX after delivering a report on 
priorities 
to Manuel Camacho Soils, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, Pillar Borja explained that the 
support does not include luxury projects. 
  On 1 January, groups of armed Indians seized four towns in 
Chiapas State in southeast Mexico, thus prompting military 
intervention and a quick conciliatory action by the government 
to restore peace. 
  In a general way, the Indians are calling for attention to 
their urgent economic, political, and social needs. 
  Pillar Borja stressed that "only the peasants and the 
Indians 
will present projects to be carried out in their places of 
origin (...) to lay the groundwork for better development in 
Chiapas." 
  The regional committees of the National Solidarity Program 
(Pronasol) will be responsible for delivering and supervising 
the funds. 
  In view of the problems caused by the conflict, Pronasol 
sped 
up its working plan to meet the most urgent demands of the poor 
people, the official explained.

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Eight national political parties and their 
presidential candidates have pledged to join efforts for peace, 
democracy, and justice. The document was signed before the 
Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] General Council, where it was 
also announced that there could be changes in the Electoral Law 
in advance of the 21 August elections. 
  The first meeting was chaired by Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo, who serves as IFE president. He disclosed a commitment 
made by the political parties and their presidential candidates. 
The commitment is for peace, democracy, and justice, and it is 
designed to put an end to violence and to further the democratic 
process by way of the law. For this they agreed: 
  [Begin Carpizo recording] To adopt decisions that will lead 
to create conditions of trust and stability in all of the 
institutions that will participate in the elections. [end 
recording] 
  In addition, the political parties agreed to foster and 
maintain the social and political conditions that will guarantee 
a climate of trust for productive investment and economic growth 
within a framework of stability and respect for everyone's 
rights. 
  To conclude, the government secretary insisted that this 
year's challenge is to hold honest and open elections within a 
legal framework. 
  [Begin Carpizo recording] We must act responsibly, and we 
must all take up truth as our motto and our aspiration. Let us 
struggle for our causes, but within a legal framework. We have 
a point of reference in the law. When it becomes necessary to 
apply or to modify the law, it should be within the commitments 
made and within the correct institution, and this is precisely 
the goal of the IFE General Council. [end recording] 
  The IFE General Council fixed at 134.460 million new pesos 
the ceiling for campaign expenses that each party can spend in 
this year's presidential election. This amount is more than 
five times less than an original estimate of 722 million new 
pesos. In December this amount had already been reduced to 
336,151 million new pesos. The ceiling of political campaigns 
was reduced by 82 percent, taking into account the 722 million 
pesos originally proposed. This is the result of a complex 
mathematical operation. It is based on the unit value of six 
pesos and 39 cents per deputy seat assigned by relative 
majority, to which is added the inflation rate; then it is 
multiplied by the number of voters registered, and it is also 
multiplied by a value fittingly assigned for the duration of the 
political campaign.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 1 Feb, CANA -- Guyana's 
president, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, has stated his government's 
commitment to good environmental development and respecting the 
rights of indigenous people. 
  Jagan was responding to an "open letter" and press statement 
circulated here last week by the Amerindian Peoples Association, 
which is linked to the Guyana Human Rights Association. 
  The "open letter" to the just-concluded World Bank Advisory 
Group meeting in Guyana bore the names of representatives of 
several regional and international organisations. It urged a 
freezing of aid to the country. 
  It said that this became important as new logging 
concessions, likely to be granted by the government, could 
affect the "Wai Wai" Amerindian tribe. 
  However, the meeting of the Caribbean Group for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (CGECD) apparently ignored the 
letter. 
  It concluded with firm commitments of 320 million US dollars 
in new economic aid for Guyana for the 1994-96 period, some 70 
US dollars million in excess of what was originally anticipated. 
  President Jagan said: "Aid donors and the governments 
providing aid to Guyana are quite aware of our policies and will 
not be side-tracked by anti-national groups and elements." 
  He told CANA it was "sad that well-meaning regional and 
international organisations that signed the "open letter" in 
good faith, did not seek to first better inform themselves about 
our policies". 
  "They would have found how much they were being misled by 
people here with their own negative agendas about our plans and 
commitment on environmental issues as well as ensuring the 
rights of the indigenous people," he added. 
  Jagan said that "very shortly" his government, which has a 
Ministry of Amerindian Affairs, would be organising a special 
conference of Amerindian representatives to deal with "the 
misrepresentations and mischief being promoted by those with 
their own selfish and opportunistic agendas." 
  He described the APA as "a front group for well-known 
opponents of this government", saying it was "not really 
representative of the broad mass of indigenous peoples." 
  The president also attacked the opposition People's National 
Congress, which had also called last week on the World Bank 
meeting to withhold any aid for the government unless it agrees 
to steer clear of the Marxist/Leninist ideology and end racial 
alleged discrimination. 
  Jagan said the PNC was "anti-national", engaging in what he 
termed "baseless accusations designed to undermine the best 
interest of Guyana."

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy last night said that 
he has yet to make a final decision regarding the U.S. 
Government's offer to deploy 600 U.S. servicemen in Paraguayan 
territory for five months, to erect a number of buildings in San 
Pedro Department. 
  Wasmosy denied having earlier expressed an opinion on this 
matter. He noted that all he had done so far was to meet with 
military representatives at the Armed Forces headquarters and 
with members of the Congressional Standing Committee to hear 
their views on this matter. 
  Wasmosy, who made these remarks last night upon his arrival 
in the country after visiting Ecuador and Peru, also announced 
that the Paraguayan Government will convey its decision to the 
United States through the Foreign Ministry. 
  A controvery over this issue erupted among politicians and 
lawmakers during Wasmosy's absence. Several congressmen have 
voiced support for the entry into our country of the U.S. 
servicemen. Asked whether his answer would be positive or 
negative, he said he would answer this question as soon as "I 
arrive and have time to stop and think about it."

  [Text] Quito -- Paraguay will supply Ecuador with breeders 
and genetic material to help that country develop its cattle 
breeding sector, especially in tropical and subtropical zones. 
This was yesterday stated in a joint communique signed by 
Presidents Sixto Duran-Ballen and Juan Calos Wasmosy at the 
conclusion of the official visit by the Paraguayan chief of 
state. 
<H5>  Air Transport </H5>
  Taking into account the cargo transportation difficulties 
that the two countries have, with a lack of connections that 
could further promote tourism and commerce, the presidents 
emphasized the importance of air transport for promoting 
development between the two nations. They agreed to instruct 
the aeronautical authorities in their respective countries to 
continue and to intensify the dialogue on the benefits of an 
agreement for air transport between the two nations. 
  The presidents also reaffirmed their support for the role 
played by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] in the 
current situation, particularly as it refers to subregional 
integration agreements and to the promotion and liberalization 
of regional commerce. 
  In this regard they expressed their firm position with 
respect to the observance of the preferential treatment provided 
for by the Treaty of Montevideo of 1980 for the countries of 
lower relative development. 
<H3>  Agreement Between Paraguay and Ecuador for the Protection of 
Investment </H3>
  Presidents Wasmosy and Duran Ballen also attended a ceremony 
during which Foreign Ministers Diego Paredes and Luis Ramirez 
Boettner signed a bilateral agreement for the promotion and 
reciprocal protection of investment. 
  Under the terms of this agreement each side promised to 
promote, within its territory and to the extent possible, 
investments by the other side, putting them under its own laws 
and regulations. 
  The agreement notes that the party that has admitted 
investment in its territory will grant the necessary 
implementation permits. 
<H5>  Type of Investment </H5>
  The agreement defines the type of investments that will be 
admitted, and each party promises to protect them within its 
territory, granting them the treatment of more favored nation. 
  This implies fair and equitable treatment, no less favorable 
than the treatment that each party grants to its own investors 
or to third states. 
  Both sides also guarantee that the investors who avail 
themselves of the terms of this agreement may freely transfer 
the payments corresponding to their investment.

  [Text] New Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino Flores said 
that the possibility of eliminating the position of Armed Forces 
chief "is something that will have to be studied eventually." 
  Andino thus reacted to President Carlos Roberto Reina's 
statement to a local television station that the current 
historic moment demands changes in the military institution, 
including the possible elimination of that position. 
  He added, however, that he could not comment further on the 
subject as he had not heard Reina's statement. 
  Should that position be eliminated, Andino would assume 
leadership of the Armed Forces as defense minister. In that 
regard, he said: "I have been a soldier at the service of my 
country, and that is what I have always been wherever I have 
been assigned. Fortunately, all of my appointments have been 
important. I assume this post with the same satisfaction and 
with the desire to do my best." 
  He added that before eliminating the position of Armed 
Forces 
chief, "it should be studied first among political sectors, the 
Armed Forces, and Honduran leaders in order to make the decision 
that is best for the people. After all, we, the members of the 
Armed Forces, are part of the people." 
  Andino said that the post of commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces has its advantages in relation to the position of defense 
minister. He added, however, that "things are changing, and I 
believe that the position could continue to exist if it were 
updated, the necessary reforms were made, any negative aspects 
were corrected, and positive aspects highlighted.

<F P=106> [Report by Garfield Myers] </F>
  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 2 Feb, CANA -- An increase in the 
number of foreign exchange dealers, a 25-million U.S. dollar 
bond issue, and differential interest rates are among new 
measures announced by the Jamaica Government to stabilise the 
local dollar and boost the troubled economy. But the opposition 
Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) is already claiming the measures will 
fail. 
  "Nothing in the presentation will alter the present course 
of 
the economy or halt the slide" of the dollar, insisted 
opposition leader Edward Seaga in response to Prime Minister 
Percival Patterson's address in parliament late Tuesday. 
  Since June last year, the Jamaica dollar has slipped from 
what was then a relatively stable rate of 4.5 U.S. cents to just 
over three U.S. cents. The slide has fuelled high inflation of 
three percent a month in the last eight months, seriously 
increasing economic hardships for the majority of Jamaicans. At 
the same time, anti-inflationary measures by government have led 
to a hike in commercial interest rates to well over fifty 
percent, dampening the investment climate in the process. 
  Patterson announced that in a bid to increase the flow of 
hard currency through the official system, unify the currency 
exchange rate, and reduce currency black marketeering and 
tourist harassment, authorised dealership in foreign exchange 
would be expanded in "two parts." 
  First, a "cambio system" would be introduced, incorporating 
more than 100 hotels which currently buy hard currency from 
tourists through foreign exchange bureaux. The prime minister 
said that under the new system, hotels would be licensed "to buy 
and sell foreign exchange, 20 percent of which will be sold to 
the Bank of Jamaica" (central bank). 
  Secondly, the more than 20 merchant banks operating here 
will 
be given limited foreign exchange dealer status. This will allow 
them to take foreign currency deposits, make foreign currency 
loans, borrow foreign currency abroad, and arrange foreign 
currency lines of credit for their customers. 
  The merchant banks will be able to "access" the foreign 
currency facilities of the development credit banks to "support 
... the export sector and thus improve the supply side of the 
economy," Patterson reported. 
  The oil refinery, Petrojam, will also be given a limited 
foreign exchange license in order to meet its oil importing 
requirements, according to the prime minister. He stressed that 
with the new measures, laws against black market currency 
dealers would be strictly enforced. 
  Under existing laws, people buying and selling hard currency 
without a permit may be subject to heavy fines or imprisonment. 
  Patterson also announced plans to float a U.S.25 million 
dollar foreign exchange bond, expand the lending capacity of the 
Exim Bank by 50 million Jamaican dollars, lower lending rates by 
developing banks, and provide differential interest rates for 
small farmers and small businesses, in order to encourage 
production. 
  He said the proceeds from the bond issue would go to the 
National Development Bank and the Agricultural Credit Bank for 
on-lending to the productive sector. Negotiations were taking 
place with international lending agencies including the World 
Bank to find "a compromise" that would allow for the 
differential lending rates. The various multi-lateral lending 
agencies on which the Jamaica economy is dependent have 
steadfastly opposed such measures in the past. 
  Patterson renewed promises made to exporters last month that 
effective April 1, all import duties on raw materials for the 
export market would be removed, manufacturers would be allowed 
to accelerate capital depreciation of machinery over two years, 
and there would be a tax credit of 25 percent on the nominal 
value of bonus shares issued from the profits of a company, to 
expand its equity base. 
  While Patterson appeared optimistic that the new measures 
would work and that the Jamaican economy was on track to 
recovery, opposition leader Seaga poured scorn on the 
initiatives. He said the increase of the number of dealers in 
the market will not increase the flow of foreign exchange into 
the official system but will only "ensure that there will be 
even more dealers" in the hunt. 
  "What this will do is create even more pressure on the rate 
of exchange, as more "dogs" chase the same "bones." What the 
economy urgently needs is more "bones" not more "dogs," Seaga 
said.

  [Text] In Caracas on 1 February, Cuban Vice President 
Carlos Lage [title as heard] expressed his confidence that our 
country's relations with Venezuela will continue to develop 
under Rafael Caldera's government. Caldera takes office as 
president of Venezuela today. 
  Lage, who is on his way to Brazil, spent a few hours in 
Caracas, where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando 
Ochoa Antich and with Venezuelan businessmen. Lage told 
journalists this is a good moment for the ties between the two 
nations and said he had reason to expect these ties to continue 
to develop, because the Cuban and Venezuelan peoples are very 
much alike.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the </F>
Cuban National Assembly of the People's Government, from Bonn, 
by reporter Mejias -- live] 
  [Text] [Mejias] Good evening, Comrade Ricardo Alarcon. I am 
speaking to you from Havana, Cuba. 
  [Alarcon] Good evening, Comrade Mejias. 
  [Mejias] Well, we would like to learn something about the 
results of these first three working days in Germany and about 
the various activities you have been carrying out there. 
  [Alarcon] By all means. In fact, I am here at the embassy 
for 
a meeting with the chairman of the federal parliament. This is 
the first meeting we held with her, but tomorrow we are going to 
meet again in the morning. Representatives from all German 
political parties participated in this meeting tonight, 
including congressmen, representatives from the Foreign 
Ministry, from the research center, and from the cooperative 
development program. 
  [Mejias] Comrade Alarcon, have you talked about the 
possibility of increasing trade and the possibility of German 
investments in our country? 
  [Alarcon] Yes. I also wish to stress the fact that the 
German 
minister was already waiting for our visit, and that we were 
treated in a warm and friendly manner. The German people are 
also aware of our visit due to the broad coverage of the 
meetings. Germany is today the second country in the world and 
the first in Europe as to number of tourists visiting our 
country. There are also, as you know, some German investors who 
are participating in the construction of hotels in our country. 
There are some prospects as well for joint ventures with German 
companies in the pharmaceutical area. The talks also touched 
upon other areas of cooperation. These were the main subjects we 
discussed today with members of the Foreign Ministry. The legal 
instruments that would facilitate and promote German investments 
in our country are being discussed, and we are also discussing 
economic cooperation. 
  [Mejias] Thank you very much, Comrade Ricardo Alarcon de 
Quesada for these exclusive remarks for Radio Rebelde. 
  [Alarcon] Thank you, Mejias, and greetings to all. 
  [Mejias] Greetings to you as well.

possibility, with Cubanacan S.A., of forming a mixed civil 
aviation enterprise by 1995-96. The German businessman also 
offered to collaborate in promotions and advertising encouraging 
German tourist travel to Cuba. Another aspect is the possibility 
of increasing the German airline's flights from Dusseldorf to 
Cuba; nor did Driessen discard the idea of cruise ships.

  [Text] The involvement of Cuban organizations in exporting 
Chinese medical products to Latin America is imminent. This was 
stated in Beijing by participants in a joint meeting on 
cooperation in the sphere of medical products and biotechnology. 
This intention is expressed in one of the five accords that were 
signed by the two countries on 2 February. Another two accords 
were signed on 1 February. 
  Jose Luis Fernandez, head of the Cuban delegation to this 
bilateral conference in Beijing, also stated that this 
cooperation will result in the creation of new Cuba-PRC joint

  [Excerpt] We talked to National Baseball Commissioner 
(Domingo Sabala), who leaves for Japan tomorrow. We are going to 
hear an excerpt of our conversation. Our first question to him 
was: What are the fundamental objectives of this trip? 
  [Begin (Sabala) recording] The fundamental objectives of the 
trip are to analyze with the Japanese Amateur Federation the 
1994 agreement it has with Cuba, which is a very broad 
agreement. We (?plan to go there, in) June, with amateurs and 
professionals, with our team. And (?we will be in Japan again) 
in September-October, with professional teams. 
  There are plans for Japan to come to Cuba in February, with 
the national team, and a university team from Sendai to come to 
Cuba, in February. They are also interested in [words 
indistinct] Cuban technicians to work with their university 
team; and there is also a juvenile program established, for 
youths 16-18 years of age from the Cuban team to go to Japan for 
15 days beginning in 1994 -- because there is an annual plan for 
the relations between our teams for the youth world championship. 
  These are, broadly speaking, the things that we are going to 
discuss in Japan, and from that will emerge other talks. They 
want exchanges with our technicians, which are taking place now. 
Pedro Medina and Calzadilla will be traveling with me. They are 
going to work with the Dragons, in (Denagoya); the following 
week, Miguelito and Chinea from Villa Clara will go to work with 
the Tokyo Giants [words indistinct] give some 15-day courses, 
for our improvement. And they are also interested in learning 
the technical (?elements) of our baseball. (end recording]

  [Text] On 1 February, Cuba and the Argentine province of 
Misiones reached agreement on a compensated exchange of products 
and established formulas for putting this mutually beneficial 
collaboration into practice. Misiones Province Governor Federico 
Ramon Puerta and Acting Foreign Trade Minister German Amado 
Blanco signed the document, which will strengthen economic ties 
between the two nations. 
  The agreement proposes that Misiones Province send our 
island 
mainly lumber and paper, while Cuba would supply certain 
medicines, medical advice [asesoria], and specialized health 
services. Morever, according to what was learned at the signing 
of the cooperation agreement in Havana, a group of Cuban 
physicians will provide technical assistance in developing a 
primary health care program in Misiones Province. The agreement 
calls for a team of four experts in general medicine, a nurse, 
and a dentist to go to Misiones within the next few months to 
act as consultants in applying their Family Doctor Program 
experience to local conditions in Misiones.

  [Text] On 2 February, the newspaper GRANMA reports that the 
ranks of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and the Union of 
Young Communists [UJC] experienced a significant increase in 
1993 while maintaining their selective and vanguard nature. The 
newspaper adds that approximately 50,000 people joined the PCC 
and approximately 80,000 youths joined the UJC while the 
attrition rates remained at the level of the past 15 years. The 
growth in the PCC ranks represents a important political 
process, particularly in light of the broad participation of the 
people on the outstanding workers' assemblies. [as heard] The 
PCC needs to increase its under-30 membership in order to 
include the views of the young.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1255 GMT on 2 February, during its "Doing Radio" program, 
features an 18-minute roundtable conversation with Politburo 
member Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers 
Federation. 
  The program hosts introduce Ross for what they label a Radio 
Assembly of the Cuban People. The hosts stress that the workers' 
assemblies are not a passing notion but a mass movement that 
includes over 3 million workers and now students, according to 
recent statements by Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union 
of Young Communists. 
  Ross says: "I believe it is one of the most important, 
relevant political events of all time because no other country, 
ever, has conducted a workers' assembly to discuss national 
problems, particularly when the country is facing such a 
complex, difficult situation. It is precisely the workers' 
suggestions, their ideas, that become the basis for decisions. 
It is not a matter of conducting a parliamentary exercise. The 
goal is to conduct a true parliamentary operation to make 
decisions, suggest ideas, and promote action. We are gathering 
everything being said. There is even a computer program to store 
all the opinions and suggestions offered." 
  Ross adds that the 1 million retirees in Cuba can join 
former 
workplaces to participate in the assemblies. Ross reiterates 
that management's reports to the assemblies must be clear, 
concise, and to the point, noting the exemplary report presented 
by the manager of La Corona Cigar Factory at its ongoing 
assembly. 
  At this point, Ciego de Avila correspondent Fernando Sanchez 
states that approximately 120,000 workers will participate in 
the provincial workers' assemblies which began 1 February. 
Sanchez says that Ciego de Avila's Central Construction 
Enterprise workers called for increasing efficiency and cost 
reduction and discussed excess currency, unjustified sick 
leaves, confiscation of the money of the so-called macetas, and 
the need to increase production by increasing efficiency in the 
commerce and food industries. Santiago de Cuba correspondent 
Carlos Zanabria praises the concept of the workers' assembly as 
brilliant. When Ross interjects that it was President Fidel 
Castro's idea, Zanabria adds: "Brilliant, as is every idea of 
our commander in chief who has always helped us overcome highly 
complex national difficulties and thus enjoys such extraordinary 
admiration and the unlimited trust of the Cuban people." 
Zanabria stresses the need to make profits by producing with 
quality and efficiency, following the collapse of the socialist 
markets. 
  Ross announces that on 10 February he will be at Palma 
Soriano's Abel Santa Maria Printing Enterprise in Santiago de 
Cuba Province because it is an outstanding example of how 
production and workers' efforts can be realigned. This industry 
has sought ways of employing workers usefully instead of 
releasing them from their posts; it has also added surplus 
workers from other workplaces to its personnel roster. 
  Ross tells La Corona workers that he will visit the factory 
later in the day to discuss their efficiency and the issue of 
the 1 million cigars not produced. In response of a question by 
the host, Ross notes that "the workers' main suggestions have to 
do with increasing efficiency in the workplace" and gives 
examples of effective implementation of suggestions at the 
National Hospital, the Regla Fish Distribution Center, cigar 
factories, and the Finlay Research Institute. 
  Pedro Ross adds that the key is efficiency, citing the 
sphere 
of sports, which is contributing to the economy in addition to 
having become self-financing. He has visited a milk complex that 
is producing a good quality soy yogurt through its workers' 
efforts. Those workers discussed at length how to make the most 
of available resources. Ross notes that the next phase of the 
process is management's response and stresses that the measures 
implemented will result from the workers' suggestions. 
  Ross says he has refrained from offering ideas in order not 
to influence worker opinions, which he wants to come directly 
from them: "We want the workers to assume their roles as 
parliamentarians, as leaders of the country, and to determine 
the solutions to the problems we have." 
  Ross goes on to say that the workers are being highly 
responsible in pointing the finger at those who hamper efforts, 
as well as at the bureaucratic tangle in many sectors that is 
obstructing efforts to move ahead: "I have heard this in all 12 
assemblies in which I have participated: Our superstructure 
inhibits production and service efforts." 
  The host stresses that the workers can trust that whatever 
economic measures are taken will most benefit the country while 
least affecting the people. Ross agrees, thanks the hosts, and 
adds that he may appear on the program again after visiting 
Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba next week.

  [Text] The governments of Brazil and Qatar have decided to 
open embassies in Doha and Brasilia one year from now. This 
will be one more effort by the two countries to intensify 
bilateral trade relations. 
  Last year Brazilian imports from Qatar totalled $112 
million, 
basically in oil, while exports to that country amounted to only 
$29 million in chicken and iron ore. 
  The decision was made during the visit to Brazil by Qatar's 
Foreign Affairs Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al 
Thani.

  [Text] Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Paulo 
Tarso Flecha de Lima has sent a protest letter to the president 
of the World Bank over the statement by World Bank Director Said 
Hussein. 
  During a speech to the America's Society, which groups most 
of the bankers with whom Brazil is renegotiating its foreign 
debt, Hussein said Brazil is the biggest cloud on the Latin 
American horizon. 
  In his letter, the Brazilian ambassador said he is surprised 
at this statement because a World Bank official like Hussein 
cannot denigrate the image of a country which that bank should 
help.

  [Text] An accusation was made in the Amazon that 
high-quality wood smuggled by a U.S. company is being used as 
railroad ties in the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] The office of the 
U.S. company (Hatch Main) was located in a room of this hotel in 
downtown Manacapuru, 80 km from Manaus. The company owners 
disappeared but the last shipment of wood ready for shipment was 
left on the banks of the Solimoes River. The people living in 
the area told Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources] inspectors that the U.S. company 
(Hatch Main) has been buying wood from the region's Indians for 
more than eight months. 
  The inspectors discovered that the wood was shipped 
clandestinely directly to the United States, and that because of 
the wood's condition they believe it would be used for railroad 
ties. Ibama inspectors believe all the wood smuggled by the 
company was enough to build at least 300 km of railroad tracks. 
The shipment seized by Ibama, which is worth almost 6 million 
real cruzeiros, has more than 1,000 railroad ties of 
macaranduba, which is a high-quality wood that is becoming rare 
in the Amazon. The Federal Police now will investigate the 
whereabouts of the Americans and try to discover who was 
facilitating the shipment. [end recording]

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Interview with BNDES [National Bank for Economic and </F>
Social Development] president Persio Arida, by Miriam Leitao and 
Luiz Noronha, place and date not given; first three paragraphs 
are O GLOBO introduction] 
  [Text] During the entire time the FH [Fernando Henrique] 
Plan was being readied, economist Persio Arida remained in the 
background. He said very little and was hardly ever seen in 
public. On the day the plan was announced in Brasilia, he sat 
discreetly in a side chair at the large table that had been set 
up on the platform in the press conference room at the Ministry 
of Finance. 
  The first journalist in line at the microphone opened the 
question period. What Arida had tried to conceal was then 
revealed. The other members of the economic team and the 
officials seated at the table looked in his direction for the 
response. Rather awkwardly, he began to answer and became the 
central figure during practically the entire press conference. 
  At age 41, Persio Arida is, for the second time in his life, 
a key player on an economic team that is involved in a 
stabilization plan. The first time was during the Cruzado Plan. 
Still professorial, he displays more enthusiasm when he talks 
about the theoretical concept of the plan than about its 
practical application. He thinks it is too early to unveil 
mysteries such as, for example, whether the exchange rate 
between the new currency and the dollar will be a fixed rate. 
But he left no doubt on one point: the plan will cause losses, 
mainly for those who have something to gain from inflation. 
There is only one trick to guaranteeing this kind of plan: 
"political coalition." He also explains why he is staying in 
Rio, as president of the BNDES, rather than going to Brasilia. 
"Privatization is an integral part of any stabilization process." 
  [O GLOBO] The inflation rate is rising, the money supply is 
expanding, the Central Bank is having trouble selling bonds, and 
everyone thinks the minister will step down in April. Is this a 
good time for an economic plan? 
  [Persio Arida] Indeed the inflation rate has risen, but this 
must be attributed to a farm products price shock. But 
government paper is not being rejected; the NTN [National 
Treasury Notes] auctions prove this. As for the monetary 
expansion, it is a mistake that we must market bonds to shrink 
the monetary base. Building up reserves will produce practically 
the same effect. 
  [O GLOBO] So this is a good time? 
  [Persio Arida] A good time is when the public finances are 
in 
order. Now, therefore, is not really a good time. Unless the 
budget and the fiscal adjustment are approved, the right moment 
will not be created. That is what is most important. 
Furthermore, a stabilization plan announced during a "supply 
shock" will run into trouble. The third feature of a good time 
is the existence of a consensus in the minds of the public and 
the government about the imperatives of the stabilization. 
Stabilization does not come about because of an act by the 
finance minster. Any stabilization involves a net gain for 
society, but it always involves losses. 
  [O GLOBO] How does the apprehension about Minister Fernando 
Henrique's candidacy affect that coalition? 
  [Persio Arida] I would rather comment in greater depth on 
the 
political coalition. Stabilization involves far-reaching changes 
in the way the economy functions. It is not something that is 
applied topically. A technically well-designed program that does 
not have the backing of the public has a good chance of failure. 
That is why the question of the right moment, aside from the 
fiscal requisite, depends essentially on magic--in the sense 
that it charms, enchants, and so wins the support of society. 
  [O GLOBO] You mentioned losses. Are they digestible? 
  [Persio Arida] Every program has its costs. Since the 
identified losers have a stronger lobby than the scattered 
winners, the political balance is unquestionably difficult to 
maintain. 
  [O GLOBO] The initial version of the plan called for a slow, 
voluntary transition to the new currency. But no economist 
believes it is possible to eliminate a 40 percent [monthly] 
inflation rate this way. 
  [Persio Arida] The fact that contracting in URV's [Real 
Value 
Unit] is voluntary does not mean a drop in the inflation rate 
will not cause losses. We have had high inflation rates for more 
than two decades. We must assume that this inflation has deep 
roots. I would be the last to say that everyone will win. 
  [O GLOBO] And do you think this country is mature enough to 
understand this clearly? 
  [Persio Arida] My assessment is that our society is 
maturing.... 
  [O GLOBO] Maturing? 
  [Persio Arida] It is a process, it really is. Most of our 
problems were inherited from the decade of the 70's, the era of 
big nationalizations and regimentation of the economy. The State 
was the driving force of the Brazilian capitalist system; it had 
a fantastic power to choose the losers and the winners. That led 
to a series of imbalances. 
  [O GLOBO] When you ask a businessman if he believes the plan 
will turn out well, he answers that he is rooting for it. The 
fans are as irrational as those at a soccer game, but the public 
is not convinced that the plan can turn out well. What are the 
actual chances that the plan will work? 
  [Persio Arida] There are lots of fans, but plenty of 
caution. 
Some of the doubts result from the fact that stabilization in 
Brazil is truly difficult to achieve. We have said, 
simplistically, that Brazil has one currency for the rich and 
another one for the poor. But it reflects what is happening. An 
appreciable portion of our population has no bank accounts and, 
if they do, they cannot invest. That part of the population is 
the big beneficiary of a decline in the inflation rate. For 
those who are indexed, a 40 percent inflation rate is not so 
serious. "Serious" is what it is for the great majority of 
Brazilians. But it is interesting to note that all attempts at 
stabilization in Brazil have had popular support. 
  [O GLOBO] The popularity ratings of a finance minister 
usually go up in the same proportion as inflation declines. 
Imagine what would happen to a minister who is already popular 
when the inflation rate is at 40 percent.... 
  [Persio Arida] Stabilization is a difficult process. It 
demands an ability to resist very strong pressures--pressure not 
only from the general public, but from the lobbies. Some lobbies 
are rooting for the plan, provided the adjustments are made by 
others, not by them. The budget issue is an example of this. 
Everyone wants to cut someone else's spending. Stabilization 
demands a determined government. 
  [O GLOBO] Does the government have any appetite for going 
against special interests? 
  [Persio Arida] That is one of its biggest tests: being able 
to cut, and to defend the cuts in Congress. 
  [O GLOBO] The Congress does not want to bear the burden of 
the chaos that would follow the rejection of the budget, but it 
will certainly try to debate certain points. What points are 
non-negotiable? 
  [Persio Arida] We are talking about balancing the budget. 
Therefore, there is a quantitative restriction. We cannot depart 
from our zero goal. We have to be careful, because it is not 
only the zero goal that is important; the quality of the result 
matters, too. The budget has always involved estimates. If we 
overestimate the expected revenue, we will have a budget that 
will look balanced, but may not be so in the long run. In other 
words, depending on how it is done, one zero is not the same as 
another zero. Negotiation is part of any democratic process. 
  [O GLOBO] In a recent interview, you said that the more time 
spent in the process of adopting the new index mechanism, the 
better. However, Minister Fernando Henrique has said just the 
opposite. 
  [Persio Arida] With inflation at 40 percent, of course the 
faster the process moves, the better. That is what I want to 
see, too. The more rapidly the parts come together, the better. 
  [O GLOBO] But if it goes too quickly, might it not produce a 
hyperinflation in terms of the real cruzeiro? 
  [Persio Arida] We would like to see this recontracting in 
URV's translate into a real and permanent equilibrium. If we set 
deadlines, that will lead to ill-conceived transactions. 
Reducing the average period of indexation makes the index more 
volatile, both upward and downward. That is why it is a step 
that can only be taken when conditions are favorable. If we 
start from the hypothesis that the fiscal adjustment will be 
delayed and will not be approved, the tendency will be to 
stretch out the indexation. 
  [O GLOBO] Do you believe we are vulnerable to a risk of 
hyperinflation? 
  [Persio Arida] The classic definition of hyperinflation is 
an 
inflation rate above 50 percent. That definition comes from 
Philip Cagan, and is based on the inflationary processes that 
preceded World War II, when the financial system was not as 
technologically sophisticated as it is today. Those were 
processes that entered into spontaneous combustion. Once the 
process got started, people took their money out of the banks 
and tried to buy more things. The more they bought, the higher 
prices rose and the worse things got for those who had not yet 
bought. Our experience at the end of the Sarney administration 
was different from classic hyperinflation. The economy was still 
functioning, more or less. 
  [O GLOBO] Even so, isn't the approval of the fiscal 
adjustment a race against time? 
  [Persio Arida] No question. The sooner it passes, the 
better. 
  [O GLOBO] If it is passed, will this country get the URV the 
following month? 
  [Persio Arida] The URV is a complex mechanism--the details 
are still being discussed within the administration. The basic 
concept was developed within a principle of flexibility. The 
stabilization process is like a game of chess. In that sense, no 
matter how well a good player can anticipate some of the moves, 
there is always the imponderable. That is why it is important 
that the mechanism be flexible enough to open up a range of 
possibilities. 
  [O GLOBO] Let us anticipate just one move: will the exchange 
rate between the new currency and the dollar be a fixed rate? 
  [Persio Arida] That question of the exchange rate has been 
framed as the biggest doubt about what will happen in the third 
phase. 
  [O GLOBO] In the Cavallo phase of the Brazilian plan? 
  [Persio Arida] You said that; I didn't. Any discussion of 
the 
third phase would be premature at present. I am not trying to 
evade the question, but there is something wrong with the 
Brazilian monetary system today. There needs to be an 
institutional change in this area. In Argentina, they 
established a fixed rule, an automatic rule. In Brazil, changes 
often require changes in laws. 
  [O GLOBO] How will it be possible to privatize 34 companies 
this year, as planned, if only one has been privatized in the 
four months since you took office? 
  [Persio Arida] The privatization process has a long 
gestation 
period. We will not be starting from zero in all 34 companies; 
many have already been appraised. Of course there are problems. 
It is easier to sell off a steel mill than an electric power 
company, which involves a public utility concession. 
  [O GLOBO] Even if it is technically possible, is there the 
political will to privatize 34 companies in the final year of an 
administration? 
  [Persio Arida] Privatization is an integral part of any 
stabilization process. It is a contradiction in terms to pursue 
a stabilization program without making progress in 
privatization. The state still has a regulatory and indicative 
role. The electric utility sector in the United States is 
completely private, but it is also completely regulated. Having 
state ownership is extremely costly. Look at the question from 
the standpoint of the public debt. On the one hand, the Treasury 
has properties; on the other, it has very high debt service 
costs. It reminds one of a man who owns a huge tract of land and 
is paying astronomical carrying charges, but will not sell a 
single piece of his property. 
  [O GLOBO] It would be wonderful if the administration, as a 
whole, believed that, wouldn't it? 
  [Persio Arida] That is a process of maturation. It goes 
slowly. Our culture had always been a culture of the 
paternalistic state. 
  [O GLOBO] Talking about the paternalistic state, what is the 
new role of the BNDES? 
  [Persio Arida] I am convinced that if the state resumes its 
growth at an accelerated pace, the bottlenecks in the 
infrastructure will show up very dramatically. These are 
projects that mature over a long time and are complicated to put 
together. They are projects for which the backing of a 
development bank is very important. The problem is that all 
these projects are under the control of the State. Given the 
State's financial crisis, guaranteeing a return on those 
investments is a very different task, depending on whether they 
are undertaken by the public sector or by the private sector. 
The process is intimately tied to the privatization of those 
same services; otherwise, the money gets lost in the web of 
reciprocal debits of the public sector. 
  [O GLOBO] But the BNDES has lost so much by lending to the 
private sector.... 
  [Persio Arida] We are working very, very hard to recover the 
sums owed us. If you look at the renegotiated credits, you will 
find the bulk of them are in the public sector. The BNDES does 
not make subsidized loans to anyone. Those days are over. 
Subsidies and forgiveness of debts no longer exist here. 
  [O GLOBO] Do you think BNDES employees are too highly paid? 
  [Persio Arida] Concepts of equity have been distorted in 
public administration. There are all kinds of inequalities: 
between branches of government, within the Executive Branch, and 
within the state enterprises. Salaries in the state enterprises 
are not too high in comparison with those in private enterprise, 
but they are ridiculously higher than those in the direct 
government administration. The entire direct administration 
earns very little. We need fewer civil servants, and higher 
salaries. Public officials should be well paid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Nelson Jobim by Luis Costa Pinto, </F>
conducted "last week," place not given; first two paragraphs are 
VEJA introduction] 
  [Text] Deputy Nelson Jobim, of the Rio Grande do Sul PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], is now one of the most 
overworked legislators in Brasilia. Three months ago, Jobim was 
elected rapporteur of the constitutional revision process--the 
corrections that are to be made in the 1988 Constitution. He has 
had not a moment's peace since then. After barely two weeks as 
rapporteur, he had to swap his cellular telephone with a friend 
and install an answering machine in his house. Jobim spends 
hardly any time at home now. He eats, drinks, and sleeps 
constitutional revision. "During the day, I even drink tea and 
coffee while talking about the revision," the deputy joked. The 
task is Herculean. The deadline for submission of amendments has 
now expired; there are a total of 17,000 suggestions. All of 
them will pass through a screening process coordinated by Jobim, 
who will have four deputy rapporteurs to help him with the job. 
  So far, all this work on a subject as important as the 
constitutional revision has been obscured by the Budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee]. Legislators will have 
to work hard from now on, if the revision is to be finished by 
15 March, the date set by Congress for promulgation of the 
revised text. The importance of the subject merits such an 
effort. "The country needs this revision," Jobim said. "The 
bottlenecks that hold back production and the economy are in the 
tax area, and in the concentration of monopolies in the hands of 
the government." At age 47, married, three children, an attorney 
on leave from his partnership in a law firm with offices in 
Brasilia and Rio Grande do Sul, Jobim will have even more work 
to do between now and 15 March. He wants to end government 
monopolies, change the social security system, establish an 
external control over the judiciary, and approve a tax reform 
package that will reduce the number of taxes and increase the 
number of taxpayers. Last week, in the midst of reading the 
proposed amendments, the deputy gave VEJA the following 
interview: 
  [Costa Pinto] Are you sure we are going to get a revision? 
  [Jobim] Yes, we will get a revision. All we need to do to 
make this more obvious to the general public is to agree on a 
minimum agenda listing the topics of the revision. Starting this 
week, I will hold separate conversations with all the party 
leaders to reach such an understanding. I am going to talk to 
parties that oppose the revision, such as the PT [Workers 
Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PC do B [Communist Party 
of Brazil], and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]. We will 
start the debate on the revision by discussing legislative 
immunity, a subject on which those parties cannot fail to 
express an opinion. Once we have given it an initial kick, the 
revision will get moving. 
  [Costa Pinto] What will be on this minimum agenda? 
  [Jobim] The agenda will represent a consensus of my 
conversations with the leaders. I see two blocs of issues. 
One--economic--includes tax reform, changes in the monopoly 
system, and restructuring of the pact between the federal 
government and the states. The other--political--concerns 
modifying the elections system. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will the revision generate a revised and 
expanded, or a revised and abridged, edition of the Constitution? 
  [Jobim] As rapporteur, I want to produce an abridged version 
of the Constitution. We have made a rule: no inventions. There 
is no room for unnecessary novelties, for creating new issues 
and new chapters. To the extent that more issues are placed into 
the Constitution, the powers of Congress are reduced and those 
of the judges, of the Judiciary, expanded. The 
constitutionalization of subject matter leads to the 
jurisdictionalization of politics, i.e., giving the Federal 
Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on everything that is done 
in this country, because everything becomes a constitutional 
matter; this curtails the freedom of the Executive Branch and 
the legislators. 
  [Costa Pinto] How will the Congress find time to debate the 
merits of the 17,000 amendments submitted for the constitutional 
revision? 
  [Jobim] We are not going to discuss the amendments one by 
one, only the topics of the revision and their merits. We have 
received 80 amendments that regulate the president's use of 
"provisional measures." I will not read all of them. We need to 
find out what the majority thinks about the subject and then 
draft consensus amendments inspired by those 80 original 
amendments. You would not believe how much repetition there is 
in those 17,000 amendments. 
  [Costa Pinto] Is the 1988 Constitution that bad? 
  [Jobim] I would divide the 1988 Constitution into two parts. 
The part on individual rights and guarantees, which is very 
good, and the part on the design of the State--which is faulty. 
We must redefine federalism and the system of government, 
because the Constitution is very unsatisfactory on those points. 
We have to do something about the Judiciary, an area where the 
1988 Constituent Assembly made no progress at all. The way money 
is spent in Brazil is wrong, and the CPI's are proof of that. 
When we drafted the present Constitution, we were looking 
backward. Everything that the military had done looked wrong to 
us. That is not reality. 
  [Costa Pinto] It is not for lack of laws that Brazil is in 
crisis. Do we really need this revision, which is, after all, a 
process of enacting new laws? 
  [Jobim] We do. The bottlenecks that hold back production and 
the economy are in the tax area, and in the concentration of 
monopolies in the hands of the government. In 1988, we gave 
special favors to outmoded monopolistic protectionism, something 
very common in mercantile capitalism, and we forgot to protect 
the user, the consumer--in short, the taxpayer. We ended up 
creating an economy of special privilege, a monopolistic economy 
that leans toward statism, that does not protect the ordinary 
Brazilian. This habit of creating laws is a fault we inherited 
from the Portuguese. They thought they could resolve things that 
way, and even today they have one of the world's most 
complicated bureaucracies. But, on the other hand, you cannot 
modernize institutions without enacting laws. Our big mistake 
was to transform laws into speeches, making everything polemic. 
  [Costa Pinto] In an election year, will legislators be 
capable of drafting a Constitution that reduces the size of the 
State, changes the tax system, ends retirement based on length 
of service, and redistributes the obligations between governors 
and mayors? 
  [Jobim] Administrative decentralization is one of the 
strongest trends that is emerging in this revision. It is a way 
of redesigning the State by redoing the federative pact. The CPI 
on PC Farias concluded that the corruption of the Executive 
Branch was possible only because of the concentration of powers 
in the hands of the president of the Republic and the ministers. 
States and cities, which won more revenues starting in 1988, 
must now assume new obligations, and the federal bureaucracy 
that is entrenched in Brasilia opposes this, because it would 
curb Brasilia's power. The suppliers are another group that is 
rising up against decentralization. It is easier to corrupt a 
centralized State--you just go to Brasilia--than to travel 
around the country buying special privileges. With 
administrative decentralization, you also dilute the power of 
politicians, who love to propagate problems so they can sell 
solutions. This renovation of the State has to be part of the 
party discourse. One legislator cannot take an unpopular 
position like this because he will get burned, but the parties 
have an obligation to adopt this line. After all, if they expect 
to come to power, they need to be concerned about what they will 
inherit. 
  [Costa Pinto] Why, and by whom, was the agreement made not 
to 
meddle with the so-called "social conquests" of the 1988 
Constitution? 
  [Jobim] I did that. Early last year, I was at a meeting of 
businessmen in Porto Alegre, attended by American economists, 
and everyone jumped all over the rights of workers as stated in 
the Constitution. I told them that if they thought the purpose 
of the revision was to take away worker rights, they were not 
only mistaken, but they would kill all chances of accomplishing 
anything. The revision would become ideologized, and centrist 
parties like the PMDB and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] would be shoved over toward the Left and forced to forge 
alliances with the PT and the communist parties. I made them 
realize that the important thing is to change the economic order 
and the social security system, end the monopolies, and 
modernize the federative pact. After that, the leaders of the 
PMDB and PSDB agreed to take a firm stand against changes in the 
social conquests. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] did not take a 
position, making it clear that it would go along with that 
agreement. 
  [Costa Pinto] Two polls, one by Diap and another by 
MultiConsultoria, found that more than 70 percent of the 
legislators want to change the electoral system by instituting 
mixed district voting. What kind of election system is Brazil 
likely to have after the revision? 
  [Jobim] The trend I have observed in the amendments 
submitted 
is toward the mixed district vote. Our election system has 
outlived its usefulness. It dates from 1932, which was the 
Getulio Vargas era, when Minas and Sao Paulo were taking turns 
electing the presidents, when there were no political parties. 
After this revision, we will probably have election of regional 
deputies and national deputies. The current election system is 
brutal: it induces the country not to think. No one gets elected 
on national issues. 
  [Costa Pinto] Might the revision vote on only the most 
pressing topics now and leave the rest to 1995? 
  [Jobim] No. There will be only one revision. The revision 
proposed by the 1988 Constituent Assembly has to begin and end 
without intermissions. And how could we carry out a revision in 
1995, with a new Congress and a new president? If new the 
president has a majority, he would conduct a revision in his 
image and likeness. If he is weak, he would become a hostage to 
Congress. 
  [Jobim] From what you have already read of the amendments in 
the tax area, what model of tax collection and how many taxes 
are likely to survive in the revised Constitution? 
  [Costa Pinto] There are eight kinds of complete proposals 
for 
tax reform. Six of them retain the classic concept of taxation 
on income, consumption, and property. What almost all of them 
have in common is elimination of points of over-taxation, such 
as a reduction in the burden on payrolls, in exchange for a new 
withholding tax rate of 5 percent that would catch all wages and 
salaries. There are also two more radical proposals, such as the 
one by Flavio Rocha, which would leave Brazil with only three 
taxes: the IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], the 
tax on foreign trade, and a tax on beverages and games of 
chance. Then there is a proposal by Deputy Luis Roberto Ponte 
that would leave us with eight taxes. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will Brazil have fewer state enterprises and 
be 
free of the monopolies after 1994? 
  [Jobim] The state enterprises are the thorn in the side of 
this revision, and this country. The State is no longer an agent 
of production as it was in the 1950's and 1960's. State 
enterprises are not a subject of the constitutional 
revision--monopolies are. Today we have three big state 
monopolies: petroleum, telecommunications, and nuclear energy. 
No amendments suggest changes in the nuclear field. As for 
petroleum, some amendments that would completely abolish the 
monopoly, leaving Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] 
with nothing to do. Others seek a middle ground--maintaining the 
monopoly on exploration and drilling for petroleum in the hands 
of Petrobras and privatizing the refining and distribution. Then 
there are amendments that would allow private enterprise to 
enter all phases, by government concession. The problems in 
telecommunications are exactly the same, and the proposals are 
similar. Now from what I have already seen and discussed in the 
Congress, I can say with certainty that the monopolies will not 
stay the way they are. How they will change, I cannot yet say. 
We need to get a feeling as to what kind of State the majority 
of congressmen want. An interventionist State? A regulatory 
State? A do-nothing State? This issue will split the body 
between neoliberals, advocates of greater flexibility, and 
statists. 
  [Costa Pinto] Hasn't the attention paid to the Budget CPI 
cooled off the debates on the constitutional revision? 
  [Jobim] Actually, it was a good thing that the spotlights 
were turned toward the CPI. Without unproductive debates on 
bureaucracy, the revision was able to get a head start on its 
deadlines and only now, when ideology and the different parties' 
plans for Brazil are coming to the fore, will we go back to 
discussing ideas. That is why the CPI did not hurt us, it 
helped. Now that the CPI's deadline has been extended to the 
24th, voting on the revision could start on the 26th. 
  [Costa Pinto] But the revision has to end on 15 March. And 
Carnival falls in the middle of that period. Isn't that too 
little time for the public to participate in the revision? 
  [Jobim] The timetable is certainly tight, but the public 
should and will participate in the debate. But I must remind you 
that this is not a Constituent Assembly, and nothing is going to 
be invented. We are only going to rewrite and delete. Tax 
reform, which is perhaps the most controversial topic and the 
one that most directly affects the average citizen, has been 
under discussion for two years now. The rest are well-known 
topics--they may be controversial because they are ideological, 
but I do not see the general public mobilizing against the 
revision. The vested interests are against it, yes. But it seems 
to me that they are also against citizens and taxpayers. 
  [Costa Pinto] How can a good Constitution prevent, or at 
least make it more difficult for thieves to get into the 
political machinery and how can it prevent reruns of CPI's like 
the ones on PC Farias and the budget? 
  [Jobim] We can close the loopholes in the Constitution that 
are open to corruption. We do not need to stiffen the penalties 
against corrupt individuals, what we need to do is prevent 
corruption by reducing the size of the State. If Brasilia's 
power over the aspirations of Brazil is diminished and the 
oversight mechanisms are strengthened, we will have made a fine 
contribution to this country. Increasing the repressive 
machinery does not reduce corruption; on the contrary, it raises 
the stakes in the battle of good versus evil, and makes the 
corrupt more creative. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will the revision tend to improve the 
relationship between the executive, judicial, and legislative 
branches, or will the three parties continue to clash with each 
other? 
  [Jobim] The American Constitution created three branches of 
government so that they could share the power. Now--and this is 
not merely a Brazilian phenomenon--we have separate institutions 
that fight among themselves for the power to be a branch of 
government. The Executive Branch wants to be the Legislative 
Branch and get rid of the Judiciary. The Legislative loves to 
play at being the Executive, and the Judiciary likes to be all 
three together. In a democratic state, power exists only if 
those who hold it are responsible to the nation. There is a 
social duty to be accountable to the ordinary people, but none 
of the three branches permit administrative oversight and they 
do not have independent sources of revenue. When people talk 
about external control over the Judiciary, they are talking 
about the rendering of an administrative and financial 
accounting. On that point I will not yield. There is no 
justification for a superior court judge--in Brasilia for 
example--to take two years to write up the opinion on a decision 
on which the full court has voted. The decision is not valid 
until the opinion has been issued, so why is that judge holding 
back those opinions? I don't know. But that situation exists, 
and it is going on right now. 
  [Costa Pinto] And the PMDB? Don't you feel uncomfortable 
belonging to a party that is the target of so many charges of 
corruption, one that has no platform? 
  [Jobim] We must not confuse personal relationships with 
political ones. The problem with the PMDB is that we have no 
party line. We have nothing to say to the country. We have no 
platform and no model for Brazil. Having a platform is crucial 
to party unity. If it does not exist, then unity moves into the 
personal field. In 1994, we peemedebistaswill take 
refuge in our regional realities and will, in the last analysis, 
be absent from the national political debate. We in Rio Grande 
do Sul decided not to leave the party because southerners have a 
hard time understanding such changes. We decided to stay and 
fight to purge the party of the bad apples and give the party a 
purpose. 
  [Costa Pinto] If Quercia or Sarney get control of the PMDB 
machine and become viable presidential candidacies, would you 
vote for them? 
  [Jobim] There is no possibility of my voting for either of 
them. I would even work against them, and would urge the PMDB in 
Rio Grande do Sul to rebel against them. 
  [Costa Pinto] Does the fact that the government has had no 
leader in the Chamber for three weeks now, and has not submitted 
proposals for the revision help, or hinder? 
  [Jobim] The administration's absence from the revision is 
unfortunate. The logic of the presidential system of government 
depends heavily on the president of the Republic. He sets the 
tone for the opposition. We lack an opposition simply because 
there is a feeling that we also lack a government. Itamar has 
forgotten that he sits in a chair where one is supposed to think 
about the country. 
  [Costa Pinto] And Itamar--does he help, or hinder? 
  [Jobim] He neither helps nor hinders, and that's the worst 
of 
it. He is neglecting his duties. His administration lacks 
substance. It's spongy. One minister pulls the government to 
one side, wanting to enact a tax reform and balance the books, 
but another minister wants to rehire 100,000 civil servants. 
Itamar is the head of a government that lacks direction. Note 
that I am not questioning the president's intentions--only the 
way he is doing his job.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Feb (NA) -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Fernando Petrella today downplayed the importance of a U.S. 
State Department report on the human rights situation in 
Argentina because it "includes an assessment that is formulated 
through the system" but "it is not a criticism of the system." 
  Petrella was referring to the document the U.S. Government 
submits to Congress with a detailed report on each country, and 
he believes that it "must be taken into account," although he 
made it clear that "no institutional aspect has been criticized" 
because "our country has made notable progress that is 
noticeable in the management of the OAS' Human Rights 
Commission." 
  In the chapter that refers to Argentina, the document 
published today by a newspaper alludes to police executions, 
torture, and disappearances, and it puts in doubt the 
independent functioning of the judicial branch. 
  Petrella added that "there are several categories within the 
mechanism of human rights," and he stressed: "Argentina is in a 
good position." 
  Regarding the chapter that indicates that the Executive 
Branch puts pressure on the Judicial Branch, the vice minister 
explained that the report "takes up the opinion of the media," 
and he emphasized that "this type of opinion did not find an 
echo within the Inter-American Human Rights Commission." 
  He also admitted that "without having fully read the 
report," 
in Argentina "there are aspects that can be improved," although 
he highlighted the fact that "if the U.S. Congress has to decide 
on something related to our country, it will not necessarily 
take the report into account." 
  "Regarding human rights, the fact is that since 1983, 
Argentina's record has been a good one because our country is 
not even mentioned in the Inter-American Human Rights Commission 
report," the vice minister said.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- The group of separatist General 
Labour Confederation [CGT] unions spearheaded by the 
secretary-general of the powerful UGTT transport workers 
confederation Juan Manuel Palacios and by former CGT head Saul 
Ubaldini yesterday launched the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA) 
umbrella group that pledged to oppose President Carlos Menem's 
economic policy. 
  "Only the workers will save the workers," the MTA said in 
its 
nine-point founding document presented during an assembly staged 
in the Eva Peron auditorium at the Federal Capital headquarters 
of the UTA [Motor Transport Workers Union] transport workers. 
  The organizers said that the assembly was attended by 
representatives of 80 dissident unions -- including the large 
food workers union -- that decided to quit the CGT last week 
after the umbrella group's leadership announced it was lifting a 
general strike called for January. 
  The MTA is flatly rejecting the government's labour reform 
bill and is demanding the collective labour bargains "to be put 
into total effect." 
  The rebel unions announced that they will participate in the 
100th weekly pensioners demonstration scheduled to take place on 
March 2 and that it will launch a nationwide plan which could 
lead to a general strike. 
  This is the second major split in the CGT in the last two 
years. The ATE [Association of State Workers] state workers 
union, the CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of the 
Argentine Republic] teachers union and others walked out of the 
organization in 1992 to launch the staunch antigovernment 
Congress of Argentine Workers umbrella group. The CGT is 
currently led by a five-man general secretariat. One of those 
secretaries, Raul Amin called on the MTA "to stop messing about 
so we can launch a joint action, because there is a campaign to 
kill the labour movement." Amin defined the MTA as "an internal 
line that is not leaving the CGT." 
  Palacios said yesterday that his faction had decided to name 
itself "only to be identified because we are not prepared to 
give up the glorious initials of the CGT." He stressed that the 
division in the CGT was not final and called on those present at 
the assembly not to criticize the current leadership. But he 
added that the MTA "will occupy the place to fight left vacant 
by the CGT." [passage omitted]

  [Text] If the government does not adopt fiscal measures, 
this year's deficit will total 1 percent of the GDP (some $140 
million). As a result, the economic team is "reviewing the 
figures" so that the deficit does not surpass 0.5 percent of the 
GDP, Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas said. 
  In an interview granted to radio station CX 24 Nuevotiempo, 
the minister confirmed in broad outline the economic measures 
contemplated for 1994. He made a positive balance of the 
government's economic policy and, analyzing his recent 
interpellation by Congress on the national industrial situation, 
he again criticized Congress for what he called its rejection of 
the implementation of structural reforms. 
  The minister justified the hard tone he used to reproach 
opposition congressmen over their "double discourse." 
  He said that the promoters of the interpellation had 
"political intentions," particularly Senator Hugo Batalla, and 
added that they had thus been trying to "recover a lost role as 
protagonists." 
  De Posadas held the Broad Front, the New Sector coalition, 
Crusade 94, and the Batalleist Forum responsible for increasing 
the expenses approved by Congress during the debates for the 
approval of the last national budget. 
  The minister emphasized the "contradictory position" adopted 
by these parties and said that, while proposing a constitutional 
reform to allow a more smooth administration, they "prevent the 
administration from governing the country, and paralyze the 
Executive Branch." 
  After pointing out that despite the unfavorable 
international 
situation the national employment and salary indexes are 
acceptable, the minister criticized the opposition's "refusal to 
accept the government achievements, and their drastic attitude 
in calling for an interpellation." The minister said this 
attitude is motivated by political reasons. 
  Regarding the industrial area's situation, the minister 
admitted that several industries are facing hard times, and said 
that these difficulties are "normal in a process of 
transformation." 
  He denied the need to protect the industries, and pointed 
out 
that Uruguay has the largest list of exceptions in the Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] customs fees reduction process, as 
well as several mechanisms -- such as the minimum export prices, 
reference prices, and a board to evaluate imported products -- 
to protect its industry. He said there are some 50 such 
measures. 
  "No administration can guarantee economic welfare; this does 
not exist. It is senseless and entirely absurd, in addition to 
harmful, to ask the government to say which economic sector will 
survive and which will not," he said. 
  He deemed the Chamber of Industries document analyzing the 
situation of the industrial sector "slightly inconsistent." He 
said the Chamber "criticizes the idea of reducing customs fees, 
and says that this has not been reflected in the economy or 
forced prices down, because the middlemen keep the difference. 
If this were true, however, the industries would still have no 
reason for concern, because any other effective protection is 
similar to what we had previously." 
  He also refuted the assertion that the government is not 
stimulating the productive sector. As an example, he said that 
the tax exemption granted to the companies deemed of national 
interest represents a $50 million to $60 million drop in 
government revenue.

  [Text] The nation's oil workers will join the strike staged 
by the United Workers Front [FUT] to demand that the government 
revoke its decision and not implement the gasoline price hike, 
said Pedro Chiriguaya, leader of the Petrocomercial workers. 
Here is what Pedro Chiriguaya said: 
  [Begin recording] [Chiriguaya] The government is mistaken, 
totally mistaken. We have already said they are mistaken; there 
is no reason to raise gasoline prices. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] go on strike 
tomorrow [words indistinct] into a nationwide strike? 
  [Chiriguaya] We are just now on our way to the meeting 
called 
by the Federation of Oil Workers and the [words indistinct] in 
Pichincha. A decision will be made on Thursday. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Chiriguaya] We must obey our union headquarter's decisions. 
We believe the strike will be total. 
  [Reporter] [Passage indistinct] 
  [Chiriguaya] In any case, the one to correct the mistake 
would be the finance minister, as he is the one who raised fuel 
prices. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Fidel Garcia, president of the federation of 
public employees in Pichincha, announced they will join the 
strike called by FUT as they consider that the gasoline price 
hike adversely affects all national sectors, particularly the 
most needy. Garcia explained that although they are prohibited 
from participating in the strike, they will go ahead anyway as 
the government must understand that its duty is to work for 
Ecuadoreans, not against them. 
  In addition, Luis Macas, Conaie [Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador] president, said Thursday's strike will 
be characteristic of a struggle and that demonstrations will 
continue in the coming days until the government revokes its 
decision. Macas said that an Indian uprising might occur on 8 
or 9 February. Here is what Luis Macas said: 
  [Begin recording] [Macas, in progress] ...of the union 
workers movement, the Indian-peasant movement, that is all the 
Ecuadoran people. A day of struggle by the students has been 
called for today. In the same fashion, tomorrow the whole 
Ecuadoran population is summoned, all of us who are adversely 
affected -- that is, from the middle class on down. That 
measure is nothing more than a statement by the ruling class, by 
this nation's oligarchy, against all Ecuadoreans. We call on 
the people to join this struggle; this is a popular struggle. 
This summons is coordinated precisely through this nation's 
Indian-peasant, workers, and peoples organizations. [end 
recording] 
  Along these same lines, student leader (?Elwis Moreira) has 
said the Student Federation will actively participate in the 
strike called for tomorrow by Ecuadoran workers. He termed 
successful the current student demonstrations. 
  Meanwhile, in Guayaquil, at the National Teachers Union of 
Guayas, Alonso Lopez, president of Teachers' Democratic Front, 
was asked about what actions are planned for tomorrow. Here is 
Alfonso Lopez: 
  [Begin recording] [Lopez] Specifically, the Teachers Union 
has called on all education sectors: supervisors, directors, and 
students in general, to join [words indistinct] tomorrow the 
24-hour protest. They should attend peacefully. But if there 
is repression, if the repressive forces prevent the 
demonstration's normal development, we the teachers, together 
with the organized sectors, are willing to carry the 
demonstration through to its ultimate consequences. We call on 
all organized sectors to gather tomorrow morning at 0900 at the 
Centenario Plaza [words indistinct] in the afternoon at 1600. 
[passage indistinct] In addition, certain important sectors of 
the roads in the Guayas Province will be blocked on Friday, as 
on this day we will not stage a protest. The following day, on 
Friday we will continue our activities at the National Teachers 
Union of Guayas [break in reception] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hugo Penafiel, Pichincha Province </F>
transportation groups' leader, in Pichincha, by Patricio Ramos 
in Quito -- live] 
  [Text] [Ramos] We have Hugo Penafiel, transportation group 
leader in Pichincha Province, on the phone. Mr. Penafiel, I 
understand the National Committee of Transportation Workers met 
today at 1400. Have transportation workers reached an agreement 
with the national government regarding the subsidy that was 
being negotiated during the past days? Welcome to Radio Quito. 
  [Penafiel] Many thanks to Radio Quito once again. Actually, 
we were waiting for National Executive Committee members to 
arrive in order to hold a meeting to discuss mainly if we were 
going to accept and support the measure [words indistinct] for 
tomorrow. We were planning to meet here in my home, but since 
I am still ill, fellow delegates decided to meet at federation 
installations. My colleagues have resolved to resume regular 
activities tomorrow so long as the guarantees are still standing. 
  Now [word indistinct] they will take care of putting the 
vehicles away in the garage of [word indistinct] to prevent any 
possible attacks against us. So far we only have 37 vehicles 
operating in the city of Quito. 
  Regarding the subsidy, 1 million sucres have been accepted 
for vehicles that use gasoline engines and 700,000 sucres for 
those that use diesel engines. 
  In view of this, we have confirmed that the government's 
offer is not fair or complete. Fellow delegates have been 
willing to sacrifice for Ecuadoreans' peace of mind. I believe 
the government's offer is not fair because the highest fares 
remain unchanged, and transportation workers will have to be 
compensated by the transportation sector. 
  [Ramos] Many thanks, Mr. Penafiel, for your participation. 
We reiterate the announcement that transportation workers will 
resume their regular operations tomorrow.

  [Text] After the announcement of an increase in fuel 
prices, strong demonstrations took place around the country, 
especially in southern Quito, where clashes with students and 
workers in some enterprises were continuous. 
  Also, in the north, groups of Indians entered the towns of 
Cayambe, Otavalo, Ibarra, San Gabriel, Huacas, and Cristobal 
Colon and blocked the Pan-American Highway, thus preventing the 
movement of vehicles. 
  As a result of the demonstrations in Quito, approximately 50 
people are under arrest and, at the orders of the police 
commissioner who according to the law must punish them for 
breaking the law, will be fined between 60 and 120 sucres and 
serve four days in jail. 
  Approximately six aerial incursions took place between 1 and 
2 February over Quito, especially over places where students 
were protesting. The aircraft dropped tear gas bombs to 
disperse the demonstrations.

  [Text] Government Minister Marcelo Santos has made a call 
for understanding, good sense, and prudence to ensure there will 
be no regrettable incidents during the labor strike. The 
minister did not rule out the possible of militarizing the 
country for the duration of the strike should the situation 
warrant. 
  [Begin Santos recording] I want to urge Ecuadorans to 
reflect 
on the situation. I want them to understand that the president 
[words indistinct] adopt measures that could weaken -- in one 
way or another and to a greater or lesser extent -- citizens' 
purchasing power without regard to established levels and also 
being aware of the political impact that this could have on him 
and his government, is adopting the necessary steps to effect 
authentic economic recovery in Ecuador. [end recording] 
  Congress President Samuel Belletini described as sadistic 
the 
economic measures implemented by the regime that will supposedly 
cover the fiscal deficit. He added that demonstrations and 
protests are just, in view of the harshness of the economic 
package, because once more the government is attacking the 
living conditions of Ecuadorans. The people cannot bear this 
situation any longer because they are confronting serious 
problems to secure basic staples, he said. 
  [Begin Belletini recording] What can I say to the poor of 
Ecuador, to laborers, employees, and workers? I can only tell 
them to be courageous and to struggle, to struggle for their 
lives and for dignity, and to struggle for the future of their 
children. Messrs. Reporters, also ask me what I have to say to 
the president. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, please, the 
people cannot endure more taxes. The anguish, fear, and pain 
that the poor are suffering grows worse by the day. Rectify 
this tariff that is really a disguised tax through an increase 
in gasoline prices. Listen to the Congress' opinions. Join the 
Congress by supporting this law that injects life into the 
productive apparatus. [end recording] 
  Labor Minister Alfredo Corral termed as understandable the 
workers' strike [words indistinct] that the economic measures 
are harsh. He urged workers to conduct protests in a peaceful 
and calm manner. [Begin Corral recording] We understand that 
the harsh measures that the government had to implement caused a 
popular reaction. The dialogue, however, is still completely 
open to deal with this and any other problems. We think [words 
indistinct] decrease in funds caused by a drop in oil prices, 
the paralysis of activities in the country. Quite to the 
contrary, the country must produce more [word indistinct] with 
the efforts and work of all Ecuadorans, and it will never [words 
indistinct] solution to problems. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 1 Feb (EFE) -- In a joint declaration, 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Paraguayan President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy expressed here their decision to give "a 
renewed, vigorous" boost to their countries' bilateral ties. 
  The declaration reiterates the traditional friendship 
existing between Paraguay and Peru and outlines their decision 
to strengthen cooperation and their political, economic, and 
cultural ties. 
  The two presidents signed the document at the Golden Hall of 
Government Palace in Lima in the evening of 31 January, on the 
first day of Wasmosy's two-day official visit to Peru. This is 
the first visit by a Paraguayan head of state to Peru. 
  The declaration firmly condemns terrorism, which it 
characterizes as a systematic and deliberate form of violating 
human rights that poses a threat to the stability of the 
democratic system. 
  The two presidents state that they are committed to 
implementing a policy that will improve the standard of living 
of their people, especially those in low-income groups. 
  In their declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy reaffirm that 
socioeconomic development must go hand in hand with the 
preservation and rational use of natural resources through a 
mechanism designed to protect and preserve the environment. 
They also express their support for efforts to consolidate 
integration processes in the region. 
  They also state that it is their common objective to 
gradually build "a great zonal and continental market" in which 
the Paraguayan and Peruvian economies would interact 
"dynamically and in a balanced fashion." 
  They also vow to promote negotiations with a view to 
building 
a highway that would link Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, 
with the Peruvian cities of Ilo and Matarani. 
  The two presidents convey their "deep concern" over the 
steady rise in the drug trade and the unlawful consumption of 
narcotics. 
  Prior to signing the joint declaration, Fujimori and Wasmosy 
signed agreements designed to fight the drug trade and the 
unlawful consumption of narcotics, to promote and give mutual 
protection to investments, and to promote cooperation between 
the diplomatic academies of the two countries. They also signed 
a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation between 
the two foreign ministries. 
  During day one of his visit, Wasmosy was received in the 
Peruvian Congress and declared an "illustrious guest" by the 
Lima city government. 
  Today, 1 February, Wasmosy will visit an exposition of 
Paraguayan handicraft and, accompanied by his Peruvian 
counterpart, will dedicate a school bearing the name of "Colonel 
Jose Felix Bogado," a Paraguayan citizen who took part in the 
expedition to liberate Peru led by General Jose de San Martin. 
  Wasmosy will first decorate Fujimori with the Francisco 
Solano Lopez National Order of Merit and then will host a 
reception in his honor.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Playing with Fire;" bolded passages as </F>
published] 
  [Text] The secret Shining Path [SL] document which LA 
REPUBLICA published on 25 January answers several questions 
concerning the negotiations between Fujimori's administration 
and the SL leadership in prison, and gives rise to other 
questions. 
  This is why we chose to make it public as soon as we were 
able to fully authenticate it through the anonymous sources that 
conveyed it to us and the experts whom we consulted. Everyone 
agreed it was either a document written by the SL leader himself 
or a transcript of Abimael Guzman's [AG] report to the 
leadership meeting of this subversive group at the Callao Naval 
Base [the prison where they are being held]. 
  In any case it was clearly our duty to make the document 
public, given the mantle of silence that the government has cast 
over negotiations in which the future of all Peruvians is at 
stake and about which nothing is reported probably in keeping 
with Fujimori's "do first, announce later" approach which has 
greatly harmed our democracy in the past few years. 
  First, the document makes it clear that as far as AG is 
concerned the required peace agreement does not imply a 
demobilization and a surrendering of arms. AG sees the signing 
of the peace agreement as a kind of armed truce, a 
halt along a road which may last 10 or 15 years, after which -- 
"having strengthened its links with the masses" -- the SL would 
resume its bloodbath. 
  Therefore, the agreement in question has nothing to do with 
the quest for peace in Peru the way most Peruvians see it. 
There is a reason for this: The fundamentalist leader -- and 
probably the other SL leaders that follow him -- believe that 
this armed gang has not been defeated either 
militarily or ideologically. 
  This means the defeats the group has been experiencing since 
1988 are mere setbacks in a long-term struggle. These setbacks 
are serious and have led the SL to lose some ground -- as AG 
himself admits by stating that the conditions essential for the 
"victory of the popular struggle" are no longer present -- but 
this cannot be looked upon as a defeat. 
  Let us make it clear that AG scornfully relegates the change 
in what marxists call "favorable objective international 
conditions" to the sixth place ("it is a necessary element but 
not the main one," he adds), rating it well below the problems 
created for the SL following the arrest of its top deity and 
most of its leadership. In sum, displaying very little modesty, 
the lack of a "proletarian leadership" which "will take some 
time to resolve" (which tells us, by the way, that AG does not 
consider his life sentence as definitive) is blamed for the 
setback. 
  At the same time, AG's disdain for the performance of SL's 
"hard" faction led by Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, top SL 
leader in Ayacucho] clearly indicate a split in the terrorist 
group and a lack of communication between the two factions. We 
unable to do so, but it should be established whether this lack 
of communication is circumstantial (some SL leaders are in 
prison while others are free) or deliberate. In the latter case 
we would be dealing with a splinter faction led by Feliciano 
which has decided to pay no heed to Guzman's directives. 
  But AG views "Feliciano's faction" as 
recoverable, as can be deduced from one of AG's 
political conclusions which states that the "struggle between 
two factions" should seek unity, adding that "one must work to 
keep the scattering of forces to the bare minimum." The 
document adds, however, that "we should be prepared for the 
possibility that only a few of us will be left," and "those will 
be the most tested ones." Once again, it is implied that defeat 
is out of the question and that AG will play an active 
role and exercising leadership from inside prison 
(undoubtedly the government has created circumstances to make 
this possible). 
  Finally, it should be noted that AG suggests "changing our 
language," adding that diplomatic talks are underway 
between the SL and the Armed Forces through the 
government. Aside from his strong disdain for Fujimori's 
administration (which he treats as a mere go-between), AG 
continues to hang on to his long-standing obsession that it all 
comes down to a clash between two military forces, disregarding 
everything about the civilian institutional order that gets 
caught in the middle. Paradoxically enough, this disregard for 
the institutions is what the SL has in common with Fujimori's 
administration. 
  This is an initial evaluation of the document, which 
undoubtedly lends itself to further analysis. The important 
point right now is to unveil the dangerous tactics of Fujimori's 
administration implemented through the publication of AG's 
letters and their obvious manipulation for electoral reasons 
during the campaign for the referendum. 
  Various circles share the opinion that Fujimori's 
administration is trying to bring about a peace agreement with 
the SL without realizing that it is playing into the hands of 
SL's top leader, who has been put back into circulation in a 
very obvious effort to prove that he is still at the helm of the 
subversive gang. 
  In other words, President Fujimori is laboring under the 
pressure of his own promise that the SL will be defeated by 1995 
and is beginning to feel that he is running out of time in his 
quest for this trump card which can get him reelected. AG knows 
this very well and he is trying to take the best possible 
advantage of the president's haste. 
  The risks that this situation poses are obvious: A peace 
agreement is already being discussed although armed actions have 
not been suspended and nobody is talking about laying down arms, 
thus a truce that will last a few years is being misrepresented 
as real peace. 
  Furthermore, all the latest documents of the SL address the 
need to "lay the foundation for the second congress" of the 
subversive gang. This obviously implies that the SL will 
continue to operate even if it has to do so under the until now 
abhorred guise of a political party. Should this be the case 
the "strengthening of the links with the masses" will simply 
mean preparing them for the future uprising. 
  We believe the time has come for Fujimori's administration 
to 
explain to the country the status of its negotiations with the 
SL leadership. It is obvious that it is not necessary to 
disclose the details of these negotiations. The citizenry, 
however, must understand the goals of these talks because this 
SL document leaves the impression that -- perhaps involuntarily 
-- the government is helping the man who has caused more deaths, 
sorrow and destruction than anyone else in Peru, to achieve his 
sinister objectives.

<H6>  Declaration for a Democratic and Sovereign Peru With Peace 
Based on Social Justice </H6>
  Those of us who sign this declaration have begun talks 
seeking to generate a current of action and thought that will 
permit us to converge for the creation of a broadly based 
Promotion Committee in order to unite the left and people's 
movement. This committee will be integrated with representatives 
of political parties and movements; regional leaders; labor, 
neighborhood, and youth leaders; and progressive leaders. They 
will combine the efforts of Peruvian social and political 
movements to propose political initiatives and actions for a 
democratic alternative to the country. They also will represent 
citizens' aspirations for peace with social justice in order to 
fight the neoliberal project and Alberto Fujimori's 
authoritarian government's attempt to stay in power. 
  This is a starting point for a dialogue and a new attitude 
for the democratic and socialist left. From this platform we 
want to promote the broadest programmatic debate possible in 
light of the latest changes in Peru and the world and in order 
to generate a new practice with people's and social forces. It 
also is the beginning of an intense collective reflection on our 
role in Peruvian national life in the past decades, a reflection 
with deep self-criticism on past mistakes and the commitment to 
overcome them in order to assume the responsibilities the people 
and Peru demand of us. 
  We wish to call on all those who individually or 
collectively 
-- and from a socialist, democratic, and deeply Peruvian 
perspective -- might want to join our efforts and commit 
themselves to fight for a modern and efficient economy 
implemented with solidarity; for the full implementation of 
social and political rights; for the country's moralization; and 
for respect for human rights. Those who join us will be involved 
in the construction of a National Project for Development, 
Modernization, Decentralization, with Sovereignty and Peace, and 
Based on Social Justice in order to make our country really 
viable. 
  To this effect, we will promote numerous regional and local 
events nationwide to discuss in an ample and democratic manner 
your opinions regarding the unity of the left and the people's 
movement within the national political context and the 
responsibilities of the current national situation. These 
discussions will be conducted with the participation of 
political parties and movement leaders, different personalities, 
intellectuals, social and regional leaders; members of this vast 
progressive and people's sector. These opinions will be studied 
in a session at the national level. We propose to hold it as 
soon as possible so we will be allowed to establish the proposed 
Promotion Committee and thus undertake a joint Action and 
Working Plan. 
  In line with this effort to achieve the unity of the left, 
we

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 19 January on 
pages 14 and 15 carries a 900-word article by Liz Mineo on the 
serious crisis affecting San Martin Department due to the 
reduction of drug-trafficking activities in Huallaga in the last 
few months. 
  Peasants are learning a hard lesson because they cannot sell 
drugs due to the shortage of flights and low prices; therefore, 
they have discovered that "coca is no longer the remedy for all 
their ills." A peasant in the Tres Unidos settlement, 250 km 
from Tarapoto, said: "When I was growing corn or yucca I could 
eat them if I did not sell them. But if I don't sell coca I 
cannot eat it." 
  The great majority of peasants in Huallaga abandoned 
agricultural production to grow coca and make cocaine base, 
which was more profitable and easier to sell. During the 1991-92 
agricultural season in San Martin Department, peasants planted 
16,524 hectares of corn, which was about half the area planted 
the year before. 
  Coffee production was affected most, dropping from 3,149 
hectares in the 1990-91 harvest to 143 hectares the year after. 
The same thing happened with beans, dropping from 3,945 hectares 
in 1990-91 to 1,388 hectares the next season. Even banana 
production dropped considerably. A Juanjui peasant said: "In 
the jungle we were eating bananas grown in the coastal region. 
We were all going crazy growing coca." 
  Although coca fever has not ended, police were able to 
reduce 
drug trafficking activities in Huallaga, thus reducing drug 
prices considerably. Tingo de Ponaza Mayor Enrique Reategui 
said: "Peasants now are more willing to grow other products 
because coca growing has become risky and not very profitable." 
  During the 1992-93 agricultural season, peasants planted 
34,443 hectares of rice; two years ago it was only 22,723 
hectares. During the same season, peasants planted 18,753 
hectares of corn, which was 13.5 percent higher than the year 
before. Cotton production also increased considerably, going 
from only 53 hectares in 1991-92 to 1,173 hectares. One Taraporo 
peasant said: "We will continue growing coca but we are back 
growing corn, bananas, and yucca to have something to eat when 
we are not able to sell coca." 
  Some people believe the increased rice and corn cultivation 
is a demonstration of agricultural reactivation in San Martin. 
One of the most optimistic is Gonzalo Villavicencio, president 
of the San Martin Regional Government, who said: "Agriculture 
is in full reactivation because there is greater support by the 
government and a trend by peasants to get on the legal path." 
  Many peasants have abandoned coca growing, but many more are 
willing to begin poppy growing because it is more profitable 
than traditional crops, the article concludes.

  [Text] A high-ranking officer at the Santa Lucia police 
base has reported that a group of peasant patrols located in 
Peru's coca-producing regions is offering protection to drug 
traffickers operating in these areas, in exchange for large sums 
of money. 
  The police officer, who asked not to be identified, added 
that in view of this it is very likely that the peasant patrol 
members will refuse to hand over the guns that were supplied to 
them by the government to protect their towns against terrorists. 
  He said that the Peasant Patrols have cooperated actively in 
the pacification of the country, and that through their active 
presence Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] lost a great deal of their prevalence. 
  He said that, unfortunately, the strong economic incentive 
offered by drug traffickers for looking after coca farms allows 
the peasant patrols to improve their standards of living, while 
no alternative development programs have been promoted for 
cultivating other products instead of coca. 
  Moreover, intelligence service reports state that there are 
bad armed forces and police officers detached in the area who 
are also offering protection to drug traffickers in exchange for 
money. 
  The staff at the Santa Lucia base, which was built with the 
DEA's support to combat drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga 
region, is already aware of the situation. 
  As an example of these charges, the police officer said that 
the peasant patrols in Pampapalma, in La Mar Province, Ayacucho 
Department, "do not allow the police to enter the area, and 
openly support drug traffickers."

J. Velasquez at the National Congress in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Honorable National Congress President; Honorable 
National Congress Vice President; Honorable Supreme Court of

His Eminence Cardinal Jose Ali Lebrum, archbishop of Caracas; 
Mr. Attorney General of the Republic; Mr. Presidents and

Director General; Presidents of State Autonomous Institutions 
and Corporations; Media Representatives; Special Guests; Ladies 
and Gentlemen: I come here today to address you as part of my 
duties, but at the same time I am here today to express my 
satisfaction. 
  Seven months ago the Constitution imposed a duty on me, 
which 
I swore to honor. That is why I am here today to present a 
state of the nation address as well as a report on the Executive 
Branch's performance during the period that I was responsible 
for directing the nation. This feeling of satisfaction 
overwhelms me. I feel it just as if I were an ordinary citizen. 
In a few days time I will return to being an average citizen 
and the same type of person I tried not to stray away from 
during these past months when I became aware that I would be 
part of the institutional succession mechanism. In saying 
this, in no way am I trying to diminish the position's 
importance or my personal responsibility. However, I seek to 
highlight how Venezuela was able to confront a crisis of 
historical dimensions and was able to defeat it by implementing, 
through an exceptional effort, mechanisms that ensured that 
governmental changes would take place in a peaceful and orderly 
manner, such as in societies with a more mature democracies. 
  My administration developed as a result of that effort and 
from that endorsement. In addition, normal democratic elections 
were possible as a result of that effort. Also as a result of 
that same effort and endorsement, my government was able to 
fully carry out the duties imposed by the nation. In a few 
days it will be my honor to place the presidential sash across 
the chest of Dr. Rafael Caldera, an illustrious Venezuelan, an 
expert in guiding the Republic, and a man unquestionably 
anointed by the people's vote. His experience and his popular 
anointment make me feel at peace in handing over the mandate. 
The Republic was not lost by my hands, and I pass over the 
command certain that Dr. Rafael Caldera will say the same when 
his mandate concludes. 
  The origin of my mandate, which differs from those of 
presidents who succeeded one another since 1959, gives this 
ceremony a nature that goes beyond simple institutional routine. 
Amid dramatic circumstances and dangerous general confusion, 
the Legislative Branch chose one of its own -- me -- to honor 
and gave him the historic responsibility of taking over the 
Executive Branch for the remainder of the constitutional period 
that started in February 1989. 
  Today I have come before the congressmen elected for the 
1994-99 five-year period, and this appearance symbolizes the 
ability of Venezuelan democracy to face a crisis and to build 
its future. 
  This is why I will not just thank those who as 
representatives of the nation and functioning in the midst of 
the most serious institutional conflict our democracy has every 
faced, placed their trust in a man who had never requested or 
sought to occupy -- under very special circumstances -- the 
presidency. 
  This is a thing of the past. It could be seen as a personal 
expression of gratitude. I have to add, because this deals with 
the future, that I am certain, and I hope the country is too, 
that with the installation of the new parliament and the 
forthcoming presidential inauguration we will be taking a giant 
step toward the consolidation of Venezuela's institutions. 
  This is not a more or less official expression of optimism 
or 
a rhetorical statement. I know that in very important sectors 
of the nation there still exist the huge crisis factors that 
produced my brief government period. My government came to 
power under circumstances that obstructed its work from the very 
beginning. The start of an administration would have to be 
difficult if it did not have the two keystones that give 
strength to governments in democratic countries: the 
indisputable strength of an election victory and the backing 
that party support provides for daily influence of public 
opinion. Not only this, my administration emerged in a context 
capable of making not only the government, but also the state, 
appear weak. 
  Other factors were to appear during this brief and unique 
presidential period. These factors were against the traditional 
appearance of presidential authority. On the one hand, the 
image of the Executive Branch had changed because state 
governors are now being elected directly; and on the other, the 
privatization of the big public enterprises had taken from the 
president a traditional source of power. At the same time, 
there were social demands that could not be met quickly because 
a treasury deficit created difficulties and problems could not 
be resolved or commitments could not be fulfilled as quickly and 
as easily as before. 
  In addition there was the unrest that prevailed in the 
country following the February 1992 events and as a result of 
the institutional crisis of June 1993. In addition, there was 
the new economic situation, the daily deterioration of the 
family budget, and the state of hopelessness in the middle class. 
  During the past few months, all this resulted in continuous 
observations about the frailty of the new government, the small 
probabilities of the government lasting until the November 
elections, and the paralyzing and anguishing expectation about 
what could happen at any moment. 
  The continuous consultations we held with all the sectors of 
the national community and in all regions showed us, better than 
polls, the reasons for absenteeism or electoral indifference 
among a significant group of Venezuelans. It appeared that 
democracy was going to succumb. New military rebellions were 
feared, immediate strikes in important sectors were expected. 
  After a succession of partial strikes a date was set for a 
general strike in the public sector. This, in effect, would 
have spurred unpredictable consequences for the December 
elections. Incidentally, I would like to clear up something now. 
Those union demands did not respond to goals derived from the 
people's needs. They were, as I said at that time, fair 
aspirations but not feasible due to the serious fiscal crisis 
and the growing Treasury deficit. 
  In addition, the country was appalled by the terrorist 
threats that were perceived as a product of diverse 
conspiracies. I would be lying if I said that my government, 
even since its beginning, lacked total institutional or national 
support. I was able to count on the initial support of the 
Parliament, the support of the nation's Armed Forces, and the 
support of the Catholic Church. These stimulated our 
determination to progress on the road to transition because we 
perceived that our goal to listen to demands and to hear 
positions from all the nation's sectors and regions were more 
than heard, they received satisfactory solutions. 
  The government I led was initiated with demands from 
political sectors and the written press to make significant 
changes. Most of these demands were in reference to scrapping 
an economic program that the Congress had recently approved 
through a series of legislative laws. Since the beginning I 
warned that I was not a miracle worker, that I was a public 
servant. I understood at that time that my government's main 
objectives were, as they could not be otherwise, to reestablish 
public peace by putting an emphasis on dialogue instead of 
repression, to persist in negotiations to resolve and 
restructure labor demands, to rehabilitate -- to the extent 
possible -- public finances to prevent a halt in the payrolls 
before December and thereby assure administrative continuity, 
and to revive faith in the elections. 
  I believe that any judgment passed on the brief, but intense 
administration that I have headed, should be based on the 
explicit objectives that I was given. It was too short a term 
to carry out significant programs in state organization, but was 
a term committed to respond to the demands and risks of the 
national emergency. Democratic will prevailed in the end and in 
the 1993 electoral scenario the public presence of all the 
existing Venezuelan political organizations of the nineties 
surfaced. 
  The final acceptance of the election results meant the end 
of 
the most serious stage of the crisis that shook the nation. 
This has allowed us to put an end to doubts and tensions, 
thereby opening the road to a new chapter in our history. 
  These statements should not be taken as an assertion that 
now 
that the elections are over we live in the best possible world. 
This would be an attempt to hide the concern resulting from 
election abstention registered in official statistics. This is 
of particular concern when it involves the younger Venezuelan 
generation. 
  Both the willingness expressed by those who cast their votes 
and the willingness not to vote, given their equal force, make 
up a puzzling and difficult situation in our history. The 
puzzling situation we are experiencing is that the possible 
solutions entail important changes in the very system adopted by 
our democracy to alleviate backwardness and injustice. This is 
because more than 30 years have gone by since an experience 
without precedent in Venezuelan history was initiated. This took 
place at a time when there was a small population, a manageable 
fiscal situation, absence of large social demands, and political 
participation in a stage of clearly defined dimensions. 
  That situation disappeared and gave way to another reality 
whose development is traumatic and unpredictable. As with any 
beginning, this new period we are facing is characterized by the 
urgent demands of the new Venezuelan society, and, therefore, a 
redistribution of power is required. No dictatorship would have 
endured the kind of crises that our democracy has endured in the 
past three years. 
  I do not want you to think that what I will now say is the 
product of some sort of professional or intellectual distortion 
stemming from my passion for history that prompts me to yield to 
the joy of making comparisons. I have had the privilege of 
experiencing two major crises in our democratic system, and in 
both of them the circumstances placed me in the very eye of the 
hurricane. I was a protagonist and a witness at the same time, 
as a public man and as interpreter of history: The first time, I 
served as secretary general of the Presidency of the Republic 
beginning in 1959, and the second time I served as president of 
the Republic. 
  This has allowed me to monitor closely and experience not 
only the events, but also to see their hidden sides. This has 
allowed me to recall -- and I am recalling this before you -- 
that we are not experiencing an unknown situation and that 
during the first five years of the democratic period -- in the 
early 1960's -- the country was rocked by a deep crisis as a 
result of national changes and world developments -- as is the 
case with the current crisis -- that caused serious political 
conflicts. 
  In those years, there were numerous military insurgencies, 
terrorist actions, and guerrilla activity fostered by the 
enthusiasm generated Fidel Castro's triumph in Cuba and by a 
fiscal and economic crisis that forced the government to adopt 
special measures. 
  Despite the seriousness of the events of that five-year 
period, they were met by a national community that had not long 
ago come out of a decade of dictatorship to which it did not 
wish to return. That is why this national community thought it 
had found a cure for all of its evils in that new political 
period. 
  Behind that backdrop there was determination to persist in 
democracy and liberty, and this was reflected in the 
establishment of a political pact by which the most powerful 
political parties, despite their differences and without 
disclaiming that disputes existed among them, managed to unite 
to face conflicts that situations of this sort always provoke, 
but at that time they appeared to be so new and unprecedented. 
  That collective will and that political pact brought three 
decades of stability to the democratic system and the changes in 
our society and the opening of the political system -- with all 
of their faults and inconsistencies -- have been achieved 
through institutional means. 
  That pact is virtually nonexistent today, and we do not yet 
have another one to replace it. The country has changed 
significantly in all areas. These significant transformations 
could have affected its political life in the recent elections. 
Dr. Rafael Caldera enjoyed the support of a group outside the 
traditional majority parties, and at Congress there is now a 
balance of four and not only two coordinated groups. 
  The democratic model mentioned in the Constitution and the 
pact that strengthened it have become limited, while civilian 
awareness and the people's participation in the continuous 
exercise of democracy have matured. The people no longer 
comprise a more or less passive body that is only evident at 
election time. Rather, the population now is the direct 
promoter of public activity, as well as a not very reverential 
critic. 
  This is why we cannot postpone decentralization, the 
development of the electoral system, promotion of greater 
democratization of parties and unions, drastic reduction in 
government size, and fostering complete honesty in 
administrative and judicial procedures. This profound change 
coincides, and not by chance, with a weakening of the 
protectionist, profit-oriented [rentista], and inward-growing 
model based on petroleum and of a spendthrift state that ended 
up pouring on that complex process of transformations the fuel 
of inflation, deterioration of services, and insecurity. 
  Though these may be growing pains, which when handled in an 
enlightened fashion may lead us to higher stages of development 
and higher levels of life, it has not been easy to make people 
understand the need to establish an austere system -- not a 
patronage system -- based instead on productive work. The 
excessive custodianship of the state and the unproductivity 
hidden by massive official aid have been ruinous practices that 
have structurally weakened the treasury and tend to give the 
deficit a chronic nature. 
  The worrisome events of February 1989, as well as those that 
took place in February and November 1992, are manifestations 
that, although unusual, brought to light before the December 
elections the major changes many of us had foreseen -- seen 
through the naked eye, without pessimistic considerations. Those 
threats that seemed a thing of the past in our political life 
may prove beneficial to democracy, with all the violence in 
which they took place. If we succeed in understanding them, they 
add pressing reasons for the need for a national consensus to 
change. 
  The process of decentralization. That process of in-depth 
political change that has been taking place in the country has 
been fundamentally manifested in the direct election of 
governors and mayors since 1989. That political event -- no 
doubt the most important in our democratic history since the 
introduction of universal and direct suffrage to elect our 
representatives in 1947 -- falling within the framework of the 
state reform proposals I was honored to promote in the 
Presidential Commission for State Reform in late 1988, has set 
the stage for a new era, one of an democratic but also 
decentralized and participative state. 
  The decentralization policy of my administration stems from 
my conviction that thanks to this process, the experienced 
political change has occurred in a democratic manner. The real 
modifications that have taken place in the political state will 
begin to be felt in the constitutional period that is beginning. 
  Aware of the irreversible presence of this consensus for 
institutional transformation, I imprinted on the 
decentralization process during the months of my mandate all the 
momentum possible as the democratic tool of the inevitable 
political evolution. I appointed a state minister for 
decentralization to guide this process on behalf of the 
government, to propose the necessary political and government 
decisions, and to establish new grounds for the 
intergovernmental relations the new state required, where the 
government of the Republic is not merely the national government 
but is a government together with the state and municipal 
governments, as part of a public, single, and overall public 
authority that is no longer vertical, but constitutionally 
distributed in a horizontal manner in the territory of the 
Republic. 
  The decentralization charter of 1989. During my months in 
office, this law was implemented and complemented through 
regulations I issued through the Council of Ministers. The bases 
were established for the process of transferring national 
jurisdiction and services to states and municipalities, and 
mechanisms were regulated in a smooth manner to advance the 
necessary intergovernmental relations between the national, 
state, and municipal authority bodies. The creation of the 
Territorial Government Council, National Mayors' Council, and 
the Council of Government for metropolitan Caracas stemmed from 
there. 
  By the same token, agreements were signed with five states 
transferring public health services. We signed another agreement 
on care for children and senior citizens. In addition, the 
national and state organizations signed many agreements to 
relieve clogging of services. 
  Urgent fiscal action. The implementation of deficit 
budgets in the past few years reached a critical point in the 
second half of 1993, coinciding with my government. Doubts 
were raised concerning the possibility of adequately repaying 
domestic and foreign obligations, including the payment of the 
public administration's payroll and year-end special 
remunerations. Several solutions to the fiscal problem were 
carefully studied within the short time available. In view of 
the impossibility of significantly cutting expenses, the 
government resorted to establishing taxes on the nonoil sector. 
This was feasible, considering the low fiscal pressure on this 
sector. Consequently, and by way of congressional 
authorization, I issued decree-laws at ministerial council 
meetings, which established value-added taxes [VAT] and taxes on 
corporation assets. Other decrees enforced the new Banking Law, 
the Fiscal Stamp Law, and the Judicial Tariff Law. 
  One of the VAT's characteristics, among others, is its 
immediate and easy collection. Its destiny now depends on what 
this sovereign Congress may decide. The tax on enterprises' 
assets is, more than anything else, a means for preventing 
income tax evasion. 
  Meanwhile, the taxes stipulated by laws to reform the Fiscal 
Stamps Law and Judicial Tariff Law were updated and fine-tuned. 
Efficiently and on a short-term basis, the new taxes not only 
provided resources to meet urgent fiscal needs, but they also 
decisively contributed to the placement of securities issued in 
1992 and 1993 -- securities which had seen little acceptance. 
Late in 1993, it became possible to place those securities 
because investors realized the Venezuelan Government would be in 
a better position to pay its obligations. On a mid-term basis, 
and in addition to helping correct the fiscal deficit, this 
placement can ease the refinancing of the debt by resulting in 
better fiscal control, an essential condition to meet this 
objective. 
  In the area of expenditures, numerous allocations were 
declared nonfeasible. This made it possible to finance greater 
priority needs. These additional resources were used to complete 
the financing of the electoral process and the Republic Plan, 
meet the state universities' requests, create a single 
compensation bonus, and raise salaries according to collective 
contracts. The public budget already runs in the millions, 
while fiscal revenue sources have not yet been diversified. 
Expenditures exceeded fiscal revenues during 1992 and 1993. 
The corresponding deficit materialized in payment orders worth 
more than 180 billion bolivares. The tremendous nature of the 
fiscal crisis and the shortness of my term made it impossible to 
tackle this problem fully. 
  The budget approved for 1994 is based on estimated general 
revenues that proved unrealistic as soon as the weakness of the 
international oil market determined a drop in both sales volume 
and the price of our oil. To top it off, a large portion of the 
special revenues anticipated for the complementary financing of 
this budget also proved unrealistic. All of this makes us 
expect another worrisome fiscal deficit. The new leaders of the 
nation must urgently find in-depth solutions and new and 
dependable sources of income, while, at the same time, finding 
areas where public expenditures can be reduced and other budget 
credit requirements are met. These leaders must carry out an 
dauntless fiscal reorganization based on modern tax schemes and 
resource-utilization plans which might correct the downturn that 
has taken place in the recent past. 
<H5>  The Task Accomplished </H5>
  I want to emphasize the task accomplished during the short 
and conflicting duration of the administration I presided over 
by those who accompanied me in the government tasks. In the 
work done in different sectors, they did not show any interest 
other than serving Venezuela. They knew they could not count on 
the support of any parties, and they were aware of the great 
responsibility of the government they formed. 
  Public order was maintained and relations with all political 
sectors were maintained within an atmosphere of understanding, 
respect, and broad-mindedness. We fulfilled our international 
commitment and increased our leading presence in the Latin 
American economic integration process. We reached fundamental 
accords in the agricultural and auto manufacturing sectors. In 
terms of the health sector, we worked enthusiastically, and this 
translated into standards that took into account the growth of 
demand, the definitive application of national law on this 
matter, and the demands for decentralization. 
  Concerning the areas of education, social work, and labor 
relations, we responded to demands with programs, 
notwithstanding the growing limitation of fiscal resources. The 
extensive report accompanying my message and the notes and 
reports of the ministers deal with these government 
administration aspects. The detailed presidential report is 
illustrated by numerous statistical figures that explain and 
complement the statements on this message on the state of the 
country. 
<H5>  Venezuelan Reflections </H5>
  The fact that I can address you from the highest office in 
the Republic is a situation that cannot repeat itself. 
Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to make some final 
reflections on the future of Venezuela, the questions involving 
Venezuela's future, and the ways to solve problems I have 
learned throughout my participation in public life, which I 
realized during my short stay at the presidency. These 
reflections are aimed at contributing in a modest manner to 
examine the decisions that you, as representatives of a country 
needing the truth and solution, must make in these dramatic 
years. 
  Our contemporary history has centered on the state. During 
70 years of this century and until recently, the center of 
disputes in society was the proximity of the state, given its 
role as great distributor of income. All social sectors 
approached this rich state, capable of enriching profusely, to 
enjoy its riches either legitimately or illegitimately. That 
state, which was the basis for the habits of the Venezuelan 
people, no longer exists. We have a state that is deeply in 
debt -- a debt for which oil revenues are not enough -- with 
multiple obligations that cannot be met in terms of services and 
social security by resorting to old ways and resources. 
  Petroleum, the source of so many supplies, is today also the 
source of our many constraints. Oil revenues are insufficient 
for society to live off of them, and in the future it is not 
more promising than it has been in the past 10 years. 
  We built a state that considered erroneously -- as can be 
appreciated now -- that the flow of oil revenues was constant, 
eternal, and unstoppable. When oil revenues decline and debt 
obligations become evident, the state enters a situation of 
insolvency, without being able to face its commitments. Today 
the state owes workers, contractors, and social institutions 
responsible for guaranteeing a minimum level of quality of life 
for Venezuelans in terms of health, education, housing, and 
transportation. 
  Venezuelan society has not yet understood this reality. 
Representatives of all national sectors continue to come to 
Miraflores Palace to demand compliance with real or supposed 
commitments. This is the cause for the deterioration of the 
governments. The fact of who is leading the country is not as 
important. When the hand is extended to the state and it does 
not give a prompt and satisfactory response, a sensation that 
the state is failing to meet its responsibilities sinks in. 
  The truth of the matter is that the state can no longer do 
things the old way. Never again. It is the duty of Venezuelan 
society, now as never before in its recent history, to set forth 
its own alternatives and meet its own needs through mechanism of 
its own. This does not mean the state will relinquish the role 
it must play in a society like ours. However, for this to 
happen, society itself must provide the resources that oil 
provided in the past. 
  There is no alternative. We must go -- and we are doing this 
now -- from a society that lives off its earnings to a 
productive society that can pay taxes and sustain the means that 
enable the state to fulfill its social functions. As we never 
tire of saying, the majority of Venezuelans do not understand or 
agree with this evident truth. The same ones who talk about 
state needs that are more reduced and operational and less 
interventionist, are the first ones to extend their hands to 
obtain the state's protection and resources the minute they face 
a problem or difficulty. 
  In another respect, the reforms package has limited the 
state's intervention capacity. Private entities and institutions 
were handed activities and powers that not long ago were the 
purview of the public sector. This is a signal of progress, but 
often, counter to what is being said, the state tries to 
intervene in activities that it left to the private sector. 
These contradictions are present in Venezuelan society, and they 
are the cause of many of the demands made on our depleted state. 
  The foreign debt burden is real. Between the foreign debt, 
the internal debt, the floating debt, and the unregistered debt, 
the pressure that exists on the Treasury makes it impossible to 
implement many projects and meet many expectations. Fiscal 
accounting has turned into a kind of fiscal sleight of hand in 
Venezuela. Meanwhile, corrective measures -- many of them 
painful -- meet the resistance of deeply rooted traditions as 
well as vested interests. 
  As long as there are no leaders with a clear awareness that 
their guidance must enlighten all Venezuelans on the new 
conditions, and as long as lawmakers do not accept that they 
must sacrifice the promises they made to correct the course, any 
effort to obtain fiscal resources will run up against the view 
that it will be misspent or provide raw material to corruption. 
This predicament is extremely perilous. It is not true that the 
leaders are corrupt or insensitive. The truth is, however, that 
the leaders do not speak clearly to the people of Venezuela. The 
failure to do that turns them into the first victims of the 
people's rage, because decisions are made without clarity. When 
they become difficult, leaders seek to distance themselves from 
them so as not to lose popularity. 
  That is not the way to build a permanent leadership in a 
modern and strife-torn society. Minor victories can only barely 
be achieved, and they vanish when despair grows. Public 
services were the first casualty of state insolvency. The 
deterioration of public services dates back many years, since 
fiscal difficulties were first manifested in this field. Many of 
our schools and health centers are run-down. Our network of 
roads and highways lacks proper maintenance. Our transportation 
system is vast but ineffective. 
  During the bonanza time, adequate maintenance was not 
provided because everything could be replaced by new projects or 
more money. We were unable to foster an awareness of 
maintenance. We lacked the mental clarity which would have 
allowed us to regard maintenance as a way to preserve the 
country's assets for lean times. Many projects are crumbling 
before our eyes .... [pauses] Many projects used to crumble 
before our eyes because we expected to replace them with others, 
when we should have learned to maintain them instead. 
  This is a cultural reality of the utmost importance. Social 
segments behave that way because they do not maintain what they 
have in their own personal lives but seek to replace them with 
new and costlier products. 
  Anyone who throws away a personal possession just because 
it has some minor damage cannot have a clear awareness of how to 
maintain public goods. People demand that the state eliminate 
the fiscal deficit, but often those who propose this desirable 
goal are the same ones who do not hesitate, even under the 
difficult situation we are experiencing, to pressure the state 
to increase its spending to resolve a problem. Those who on 
the one hand criticize increases in spending yet reject the 
government's actions to obtain more resources are the same 
people who on the other hand repeatedly demand the enforcement 
of actions that generate further spending. [applause] At the 
same time, we are facing just demands for pay increases, better 
social security, and programs to protect the most vulnerable 
segments of society. These demands lay permanent siege to the 
public resources, and the state can no longer face it. 
Administrative problems. Compounding all these conditions is 
another dramatic one: Public administration is practically 
useless. It was an adequate structure for managing a country of 
10 million people with a budget that barely exceeded 10 billion 
bolivares almost 20 years ago. That same apparatus tried to 
manage a nation of 20 million people with a budget of over 1.2 
trillion bolivares. That change of scale has turned public 
administration into a monster barely able to meet its 
obligations. The presidency of the Republic, regarded by the 
collective imagination as the center of power and favors, is a 
precarious management office upon which an unbending social 
pressure is exerted. We have a presidency that uses 19th 
century methods, but we need one that meets the needs of the 
21st century. The president no longer has the power he once 
held. Society has become more complex. There has been progress 
in decentralization. New factors of social power have emerged. 
Citizens have their own means of administering themselves. 
Economic activity is taking a private course. The traditional 
government dues are disappearing. The people, however, view 
the presidency and the president as the deciding factor in all 
the country's benefits and ills. If this view of the 
president's actions does not change, it will be difficult for 
the head of state to be, beyond brief periods of hope, the 
representative who Venezuelans feel is always committed to their 
destiny. He will always have to do less than he promised, and 
the promises he keeps will always be thought of as limited, 
petty, and sometimes as undesirable. Under these 
circumstances, the president is a prisoner, but most of all he 
is a prisoner of himself if he hopes to carry out the things of 
which he dreamed and if he is regarded as a wizard who can 
resolve through magic [applause] everything that accounting does 
not allow him to do. 
  We cannot be pessimistic about Venezuela if we intend to do 
what must be done, but we must abandon all hope if an erroneous 
concept about a leader's role prevents us from courageously 
planning and doing what must be done. The only way to defeat 
the national belief that only a dictatorship allows the adoption 
of severe measures to reorganize the country is to prove that 
democracy is capable of doing it. There is no other option. 
Democracy cannot be a covert dictatorship, yet democracy cannot 
renounce changes that are determined by our times, even when 
these changes are difficult and costly. 
  Lasting leaderships are those that build things even when 
it may cost them a short-lived, evasive popularity, not those 
that seek to please. Trying to please without assuming the 
inherent responsibilities of leadership is the best way to 
destroy the people's faith in democracy because in the end 
citizens forget demagogic actions and only remember their 
personal experience in a disaster. However, the need for a 
serious rather than demagogic leadership cannot cast aside, 
hide, or deny that the crux of the Venezuelan crisis is the 
social issue. 
  The idea that economic growth in and of itself creates 
social 
welfare is not true. Economic growth is possible, but a 
concentration of wealth can also result in the growth of poverty 
within a society. The idea that all the state's efforts should 
be directed at maintaining economic variables at a specific 
rhythm of growth without meeting the people's basic needs is 
suicide for a democratic political regime, and it is also 
suicide for the economy and society. 
  The social problem is much more critical and urgent because 
the state's resources have been severely diminished. The social 
issue cannot be exclusively handled by the state based on its 
fiscal resources. Society as a whole must assume its 
responsibility toward less fortunate sectors. That means the 
business sector must be aware that its contribution toward 
solving the situation of poverty in the country is essential and 
unpostponable, because social pauperism renders personal wealth 
precarious. 
  It also means that labor unions and organizations must 
understand that a substantial portion of public resources must 
be destined for social programs and not so much to fulfill labor 
demands. That means, above all, that an organized civilian 
society must provide proof of its solidarity by sponsoring 
mechanisms that allow us to face more appropriately the 
catastrophic conditions created by poverty. To forget the poor 
is a form of forgetting democracy and economic progress in a 
regime of liberty and democracy. [applause] 
  A national agreement is essential to solving Venezuela's 
problems. This has not been a chance proposal. Instead, it is 
based on our conviction that only a broad agreement will allow 
us to overcome Venezuelan society's structural problems. Let us 
forget the idea that a man or a party will be capable of 
carrying out a project of that size or of facing the gigantic 
challenges of a modern Venezuela. Only an agreement based on 
various opinions around a nucleus of power will be able to 
achieve this. This is a mandatory provision, and above all it 
necessitates the willingness to recognize the fact that 
retaliation or the annihilation of an adversary will only lead 
to the collapse of the Republic. 
  We have faced bitter times in Venezuela. There were elite 
leaders who did not feel the country shake under their feet in 
1858. Leaders of that time vented their cruelty on one another 
and abandoned the idea of an agreement. This ignited the fuse 
and civil war broke out. The same thing happened in 1947 and 
1948. Each one believed he was right in his own way and the 
result was a ferocious 10-year dictatorship. 
  We have time to learn from those examples, but we do not 
have too much time -- the country cannot wait too long. This 
year must be the year of a national agreement to guarantee the 
survival of democracy and its social achievements. First, an 
agreement must signify the acceptance that all groups which make 
up our society can and deserve to participate. The groundwork 
for an agreement is undermined when someone tries to exclude 
someone else. [applause] The pretension of judging who can or 
cannot participate leads to a chain of exclusions that 
pulverizes any possibility of achieving an agreement. 
  Second, the agreement must have an unequivocal and sound 
democratic basis. We cannot accept the cynical idea expressed 
by a German thinker, who said democracy was accepted to achieve 
power, but once power was achieved, it was a matter that only 
pertained to the group that achieved it and it did not imply a 
commitment. That position is political suicide if not voluntary 
manslaughter. [applause] 
  Third, the national agreement cannot be reached through an 
endless chain of social demands that would render it futile. No 
one can believe all his demands will be part of an agreement 
because it would be rendered null if everyone's behavior were 
similar. We are dealing with basic issues, and the national 
emergency demands that we take these and no others into 
consideration. 
  State reforms must be the core of the agreement. These 
reforms have not started...[pauses] these reforms have started 
and they have resulted in essential achievements for society, 
but pending tasks are so important that they are unpostponable. 
The constitutional reforms are a key element of this process. 
These do not involve all the changes that may be sought in this 
area, only those which manage to create a platform for the 
irreversible modernization of the state and the nation. 
  President-elect Dr. Rafael Caldera has placed special 
emphasis on this issue and the State Commission for Reforms can 
be an efficient conduit for drafting proposals. Reforms of the 
central administration and the presidency of the Republic 
represent essential elements for a strategic settlement like the 
one that has been proposed. It is necessary to turn the 
government structure, above all its center, into an efficient 
instrument to fulfill the immense tasks that the Venezuelan 
state currently faces. 
  The presidency of the Republic must be a privileged target 
of 
this transformation so the head of state can have the 
appropriate instruments to formulate, carry out, evaluate, and 
control the implementation of the policy adopted by the 
government for each specific sector. 
  Decentralization is another issue that demands a serious 
dedication to the tasks resulting from a national agreement. 
This process is changing the situation in Venezuela, but 
despite all the efforts made since the election of governors and 
mayors, it is still misunderstood by many national leaders as 
well as by many regional leaders. This is a dangerous 
misunderstanding, and its neglect may lead to serious dangers 
for the Republic. 
  Citizen senators, citizen deputies, these are some of the 
issues that may become the groundwork for a long-term national 
agreement without which Venezuela's future is in danger. The 
idea is not to cause alarm, only to tell the country the truth 
at this hour, this conflictive hour, this dramatic hour -- 
because therein lies the solution. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Venezuelan President Caldera by </F>
Marcel Niedergang in Caracas; date not given: "`Fight Against 
Poverty Is Number One Priority,' President Caldera Told Us"] 
  [Text] Caracas -- Rafael Caldera, elected to the post of 
president last December, although without a majority in 
parliament, is to assume the role of head of state for the 
second time in his career on Wednesday 2 February -- he was 
president before from 1969 to 1974 -- and he does not 
underestimate the challenges that await him. In an interview he 
granted us he set as his prime objective the fight against 
poverty, while promising a policy of economic austerity . 
  The leading crude oil power in Latin America, Venezuela has 
reached rock bottom. The state, up to its ears in debt and 
wholly disorganized, is now bankrupt with an estimated budget 
deficit of $6 billion. In four years, the dollar exchange rate 
has leapt from 38 to 108 bolivares, representing a serious de 
facto devaluation. Interest rates have risen from 12 percent to 
70 percent. The recent collapse of the country's second largest 
bank, the Banco Latino, has forced thousands of anguished small 
investors out onto the streets of the capital and continues to 
threaten the whole financial system. The fall in the price of a 
crude oil barrel ($12) on the international market is a cruel 
blow for an economy that is already faltering. The growth rate 
was negative in 1993. According to experts, the spectacular 
growth rates recorded between 1990 and 1992 (7 percent on 
average) were mainly due to the very high interest rates and 
inflows of "dirty" money from Colombia, Panama, and the Cayman 
Islands -- drug money. 
  Corruption is widespread and there is growing insecurity -- 
with 50 deaths every weekend in Caracas -- while the public 
administration is bloated and inefficient. Rafael Caldera, 78 
years old, has inherited a country traumatized by the economic 
crisis and the two attempted military coups in 1992. The 
specter of a putsch still hovers and the dismissal of Defense 
Minister Admiral Radarnes Munoz has added to the concern. 
Certain military coup leaders were recently freed by the 
interim government of Ramon J. Velasquez. Colonel Chavez, 
however, leader of the uprising on February 1992, is still 
imprisoned. The question remains whether he too should be freed. 
<H5>  `Free Chavez' </H5>
  "Without doubt he should," said Mr. Caldera. "The majority 
of the population wants him to be released. Peace will come to 
the country if we take this step. Everywhere during my 
electoral campaign I heard this popular appeal -- free the 
military rebels. As president I have the right to do this. I 
hope this decision will be accepted by all of the Armed Forces." 
The move risks being denounced by the generals, while the army 
has taken an increasing hold over public affairs since 1992. 
"That is as may be," Caldera replied dryly, "but I also 
believe that everyone accepts the need to reestablish the 
predominance of civil power." 
  It is said that in September 1993 Washington again 
discouraged senior Venezuelan army officers who had gone to the 
United States to sound out the Clinton administration on 
"possible renewed military intervention in their country." 
Caracas diplomatic circles confirm that there is a very strong, 
even "insistent," North American "presence" in the Venezuelan 
capital. 
  The new president stated: "The United States knows that our 
democracy has the value of being a test and a symbol for the 
whole of Latin America. It attaches a lot of importance to that 
fact. Moreover, the recent incidents in Argentina and Mexico -- 
the Chiapas revolution -- and the uprisings in our prisons are 
all warning signs of the constant risks of social explosion 
south of the Rio Grande. For this reason, I am convinced more 
than ever that our number one priority must be the fight against 
poverty and marginalization. We must revise and amend an 
economic policy that is too radical. This is one of the causes 
of the general malaise. You can see the same thing in Russia and 
in eastern Europe." 
<H5>  `We Are No Longer a Country of Independent Means' </H5>
  Explain, negotiate, and convince, in Venezuela and abroad: 
Mr. Caldera's team has already started talks to renegotiate the 
debt (of which in theory only 10 percent can be rescheduled). 
The president stated: "Of course, but there are special 
mechanisms, not least because the crude oil market plays a key 
role in the structure of our debt. The World Bank has assured 
me of its comprehension and the international financial 
institutions know that we are in a serious situation. The 
Clinton administration knows it too. We must save our democracy 
and I have high hopes." 
  Mr. Caldera considers that oil will for a long time remain 
the key motor of the Venezuelan economy, even though he is 
determined to favor a diversification of the source of foreign 
income which at the moment is too dependent on fluctuations in 
oil prices. "For a long time we were the Saudi Arabia of Latin 
America, but we are not any more. Previous governments 
speculated on a regular rise in the price of crude and dreamed 
of $50 per barrel. As a result, our budget has increased by a 
factor of 100 in 20 years. During my first term of office I was 
able to revalue the bolivar. Now, our currency is weakening all 
the time, and in 1993 we had inflation of 40 percent. Society 
must accept that we are no longer a country of independent means 
and that frantic speculation has done a lot of harm to our 
country." 
  How can Venezuela find urgently-needed resources and make up 
the budget deficit? Mr. Caldera is a prisoner of his own 
electoral promises -- which he says he intends to honor -- but 
the commitments are specific. The Velasquez government decreed 
a 10-percent VAT [value-added tax] rate which recently sparked 
street riots throughout the country. The fear of another 
"caracazo" (the bloody uprising of February 1989 caused by 
modest hikes in public transport fares) is at the back of 
everyone's mind. Can Mr. Caldera perform an economic U-turn and 
cancel the Perez government's austerity plan of 1989? In any 
case, this is what the main sectors of society are expecting. 
  The president pointed out: "Almost all the elements of the 
1989 plan can be changed. Some things were right, such as the 
elimination of preferential exchange rates which were a source 
of corruption. We have to revise everything in a pragmatic way. 
I announced a policy of austerity and the government must lead 
by example. The presidential running costs will be cut by 30 
percent. VAT, an unfair tax, must be canceled." VAT has already 
been suspended by the outgoing government in response to street 
demonstrations, and has been replaced by income tax. 
  The problem is how to make people pay taxes in a country 
where this "custom" is more or less unheard of. Mr. Caldera 
does not pretend the difficulty does not exist, but at least he 
wants to try. "That will require very severe measures. We have 
started living in a protest culture. While VAT has become a 
symbol, even a taboo, the same is also true for petrol. It is 
almost impossible to touch it. However, public opinion must 
accept that price rises are inevitable. The sacrifices made will 
be sweetened by the compensations to be had. There again, this 
is a long-term task. After the attempted coup of February 1992, 
Carlos Andres Perez announced to Congress that everything was 
going to change. He was applauded just once -- when he said 
that the price of petrol would not go up." 
  People say that Mr. Caldera is an authoritarian: "I do not 
think that is true. I am capable of changing my mind. If I am 
right, however, then I vigorously defend my point of view. I 
have acquired a false reputation: People have confused firmness 
with pride. Here there is a considerable risk that things could 
get out of control. I cannot promise miracles or prompt radical 
changes, except where assistance to the underprivileged is 
concerned.

<F P=106> [Commentary by D.B.U.: "The Debt With the Middle Class"] </F>
  [Text] On 25 January, President Ramon J. Velasquez conceded 
that the Venezuelan Government's insolvency is due to a "huge 
foreign debt," as well as to an "even greater social debt, which 
cannot wait." 
  According to Velasquez, the social debt is pending with 48 
percent of Venezuelans living in extreme poverty and whose 
incomes fail to cover the price of essential goods. Aside from 
this, the current situation is that the government's social debt 
also affects the middle class, which has been hard-hit 
constantly since "the government for the poor" made everyone 
poor. This is the way we have felt since that tragic Black 
Friday. 
  Since that time, and in a sustained manner, the "middle 
class," which does not receive any food stamps or other state 
subsidies, is becoming ever smaller. The middle class only has a 
salary, from which growing amounts are being deducted for taxes, 
social security, and the housing fund without receiving any 
benefits in exchange. 
  The Venezuelan "middle class" is one that does not illegally 
hook its homes into the electric power grid but, rather, pays 
its entire bill, including monthly "adjustments," and 
accordingly, the bills for other services -- if they work -- 
such as water, gas, telephone, and garbage collection, which 
also have extra charges. 
  The middle class comprises those Venezuelans who can no 
longer afford a car, not only because a car is now as costly as 
a luxury home used to be, but also because they cannot pay for 
insurance to protect themselves from a very high theft risk. It 
includes those who had to stop dreaming about owning a decent 
home of their own because they had to give up their hopes for 
credit because of rising interest rates. The middle class also 
includes those who this year will have to forget about providing 
a better future for their children because they have no access 
to private schools or private medical attention, needless to say 
a well-balanced diet. 
  The middle class also comprises those who today, in addition 
to witnessing a decline in their purchasing power, must face 
losing their savings if they had an account with Banco Latino or 
are afraid of losing them if the crisis spreads to other 
institutions. 
  The middle class comprises professionals, technicians, and 
office clerks who, regardless of having a professional 
background, see their hopes disintegrating. 
  Venezuelan society was always an open society where, with 
work and effort, the poor had the hope of becoming a member of 
the middle class. Leaving the shack was an achievable goal. 
Currently, the poor feel as though they will never leave the 
shack, while the middle class feels increasingly pushed toward 
the shack. 
  The middle class builds the country. In Venezuela, these 
builders are being destroyed. It is important that the national 
leadership and, especially the new government, understand that 
that social debt is much greater, and that it cannot be paid 
with petty grants or food stamps. The solution to this problem 
lies in an open and valiant fight against inflation, which is 
impossible without a deficit reduction.

  [Text] (Sonia Ciambatti), former magistrate of the Supreme 
Court of Justice, said that the Executive Branch, through the 
Central Bank of Venezuela, will begin operating a data base that 
will allow the detection and neutralization of money transfers 
linked to drug-trafficking activities that are coming into the 
country from overseas. (Ciambatti) made the announcement within 
the framework of a conference in Caracas on U.S. experiences in 
fighting money laundering in the United States. 
  If money laundering is not eradicated, it is capable of 
spilling over and harming the financial system of a nation, 
because people involved in money laundering take advantage of 
the system for their own benefit. According to (Ciambatti), 
Venezuela has acquired international tools, such as the Vienna 
Convention and the standard regulations on the legitimization of 
capital, that enable a country to fight the crime. Establishing 
the proposed data base, therefore, will be a smooth process. 
  [Begin (Ciambatti) recording, in progress] ... so there is a 
check to allow only banking transfers and economic situations 
that are entirely legal and which benefit the country and to 
keep Venezuela from becoming a center of operations for 
international drug-trafficking activities. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Teresa Fajardo from the "YSU Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Excerpt] Jorge Antonio Jean Mateu Aviles, vice president 
of the Supreme Court of Justice, has avoided making any 
statements that call into question or defend the Judiciary 
Branch's handling of the murder of a Salvadoran citizen by U.S. 
military officer Mike Lopez on 29 January. The magistrate 
declined comment because public reports on the case are just 
opinions and cannot form the basis of a legal position. 
  [Begin recording] [Mateu] The Court does not have a position 
on this case. I understand the Court president has already made 
statements reflecting the opinion of the Court. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Weren't Salvadoran laws violated in 
this case, in the sense that, according to the prosecutor 
general and the director of the PNC [National Civilian Police], 
the judge was manipulated? They said that the supply of U.S. 
aid was linked to the judge not indicting the U.S. citizen. 
Aren't the nation's laws being manipulated? 
  [Mateu] The Judiciary Branch is not manipulating the law. 
The judiciary is working to see that laws are fulfilled. But 
as Supreme Court... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Will you defend the Constitution of 
the Republic? No statement has been made in this regard. 
  [Mateu] Once the recourse in this case is filed, we will 
have 
more details about this situation. But for now only opinions 
have been aired. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] a case of real impunity? 
  [Mattei] Regardless of what I think, I cannot state my 
opinion because a recourse may be filed with this office. It 
would be inappropriate for me to give my opinion. [end 
recording] 
  The Supreme Court official made these brief comments on this 
case, after having announced plans to convene a special congress 
of the Latin American Federation of Magistrates in this capital.

  [Text] The Nationalist Authentic Central (CAN) party 
leadership expressed through its general secretary, Roberto Tito 
Arana, its satisfaction with the patriotism demonstrated by the 
Guatemalan people by going to the polls to cast their vote in 
favor of the referendum. This action resulted in the approval 
of the constitutional reforms, thereby laying the foundations 
for purging Congress and the Supreme Court. The CAN leadership 
concluded by stating: "Although we are immersed in a sea of 
uncertainty and indecision, the people's will as expressed in 
the referendum compels us to demand the immediate purge of state 
institutions. As a direct consequence, elections must be held 
immediately in order not to frustrate the aspirations of the 
Guatemalan people, who for several months have been demanding 
the election of a new congress.

  [Text] The Brazilian Government has repudiated, through 
Brazilian newspapers, the annual report on human rights issued 
by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. report released 
yesterday included Brazil among the countries that violate 
civilian rights. 
  In its reaction to the U.S. report, the Brazilian Government 
considers as unfounded charges of disrespect for civilian rights 
because the document does not consider the efforts by the 
Brazilian federal, state, and municipal governments to solve the 
problem. 
  The Brazilian Government believes the subject must be 
discussed by international organizations and stresses that the 
accusation is unacceptable because the U.S. Government does not 
release reports on human rights violations in its own territory.

<F P=106> [News conference by Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio </F>
Lacayo, National Police Director Fernando Caldera, National 
Transportation Commission spokesman Gustavo Aguiluz, 
Parrales-Vallejos Cooperative President Carlos Palma, and 
National Workers' Front Leader Roberto Gonzalez, who is also a 
member of the Parrales- Vallejos Cooperative, with unidentified 
reporters at the Presidential Palace in Managua -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Lacayo] Nicaraguans: In the pre-dawn hours of 
this morning I received a letter from (Don Jose Sara), 
coordinator for the National Transportation Commission [CNT], 
requesting a meeting to try and find a definitive and long-term 
solution to the transportation sector's problems. Despite the 
fact that I have not participated in the government commission 
that has been meeting with the various transportation sectors 
since 13 January, I accepted with pleasure because I was aware 
of their willingness to solve the strike today. 
  The meeting with CNT representatives was held in the 
afternoon and lasted about an hour and one-half. I must say 
that the talks were very frank and constructive. They explained 
their view of the transportation sector's main problems; that 
is, problems involving fuel price hikes and mechanisms dealing 
with the effective tax exemptions to which cooperatives are 
entitled in accordance with the country's laws and problems with 
coupons that were agreed upon back in September and which in 
some cases have not been distributed. All this, I would say, 
was communicated by those who work in this important sector with 
a desire to survive. 
  I also took the opportunity to tell them of the government's 
wish to consolidate this sector. The transportation sector is 
vital to Nicaragua's production, passenger and cargo 
transportation, and collective transportation. The government 
would like the sector to consolidate with other transportation 
federations and chambers and for the tax exemption mechanisms to 
be fine tuned. The government wants the sector to understand 
the fuel situation, that they must have greater trust in what 
the government does once the price freeze period expires and 
when pending coupons are brought up to date, and all other 
aspects that hinder the smooth operation of this sector. The 
government also wishes to discuss the in-depth problems 
involving the new organization throughout this sector and the 
preparation of a general transportation law, which must be 
drafted with all sectors involved in transportation. Then the 
executive branch, President Chamorro, can send this draft bill 
initiative to the National Assembly for discussion and approval. 
  Following these frank talks, which lasted an hour and 
one-half, I asked them to end the strike, because we all know of 
the inherent danger of these situations when people take 
advantage of circumstances to complicate things even more. In 
fact, the transportation sector itself is interested in resuming 
work because they are harming their economic situation. They 
have entrusted me personally with overseeing and ensuring that 
the various government commissions working with the 
transportation sector work smoothly toward the goal we seek, 
which is that this sector become organized and an in-depth 
solution to their problems be found. 
  At the end of the meeting they asked to talk with their 
affiliate members and return later tonight to tell the 
Nicaraguan people what has been done. I agreed with pleasure, 
and in light of radio reports that were being broadcast at the 
time that bore little resemblance to the talks we had held, I 
also decided to speak to the other transportation sectors, 
federations, and chambers to explain that we were meeting with a 
constructive spirit full of goodwill, which will allow the whole 
sector to work in greater harmony. I also found them to be very 
receptive toward the idea of working together. I think this is 
a great step. 
  While in the meeting I received information that the CNT had 
accepted my request to end the strike. I think this is a very 
positive step in favor of the transportation sector. The 
attitude of the commission and other chambers and federations 
forecasts a very positive working meeting tomorrow or the day 
after at the latest. This definitely commits the government to 
working with greater interest in support of the definitive and 
long-term solutions requested by the CNT in their letter. 
  By beginning February with this strike resolved without 
regrettable deaths or injuries, the country is taking a very 
important step on the path to reaffirming dialogue as the 
fundamental instrument for resolving differences among 
Nicaraguans and in favor of the reconciliation of Nicaraguans by 
achieving their unity in a concerted agreement. I am very 
happy, and now it is the commission members' turn to comment. 
  [Gonzalez] We wish to inform the local and international 
public, the Nicaraguan people, and the members of our 
organization throughout the country who are following this news 
conference of the National Transportation Commission's [CNT] 
responsible decision to contribute to a solution. We also wish 
to emphasize this chance to restore confidence between the 
government and the drivers, a confidence that had clearly 
deteriorated in relation to the fulfillment of previous 
agreements. It was decided today, as the result of Minister 
Lacayo's pledge to the CNT and in response to our proposals, 
that the agenda items the CNT had been proposing will be 
revised, adjusted, and discussed at 1500 at the CNT office 
tomorrow and in a bilateral meeting to be held at 0900 on 
Thursday as agreed with Minister Lacayo. 
  This decision to suspend the transport strike is our 
contribution to and a demonstration of our interest in the 
country's stability. We expect the government to reciprocate by 
meeting the cooperatives' long-standing expectations. Today we 
can see the possibility of the drivers' hopes being fulfilled 
and of our dreams coming true. We have stated our position 
regarding the government. We are for national stability, 
agreement, dialogue, and the discussion of problems. We are 
willing to use every necessary administrative procedure that 
lends itself to achieving an understanding. We also wish to 
reiterate firmly, however, that the drivers' contribution to the 
recovery of trust between themselves and the government will be 
conditional upon the fulfillment of the government's pledge 
through Minister Lacayo. As a result, we hereby announce that 
the general transportation strike has been suspended today and 
that all delegations in Managua can return to their places of 
origin, a return that must be guaranteed by the National Police. 
We also wish to make it clear that a fundamental aspect of 
these negotiations as part of the climate of understanding is 
the release of all detainees and no reprisals against the 
strikers. Minister Lacayo, today we have pledged our word in 
responsibility. This is a historic chance to aid Nicaragua and 
to set an example for all sectors. We urge the government to 
keep its word. Let's not betray this word. We believe this is 
a chance to create conditions for a greater openness and to 
increase trust. Thanks. 
  [Reporter] Minister Lacayo, why was your participation 
necessary in this transportation sector conflict? Can't the 
other ministers make decisions? My next question is for Roberto 
Gonzalez of the CNT. What was the subject of your meeting this 
afternoon with Minister Lacayo? What arrangement did you make? 
And why this last-minute decision to end a strike that was going 
strong? 
  [Gonzalez] This morning the CNT presented its position to 
Minister Lacayo. We found that Minister Lacayo is in favor of 
discussing this position and of seriously analyzing it to give 
us a positive answer. That is why the commission believes that 
this time we will not be left vulnerable. That is why we have 
informed our people on strike at the national level that the 
strike is over. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I will expand on that so there is no 
misinterpretation of your question about what was discussed. We 
discussed what Minister Lacayo and Roberto have explained. Our 
position to end the strike came in response to the first sign of 
goodwill and interest, which in this case came from Minister 
Lacayo. In the face of this situation, we had an obligation to 
the people and our sector, which we represent, to find a 
negotiated solution based on Minister Lacayo's receptive 
position in favor of a commitment. 
  [Lacayo] [passage omitted] We must admit that during the 
first years of this government, some transportation permits and 
operating licenses were granted in response to political 
pressures brought to bear by the end of the war. We gave taxi 
operation licenses to demobilized people from the Nicaraguan 
Resistance as well as to retired Army people, who thus found 
jobs immediately. We must end that practice so we can move to a 
higher phase to benefit the entire sector. 
  I think that the ministers have acted in accordance with 
their responsibilities. [passage omitted] 
  There has been a great deal of distrust in both the 
transportation sector and -- the ministers have told me this -- 
among the ministers. Please remember what happened in 
September. These meetings have taken place in the midst of a 
strike. This makes negotiations difficult. When this is the 
framework, the people don't perform as well as they could. I 
had an edge: I had not participated in the negotiations and I 
had not met the transportation people. I met them today. 
Perhaps this made it easier for us to realize that we are 
closer to an agreement than we had thought and that if the two 
sides have the will, we will be able to reach an agreement that 
favors this sector. 
  [Reporter] What will happen to the transportation people 
still in prison now that the strike is being dismantled? What 
will happen to the cases that have been initiated against 
approximately 200 transportation people who were arrested during 
the strike? What will happen to them? Will the trial 
proceedings continue? 
  [Lacayo] The people arrested as suspects by the police will 
be released. No one has been placed at the disposal of a court, 
so there is no problem in this regard. We think, as we have 
discussed with the commission, that in the future, if we work in 
a more harmonious way, we will not find ourselves in this kind 
of situation. In this regard it is important to state that 
everyone is interested in making the transportation sector 
function better. This will get us off to a good start tomorrow. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] The strike began with a protest over increased 
fuel prices. Nicaragua has the highest gasoline prices in 
Central America. There was also a failure to fulfill the 
agreements signed in September 1993 and the issue of 
reorganizing the transportation sector. What did the government 
promise the transportation sector in response to their requests? 
  [Lacayo] We explained that a reorganization is in the best 
interest of the government and the transportation sector as 
well. The reorganization must be established in a general 
transportation law previously agreed upon by all sectors 
involved in transportation. We would send the law to the 
National Assembly, which would reach a final consensus, polish 
the document, and approve it. Nevertheless, it must be clearly 
understood that this concerted effort to create a new general 
transportation law must be a joint effort, and it is very 
difficult for the government to hold bilateral meetings with one 
sector and then with another sector, because in the end we get 
caught up in suspicions on all sides that are only dispelled 
when all sectors come together at a meeting. I believe the 
commission members have decided to take a positive step. It is 
also a positive step on the part of the other federations and 
chambers, which said this afternoon that they have never closed 
their doors to anyone for this sort of meeting. 
  All the sectors agree on one issue that could be the 
starting 
point for dealing with all these issues, including the fuel 
issue. As you said, fuel in Nicaragua is definitely the most 
expensive in Central America, but we must also clearly 
understand that our economy is the worst in Central America. 
This is the result of what we all know happened in our country 
over the past 10, 15, 20, or 100 years, to be more specific. 
While the other countries can pay their teachers, build medical 
centers, and construct better highways with taxes generated by 
their greater economic activity, we in Nicaragua have not had 
that luck. I hope that someday in the future the taxes we 
collect will allow us to lower fuel prices, but for the time 
being there is no other solution, and all Nicaraguans must 
understand that. 
  We must make an effort to raise our economy's level of 
production and productivity. I think we will take an important 
step in that direction this year, and eventually more 
Nicaraguans will be able to pay their taxes. We will also 
collect more from the business sector and from the sale of 
products that contribute to the generation of taxes, such as 
beer, rum, and cigarettes. Thus we will be able to gradually 
lower the tax which simply must be imposed on fuel. All 
countries collect taxes this way. Even in Europe, where there 
are strong economies, gasoline is sold for up to 25 or 26 
cordobas per gallon. The European countries are donors, in 
Nicaragua's case, and they have often pointed out that although 
gasoline is cheaper in other countries, it is still relatively 
cheap in Nicaragua when compared to prices in Europe. We must 
listen to the donors' points of view and seriously consider 
them, because they would like to see their aid channeled to more 
important matters and to the most dispossessed sectors of our 
society. Thus, in the agreements reached at dawn on Saturday, 
which the government is committed to maintain, we lowered the 
price of diesel as much as possible to prices that are quite 
competitive within Central America. Diesel is used for cargo 
and passenger transportation and for farm production in general. 
  An effort has also been made to subsidize gasoline for 
taxis. 
Taxi drivers will receive coupons per gallon of gasoline for a 
maximum of six gallons daily, thereby receiving some support 
from the government. However, gasoline in general and 
especially super gasoline must be more expensive to discourage 
the use of taxis and foster the use of mass transportation so 
the latter will have a greater volume of work. 
  [Reporter] I have questions for both sectors. The first is 
for the transportation sector. One thing that delayed the 
possibility of your ending the strike or reaching an agreement 
was a lack of trust. What makes you believe that you can now 
reach a satisfactory agreement? Also, have you considered 
proposing to the government other possible sources of income 
that would lower government taxes? I would also like the 
presidency minister to respond to this. 
  In addition, President Chamorro, and specifically [former] 
Transportation Minister Jaime Icabalceta, said that members of 
the Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative must decide whether they will 
use the buses. If not, they should return them, because those 
buses must be paid for and operated. I would like to know if 
the government is still concerned about this. I would also like 
to know, Mr. Minister, what effect this strike will have on your 
forthcoming meeting with the multilateral financial 
organizations. 
  [Lacayo] In response to the final part of your question, I 
would like to say that many things have been said by both sides 
over the past seven, eight, or nine days. Some news media have 
even reported things that were never said by either side. But 
all of that is behind us. What matters now is our current 
resolve to end the transportation sector problems. 
  Concerning alternative sources of income taxes, I think one 
source identified not only by a broad segment of the trade 
sector but by the general public is contraband. We all know 
that there are people in Nicaragua who bring merchandise into 
the country in a fraudulent manner. They do not pay the taxes 
they should pay; they compete unfairly against formally 
established businesses; and they do not make the required 
payments to bring their products into the country. We also know 
there are establishments that ask clients whether or not they 
want receipts. All merchants who do not provide receipts also 
harm the transportation sector and the economy in general. The 
burden must be shared by all. I think it is important for 
everyone who has the legal obligation to pay taxes to do so we 
can gradually reduce taxes on certain products, which would be 
to our advantage. That is what I have to say about alternative 
sources. 
  As for the international community, I must speak openly. To 
the extent that the international community sees the Nicaraguan 
people resolving problems, especially the way in which we have 
resolved a protest that did not become violent as it did in 
September and on other occasions, to the extent that we 
Nicaraguans can show the world that despite our country's 
infinite problems we are capable of reaching agreements and 
resolving our problems, to that extent, we will make a favorable 
impression on the international community. 
  The broad consensus achieved at the National Assembly at the 
beginning of the year and the fact that the Assembly is 
functioning with almost all of its 92 deputies has definitely 
had a very positive impact on the international community. U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Watson emphasized that point in 
spite of criticisms by certain Nicaraguan news media. I believe 
it makes an impression on the international community when they 
see that we are approaching the path to democracy. I have no 
doubt whatsoever that the way in which we resolved the strike 
and transportation stoppage today will also have a very positive 
impact, which is good for all Nicaraguans and, why not, for the 
transportation sector. 
  [Unidentified labor leader] It must be clearly established 
that we demanded of the government that both sides agree to a 
truce. This truce, which has been requested and demanded by the 
transportation sector and various cooperatives for over three 
years, is precisely the result of the economic difficulties 
faced by the cooperative movement. Therefore, we believe it is 
to our advantage to discuss our problems, and we have found the 
government to be receptive. I believe the fact that the 
presidency minister has listened to our observations and 
thoughts about the agenda we presented and discussed this 
afternoon proves that an understanding may be possible. 
Therefore, the pledge made by the government through Engineer 
Lacayo is precisely the offer we discussed today with our entire 
national directorate. We decided to discuss the work agenda we 
presented, which includes such issues as fuel, taxes, matters 
pertaining to Decree 62-93, and matters pertaining to the 
reorganization of transportation and other important issues. We 
decided to discuss these points at multilateral meetings, but 
above all they must be discussed at a bilateral meeting, which 
in our opinion is also a viable mechanism through which an 
agreement can be reached.

  [Text] The new National Police commander will be installed 
on 4 February. This and other details will be discussed in the 
following report by Mario Espinoza: 
  [Begin recording] In a few seconds I will give you the name 
of the new National Police commander who will be installed on 4 
February. But let us review the issues one at a time. 
  I am here in the Senate, where this afternoon there will be 
a 
secret session during which at least four police colonels will 
be promoted to general. The promotion of at least two of them 
is absolutely certain, that of the current Police Department 
chief, Colonel Luis Rocha; and Colonel Willy Arriaza. 
  The new National Police chief will be installed on 4 
February 
during a ceremony to be held at Government House that will be 
headed by the president. 
  The current National Police chief, General Einar Lopez, has 
fulfilled his years in service and, therefore, will retire. He 
will be replaced by newly appointed General Luis Rocha. 
Moreover, Col. Willy Arriaza, who will certainly be promoted to 
general, will be appointed National Police deputy chief. At any 
rate, well-informed Government House and Senate sources have 
confirmed this report. Therefore, new National Police Chief Luis 
Rocha will be installed on 4 February. 
  But this is not an isolated report, at least not within the 
police force. There are problems within the police force. On 1 
February, we were told by well-informed sources that Minister of 
Government German Quiroga asked for Police Commander Einar 
Lopez's resignation. Einar Lopez has refused to resign and said 
that when he assumed the post a few months ago, he thought it 
was a long-term important post, that he was not an acting police 
commander. 
  Everything seems to have resulted from a letter Gen. Einar 
Lopez submitted to Government Minister German Quiroga, which 
states there are unusual promotion procedures regarding the 
background reviews of those proposed for promotion to general. 
  According to the Police Commander's Office, the following 
police colonels have been proposed for promotion to police 
general: Willy Arriaza, Walter Romero, German Pomier, and Jaime 
Escobar. 
  According to information obtained by this television 
station, 
there is great disorder in the National Police force. [end

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria has 
reported that a U.S. court martial will be the means by which 
U.S. Major Ismael Lopez will be tried for the murder of 
Salvadoran national Jose Crescencio Diaz Alvarado. 
  In a news conference with reporters, the foreign minister 
said the officer could not be arrested or forced to make 
statements because he has total immunity from criminal 
jurisdiction in Salvadoran territory, in accordance with the 
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. 
  Lopez has been accredited with the Salvadoran Government as 
a 
U.S. Embassy military attache since 4 July 1992, registration 
number 267/92. 
  However, continued the foreign minister, the Vienna 
Convention states that the Maj. Lopez's immunity has in El 
Salvador does not exempt him from his own country's jurisdiction. 
  In this sense, said Salaverria, the Foreign Ministry has 
from 
the outset received assurances from the U.S. Embassy in El 
Salvador that Maj. Lopez would be subject to a court martial in 
his own country. 
  "Ever since this regrettable incident occurred, this Foreign 
Ministry was informed by the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador about 
the case and at the same time was promised that Maj. Lopez would 
be subject to U.S. laws," explained the minister. 
  At the same time, he said the Foreign Ministry has asked the 
U.S. Embassy for "a report on emigration procedures surrounding 
Maj. Lopez's departure from the country, as well as for the date 
when the legal process will begin, information on the court that 
will hear the case, and details of penalties established by U.S. 
laws for crimes like this, in the event that he is found 
guilty." [passage omitted] 
  For his part, Dr. Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, president of 
the 
Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ], said that an investigation will 
be undertaken into whether the Foreign Ministry committed a 
crime in this case. 
  Upon his return from Brazil, where he participated in a 
meeting of the OAS legal committee, Gutierrez Castro explained 
that the Foreign Ministry's actions must be investigated by the 
judge charged with investigating the crime. 
  "If what is stated in a U.S. Embassy communique, which 
explains that the Foreign Ministry gave permission, is true, we 
could be dealing with a crime committed by a state branch," 
stressed the Supreme Court justice. 
  He explained that the officer has diplomatic immunity, in 
accordance with which the Embassy should notify the Foreign 
Ministry of the fact, and the Foreign Ministry, for its part, 
should then notify the judge in charge of the case so that the 
CSJ could invoke treaties regarding diplomatic immunity. 
  "This accomplished, Mr. Lopez could have left the country 
through the corresponding legal borders, thus observing the laws 
of the Republic," asserted the president of the CSJ. 
  Furthermore, Dr. Gutierrez said that over the last few years 
the country has been "excessively" generous in granting 
immunity, even to people who are connected with embassies or 
international organizations but who should really not enjoy that 
privilege. 
  Gutierrez Castro said that it is the duty of the executive 
branch to submit a protest to the U.S. Government and urged 
candidates in the upcoming elections to defend national 
sovereignty. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The president of the Republic has issued an 
ultimatum to the businessmen of the National Transportation 
Coordinator, the umbrella organization under which heavy cargo 
transport and transportation of passengers outside urban areas 
is grouped. 
  [Begin recording, in progress] [De Leon] ...no deadline. We 
are announcing the government's position, which must be heeded. 
We are not proposing -- we are announcing the decision of the 
Council of Ministers. This is our position, and this is the 
position they will have to deal with. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] This is due to ongoing illegalities. The fact 
[words indistinct] our situation, that we announce the 
government's position, the policy set by the government of the 
Republic, does not mean that no illegal actions are taking place 
with consequences that, in some cases, range from misdemeanors 
to crimes. Therefore, we have asked the Attorney General's 
Office to participate, but at this moment, we are stating the 
position of the government of the Republic. We are not setting 
a deadline but responding to the interests of the people of 
Guatemala. [end recording] 
  You have heard President of the Republic Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio, who said that if the businessmen do not sit down at the 
negotiations table today and accept the government's only 
proposal, it will be necessary to send security forces to guard 
the transportation of heavy cargo and provide transportation 
services to the population.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today offered a 10-percent 
adjustment of fuel transportation tariffs to end the strike that 
businessmen in that sector began on 1 February. De Leon 
demanded that the National Transportation Coordination Board 
(CNT) lift the strike, warning them that otherwise he would have 
to open up the fuel transportation business in order to 
eliminate the monopoly. At a news conference at the Presidency, 
De Leon said that the government's final position is to grant a 
10 percent adjustment to current tariffs and 0.5 centavo of a 
quetzal per gallon of fuel transported as insurance. 
  The CNT has not replied to the president's offer, who said 
that transportation businessmen must "accept today" the decision 
of the Economic Cabinet. 
  "I urge businessmen to end the strike immediately; 
otherwise, 
we will take" drastic "action," de Leon stressed. De Leon said 
that the strike called by the transportation businessmen is 
illegal, as they abandoned a dialogue with a high-level 
government commission. 
  He added that the Attorney General's Office has been 
instructed to initiate legal action against the businessmen 
because they are disrupting public order by creating a fuel 
shortage. "The government will not tolerate illegalities from 
the businessmen, as they have already caused too much harm in 
addition to encouraging a strong feeling of uncertainty among 
the people," the president warned.

Transportation Coordination Board in Guatemala City on 2 
February; broadcast in progress; from the "News Patrol" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] ...the National Transportation Coordination 
Board, in reply to the proposal made by the president today, and 
as a goodwill gesture with the sole goal of not hurting the 
Guatemalan people despite the indifference of government 
officials, reports the following: 
  A. We agree to [word indistinct] of the value of the freight 
value in the adjustment of current fuel transportation rates 
plus 0.5 quetzals per gallon considered as part of the insurance 
expenses for that freight [words indistinct]. 
  B. Rates for cement transportation should be established at 
87 percent of the 13.5 percent established by ministerial 
agreement dated 1-90 of 24 May 1990 issued by the Ministry of 
Communications, Transportation, and Public Works, forcing the 
issuance of the respective ministerial agreement. 
  The president must immediately sign the following government 
agreements: 
  1. Extra-urban passenger transportation. 
  2. Ground transportation of cargo equipment in the country 
[words indistinct] shipping companies. 
  3. Definition of the correct interpretation of Articles 61 
and 64 of the Income Tax Law, decree number... [break in relay] 
  [Announcer] We have lost the signal we were receiving via 
radio. We will try to restore it in a few minutes, because 
there seems to be a ray of hope that in the next few hours this 
problem that is already exerting heavy pressure on the people 
will be settled. Thus, we call on Jorge Celis to reestablish 
contact, to perhaps start this report over again, because it is 
interesting news. Here at our news center we are duty-bound to 
bring news to all parties involved in the problem and to report 
the information as it happens. [passage omitted] 
  Donald Gonzalez has contacted us from another location. 
  [Begin relay] ...government intention to intimidate the 
businessmen of the country's organized transportation sector, by 
this means we urge the human rights ombudsman and the 
metropolitan archbishop to be on call should this organization 
or its members deem this necessary at any given time. 
  We clarify this because at no time have or will commercial 
organizations and businesses represented by this national group 
participated in acts violating the law. The principle of 
freedom of industries and commerce entitles us to make our own 
decisions in our activities. We know, we are sure that we can 
work for our country's development as long as government 
officials fulfill their obligations and meet the people's 
demands. We are also the people. Article 43 of the Republic's 
Constitution. [as heard] 
  Based on the aforementioned, the National Transportation 
Coordination Board, in reply to the proposal made by the 
president today, and as a goodwill gesture with the sole goal of 
not hurting the Guatemalan people despite the indifference of 
government officials, reports the following: 
  A. We agree to [word indistinct] of the value of the freight 
value in the adjustment of current fuel transportation rates 
plus 0.5 quetzals per gallon considered as part of the insurance 
expenses for that freight [words indistinct]. 
  B. Rates for cement transportation should be established at 
87 percent of the 13.5 percent established by ministerial 
agreement dated 1-90 of 24 May 1990 issued by the Ministry of 
Communications, Transportation, and Public Works, forcing the 
issuance of the respective ministerial agreement. 
  The president must immediately sign the following government 
agreements: 
  1. Extra-urban passenger transportation. 
  2. Ground transportation of cargo equipment in the country 
[words indistinct] shipping companies. 
  3. Definition of the correct interpretation of Articles 61 
and 64 of the Income Tax Law, decree number 26-92 of the 
Congress of the Republic to the effect that transportation 
companies that issue receipts authorized by the General Internal 
Revenues Directorate are not subject to the 4 percent 
withholding under the category of professional service. 
  4. Order and control of work 24 hours a day by customs and 
immigration officials at national borders and ports. 
  5. We clarify that we do not reject liberalization of 
heavy transportation because freight transportation in the 
country is regulated by commercial contracts signed by mutual 
agreement among the interested parties. Thus we ask the 
president to try not to confuse public opinion. Moreover, as a 
private sector that provides work for more than 30,000 families 
throughout the country, we are not interested in more state 
controls on transportation activities. 
  6. We want history books to record that the current 
conflict reached the magnitude it has today because during the 
past seven months of government, state officials closed the 
doors on the country's organized transportation sector. We do 
not have political interests. We never stop being and thinking 
as an integral part of the Guatemalan people, and, as such, we 
continue to demand solution of our problems and those of any 
other segment of the population as long as inefficiency persists 
in the decisionmaking process, because they stop making such 
decisions at certain times. [as heard] 
  This group continues to be open to dialogue and negotiation 
with the sole purpose of finding solutions to national problems 
together. [end relay]

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Guatemalan Defense Minister </F>
General Mario Enriquez with unidentified reporters; place and 
date not given; from the "Telepress" newscast] 
  [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez referred to 
the U.S. State Department's report on human rights in Guatemala. 
  [Begin recording] [Enriquez] The president of the Republic 
must defend the government. As a staunch defender of human 
rights, he would not like to hear that there have been 
violations of those rights during his presidential term. 
Unfortunately, there have been a few cases during the six or 
seven months since he assumed power. 
  Those are the cases mentioned by the State Department. This 
was not a report but a statement expressing its position with 
regard to the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC]. That 
position is well-known in Guatemala and has resulted in 
significant reduction in the number of voluntary patrols. Right 
now only 40 percent of those patrols still exist, most of them 
in the Departments of Huehuetenango, El Quiche, and Alta 
Verapaz, where subversive groups are still present, which is the 
why those patrols were created. The president of the Republic 
has explained all that. 
  In addition, during a visit to the United States at the 
invitation of General Sullivan, chief of staff of the U.S. Armed 
Forces [title as heard], I met with representatives of various 
nongovernmental human rights organizations and State Department 
officials. I also visited the Pentagon for the first time. I 
must say that during my meetings with nongovernmental 
organizations, representatives from [words indistinct], Americas 
Watch, Attorneys for Human Rights, including (Jennifer Harbury), 
they were very sincere and broadminded about our situation. 
  I believe the government should also try to continue this 
kind of communication, because many countries know only one side 
of the story. 
  [Reporter] The State Department's report said that the 
members of the Armed Forces, PAC, and the National Police are 
the ones conducting these actions, including a majority of 
extrajudicial executions. Do you agree or disagree? 
  [Enriquez] I agree, to a certain extent, because we cannot 
deny that there have been some actions by PAC, for example the 
case in Colotenango, which fortunately is already being handled 
by the court. There have been other cases, like the regrettable 
case of Jorge Carpio Nicole. Although those responsible have 
not been fully identified, we strongly condemn these actions, 
which should not occur in Guatemala. There have also been cases 
of military policemen involved in bank holdups and national 
policemen who have made mistakes. 
  There really have been very few violations of human rights 
in 
the past year. What has increased is the number of cases 
reported. I believe 13,000 cases were reported, but there is no 
evidence in these. We are aware of the situation. 
  We deeply regret the case of Jorge Carpio Nicole; we want to 
find out who was responsible, so the weight of the law will fall 
on the culprits. We suspect this was done the [word indistinct] 
because they have killed many people. There are still many 
doubts, but we believe the case will be resolved. The case of 
the PAC in Colotenango has already been settled. 
  Now that the human rights meeting in Geneva is coming up, 
some groups are trying to revive cases that occurred in 1989-92. 
But the truth is that there has been significant progress in 
Guatemala with regard to respect for human and individual and 
political rights. Now there is more awareness of the people's 
social and economic rights, but this will take time, and 
violations will cease as Guatemalans' standard of living 
improves. It will not be easy. 
  The police, the Army, the government, the PAC are the ones 
usually accused because in the opinion of many statesmen and 
according to, let's say, ideas held in common all over the 
world, only the state can violate human rights because it is the 
guarantor, it is responsible for guaranteeing respect for human 
rights. 
  But at the last two meetings in Geneva the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity] was also condemned because blowing 
up electricity towers is indeed a human rights violation, 
blowing up bridges is indeed a human rights violation. That is 
sheer ingratitude; this is a poor country with many 
infrastructural needs, and they carry out those attacks to the 
detriment of the right to free movement and against life, by 
preventing the supply of electrical energy. I know of the 
problems and the torment the hospitals ensure with those sudden 
blackouts, during which some people have even died. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Cox] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 1 Feb, CANA -- Banana 
producers among borrowing member countries (BMCs) of the 
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) may be in line for some 
financial assistance to improve their competitiveness, according 
to CDB vice-president in charge of operations, Marius St Rose. 
  St Rose, speaking Tuesday at a news conference at the 
Barbados-based regional institution, said a programme is being 
developed to improve the competitiveness of the banana industry 
to ensure continued access to vital markets. 
  The vice-president said the CDB was considering a 160 
million dollar (one EC dollar; 37 cents US) support programme, 
to be pursued over a three to four-year period. The intention 
is to improve the quality of bananas and reduce the cost of 
production by about 20 to 25 per cent. 
  "As it now stands," St Rose said, "even though the Windward 
Islands have ... preferential access (to the European market), 
they are one of the highest cost producers and if something is 
not done to reduce those costs, they are going to lose the 
market." 
  As far as the CDB is concerned, the cost reduction should 
occur at three levels: the level of the farmer, the level of 
the growers' association, and the level of the distributor. 
  At present, for each dollar earned from bananas, the farmer 
gets about 30 cents, the association gets about 30 to 35 cents, 
and the distributor, Geest Industries, gets another 35 cents. 
  St Rose told reporters governments of the Windward Islands 
met last Saturday to discuss the programme. The European Union 
is expected to join CDB in financing the proposed programme. 
  This comes at a time when the Caribbean banana industry is 
adversely affected by a number of factors, principal among which 
is the depreciation of the pound sterling. 
  Moreover, as CDB President Sir Neville Nicholls pointed out, 
"uncertainty about the future deepened as a result of 
significant changes in the arrangements for marketing caribbean 
bananas in the European Union." 
  Sir Neville said this uncertainty had induced strong 
competition through increased access for lower-cost Latin 
American or dollar area bananas. He added it would eventually 
result in the phasing out of preferential access to Europe for 
the banana-producing countries in the Caribbean, Africa and the 
Pacific.

  [Text] Given the voluntary abstentions by President Firmin 
Jean-Louis and Vice President Serge Joseph, the ad hoc office of 
the Senate, formed in compliance with the Constitution and the 
internal rules of the Senate, hastens to inform the concerned 
institutions and the entire Haitian nation that since Tuesday,

  [Excerpts] Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the 
Senate, met with the press on 1 February about the crisis 
situation that is shaking the Senate. Jean-Louis denounced 
occupation of the Senate seats by the 18 January 
parliamentarians, protesting that their presence in the Upper 
Chamber is prejudicial to its proper functioning. The following 
is a report by Daly Valet. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Whereas everybody would 
like to see the national institutions become strong so they can 
work to resolve all the problems caused the country by the 30 
hurricane [as heard]. The Senate of the Republic finds itself in 
a garden full of bears without the prospect of a solution. 
Before that, there was the phenomenon of abnormality. Then there 
was the August 1993 normalization that allowed the election of 
Firmin Jean-Louis as Senate President and the ratification of 
Robert Malval as prime minister. Today, what is being observed 
is denormalization. All the changes in the Senate office have 
failed. The cause of all these problems is the 18 January 
parliamentarians who many legitimate parliamentarians consider a 
blight bequeathed to the country by the de facto Marc Bazin 
government. According to some senators, Bazin, who was in charge 
of resolving the country's crisis, further complicated it with 
the 18 January elections. The crisis has recently reached a new 
turning point with the ad hoc office set up by Ebrane Cadet, 
which parallels the office of Firmin Jean-Louis. This office 
includes some 18 January parliamentarians. What is being done in 
the Senate is illegal; there are no sessions; the 18 January 
parliamentarians have occupied the Senate. This is a statement 
by Firmin Jean-Louis, who added that Sen. Ebrane Cadet has 
assured him that there is no second office in the Senate. 
  [Jean-Louis] The places have been occupied by the 
controversial 18 January parliamentarians. The seats have been 
filled by Sen. Cadet who pretends to be conducting sessions. But 
he has told me in letters he has written me and in all his 
contacts with me that there is only one office, the one presided 
over by us. The senator himself said so. [passage omitted] 
  [Valet] What is being said and what is being done are two 
different things. Everybody can see that the ad hoc office of 
Ebrane Cadet, which is occupied by the 18 January 
parliamentarians, is gaining ground in the Senate. They voted 
resolutions, are preparing other resolution projects, are making 
statement after statement, and are holding meetings after 
meetings. Firmin Jean-Louis protested and stated that this de 
facto situation has blocked the Senate in its constitutional 
work. [passage omitted] 
  As for the question of parliament's dissolution, the Senate 
president said he does not take this matter seriously. The 
senator said the parliament could be dissolved only by another 
coup d'etat or if the men, the powerful men, decided to kill all 
parliamentarians. [passage omitted] 
  We must inform you that while the 18 January 
parliamentarians 
occupy the session room of the Senate with Ebrane Cadet and 
other Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion parliamentarians, 
Firmin Jean-Louis holds formal meetings in his office. located 
at the former premises of the National Office of Tourism from 
time to time with the other senators who remain faithful to him.

  [Text] Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton objects to charges 
implicating him in the murder of businessman Antoine Izmery. The 
legislator has asked the people in charge of the civilian 
mission in Haiti for clarification of the article in the weekly 
magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, which quotes the United Nations [UN] 
regarding this case: 
  [Begin recording] [Dupiton] Everytime there is a question of 
change in the Senate of the Republic, these kinds of attacks 
arise against Sen. Dupiton. However, this case arises at the 
right time. This is going to show you on what level these people 
who are acting can benefit from the complicity of the 
international community. Since it was published about a month 
ago, the UN must have known that something was published in 
JEUNE AFRIQUE mentioning a UN report. It was only yesterday that 
I saw this article. That is perhaps why reactions came from the 
Senate. But the UN was aware of this. It has even been said that 
articles were commissioned and that these gentlemen distributed 
those articles. I am speaking of those who have an interest in 
disseminating this message. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think it is a plot against 
you? 
  [Dupiton] It is a huge plot, not only against me, but 
against 
the country, since the police have been put into action. If the 
police do their work, they must, based on this UN report, 
investigate the matter, if the UN sources are verified. It is 
therefore a huge plot against the institutions in charge of this 
country. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. It should be 
pointed out that according to the article in the weekly 
magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, Sen. Dupiton had taken in the murderers 
of Antoine Izmery on the eve of the 18 September crime.

  [Text] The leader of PANPRA [National, Progressive 
Revolutionary Party of Haiti] Serge Gilles reiterated his 
opposition to the worsening of the sanctions against Haiti. 
  Serge Gilles today expressed opposition to the sanctions on 
Haiti in the form of a total embargo, said that he considered it 
an erroneous approach by the international community that will 
only aggravate the sufferings of the people. In a statement to 
the Agence France-Presse, Gilles pointed out that based on what 
he saw within the country, the suffering of the people was 
increasing dramatically. 
  The embargo did not create the structural misery in Haiti, 
he 
said, but it has multiplied this misery six or seven times. The 
increase in the rate of child mortality and the destruction of 
production capacity are palpable facts, Serge Gilles pointed 
out, adding that those who are motivated by those sanctions are 
doing well at the expense of the people. Mr. Gilles advocated 
the search for a consensus through a national conference, 
excluding no one, with a view toward forming first a government 
of national concord. 
  It should be recalled, according to some independent 
humanitarian religious sources, that the embargo against Haiti, 
imposed in October 1991, has caused the deaths of more than 
10,000 people in vulnerable groups, mostly children and the 
elderly.

  [Text] The first meeting between employers and unions took 
place on 1 February. Nothing has leaked out of this meeting, but 
the topics to be discussed were the following: salaries, 
employees, and a final solution to the crisis. The members of 
the private sector who had participated in this meeting said the 
discussions were constructive. Bernard Craan reaffirmed that the 
objective of the movement by employers' associations is the 
lifting of the embargo. 
  [Begin recording] I believe that what we employers are doing 
is a rational step. We are just expressing our exasperation, and 
saying aloud what everybody has been saying in a quiet voice. It 
is time for the protagonists of this crisis to sit, think, and 
find the solution the country needs so this embargo can 
eventually be lifted and so we can again begin working normally 
toward the establishment of a fair society and a state of order. 
  I think I am just saying what everybody else is thinking. I 
do not see why I should be afraid. We have made contact, we keep 
making contact, but the results of thr contacts cannot be 
disclosed until they have been completed. We cannot unveil our 
strategy and say what we are going to do and how we are going to 
do it. It would be thoughtless on our part. [end recording] 
  It should be recalled that a second meeting between the 
employers' sector and the labor union sector is scheduled for 
today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister-designate Alvaro Garcia by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given, passage within 
quotes are editorial commentary] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [ESTRATEGIA] [Former Economy 
Ministers] Carlos Ominami and Jorge Marshall maintained 
excellent relations with President Patricio Aylwin. How would 
you define your relationship with Eduardo Frei? 
  [Garcia] It is very good, I greatly admire the 
president-elect... 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe your appointment was decided by 
the president alone or do you think partisan interests were 
considered? 
  [Garcia] I have no doubt I was elected by the president, but 
I also enjoy my party's support. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] You are one of the youngest and most handsome 
members of the cabinet. What other virtue do you think will 
help you do your job as minister? 
  [Garcia] I do now want to discuss my own virtues because 
this 
is for others to do, but I would like to talk about what I want 
to do "he says calmly and with a smile on his face which becomes 
more serious when he refers to his tasks in the ministry." From 
the economic viewpoint, Chile's great challenge lies in 
constantly increasing its competitivity, which is linked to two 
great aspects: increased productivity and increased quality of 
the productive apparatus. Chileans have become aware that these 
two issues are essential if we are to continue to grow 
successfully. This overall consensus has not resulted yet in 
specific working agreements or in a joint action of public and 
private sectors, or in the private sector itself. I want the 
Economy Ministry to reach these agreements and implement them. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In this sense, do you think the Economy 
Ministry 
has failed to do its job? 
  [Garcia] No, on the contrary; I believe the ground rules 
have 
been set for a sound relationship between the Economy Ministry 
and the private sector that now allow them to work jointly. 
  This formal dialogue is carried out through the 
institutional 
channels that have been created. The economy minister presides 
over the Committee for the Participation of the Private Sector 
in International Economic Relations [Comite de Participacion del 
Sector Privado Para las Relaciones Economicas Internacionales], 
which groups the main business and labor union leaders. These 
subjects have been placed on the agenda of the public as well as 
the private sectors. Therefore, an effort is being made to step 
up and continue a task that has already been started. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Taking this into account, what short-term plans 
do you have in mind? 
  [Garcia] The main objective is to make progress jointly -- 
businessmen and workers -- to draft an agenda of concrete tasks 
that will make global agreements possible. I want this to be a 
joint effort so the agenda must also be drafted jointly. I have 
some ideas in mind but, above all, I want to discuss them and 
reach agreement with business and labor union leaders. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Have you started making the contacts? 
  [Garcia] I have been talking with them but we will really 
get 
down to work when I assume as economy minister. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What do you think about the role of businessmen 
and workers during the current administration? 
  [Garcia] Incredibly positive. In a very brief period of time 
a climate of dialogue that never existed in our country has been 
established between the government, businessmen, and workers. 
  Confrontations used to be characteristic of the relationship 
between these sectors. During these past four years a method to 
define public policies has been established and the challenges 
that have surfaced have been tackled jointly. All involved 
sectors have revealed a national spirit that has allowed the 
country to grow; all sectors have revealed a great commitment 
with the country, not just with their sector, which must be 
maintained because that is their social duty which they assumed 
with great dignity. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Within this context do you believe the policy 
of 
consensus must be maintained? 
  [Garcia] Absolutely...! 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think this is why the government has 
criticized for its "lack of audacity." 
  [Garcia] I do not agree there has been a lack of audacity. 
On the contrary, I believe it was very audacious to progress on 
the path of consensus. It was very audacious because it was 
very new and needed great willpower. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What challenges will the country have to face 
in the macroeconomic field given the scope of the scheduled work? 
  [Garcia] Our most important effort will be to stay on the 
present path. Conditions are right for the economy to grow at a 
stable pace of 6 percent, and current investment levels make us 
believe this is possible in the long term. We need only 
continue to encourage savings and we will finance all our 
domestic investments. 
  The path we have chosen -- the gradual reduction of 
inflation 
-- will assure a more stable process and, therefore, our 
challenge is to continue the program. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think estimates for 1994 on growth and 
inflation rates are correct? 
  [Garcia] Yes. We should expect growth rates of between 4 and 
5 percent and inflation slightly lower than last year. However, 
it is important for the country to be aware that the development 
path we have chosen -- which has yielded great results -- also 
increases the influence of the world economy on Chile's economy. 
Therefore, it is not possible to make economic evolution 
projections solely based on local conditions. 
  There are signs of a recovery in the world economy, which is 
promising for our economy, but I do not think the process is 
definite. My impression is that 1994 will still be a year of 
slow international growth. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Would you say we should be optimistic or 
cautious during 1994? 
  [Garcia] I would say we must face the year with austerity. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In your opinion, will Chile reach single digit 
inflation rate during the next few years? 
  [Garcia] We must try to reduce inflation to one digit. 
Conditions are right. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] During the presidential campaign, [Copper 
Corporation, CODELCO, executive president] Juan Villarzu's 
proposals were considered more liberal than those of Minister 
Alejandro Foxley. Whose proposals do you think are closer to 
your way of thinking? 
  [Garcia] I was not aware there were differences. I do not 
know in what areas... 
  [ESTRATEGIA] For instance, regarding capital accounts, 
privatization, foreign exchange policy... 
  [Garcia] Minister Foxley encouraged the opening of capital 
accounts and this is currently paving the way. I have no doubt 
that Villarzu, Foxley, and the entire coalition agree that the 
opening of capital accounts is a crucial factor in our export 
development. 
  Chile has a potential offer of services in the international 
arena. To materialize this offer we must open capital accounts. 
One of the usual hurdles in the commerce of goods has been the 
lack of follow up by the financial sector. We all agree on the 
absolute need to advance this opening process. We have defined 
a path that passes through the normalization of national 
capitals market, particularly the banking system which has 
sponsored this process. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] But critics speak against the current 
government's gradualism. 
  [Garcia] Speaking about the capital market, in the past few 
days we have seen a Minister Foxley rather annoyed by the 
slowness of the process that he is trying to speed up. It 
obviously does not depend on the willingness of the Executive 
Branch because the bill has been in Congress for more than a 
year now. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What is your position regarding privatizations? 
  [Garcia] We discussed the issue at length inside the 
coalition. The important aspect of our position is that we do 
not have a set criteria as to whether privatizations are good or 
bad. Public companies must be efficient and competitive in 
order to fulfill their social function. If they are not, there 
is no reason why they should continue as public companies. To 
advance the privatization process, however, it is essential to 
create the mechanisms to ensure the preservation of the common 
good in areas where -- some times -- competition does not 
operate effectively. When privatizing companies in certain 
productive areas it is essential to create regulating mechanisms. 
  Perhaps the most important part of our proposal is that no 
area should be off-limits for private initiative. On the 
contrary, we must do the utmost to encourage investments in 
areas that are traditionally public -- particularly in the field 
of infrastructure. For instance, the president-elect has said 
that all new investments in the ports will come from the private 
sector. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Does it mean then that the issue of 
privatizations is more an economic than a political issue? 
  [Garcia] Absolutely. We are not politically prejudiced about 
the issue. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Do you believe a public company that is not 
administered well should be privatized? 
  [Garcia] We should consider privatizing inefficient 
companies. Sometimes it is a better to rationalize a company 
than to sell it. But continuous inefficiency is a very good 
reason for privatization. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What companies do you think should be 
transferred to the private sector? 
  [Garcia] I do not have any in mind right now. I could not 
mention a specific company. But we have agreed on certain 
criteria. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What about Codelco? Why is there so much fear 
about discussing it? 
  [Garcia] There are two good reasons why the company should 
stay in state hands. First, the state can provide a broad field 
for possible progress in the areas of efficiency and 
rationalization; and second, the company has a great 
macroeconomic importance. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] We have noticed a certain disorder in the 
administration of trade agreements during this government. What 
will be the role of the Economy Ministry during your 
administration? 
  [Garcia] I would not characterize it as disorder. The 
economic opening is an objective for national development, and 
commercial agreements constitute one of the mechanisms to 
advance in that direction. It is, therefore, necessary for the 
Finance, Foreign, and Economy Ministries to participate in this 
process because they have areas of concern that must be present 
in any discussions. 
  At the beginning of the year a formal organization was 
created -- the Participation Committee -- to call a national 
dialogue on this task. It is a mechanism that must continue. 
It is adequately facing its tasks. Besides, the participation 
of these three ministers converge in this area. I know [Foreign 
Ministry foreign debt negotiator] Eduardo Aninat and [Foreign 
Minister-designate] Carlos Figueroa quite well and I have no 
doubt whatsoever that we will constitute a good working team to 
perform this task. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Considering the progress achieved lately, what 
must be the objectives of Chile's international economic 
relations during Eduardo Frei's administration? 
  [Garcia] We will try to continue to increase Chile's 
presence 
in international markets. There are areas, particularly the 
Asia- Pacific region, where Chile has great development 
potential. We will also seek to strengthen our presence in our 
traditional markets -- the United States, Japan, and the EC -- 
and to continue to work on market liberalization, a task that 
must be maintained. 
  This is one of the challenges ahead of us. It requires the 
active participation of everyone, that is, the government and 
the private sector.

  [Excerpt] A Chilean merchant ship sailed to the Malvinas, 
or Falklands, Islands for the first time. 
  The ship Cordillera was transporting a 180-metric ton cargo 
bound for Punta Arenas, according to maritime sources. The 
sources added that the ship sailed to the Malvinas after 
receiving a call for services on its way to Chile from Brazil. 
  The Cordillera belongs to the shipping company Asmares 
Naviera Chilena. 
  At the Falklands, called Malvinas by Argentina, it loaded 48 
container-type prefabricated houses, three containers, one 
truck, one backhoe, and a reservoir. The sources also noted 
that the ship sailed through the British islands only by chance.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish on 26 
January, on page A2, carries a 600-word article by Rafael Rey 
Rey entitled "The Mote in Another's Eye," referring to the 
recent visit by the U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American 
affairs, Alexander Watson. 
  The commentary states that although the U.S. delegation had 
to admit the progress made by Peru during the past few years in 
various fields, it still let Peru know that the U.S. Government 
and Congress "are still concerned and closely watching Peruvian 
developments and have recommendations to make in the human 
rights field." 
  It then goes on to say that it would be a good thing if 
these 
recommendations were directed to the human rights of the victims 
of terrorism, the unemployed, the homeless, the hungry, and the 
uneducated, but that unfortunately there are only 180 alleged 
cases of torture reported by an unknown organization for the 
defense of human rights. 
  Rey then rejects the so-called human rights defense 
institutions that only damage the country's image with their 
"distorted" reports, and notes that the members of the Peruvian 
leftist, Marxist, and socialists sectors, as well as opposition 
members, who used to greet U.S. representatives with insults in 
the past now enthusiastically applaud the U.S. recommendations. 
  After explaining that a U.S. delegation member was unable to 
say with what moral authority the United States, with numerous 
cases of human rights violations, made recommendations on human 
rights, the article ends by stating that if the U.S. Government 
and Congress fail to acknowledge Peru's achievements after this 
visit, it is time for Peru to clearly tell the United States 
that, although it appreciates its aid and cooperation, it is no 
longer willing to be humiliated. 
  Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 26 January, on page A26, carries 
a 
1,100-word "commentary" by Federico Prieto Celi entitled "One 
Should Not Wash One's Dirty Linen in Public," also referring to 
Watson's visit. 
  The article comments that the visit has revealed that those 
who followed Moscow in the past now are siding with Washington's 
reports on the Peruvian Government's alleged shortcomings before 
another government as if Peru were its subordinate. 
  The commentary says Washington has gained courage with the 
USSR's downfall and feels entitled to tell Peru how to behave 
when the United States itself has serious human rights problems. 
The "commentary" notes that in democracy each country should 
solve its own problems with its own tools, and that those who 
"talk about dependency and domination are not valid 
interlocutors to tell Washington today what they told Moscow 
yesterday about what the Lima Government should be." 
  The "commentary" ends by stating that democracy is not a 
product the United States exports, and that Peruvians should 
calmly realize that the national problems and solutions do not 
come from abroad but rather from their own roots, their current 
challenges, and the democratic will of the people.

<F P=106> [Inaugural speech by Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera at </F>
the Congress of the Republic in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] President and Vice President of the Congress; 
President of the Supreme Court of Justice; Your Eminence 
Cardinal Jose Ali Lebrun, Archbishop of Caracas; Prosecutor 
General; President and members of the Supreme Electoral Council; 
President and Magistrates of the Judiciary Council; former 
President of the Republic; Ministers of the Executive Cabinet; 
Governor of the Federal District; Comptroller General; Attorney 
General; Your Excellency and Most Reverend Apostolic Nuncio, 
dean of the diplomatic corps; ambassadors; charges d'affaires 
and international organizations delegates; officers and 
admirals, members of the High Military Command; Governors; 
Mayors of metropolitan areas; presidents and directors of the 
national academies; rectors of the national universities; 
directors general of the executive offices; presidents of 
autonomous institutions and state enterprises; delegates of the 
media; Senators; Deputies; people of Venezuela: 
  As the homeland's distinguished citizens used to do in the 
past, I am assuming the office of the Presidency of the 
Republic, invoking God Almighty, in whose name I have sworn to 
obey and enforce the Constitution and bylaws. I hereby greet the 
heads and members of the other branches of the government, 
particularly the Legislative and Judicial Branches, with which I 
aspire to hold the best possible relations within the framework 
of the consideration that each of them deserves, and I pledge to 
cooperate with them in the fulfillment of the state's goals as 
stipulated by the Constitution. I hereby greet the state and 
municipal authorities elected by the people -- authorities who 
operate autonomously. I hope that, as part of the spirit of 
decentralization that has prevailed in the recent past, we will 
be able to do the joint work for which the people hope -- work 
aimed at resolving the country's problems and meeting the needs 
and aspirations of the Venezuelan people in general. 
  I hereby greet the various sectors of civilian society, 
whose 
importance is acknowledged more and more and whose understanding 
with the public sector is essential to the people's general 
well-being. I greet the religious authorities, workers, and 
entrepreneurs. I greet the men and women, Venezuelan and 
otherwise, who live in our territory, particularly the young 
people, who are the objects of my concern and hope and whom I 
hope to have in mind at all times in the government's plans and 
activities. 
  I greet the Armed Forces, an essential factor in preserving 
the democratic system and the country's development. I pledge 
to virtuously carry out the important constitutional function of 
being their Commander in Chief with a sense of justice and a 
permanent concern for their professional and technical progress, 
as well as their material improvement. In a particularly 
respectful manner, I greet Your Eminence the Cardinal, 
Archbishop of Caracas, and representative of the Catholic 
Church, to which the majority of the Venezuelan people belong. 
  Greetings to all of Venezuela's inhabitants. I begin my 
administration at a serious and complex moment. We are 
suffering the effects of a deep crisis, which began 20 years 
ago, paradoxically when the price of our main product, oil, was 
the fairest. This brought in an avalanche of money that 
mistakenly made us believe that we were very rich. This 
illusion of richness forced us to commit endless mistakes. From 
that time onward we began living a misguided process of chaos 
and disorder that produced widespread moral decline which lately 
has caused such a state of affairs that to overcome our problems 
we will need an intense national effort of solidarity. 
  President Ramon J. Velasquez, an illustrious Venezuelan who 
accepted the difficult task of leading the country into a 
political transition via an electoral process, has completed a 
job of historic proportions. No matter what the opinions may be 
about certain aspects of his administration, he deserves the 
recognition of his fellow citizens because he cannot be blamed 
for the state of affairs he dramatically outlined in his 
impressive speech of 28 January. 
  In the name of all Venezuelans I want to express to him, 
during this solemn moment, my deepest and sincerest gratitude. 
President Velasquez was the exception to the traditional change 
of office ceremony in which an outgoing president claims 
everything is fine and an incoming president stresses the awful 
aspects of the situation. In this case, the same person who, 
after listing his administration's positive deeds, felt the need 
to bare his conscience as a patriot and historian to put on 
record the very harsh reality he encountered and has turned over. 
  Exactly 20 years ago -- albiet, less one month and 10 days 
-- 
I transferred the administration I presided over between 1969 
and 1974 to the man who was elected by the people to succeed me. 
I handed over an orderly country in peace and with a fiscal 
surplus. I cannot be like singer Carlos Gardel, who once said: 
20 years is nothing! No, no way. These 20 years have been 
profound, and they have greatly influenced our country's life -- 
for good and for bad. Even through there are events that are 
unquestionably good, events have also occurred that are 
decidedly bad -- events that have threatened the very democratic 
institution that cost so many Venezuelans so much effort, so 
many struggles, and so much suffering. 
  Venezuela today is a very different country from the one I 
handed over 20 years ago. The population has, of course, 
increased substantially. From 12 million inhabitants, it has 
increased to more than 20 million by the end of 1993. The birth 
rate has diminished reasonably from 3.47 percent to 2.99 
percent, which is still high compared to more developed 
countries. Life expectancy has increased, thereby increasing 
the number of people over the age of 15, which at that time 
represented more than 52 percent of the population, to some 58 
or 59 percent. The urban population, which was 73 percent, is 
now 84 percent, which highlights the very serious duty we have 
to slum dwellers in the large cities. 
  Economic figures have undergone astronomical changes. The 
budget has gone from 14 billion bolivares to 1.4 trillion 
bolivares -- a figure which, despite the devaluation of our 
currency, represents three times the previous figure in real 
terms of U.S. dollars. 
  The GNP has increased by more than 50 percent, but per 
capita income and real salaries have dropped. The inflation 
rate, which was 5 percent, is now more than 40 percent. The 
foreign debt, which was $3 billion, is now more than $30 
billion. Unemployment has grown from 6 to 12 percent, and these 
figures could be misleading if we do not take into consideration 
that 40 percent of the active population functions within the 
underground economy. 
  The housing deficit is overwhelming. Public services have 
deteriorated. The cost of living is suffocating the middle 
class and the poor. The cost of borrowing has climbed 
dreadfully, and high interest rates are making it impossible for 
producers to ask for loans. 
  The agricultural sector was on the verge of collapse, but it 
is fair to commend the work carried out by the Velasquez 
administration and its agriculture minister, Hiram Gaviria. 
  Industrialists who were not prepared to compete in open 
markets are suffering the inevitable consequences of the sudden 
opening to foreign competition. 
  The value of the Venezuelan currency, which carries the name 
of our liberator and that used to be a symbol of stability, has 
dropped twenty-fold, and its plunge is continuing. 
  The economic situation is the main concern of the government 
over which I will preside. It has to be the main concern of all 
the Venezuelans. 
  The country is suffering from stagflation: There is no 
economic growth, but there is a rampant increase in prices. The 
people know perfectly well this is a difficult situation and 
they know that miracles cannot be performed. 
  I did not promise miracles during my election campaign, and 
I 
cannot offer them today, but I can assure you this is what the 
people want from the government being inaugurated today -- to 
work tirelessly, honestly, and with interest in serving, and to 
face the terrible problems that have been created because of 
irresponsibility, inefficiency, and corruption in the past few 
years. 
  Some believe we should declare a state of emergency to face 
this crisis and implement a war economy. There are enough 
reasons for doing that. It is necessary, however, to use the 
methods offered by the de jure state, methods that are enhanced 
because all the sectors of the nation have expressed support for 
these methods. 
  Others have said, almost defiantly, there is no alternative 
but to impose, with rigid neoliberal orthodoxy, more dramatic 
adjustments that will yield, they think, fruits in the mid- or 
long term. They have forgotten that complex ties link the 
economic and social aspects and that if the latter disintegrates 
there will be no way of generating trust for attracting 
investments and for kindling economic dynamics in the short-, 
mid-, or long term. 
  I will be both optimistic and prudent. Faced with two 
radical options -- the populist and the neoliberal -- I resolve 
to seek a commitment of solidarity with emphasis on the social 
aspects. 
  I want to trust in the reasoning abilities of the country's 
economic sectors and in the understanding and support of the 
people. I hope the various sectors do not fail to listen to the 
desperate calls for putting short-term egotistical interests 
aside for the sake of the long-term solutions that common sense 
demands. 
  The objective of this solidarity commitment is to secure a 
competitive and modern economy in the framework of social 
solidarity, with the private sector serving as the engine of 
economic growth while assuming part of the social 
responsibilities that have rested until now on the state and the 
oil economy. 
  The essential points of this strategy are: 1) We will wage 
an all-out fight against inflation. 2) We will implement 
austere public spending to attain a balanced budget and break 
the inflationary inertia in the short- and mid-term, without 
restricting social concerns, to which I will give priority. We 
will begin by setting an example by way of drastic cuts at the 
Presidency, at my own military house, and in the secret budget. 
The 1994 budget will therefore be reduced, and we will seek to 
coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to avoid contradictions 
in the fight against inflation. 3) We will stress an open 
economy and competitiveness within the framework of reciprocity. 
4) We will implement economic stabilization programs aimed not 
only at large macroeconomic accounts, but also designed to take 
into account the basic needs of the Venezuelan family. 5) We 
will wage an all-out war against waste and corruption in all 
sectors of the economy, both in the public and private sectors. 
6) We will stress openess in the privatization processes 
required by the country's situation, as well as in measures that 
tend to democratize capital. 7) We will implement tax policies 
inspired by constitutional precepts, which I quote: The tax 
system will attempt to distribute the tax burden fairly 
according to the economic capacity of the taxpayer, taking into 
account the principle of progressive taxation, as well as 
protecting the national economy and raising the the people's 
standard of living. This is the Article 223 of the Constitution. 
  This tax policy means this: on one hand, an effective 
collection of taxes, and, on the other, an in-depth reform of 
tax laws so that those who have the greatest capacity to pay end 
up paying the most taxes. [applause] 
  Regarding tax collection, a report from the Comptroller 
General's Office dated January 1994 concerning the fiscal 
deficit and the budget includes this impressive statement, and I 
quote: Studies by the Treasury Ministry and the Central Bank of 
Venezuela, as well actions by the Comptroller's General's 
Office, enable us to estimate that there is tax evasion of 
approximately 70 percent in terms of tariffs, tax contributions, 
and fines, without taking into account the income from petroleum 
products and income tax on the oil industry, unquote. This tax 
evasion represents a huge amount of money lost because of 
inefficiency and corruption. My government will strongly and 
firmly fight these two maladies. I trust that the results will 
considerably reduce the fiscal deficit. 
  Regarding tax reforms, I must be very clear in the position 
I 
uphold. I said in my letter of intention to the Venezuelan 
people during the electoral campaign, and I quote: We must 
stress the need to reduce and realign spending, radically 
improve tax collection immediately, and implement tax reforms to 
increase income, as well as distribute taxation with a sense of 
fairness to ensure that those with the most income have the 
biggest burden. Likewise, the value-added tax, the VAT, will be 
suspended because it is an unfair burden on consumers with less 
income, unquote. [applause] 
  In line with this promise, as soon as the new government is 
installed, the finance minister will present to the legislative 
chambers the draft bills proposed by the executive branch on 
urgent tax reforms in an effort to immediately confront the 
difficult situation created by the fiscal deficit. For the time 
being, we will request the elimination of the VAT on consumers 
[applause], and we will propose a series of fiscal measures, 
such as a selective tax on wholesalers, a luxury tax, and 
substantial reforms to the income tax, all of which are aimed at 
modernizing public finances so that taxes yield more progressive 
and productive results. At the same time, we will substantially 
improve public spending effiency, which is a matter that cannot 
be postponed and has been made worse by the deterioration of the 
oil market. 
  One main objective of our economic policy is to change the 
old disguised-as-modern system that called for economic growth 
while propping itself on unrestrained public expenditures. 
  The state's role is to promote and to govern. The objective 
is to encourage domestic and foreign private investments in the 
framework of legal and economic security and to stimulate, with 
proper measures, the reactivation of essential production 
sectors. 
  Short- and mid-term fiscal projects are not the only concern 
and interest of the government, which is interested in essential 
reform to the national economy. This is why I have designated a 
state minister whose responsibility will be to study and analyze 
long-term economic projects. We are on the threshold of the 21st 
century and we cannot limit ourselves to searching for ways to 
resolve situations that have arisen at the end of the 20th 
century. 
  No one can guarantee that in a society like the Venezuelan 
society, which is in the middle of a transition from a 
bonds-holding economy to a productive economy, no risk is 
involved. I can assure you I will make every effort to have a 
straightforward and trustworthy regime, and there will not be 
uncertainty in our exchange policy. I clearly announce, once and 
for all, that my government does not plan to impose a maximum 
devaluation or exchange controls. [applause] 
  Five years ago, it was announced that the production 
mechanism would be changed to make it competitive. This did not 
yield the promised results. Now it is not a matter of simply 
changing the mechanism, but of avoiding its collapse. This is 
why one fundamental objective of the solidarity commitment I am 
promoting is to implement a realistic and viable program that 
should encourage production and productivity and bring down 
interest rates. Right now, high interest rates make it 
impossible for large, medium, and small businessmen to utilize 
banking services. [applause] 
  According to what the labor and capital sectors want, a 
social solidarity program must be initiated. This program, which 
would take place as a dialogue for solidarity, should imply not 
only an institutional reordering but also the creation of public 
and private pension funds of a complementary nature as well as 
constructive discussions and analyses about social benefits and 
the guarantees workers should enjoy at the conclusion of their 
labor relations. 
  We will support the agricultural and livestock sector, which 
was severely punished by the economic readjustments and 
uncontrolled opening of recent years. 
  Priority attention will be given to guaranteeing nutritional 
needs. Investments in agriculture and livestock, industry, and 
human resource sectors will be the determining factors of the 
new, sustained economic-growth phase. 
  Production efforts in the agricultural sector will be the 
recipient of special encouragement and support. This implies 
respect for a legal and personal security system for the people 
in rural areas. We will encourage fishing activities, both 
industrial fishing in national and international waters, the 
development and consolidation of small-scale fishing, and the 
breeding of various aquatic species. 
  We will also support productive forestry activities while 
carefully protecting our ecological system. 
  The evolution of science and technology has brought 
substantial changes in the orientation and direction of 
productive processes directed at overcoming obsolete patterns, 
readapting structures, and projecting the efforts of industrial 
and farm workers to the conquest of foreign markets. 
  Aware of the disadvantages of current mechanisms of 
commercialization and marketing that establish a tangible 
difference between what a farmer is paid on his farm and what 
the consumer pays, my government will promote and encourage the 
establishment of agroindustrial intermediary structures that 
will be socially equitable and economically efficient. 
  Meanwhile, we will offer enthusiastic support to industrial 
initiatives involving the processing and manufacturing of 
agricultural raw materials and the manufacturing of industrial 
products for the countryside, thus we will be inclined to 
balance and increase farming and industry. 
  Our investment policy includes broad opportunities in 
tourism. Tourism investments in Venezuela are very attractive. 
We will make an effort to offer facilities and incentives to 
national and foreign investors, and we will work with 
determination to guarantee public security, which will be a 
powerful factor in this economic sector. 
  The country is also faced with the need for large scale 
public projects that are essential to development, such as the 
alternate highway from Caracas to the coast, the bridge over the 
Orinoco precipice, and a number of freeways, some of which were 
initiated but must now be completed. 
  In view of the fiscal situation, it is essential to 
establish 
a concessions system for the construction of projects. I hope 
Congress will review the law governing this matter and make it 
viable so we can take advantage of it now when it is urgently 
needed. 
  Small and medium businesses, handicrafts, and 
microbusinesses 
will be areas of special concern, convinced as we are of the 
important role they can play in reactivating the economy and 
generating jobs. 
  The recent collapse of an important banking institution, 
which threatened the stability of the financial system, was the 
tail end of the moral and economic crisis that has done so much 
harm. This incident was a serious warning, and it has prompted 
me to ask all economic and political sectors, especially the 
members of the financial system, to sign a basic pledge that 
will end a perverse policy: that of playing with the people's 
deposits in a sort of financial roulette [applause] that 
threatens essential institutions and damages our image of 
seriousness and honesty abroad. 
  The Banking Council, Superintendency of Banks, and other 
institutions linked to the system should eradicate the practice 
of making direct or surreptitious loans to members of the same 
banking group. [applause] 
  My administration will take the necessary initiatives to 
impose criminal and civil penalties on individuals responsible 
for fraudulent irregularities at this or any other credit 
institution. [applause] 
  We will do whatever is necessary to guarantee that account 
holders' funds will be returned to them and to ensure the 
promptest and most efficient attention possible for individuals 
who must use their deposits at the involved institution to meet 
their most urgent needs. [applause] 
  Although the terrible economic crisis and the alarming 
fiscal deficit are forcing us to take immediate action, we 
cannot overlook our priority duty to take care of social 
problems. Deteriorating living conditions are cause for deep 
concern among those who study the nation's situation. We feel 
it is our unavoidable duty to make sure that the people attain 
the greatest possible degree of happiness, as the liberator said 
in his Angostura speech. The number of families living in 
poverty and critical poverty has increased in Latin America to 
such an extent that multilateral organizations like the World 
Bank and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] have begun to 
place priority status on fighting poverty. The administration 
that the Venezuelan people elected to govern them in these 
crucial years cannot overlook that fact. I hope the 
institutions I have mentioned will give us valuable assistance 
in facing this serious problem. 
  Real wages have deteriorated to a large extent. The current 
minimum wage was established more than two years ago, years in 
which the economy suffered the onslaught of inflation and 
currency devaluation. That is why I intend to raise 
significantly minimum wage and the present food and 
transportation benefits, all within the framework of law. 
[applause] 
  Turning shantytowns into neighborhoods where people can live 
humane and dignified lives will be a fundamental concern of my 
administration. Water is a necessity everywhere. In 
shantytowns, however, the water shortage forces people not only 
to use water sparingly but to pay for it at prices incompatible 
with their modest incomes. I know the fiscal situation stands 
in the way of making good on this solemn pledge, but we will do 
everything possible and even impossible to honor my government's 
concern in this respect. Steps will begin to be taken 
immediately to solve the problem. 
  Venezuelan society has experienced many changes in the past 
few years, both in its behavior and living conditions. The 
application of economic measures without taking society into 
consideration has exacted a huge price, hence the habit of 
speaking out and resorting to demonstrations on a daily basis. 
The practice of registering complaints has played a major role 
in the political events of the five-year term that has just 
ended. People who rightly feel that they are victims of 
injustices and who cannot find a way to correct them vent their 
anger through demonstrations. I am willing to respect the 
institution of registering complaints. I will issue strict 
orders that every responsible complaint be investigated 
immediately and the results of the investigation reported in due 
time. As for demonstrations, I hope that a culture of 
demonstrations will lead us to endorse peaceful demonstrations 
and prevent provocateurs, who only seek to encourage violence, 
from infiltrating them. I hope this will also lead authorities 
to find sure methods to protect and assist protesters without 
endangering their lives and personal safety. [applause] 
  The country requires a government that governs. It requires 
an authority that can restore order within the law. I am 
determined to give the country such a government. [applause] I 
will place special emphasis on tackling the deterioration of 
public services, particularly those dealing with personal 
security, health, and education. The safety of homes, people, 
and property has deteriorated to an unacceptable degree. The 
health and education levels do not befit democratic Venezuela's 
degree of development. 
  These matters, for which the national, state, and municipal 
governments share responsibility, demand understanding, support, 
and the participation of the communities. 
  Decentralization cannot be seen as the shattering of the 
nation, and it cannot lead to burdening the municipalities with 
the defects of the central administration. The central 
administration must be exemplary in pointing out the course of 
an integral effort. 
  The task of bringing the education process up to date; of 
encouraging research, science, and technology; of searching for 
joint solutions to finance higher education; and of multiplying 
the ways of preparing people to work, especially the young 
people from poor sectors, will be tackled by the national 
government, which expects firm cooperation from governors and 
mayors. Without them it would be very difficult to take on this 
task. 
  Everyone's contribution is necessary to resolve the problems 
that aggravate everybody. I urge public employees to work with 
love and understanding to cooperate in the services 
reorganization task. I am sure that many will respond to this 
appeal. I have not made any bureaucratic assignment pacts. 
They are harmful to the country. [applause] 
  The national situation has given us big tasks. Viable 
development in the south demands coordinated activities to carry 
out projects with the cooperation of the national and regional 
governments, the armed forces, and academic and research 
organizations. 
  We must not delay in giving our immediate attention to a 
vast 
region of our territory that has been forsaken and left exposed 
to plundering by national and foreign adventurers who have 
caused irreversible damage to the economy and to the ethnic 
groups living there. In what used to be called Saudi Venezuela 
-- because of the splendor of the oil-produced bolivares -- 
there could have been no interest in what 20 years ago was known 
as the conquest of the south. [applause] 
  The urgency of the changes we need to undertake must, of 
necessity, begin with a constitutional reform. This is an 
urgent task and a fascinating challenge for the Congress of the 
Republic. Expert constitutionalists believe it will be possible 
to reform the Constitution this year as long as there is a 
consensus and the support of the popular vote. The main 
guidelines already exist: the participation of the people 
through four forms of referendum; reforming the Executive Branch 
and considering the possibility of having a prime minister; 
reforming the Legislative Branch and establishing, among other 
things, voting according to one's conscience; reforming the 
administration of justice; establishing a new system for 
electing and removing justices; and reforming the political 
parties based on strict guidelines that will insure the reforms. 
  These reforms would be the first step in the commitment to 
solidarity, which should include a generational solidarity 
agreement. 
  Constitutional reform must be accompanied by reforming and 
downsizing [redimensionamiento] the state to enhance the public 
administration's efficiency, which is functioning with 
difficulty in structures that are inappropriate to the present 
time and our needs. 
  We are anticipating great events in our country. Our trust 
in our country and our faith in ourselves must be reborn! The 
people have not lost hope! Our obligation is to strengthen 
their hope through continuous contact with them. Venezuelans 
have risen to the occasion every time they have suddenly had to 
face huge obstacles. 
  A great writer from Merida, Mariano Picon-Salas, said that 
the 20th Century began in Venezuela in 1936. I think we should 
work hard so we can also say that in Venezuela the 21st Century 
began on 5 December 1993! [applause] 
  Everyone's solidarity and work is necessary to make this 
happen. Everyone must make sacrifices, and everyone must make a 
commitment of solidarity. 
  The great crisis we have endured must turn out to be an 
opportunity for a new beginning, new horizons, new hope, and new 
life. If the confusion of our economic life, the problems in 
the administration of justice and public services, and the 
closing of participative channels have prompted growing social 
tensions, a culture of protest, and a tendency toward personal 
escapism -- indeed, if Venezuela appears to be a house divided 
-- all peaceful solutions to our problems must be sought 
hand-in-hand in solidarity. As Pope John Paul II said, 
solidarity is the firm and persevering determination to work for 
the common good -- namely, the good of each and everyone so we 
can all be responsible for one another. 
  The government whose presidency I am assuming today will be 
guided at all times by the resolute pursuit of that solidity, 
and this will enable the government to act as a guide and 
catalyst in the nation's reconstruction process. This will 
allow society as a united whole to mobilize its own resources to 
resolve urgent structural problems. 
  I am assuming the Presidency of the Republic again thanks to 
the popular vote. After a long life of struggle, I am doing so 
with the experience of my own mistakes, my unyielding 
determination to serve, and the day-to-day lessons of love for 
Venezuela. I know my country well. I know about its agonies 
and suffering, but I also know about the capacity of its people, 
their adherence to democratic values, and the incredible 
tenacity of their hopes. 
  Overwhelmed by difficulties, Venezuela is listening today to 
the question that was made to the liberator on his deathbed: 
General, what are you going to do now? Like Bolivar, Venezuela 
must respond to this question with a single word: Win! 
[applause] 
  With God's help, with the solidarity of all sectors of 
national life, with the enthusiasm and vision of youth, and with 
the entire heart of the people, we will make this crisis a 
chance for better days ahead, a time of affirmation, and a time 
of advancement in the life of the Republic. This will permit us 
to advance into the 21st century. Will we be able to accomplish 
this? We have no choice. Senators and Deputies, we must win, 
and, indeed, we will win. [applause]

  [Text] Caracas, 2 Feb (AFP) -- Venezuelan President Rafael 
Caldera swore in his new cabinet at 1645 GMT today as his last 
official act of ascension to power. 
  Caldera, 78, was sworn-in mid-morning as the eighth 
president 
Venezuela's current democratic period in the Congress building 
located in Caracas' historic center. After taking office and 
addressing the nation, Caldera laid a wreath in the National 
Cemetery at the tomb of Liberator Simon Bolivar. Following this 
act, Caldera went to the Miraflores Presidential Palace, where 
he began his duties. Once installed, he swore-in his new

  [Text] If the presidential elections were held today, 
Andres Pastrana would win with a lead of over seven points ahead 
of Ernesto Samper Pizano, according to a poll by Yankelovich 
Colombia for the Pastrana campaign. The poll was released 
yesterday. 
  However, an EL TIEMPO poll arranged with the same polling 
firm, which then subcontracted the poll to the CNC [National 
Survey Center], gives different data on who the next president 
might be. These figures and the explanations of each of the 
firms--Yankelovich and the CNC--will be published by EL TIEMPO 
on Sunday. Yankelovich is now working as a polling consultant to 
the Andres Pastrana campaign, and for that reason subcontracted 
EL TIEMPO's poll to the CNC. 
  According to the poll the Pastrana campaign released 
yesterday, the total number of persons polled would vote as 
follows: 
  In the first presidential round: for Andres Pastrana, 30.5 
percent; for Ernesto Samper, 23.8 percent; and for Antonio 
Navarro, who would be third, 8.9 percent. 
  In the second round, Pastrana would also emerge as the 
winner, with a lead of almost eight points ahead of Samper. 
Pastrana would win 41.0 percent of the votes, with Samper 
getting 32.1 percent. 
  Over half of those polled, 56 percent, said they intend to 
vote. These respondents said they would vote for president as 
follows: in the first round, 36.6 percent for Andres Pastrana, 
and 29.4 percent for Samper. Antonio Navarro Wolf would be 
third, with 7.8 percent. 
  In the second round, those who said they are going to vote 
would vote as follows: for Andres Pastrana, 38.7 percent; for 
Ernesto Samper, 30.6 percent; and for Miguel Maza Marquez, 2.2 
percent. 
  To the question, "who do you think is going to be the next 
president of Colombia, independently of whom you are going to 
vote for?" the 1,212 persons questioned answered: 38.7 percent 
said Andres Pastrana, 30.6 percent said Samper, and 2.2 percent 
chose Miguel Maza Marquez. 
  On primary elections to select the conservative and liberal 
parties' candidates, the poll revealed the following: 
  In the liberal party, Ernesto Samper would win twice the 
number of votes as Humberto de la Calle, who would be second, 
followed by Carlos Lemos. 
  In the conservative party, Andres Pastrana would win 51 
percent of the votes, with Roberto Gerlein getting 4 percent. 
Juan Diego Jaramillo would be third in a conservative primary, 
with 3.1 percent. 
<H5>  How the Poll Was Conducted </H5>
  The poll was conducted by Yankelovich for Andres Pastrana's 
campaign among 1,212 people from the lower, middle, and upper 
socio-economic sectors in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, 
Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. 
  The surveys were conducted by telephone on 10, 11, and 12 
December using a random digital method. 
  The results have a margin of error of 2.8 percent for the 
total population and 3.5 percent for those who say they intend 
to vote.

  [Text] The race for the presidency of Colombia between 
two candidates, Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana, is fairly 
close, according to EL TIEMPO's latest poll, conducted by the 
CNC [National Survey Center]. 
  Samper would win the first and second rounds, based on 
responses of people who intend to vote. But of the total 
respondents surveyed, Pastrana would win the first round, with a 
tie in the second round. 
  In comparing these results with the EL TIEMPO poll conducted 
by Yankelovich in September 1993, the same trend is evident. 
Three months ago Pastrana was winning the first round among the 
total number polled by 1.2 points, while in the second round the 
two candidates would each win 38.3 percent of the votes. 
  In the same way, among people who said they intend to vote, 
which at that time was 57 percent of the total number polled, 
Samper led Pastrana by 0.7 percent. 
  Now, of the total number polled, 39 percent think Pastrana 
is 
going to be the next president, followed by Samper with 38 
percent. 
  Those who said they are going to vote think Colombia's next 
president is going to be Ernesto Samper, by a three-point 
difference. 
  These results show that the race between Samper and Pastrana 
is a real neck-to-neck contest, as the poll has a 3-percent 
margin of error for the total population. 
  The poll results show without a doubt that Andres Pastrana 
and Ernesto Samper would be chosen as their party's presidential 
candidate, both in the liberal primary and in a conservative 
primary, if the conservatives decided to hold one. 
<H5>  Voters and Nonvoters </H5>
  Of the total population, over half the people polled said 
they intend to vote in the next elections; 64 percent are now 
registered. 
  Of this group who intend to vote in the next presidential 
election, 89 percent always intended to vote for the same 
candidate, while 9 percent had thought of voting for someone 
else. 
  In the total population, 19 percent are still undecided 
about 
whether or not they will vote. 
<H5>  Age and Sex </H5>
  In breaking down the population by sex, age, and 
socio-economic level, the results among the total number polled 
show that Pastrana would get more votes from women than men, 
while Samper would receive more votes from men than from women. 
  In terms of age, the majority of Pastrana's votes would come 
from people between 18 and 39, while the majority of Samper's 
votes would come from people over 25. 
  In terms of socio-economic level, classified for the 
purposes 
of this poll as lower, middle, and upper, both candidates would 
get most of their votes from the middle class, followed by the 
upper class. A difference was found among voters from the lower 
socio-economic group, where more people intend to vote for 
Samper.

<H5>  The Government </H5>
  On President Cesar Gaviria's image and performance, the poll 
shows that while a third of the people have a good image of the 
chief executive, over half approve of his job performance. 
  When compared with the May and September polls, these 
figures 
show that the president's ratings have improved in both aspects. 
  In May, 34.5 percent approved of his performance; in 
September, 47.1 percent, and in December, his approval rating 
was 53 percent. 
  The president's positive image rose from 15.1 percent in May 
to 31.2 percent in September, and to 33 percent in December. 
  In the latest poll, 14 percent have a poor image of the 
president and 38 percent disapprove of his performance. 
  On the nation's situation, 59 percent describe it as 
average, 
33 percent as bad, and 8 percent as good.

<H5>  How the Poll Was Conducted </H5>
  EL TIEMPO hired Yankelovich of Colombia which, as it is now 
working for the Andres Pastrana campaign, subcontracted the 
poll, with EL TIEMPO's permission, to the National Survey Center. 
  The telephone poll was conducted among 1,298 persons in 
Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, 
and Santa Marta, from middle, lower, and upper socio-economic 
levels. 
  In all, 589 men and 700 women between 18 and 65 were 
surveyed. 
  The poll's margin of error is 3 percent.

  [Text] Cuba has stated in Geneva that the United States 
intends to overwhelm with hunger the firm desire of our people 
to exercise their right to self-determination and independence, 
for which Cuba has been enduring a severe economic and financial 
blockade for more than 30 years. 
  Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations Jose Perez Novoa told 
the UN Human Rights Committee that the U.S. occupation of 
Guantanamo against the will of Cuba is one more example of the 
denial of that right. 
  Novoa spoke a second time today to express his position on 
point nine of the agenda, that is, free determination and its 
application to nations submitted to colonial domination or 
foreign occupation.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Cuban Vice President Carlos </F>
Lage by Maria de Fatima Rodrigues; answers were sent in writing 
from Havana; date not given] 
  [Text] [Rodrigues] What are the difficulties facing Cuba as 
a result of the suspension of Soviet aid and the U.S. economic 
embargo? 
  [Lage] The adverse situation we have been facing ever since 
the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union's 
disintegration is not a result of the suspension of Soviet 
assistance in itself, but the result of the loss of markets, the 
lack of fair prices, and the lack of mutually favorable economic 
and trade exchange conditions. Today we must face major 
disadvantages in our relations with the world. The hardening of 
the U.S. blockade and the pressures of all types applied by the 
United States against companies and governments make our access 
to credits difficult and undermine our efforts in the areas of 
trade and capital investment. 
  [Rodrigues] What is the country doing to survive? 
  [Lage] We are seeking new markets, new sources of capital, 
new technologies, and new paths for development conceived in the 
context of a community of nations that will disappear as a 
community, and in some cases nations that will disappear as 
nations. Meanwhile, we took some measures anticipating a virtual 
dismantling of the USSR even before it collapsed, such as 
increasing our exports and the replacement, as much as possible, 
of imported products by national products. We also gave 
incentives to savings in all fields and we urged a more rational 
use of available resources, particularly in the area of energy. 
  [Rodrigues] What are the embargo's most visible results? 
  [Lage] This will give you an idea of the sanctions' impact. 
In 1989 our imports totalled $8.2 billion. Three years later 
they were only worth $2.2 million [figures as published] and 
today they continue shrinking. We had to reduce our imports 70 
percent in only four years. And ours is an economy that depends 
on foreign trade to develop. We had to reduce the importation of 
vital products such as oil. 
  [Rodrigues] Cuba has not implemented such a deep program of 
changes in its economic structures as is being planned today 
since the transformation that accompanied the 1959 revolution. 
Is there a model that is being used as a basis? 
  [Lage] It is being mistakenly said abroad that Cuba must 
present a program of economic reorganization. We already have a 
model, the socialist model. 
  [Rodrigues] What is changing in Cuba in light of the new 
world economic context? 
  [Lage] For instance, it was necessary to adopt a group of 
urgent measures to transform our foreign trade system and 
reorient it to facilitate the search for new markets for our 
products. That is something easy to say but very difficult and 
complicated to implement, particularly considering that 85 
percent of our trade involved the Soviet Union and the other 
East European countries before 1989. We had to hurry to find 
markets for our sugar, nickel, and citrus, always having present 
the U.S. blockade's increasing pressure in each operation. 
Already operating in the country are 476 foreign commercial 
firms from nearly 40 countries, some of them with their own 
independent representation and others that are represented 
through national state and private companies. We also have 
sponsored a process of opening for foreign capital and allowed 
various kinds of associations, such as mixed enterprises in the 
tourist area. 
  [Rodrigues] But those changes are purely capitalistic, 
making 
the failure of the economic model conceived by the socialist 
system obvious, are they not? 
  [Lage] We cannot speak of a failure of the socialist system 
in Cuba. We found ourselves suddenly submerged in a crisis that 
originated abroad, that came from outside. With that I do not 
want to say that our model does not have insufficiencies, 
deficiencies, and mistakes. But the crisis was provoked by 
external factors, not internal reasons. And the situation was 
aggravated by the U.S. blockade of the country. Despite it all, 
we are determined to show that the Cuban socialist model not 
only did not fail, but it continues to be active and is seeking 
to get consolidated. We know our model is not perfect, but it 
has achieved many good things. 
  [Rodrigues] Does the economic opening have a limit? 
  [Lage] Practically all productive areas of the economy are 
open to possible associations with foreign investors. 
Regrettably, we cannot give details. Our experience forces us to 
use discretion to avoid pressures against entrepreneurs who 
might be interested in investing in Cuba. Today we can speak of 
an increased opening in the sense that some negotiations that 
were unthinkable only three years ago are being carried out 
today. 
  [Rodrigues] What countries are Cuba's main economic partners 
today? 
  [Lage] Our main partners are Russia, China, Spain, Canada, 
Italy, and France.

  [Text] National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon has 
expressed his conviction that Cuba's relations with the European 
Union [EU] are on the right track; he is hoping to conclude a 
general cooperation agreement with the EU soon. 
  Alarcon is currently visiting Germany. On 2 February, in 
Bonn, he met with (Hans Klein), vice president of the German 
Parliament; deputies in charge of relations with Central America 
and the Caribbean; and representatives of the Christian 
Democratic Union, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  In statements to the press, Alarcon stressed: Cuba has to 
make a series of changes in its economy, but it is not seeking 
to transform the basic elements of its political design, which 
is socialism.

  [Text] The participants in the extended plenum of the 
national committee of the Union of Cuban Journalists [UPEC], 
giving continuity to the Sixth UPEC Congress, have sent a 
message to Fidel in which they reaffirm that Cuban journalists 
will tackle today's missions with renewed energy. The letter 
states: Upon the conclusion of the agenda of our sixth congress, 
we wish to express the intense commitment this process generated 
in our journalists. 
  Two issues not fully debated in the congress because of time 
constraints were discussed in this meeting: Cuba's image abroad 
and media finances. The participants were unanimous in stressing 
the role of our media in disseminating the true image of Cuba 
and in confronting the U.S. blockade as well as the campaigns of 
the disinformation multinationals.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1255 GMT on 3 February features, during its "Doing Radio" 
program, four reports on the issue of emigration to the United 
States: 
  Reporters Roberto Cavada and Roberto Gili engage in a 
six-minute conversation in which they point out that emigration 
is a normal, worldwide phenomenon and that there are Cubans 
living in many countries besides the United States. The 
reporters note that Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has 
discussed this issue and that most Cuban emigration has been of 
an economic nature -- with the exception of the exodus of 1959, 
when hundreds of professionals and political henchmen and other 
kinds of criminals left for political reasons. In conclusion, 
the reporters note the way the United States, by giving a hero's 
welcome to those who make such a trip while denying visas to 
ordinary Cuban citizens, encourages dangerous attempted 
departures by rafters. 
  Next, reporter Tony Gonzalez Martin conducts a five-minute 
telephone interview of Cuba exile Nicolas Rios, who lives in 
Miami, publishes the magazine CONTRAPUNTO, and received PRENSA 
LATINA's 1993 journalism award. 
  Asked how people in Miami feel about the rafters in light of 
the recent deaths of nine people -- five of whom were minors -- 
Rios stresses that it is a known fact that the Cuban Government 
grants anyone with a visa and the money to buy a ticket 
permission to leave Cuba. However, despite having signed an 
accord to that effect, the U.S. Government fails to grant the 
20,000 visas a year for which the accord calls. This is why 
rafters take to the seas -- adds Rios. 
  Rios points out that official U.S. and Miami stations 
encourage people to do this by giving rafters a hero's welcome. 
He stresses that responsibility lies with those, both in Miami 
and within the U.S. Government, who control public opinion. 
  In conclusion, Rios stresses that the Cuban community's 
opinion cannot be perceived properly because there is no room in 
the media for those whose opinions differ from the official 
position. He adds that many reject such oppression but have no 
means for saying so. 
  An announcer conducts a telephone interview with a relative 
of one of those who died recently at sea. The relative stresses 
that the idea of leaving in a raft "got just stuck" in the 
deceased's head. 
  The announcer plays a 1967 recording of a Radio Havana Cuba 
program entitled "Our Leaders Respond" in which former Cuban 
Foreign Minister Raul Roa Kouri addresses the issue of 
emigration from Cuba. In this recording, Roa says the Cuban 
Government's policy has always been to let people go freely; 
that the United States, which blocks legal departures, is 
responsible for the plight of the rafters; and that all of that 
is part of a smear campaign against Cuba. 
  The announcer reiterates that Cuba continues to abide by the 
1984 immigration accords.

  [Text] Cuba was elected today to chair the Outer Space 
Committee [Comite del Espacio Ultraterrestre], one of the 
organizations sponsoring the UN Disarmament Conference, and 
representing the so-called Group of 21 neutral and nonaligned 
countries. 
  The decision was made in Geneva during a plenary session 
when 
the Group of 21 submitted Cuba's candidacy, which was approved 
by all members of the conference. Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez 
Novoa will head the committee which last year was chaired by the 
German representative to the Disarmament Conference. 
  The developing nations have traditionally paid special 
attention to this organization, which will now be chaired by our 
country, taking into consideration the impact the prevention of 
the arms race and the outer space program will have on the Third 
World.

  [Relay from Los Pilajones, Camaguey Province, by Adolfo 
Silva] 
  [Text] Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers 
Federation and a Politburo member, has stated that during the 
workers' parliaments in the country, the workers convey their 
political perception and patriotic spirit in facing current 
problems. 
  In remarks to the press in Camaguey, Ross praised the 
positive development of these parliaments, during which the 
workers express ideas and propose solutions. Ross today chaired 
the first of the three parliaments at Camaguey University 
scheduled to discuss the economic and financial situation in the 
country and at the university. 
  Among the suggestions proposed by the workers, to be 
implemented at the university, are the better use of the budget 
without affecting the educational process, increasing the [word 
indistinct] of outstanding students, solutions to the food 
self-supply difficulties, and the control of resources. 
  The list of proposals also includes ceiling prices for 
products sold by self-employed vendors, paying for tickets to 
sports activities, collecting fees from foreign students who can 
afford to pay them, tax exemption for salaries, and increasing 
economic activity at the regional level.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, and the delegation accompanying him 
are visiting Las Tunas Province. The delegation stopped at 
Colombia Municipality where Raul and his companions talked with 
Manuel Quesada, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba 
[PCC]. First, the good news: The sugar harvest is progressing at 
101 percent of the plan and 40 percent of the production plan 
has been completed. The Colombia Mill, which has meet every 
production plan in the last 20 years, expects to do so again. 
The mill is engaged in the sugar recovery program and to this 
end will contribute the 16 recently created Basic Cooperative 
Production Units, in addition to the state farm managed by the 
Youth Labor Army [EJT], which has increased the yield of its 
sugarfields by 10,000 arrobas per caballeria, and the Leningrad 
Farming Cooperative with its 112 caballerias. 
  During a visit to cattle ranches, Raul points out the 
negative aspect of extensive marabu weeds, saying that a 
solution has to be found so that the 25,000 head of cattle yield 
more milk and meat. [Politburo member Alfredo] Jordan explains 
that a nationwide machete campaign is being waged against marabu 
with the double goal of preserving the pastures and collecting 
kitchen firewood for workers' dining halls and homes. 
  The report on defense is very encouraging. Colombia was the 
first municipality of the Eastern Army area to achieve Ready for 
Defense in the Second Phase status and its 17 defense zones are 
attaining higher levels of readiness. 
  In Jobabo, we meet with Norge Rodriguez, first secretary of 
the PCC. We proceed directly to the pride of the locals: the 
Loma Alta state farm. This farm has 200 workers mobilized for 
two years from the municipality -- population 50,000 -- and the 
provincial capital. The 60 narrow-furrow caballerias of plantain 
yielded 253,000 quintals in 1993. This year they expect to 
surpass the 300,000 mark. The production of this, another state 
farm, and eight farming cooperatives is enough to distribute 40 
pounds of vegetables per capita a month to every person in the 
municipality. The goal is to attain 1 million tubers, 
vegetables, and grains in 1995 to meet the people's needs and 
help supply the provincial capital. 
  Rodriguez, proud of the accomplishments of the municipality, 
shows us the local wine factory which produced 189,000 bottles 
in 1993 and plans to produce 300,000 in 1994. He spoke with 
enthusiasm of the local food production and its highly diverse 
service facilities. 
  On the outskirts of Las Tunas City is something new: modest 
minidairy farms -- perfect to supply milk for children and the 
elderly of nearby communities. There are 45 of these farms on 
the periphery of the city. Horse-drawn carts distribute the milk 
early in the morning. Housewives boil the milk as was customary 
before the widespread implementation of centralized 
pasteurization. Raul congratulated Misael Enamorado, first 
secretary of Las Tunas Municipality, for this accomplishment, 
trusting that shortly the other five communities will have their 
own minidairy farms. 
  Windmills are becoming a common feature in the profile of 
Las 
Tunas City. The goal is to supply water, without using 
electricity, to the organic gardens of various sizes appearing 
in empty lots in the city. Because of the lack of resources to 
build every windmill needed, locals have made use of 
old-fashioned wells to draw water and irrigate the gardens by 
hand. These lots provide fresh vegetables and direct sales to 
the neighbors at standard prices. The vendor estimates the 
weight, since they lack scales. This is a practical 
antibureaucratic measure by the masses and for the masses. 
  In light of this fact, as well as the minidairy farms and 
other efforts, Raul states with delight that this is a blow to 
bureaucracy which is sometimes removed from reality and the 
interests of the masses; a bureaucracy may be well-intentioned 
but capable of destroying a revolution, as has unfortunately 
already happened in other countries. Raul stressed that this is 
not a fatalist statement because in the case of Cuba we are 
lucky to have a commander in chief like Fidel, a sworn enemy of 
bureaucracy and more aware than anyone else of the masses' 
morale, hopes, and needs, and who trusts more than anyone else 
the revolutionary spirit of his people. There is no sign of 
disenchantment in Raul as he recalls some of the mistakes made 
in agriculture. He affirms with optimism that the only positive 
aspect of errors is the possibility of learning from them to 
avoid repeating them. 
  Raul is accompanied by Central Committee members Julian 
Lopez, first secretary of the PCC in Las Tunas, and Vilma Espin, 
president of the Federation of Cuban Women, among others.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 3 
February. 
  Economy Minister Jaime Toha and Foreign Investment Committee 
Deputy Chairman Roberto Mayorga reported that foreign 
investments in 1993 hit a record $2.6838 billion, an 
87.5-percent increase compared with the previous year. This 
amount, which represents 6 percent of the country's GDP, breaks 
down as follows: $865.2 million in capital investments, $800.5 
million in credits in operations via Decree-Law No. 600, $191.3 
million in capital investments through Chapter 14, and $826.8 
million in American Depositary Receipts. (Santiago EL MERCURIO 
in Spanish 19 Jan 94 pp A1, A12) 
  The Industrial Development Association reported that Chilean 
industrial productivity increased 4.7 percent during 1993, less 
than in 1992. The production of nonelectric machinery, earthen 
and ceramic products like bricks, furniture, and accessories 
increased more than 20 percent. Production of oil byproducts and 
textiles dropped considerably. Domestic sales increased 7.6 
percent. Industrial exports increased 0.6 percent. Exports of 
tomato juice, puree, chicken meat, and shoes dropped 
considerably. Electricity consumption increased 8 percent. 
(Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 28 Jan 
94) 
  Association of Metallurgical Manufacturers President Juan 
Riveros on 17 January reported that the metalworking industry 
increased 12 percent in 1993. He added that the industry is 
exporting to nearly 60 countries. (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA 
HORA in Spanish 18 Jan 94 Business Section p 3) 
  A total of $34.5 million was funneled into foreign 
investment 
funds in 1993. Despite the fact that this operation started in 
Chile four years ago, the foreign investment fund has dropped 
substantially. Remittances amounted to $53 million. The Equity 
Fund of Latin America led this operation with $26.4 million, the 
Chile Fund Inc. with $9.8 million, and the Five Arrows Fund Ltd. 
with $8.5 million. Total remittances were $128.1 million, of 
which 41.4 percent was made in 1993. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in 
Spanish 19 Jan 94 p 15) 
  Chamber of Commerce Chairman Juan Carlos Delano said 
commerce 
grew 9.5 percent in 1993 compared with 1992, when it grew 14 
percent, and that retail sales increased 11 percent. He added 
that the sector created more than 90,000 new jobs, and that 
investment dropped 19 percent compared with the previous year. 
(Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 19 Jan 1994 p 4) 
  International Economic Relations Director Eduardo Moyano 
reported that Chilean companies invested $1.445 billion abroad 
between January 1990 and November 1993, of which $1.056 billion 
was invested in Argentina and $64 million in Peru. (Santiago EL 
MERCURIO in Spanish 19 Jan 94 p B1) 
  The Consumer Price Index increased 1 percent in January. 
Food, transportation, and communications increased the most 
during January. (Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen 
International in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Feb 94)

<F P=106> [Interview with President Itamar Franco by Jose Bastos </F>
Moreno in Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Text] [Moreno] What are the main characteristics of Itamar 
Franco's administration? 
  [Franco] An atmosphere of freedom reigns in the country. The 
government has given free rein to the press, which criticizes 
and does as it pleases because I have always believed that life 
looses all meaning without freedom and that mankind will be 
unable to find peace without justice. 
  [Moreno] There is a tug-of-war between the government and 
Congress over the passing of the economic plan. Is there any 
risk that Congress may reject this plan? 
  [Franco] I invited the presidents of both chambers of 
Congress and gave each of them a letter. Governability is not 
the sole responsibility of the executive branch. It is shared 
by Congress and the judicial branch. The government is doing 
its share. Never in contemporary history has a president of the 
Republic given so much support to a finance minister. Never in 
contemporary history have we seen a finance minister appear 
before Congress so many times to debate and discuss matters. 
His plan may be amended and he may agree with these amendments. 
We have established a democratic dialogue with Congress through 
the finance minister. What has Brazil seen so far? It has seen 
many economic plans implemented without the knowledge of 
Congress. Plans were implemented overnight without congressmen 
being able to even voice an opinion. We are now doing the 
opposite -- the government holds talks, backs off, moves 
forward. We currently want Congress to express its opinion on 
the economic program. If it considers it a good plan, then let 
it pass it. If Congress considers it a bad plan, let it then 
specify what is the best plan for our country. The vote of 
congressmen should not be based on political considerations 
because it is a presidential year and the [finance] minister may 
or may not run for the presidency. Brazilians are not 
interested in this. They are interested in whether the program 
submitted to Congress can curb inflation. 
  [Moreno] Isn't it a contradiction that Congress increased 
taxes on individuals and not on companies? 
  [Franco] That was really most unfair. It was a relatively 
insignificant act and yet it affected the political situation. 
It caused the government's plan to become somewhat -- the 
expression is popular but to the point -- crippled. It was 
unfair from a social standpoint. This injustice will have to be 
compensated during the next congressional stage on the measures 
the government wants Congress to pass. 
  [Moreno] The workers want an audience with you, Mr. 
President, to ask you to veto this tax increase. Will you veto 
it? 
  [Franco] I granted an audience to Mr. Medeiros (Labor Force 
President Luiz Antonio de Medeiros) to whom I showed the letter 
I sent to Congress. We discussed that injustice not long ago. 
If they come to see me, I will have to get the finance minister 
to examine the consequences of the workers request on the 
economic program. If he considers they may be improved, we can 
retrace our steps. Ours is a democratic government and we can 
either go forward or backwards. But -- and let us be very clear 
-- changing our ideas will, to a large extent, depend on the 
finance minister. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the 
income bracket affected by the tax increase is not that of 
workers. Workers will not be affected. If workers come to see 
me they will have to explain which workers have been affected. 
The low income bracket is not affected. 
  [Moreno] Most of your former ministers failed to vote on 
the issue. Did this upset you? 
  [Franco] They must have had their reasons. They do not have 
to explain their reasons to me. My former ministers and former 
congressional colleagues must explain to the Brazilian public. 
They may have had some sort of a problem. I cannot believe, 
after being a minister of this administration for more than 15 
months, how a congressman could fail to attend a session in 
which issues of such importance for the government would be 
voted on. There must have been some reason. I will not call 
for explanations. It is up to the public to question these 
congressmen. 
  [Moreno] Some former ministers, however, are already 
covertly 
criticizing your administration. One of them has even said your 
administration has no face. 
  [Franco] I ask the Brazilian people: How can a minister who 
worked with the president of the Republic for 15 months and had 
the president's full support during these 15 months begin to 
think, after only 30 days, that the government has no face? Has 
the government lost its face during these 30 days or is the 
minister losing his face? Criticism must be made clearly, 
openly. The press permanently states that my administration is 
weak. In what sense? Does the press want me invert the 
institutional order? Does it want the president to adopt 
authoritarian measures? Does it want to see the president 
govern the country without the Congress, without the judicial 
branch? What is the administration's weakness? Is being 
democratic a weakness? As Otavio Mangabeira [former foreign 
minister from 1926 to 1930] used to say, democracy is a frail 
plant. Our democracy is still a frail plant. We are obeying 
the principles of democracy, which we might very well quote 
here: Without liberty there is no reason to live and without 
meeting the demands of justice men will never achieve peace. 
  [Moreno] From your tone we can perceive that this criticism 
affected you most. 
  [Franco] I just ask: What is the government's weakness? The 
government has an economic plan. It supports its finance 
minister and has been supporting other ministers. Where is the 
government's weakness? In the fact of having an earnestly 
democratic president? Some would like to see the democratic 
order inverted. Others would like to see the government disrupt 
the structure of Brazilian parties. Should we disrupt it the 
way others did here in South America? 
  [Moreno] Perhaps, Mr. President, the idea of a weak 
government is associated with your precarious support in 
Congress. So far you have not achieved a solid majority or even 
a circumstantial majority to approve basic bills. 
  [Franco] That has a certain logic, but I ask: Do political 
parties have a strong structure? Often we see that political 
parties have internal problems and some times very strong 
confrontations. Today Brazilian political parties are fragile. 
How was the government formed? The nation was paralyzed in 
amazement and submerged in discouragement and a rebellious 
feeling. We had to coordinate fragmented forces to form a 
government. Parties represented in the government turned 
against the government. In a parliamentary system the cabinet 
would have fallen as a consequence of the crisis in Congress. 
Ministers in the government represent political parties. They 
stopped being named by their political parties as of 15 
December, but they were until then. 
  [Moreno] Political parties argue that a group of personal 
friends from Juiz de Fora [Franco's home town] run the show. 
  [Franco] What group from Juiz de Fora? We have people from 
Juiz de Fora here, but what power center from Juiz de Fora are 
they talking about? Such a power center does not exist. On the 
contrary, the people from Juiz de Fora at the Planalto Palace do 
not participate in the high-level discussions on the country's 
problems. Here we discuss problems with Senator Pedro Simon and 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. We used to discuss them 
with Deputy Antonio Britto and today we talk about them with 
government leader Luiz Carlos Santos. We operate that way. Or 
is the criticism moved by the feeling that the president is a 
man from a country town and, therefore, he cannot govern the 
country? Is it because a man from the provinces cannot rule the 
country? Is it that only powerful men can become president? 
  [Moreno] Do you feel the closeness of the presidential 
election might affect your government? Criticism against you 
increases as the elections get nearer. 
  [Franco] The time has come for those who criticize the 
government to present their candidates for the presidency of the 
Republic. They are all party members. They will have a great 
opportunity to solve the country's problems. Let us see if they 
have the courage to face the public. I would like to see them 
in public squares, at the elections, discussing issues with the 
public. I hope they will have the courage to face the public, 
but not as candidates for deputy or senator, I want to see them 
as presidential candidates. I am very interested to see who 
will be the candidates for the presidency of the Republic. I 
want to know about those who continuously say that they know how 
to solve the country's problems, that national problems are 
easily solved, and that they are not solved only because the 
government is weak, because Mr. Itamar Franco is not prepared 
for the presidency. If they are so wise and so prepared they 
should not hide behind a candidacy to the Senate or the Chamber 
of Deputies. I take advantage of the opportunity to call on 
them to step forward, now is the right time to do it. 
  [Moreno] Will you support any candidate? 
  [Franco] For the time being, the government has no 
candidate. 
  [Moreno] It has been said that you have two candidates: 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Antonio Britto. 
  [Franco] They are two great names, but I am not saying they 
will be our candidates. 
  [Moreno] Will you stay out of the succession process? 
  [Franco] I do not know. We will look at the candidates. I 
need to know who the candidates are. If you are asking if 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a candidate, my 
answer is: I do not know if he is candidate. He has not yet 
discussed that with me. He merely sent me a letter to inform me 
that at this moment he is not thinking about becoming a 
candidate. I do not know if tomorrow he will decide to be a 
candidate. 
  [Moreno] Is it true that you are becoming impatient about 
Cardoso's failure to produce tangible results in his fight 
against inflation? 
  [Franco] Never before has a finance minister had so much 
support from the president of the Republic. I am giving him my 
full support because I believe in his work and in his desire to 
serve his country. 
  [Moreno] What are you planning to do after completing your 
term in office? 
  [Franco] I will go back to my life as an ordinary citizen. I 
do not plan to seek any elective office any more. Many people 
want me to resign in April so that I will be eligible to run for 
governor of Minas Gerais State, but I have declined. I will not 
deny that it has always been my dream to become governor of 
Minas Gerais. I was unfortunately defeated in the ballot boxes. 
I did, however, serve several congressional terms for Minas 
Gerais. I want to become an ordinary citizen again. I have 
asked God not to let power get to my head. Power is a temporary 
thing. While in office one may acquire a false notion of power. 
Your entourage will desert you as soon as you leave office. 
All I want to be is a voter. 
  [Moreno] Did you get excited about the proposed idea to 
allow 
the incumbent president to seek his reelection without having to 
leave office? 
  [Franco] I do not want to interfere in the constitutional 
revision process by raising this issue, but I will say that it 
is not a tradition in Brazil to reelect presidents or governors. 
  [Moreno] What is your opinion about the efforts of your 
friend [Senate government leader] Pedro Simon in bringing the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and PTB 
[Brazilian Labor Party] together to support a single candidate? 
  [Franco] I do not see it as an easy undertaking now. It 
would have been easier before when two forces like the PMDB and 
PSDB were united. The PSDB branched out of the PMDB. I see it 
difficult now. But I am not saying they could not get together 
for the presidential election. All this will depend on the 
patriotic spirit of each sector. [Late PMDB Deputy] Ulysses 
Guimaraes managed to bring Tancredo Neves' Popular Party 
together with the PMDB. 
  [Moreno] Have you already been tempted to seek undemocratic 
solutions? 
  [Franco] I wouldn't say tempted. I have received many 
letters and petitions urging me to do so. 
  [Moreno] From important sectors of society? 
  [Franco] From various sectors. I have never been tempted to 
do that because I am a democrat.

<F P=106> [Report by Cristina Indio do Brasil] </F>
  [Text] The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] yesterday 
succeeded in preventing the vote on the Social Emergency Fund 
[FSE] from being considered a priority issue of the 
constitutional reform. 
  Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena scheduled another 
session of the constitutional reform for today, when the 
government will have a new chance to see the FSE approved. 
  The Congress again met without voting on a measure linked to 
the economic stabilization program because of a lack of quorum. 
They should have voted on the government request that voting on 
the FSE be considered a priority. Only 279 congressmen were on 
the floor, while the presence of at least 293 congressmen is 
required for the vote. 
  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who spent almost 
10 hours in Congress holding separate meetings with the PPR and 
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party to discuss approval of 
the measure, said that the government has nothing more to 
negotiate: 
  [Begin recording] The only thing that I want to make very 
clear is that there is nothing more to negotiate, because every 
minute something new is invented. Everyone is currently 
defending his or her own interests. It is natural for one to 
defend one's own interests. The problem is that no one is 
thinking about the country's interests; no one is worrying about 
society's interests. By saying no one, I am exaggerating. The 
truth is that a large number of people are not thinking about 
the country's interests. 
  I believe we are having a very serious crisis. The Congress 
overcame the crisis resulting from the corruption CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] and began the inactivity 
crisis. [end recording] 
  Despite all, the finance minister hopes that in the session 
scheduled for 1100 this morning Congress can make a decision 
regarding the amendment that creates the FSE. The minister said 
that he will talk to President Itamar Franco, who has supported 
all negotiations between government and Congress. He added that 
the Congress' failure to adopt a clear position has created a 
governability crisis in the country.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso left home 
at 1000 this morning. For 20 minutes he poured his heart out to 
journalists. He said he faced much more than a defeat. 
  Before entering the Finance Ministry, he granted another 
interview and said that late this afternoon he will meet 
President Itamar Franco at Planalto Palace. 
  He really poured out his heart during the interview. He even 
suggested summoning a national constituent assembly to decide, 
once and for all, about the constitutional review. Here are the 
main portions of the minister's interview: 
  [Begin recording] There was no defeat. It was worse than 
that. We again lacked a quorum. We again saw that Congress does 
not want to perform its responsibilities before the country. 
This is not a defeat. It is worse than a defeat. Institutions 
are not fulfilling the duties Brazil believes to be theirs. 
Brazil wants to see them vote yes or no. If they vote no, we 
know what to do, yet Congress simply fails to attend the 
sessions. 
  I will fight. I will fight as long as I can, but only as far 
as the president believes to be reasonable, only as long as I 
believe there is a possibility of adopting constructive actions. 
Someone once said that being a minister is not a permanent 
state. One is a minister only for a certain period of time. 
  The constitutional reform is behind all these difficulties. 
There is a so-called leftist group of congressmen that believes 
there should be no constitutional reform and simply fails to 
attend the session. A conservative group wants the reform but 
is afraid of the changes and, for that reason, does not appear 
at Congress either. The result is anarchy: There is no review, 
reforms are not implemented. The situation is at an impasse. 
If there is no reform, which is the basis of these changes, the 
main Brazilian problems will remain untouched. 
  If we try more effectively to fight tax-evasion, for 
example, 
we are blocked. If we try to increase taxes paid by the 
financial sector, we are blocked. It is curious. When we 
proposed fining the owners of unproductive land and increasing 
taxes on wealthy people, those who always criticized the 
financial sector refused to vote. This proves that the Brazilian 
legislative branch and our legislative culture are always 
seeking alliances and looking for benefits. The price of this 
attitude, however, is paid by the people. 
  If things continue this way -- and I may become convinced 
although I have never favored the idea -- we may summon a 
national constituent assembly. This specific and new assembly 
will have to establish the paths the country will tread. 
Frankly, I no longer believe that Congress, which has been 
badly damaged, has the energy to adopt the decisions Brazil 
needs. Despite efforts by some to apply medicines to heal 
Congress without submitting it to surgery -- like the Corruption 
CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] -- I believe it has 
no energy to make decisions. 
  Will we have to wait a whole year? Will we have to hold 
elections -- God only knows under what conditions -- before 
being able to do something? If we want to do anything it will 
have to be now because the deadline for the constitutional 
reform is near. Would it not be better if the forces that still 
believe in this country got together and said: We will elect a 
group of Brazilians with the exclusive task of conducting the 
constitutional review? This can be done in two or three months. 
  How long will the Brazilian people tolerate this situation, 
particularly when one impasse simply leads to the next? [end 
recording] 
  Minister Cardoso added that he has always been supported by 
the president who has given him carte blanche. He confirmed 
that he will meet the president this afternoon and that any 
decision he adopts will be made jointly with President Franco.

  [Text] In a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies joint 
congressional committee for Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said that Brazil will 
invest nearly $150 million in trade with Argentina, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay this year. 
  Amorim refuted criticism that the implementation of Mercosur 
was being delayed. He added that the member countries are 
merely negotiating schedules with longer adjustment terms for 
the implementation of the common custom fee. 
  The minister told the congressmen that trade among the 
Mercosur member countries has increased from $4.5 billion to $8 
billion in the last three years.

  [Text] The governments of Brazil and Qatar have decided to 
open embassies in Doha and Brasilia one year from now. This 
will be one more effort by the two countries to intensify 
bilateral trade relations. 
  Last year Brazilian imports from Qatar totalled $112 
million, 
basically in oil, while exports to that country amounted to only 
$29 million in chicken and iron ore. 
  The decision was made during the visit to Brazil by Qatar's

of the World Bank over the statement by World Bank Director Said 
Hussein. 
  During a speech to the America's Society, which groups most 
of the bankers with whom Brazil is renegotiating its foreign 
debt, Hussein said Brazil is the biggest cloud on the Latin 
American horizon. 
  In his letter, the Brazilian ambassador said he is surprised 
at this statement because a World Bank official like Hussein 
cannot denigrate the image of a country which that bank should 
help.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Antonio Britto of the Brazilian </F>
Democratic Party Movement in Rio Grande do Sul State, PDMB-RS, 
by Denise Rothenburg in Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Text] [Rothenburg] You have been mentioned as one of the 
preferred candidates in the poll carried out by Ibope [Brazilian 
Public Opinion and Statistics Institute]. Will that make you 
change your mind about running for governor of Rio Grande do Sul? 
  [Britto] For the presidency I am the second choice; for 
governor of Rio Grande do Sul, I am the first choice. I already 
made a commitment with the people of Rio Grande do Sul, and I 
cannot go back on my word. I am candidate for governor, and I 
already prepared an alliance in this regard. I have been 
working for one year to be governor. I believe we can also make 
a great alliance for the presidency. If we can work out an 
alliance, it would be easy to find a candidate. 
  [Rothenburg] Apart from you, a leading candidate among PMDB 
convention delegates is former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes 
Quercia. Do you believe his name would be endorsed by such an 
alliance? 
  [Britto] I do not believe a party could nominate a candidate 
who would have to answer too many questions. I do not know the 
truth about Quercia. I cannot say whether the charges made 
against him are fair or unfair. All I know is that for any 
candidate having the above problem it would be very difficult to 
win votes on the streets. 
  [Rothenburg] Does that mean that he could not be a 
candidate? 
  [Britto] The PMDB and the other parties have other names. We 
have to act judiciously, and weave a strong social-democratic 
alliance already for the first round of the election. We have 
learned in politics that after working out an alliance it is 
easier to find candidates. Yet without an alliance, no 
candidate will stand a chance. Winning the election should not 
be our only priority at this time. Collor did just that. We 
must also guarantee governability. By doing this, we would be 
innovating in Brazil by having a president who will in fact rule 
the country. Neither Sarney, nor Collor, nor Franco managed to 
do that. 
  [Rothenburg] But to weave that alliance it will be necessary 
to overcome regional interests. For instance, do you find it 
possible to unite Quercia, [Sao Paulo Govenor Luiz Antonio] 
Fleury, and [Brazilian Social Democracy Party Senator Mario] 
Covas in Sao Paulo? 
  [Britto] In this election we will have to follow that old 
popular saying "we either spend our money to eat, or we just 
keep our money." If we want a strong president, we must 
overcome our regional interests and sacrifice some fellow 
members in some states. If political parties choose to push for 
regional interests, we will not have a strong alliance or a 
candidate. As the popular saying goes, we will have to choose 
between either food or money.

downtown Manacapuru, 80 km from Manaus. The company owners 
disappeared but the last shipment of wood ready for shipment was 
left on the banks of the Solimoes River. The people living in 
the area told Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Renewable Natural Resources] inspectors that the U.S. company 
(Hatch Main) has been buying wood from the region's Indians for 
more than eight months. 
  The inspectors discovered that the wood was shipped 
clandestinely directly to the United States, and that because of 
the wood's condition they believe it would be used for railroad 
ties. Ibama inspectors believe all the wood smuggled by the 
company was enough to build at least 300 km of railroad tracks. 
The shipment seized by Ibama, which is worth almost 6 million 
real cruzeiros, has more than 1,000 railroad ties of 
macaranduba, which is a high-quality wood that is becoming rare 
in the Amazon. The Federal Police now will investigate the 
whereabouts of the Americans and try to discover who was 
facilitating the shipment. [end recording]
