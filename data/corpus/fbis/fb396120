  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- National Coffee Council, CNC, 
President Manoel Bertone on 2 February said the government 
decision to transfer the national coffee retention program to 
the private sector has advantages and disadvantages. "The main 
disadvantage is that Brazilian producers will lose 
competitiveness regarding their international competitors 
because our export costs will increase," Bertone said. However, 
he estimates that this system gives the retention program 
greater credibility and is not as strong an interference as a 
confiscation system would be. 
  According to a decision by the Industry, Commerce, and 
Tourism Ministry, as of 1 March the government will transfer to 
exporters the job of retaining 20 percent of the volume of 
coffee exports. In Bertone's opinion, the government's decision 
is the closest to a market solution. 
  The CNC president said Brazil knows that its competitors 
also 
are facing an identical situation. "This has led our competitors 
to seek new methods to raise coffee prices, as in the case of 
the minimum registry system adopted in Colombia," he said.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 3 
February. 
  Sao Paulo industry grew 11.2 percent in 1993. The Sao Paulo 
State Federation of Industries reported that the Industrial 
Activity Index in December was 13.1 percent higher than the same 
month in 1992, and 1.2-percent higher than in November. The 
number of employed people in the industrial sector dropped 3.8 
percent compared with the previous year. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 27 Jan 94 p B5) 
  The Average General Price Index, IGP-M, which measures 
inflation according to the financial market, ended January with 
an inflation rate of 39.07 percent. The index is 0.75-percent 
higher than the December rate. The January inflation rate is the 
highest since March 1990. (Rio de Janerio Rede Globo Television 
in Portuguese 2200 GMT 31 Jan 94) 
  The Bank do Brasil, BB, had a net profit of $388.8 million 
in 
1993, lower than 1992's $446.7 million. The BB plans to auction 
its shares in 83 companies after Carnival on the Rio de Janeiro 
stock exchange. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 1 Feb 
94 p 1)

<F P=106> [Interview with BNDES [National Bank for Economic and </F>
Social Development] president Persio Arida, by Miriam Leitao and 
Luiz Noronha, place and date not given; first three paragraphs 
are O GLOBO introduction] 
  [Text] During the entire time the FH [Fernando Henrique] 
Plan was being readied, economist Persio Arida remained in the 
background. He said very little and was hardly ever seen in 
public. On the day the plan was announced in Brasilia, he sat 
discreetly in a side chair at the large table that had been set 
up on the platform in the press conference room at the Ministry 
of Finance. 
  The first journalist in line at the microphone opened the 
question period. What Arida had tried to conceal was then 
revealed. The other members of the economic team and the 
officials seated at the table looked in his direction for the 
response. Rather awkwardly, he began to answer and became the 
central figure during practically the entire press conference. 
  At age 41, Persio Arida is, for the second time in his life, 
a key player on an economic team that is involved in a 
stabilization plan. The first time was during the Cruzado Plan. 
Still professorial, he displays more enthusiasm when he talks 
about the theoretical concept of the plan than about its 
practical application. He thinks it is too early to unveil 
mysteries such as, for example, whether the exchange rate 
between the new currency and the dollar will be a fixed rate. 
But he left no doubt on one point: the plan will cause losses, 
mainly for those who have something to gain from inflation. 
There is only one trick to guaranteeing this kind of plan: 
"political coalition." He also explains why he is staying in 
Rio, as president of the BNDES, rather than going to Brasilia. 
"Privatization is an integral part of any stabilization process." 
  [O GLOBO] The inflation rate is rising, the money supply is 
expanding, the Central Bank is having trouble selling bonds, and 
everyone thinks the minister will step down in April. Is this a 
good time for an economic plan? 
  [Persio Arida] Indeed the inflation rate has risen, but this 
must be attributed to a farm products price shock. But 
government paper is not being rejected; the NTN [National 
Treasury Notes] auctions prove this. As for the monetary 
expansion, it is a mistake that we must market bonds to shrink 
the monetary base. Building up reserves will produce practically 
the same effect. 
  [O GLOBO] So this is a good time? 
  [Persio Arida] A good time is when the public finances are 
in 
order. Now, therefore, is not really a good time. Unless the 
budget and the fiscal adjustment are approved, the right moment 
will not be created. That is what is most important. 
Furthermore, a stabilization plan announced during a "supply 
shock" will run into trouble. The third feature of a good time 
is the existence of a consensus in the minds of the public and 
the government about the imperatives of the stabilization. 
Stabilization does not come about because of an act by the 
finance minster. Any stabilization involves a net gain for 
society, but it always involves losses. 
  [O GLOBO] How does the apprehension about Minister Fernando 
Henrique's candidacy affect that coalition? 
  [Persio Arida] I would rather comment in greater depth on 
the 
political coalition. Stabilization involves far-reaching changes 
in the way the economy functions. It is not something that is 
applied topically. A technically well-designed program that does 
not have the backing of the public has a good chance of failure. 
That is why the question of the right moment, aside from the 
fiscal requisite, depends essentially on magic--in the sense 
that it charms, enchants, and so wins the support of society. 
  [O GLOBO] You mentioned losses. Are they digestible? 
  [Persio Arida] Every program has its costs. Since the 
identified losers have a stronger lobby than the scattered 
winners, the political balance is unquestionably difficult to 
maintain. 
  [O GLOBO] The initial version of the plan called for a slow, 
voluntary transition to the new currency. But no economist 
believes it is possible to eliminate a 40 percent [monthly] 
inflation rate this way. 
  [Persio Arida] The fact that contracting in URV's [Real 
Value 
Unit] is voluntary does not mean a drop in the inflation rate 
will not cause losses. We have had high inflation rates for more 
than two decades. We must assume that this inflation has deep 
roots. I would be the last to say that everyone will win. 
  [O GLOBO] And do you think this country is mature enough to 
understand this clearly? 
  [Persio Arida] My assessment is that our society is 
maturing.... 
  [O GLOBO] Maturing? 
  [Persio Arida] It is a process, it really is. Most of our 
problems were inherited from the decade of the 70's, the era of 
big nationalizations and regimentation of the economy. The State 
was the driving force of the Brazilian capitalist system; it had 
a fantastic power to choose the losers and the winners. That led 
to a series of imbalances. 
  [O GLOBO] When you ask a businessman if he believes the plan 
will turn out well, he answers that he is rooting for it. The 
fans are as irrational as those at a soccer game, but the public 
is not convinced that the plan can turn out well. What are the 
actual chances that the plan will work? 
  [Persio Arida] There are lots of fans, but plenty of 
caution. 
Some of the doubts result from the fact that stabilization in 
Brazil is truly difficult to achieve. We have said, 
simplistically, that Brazil has one currency for the rich and 
another one for the poor. But it reflects what is happening. An 
appreciable portion of our population has no bank accounts and, 
if they do, they cannot invest. That part of the population is 
the big beneficiary of a decline in the inflation rate. For 
those who are indexed, a 40 percent inflation rate is not so 
serious. "Serious" is what it is for the great majority of 
Brazilians. But it is interesting to note that all attempts at 
stabilization in Brazil have had popular support. 
  [O GLOBO] The popularity ratings of a finance minister 
usually go up in the same proportion as inflation declines. 
Imagine what would happen to a minister who is already popular 
when the inflation rate is at 40 percent.... 
  [Persio Arida] Stabilization is a difficult process. It 
demands an ability to resist very strong pressures--pressure not 
only from the general public, but from the lobbies. Some lobbies 
are rooting for the plan, provided the adjustments are made by 
others, not by them. The budget issue is an example of this. 
Everyone wants to cut someone else's spending. Stabilization 
demands a determined government. 
  [O GLOBO] Does the government have any appetite for going 
against special interests? 
  [Persio Arida] That is one of its biggest tests: being able 
to cut, and to defend the cuts in Congress. 
  [O GLOBO] The Congress does not want to bear the burden of 
the chaos that would follow the rejection of the budget, but it 
will certainly try to debate certain points. What points are 
non-negotiable? 
  [Persio Arida] We are talking about balancing the budget. 
Therefore, there is a quantitative restriction. We cannot depart 
from our zero goal. We have to be careful, because it is not 
only the zero goal that is important; the quality of the result 
matters, too. The budget has always involved estimates. If we 
overestimate the expected revenue, we will have a budget that 
will look balanced, but may not be so in the long run. In other 
words, depending on how it is done, one zero is not the same as 
another zero. Negotiation is part of any democratic process. 
  [O GLOBO] In a recent interview, you said that the more time 
spent in the process of adopting the new index mechanism, the 
better. However, Minister Fernando Henrique has said just the 
opposite. 
  [Persio Arida] With inflation at 40 percent, of course the 
faster the process moves, the better. That is what I want to 
see, too. The more rapidly the parts come together, the better. 
  [O GLOBO] But if it goes too quickly, might it not produce a 
hyperinflation in terms of the real cruzeiro? 
  [Persio Arida] We would like to see this recontracting in 
URV's translate into a real and permanent equilibrium. If we set 
deadlines, that will lead to ill-conceived transactions. 
Reducing the average period of indexation makes the index more 
volatile, both upward and downward. That is why it is a step 
that can only be taken when conditions are favorable. If we 
start from the hypothesis that the fiscal adjustment will be 
delayed and will not be approved, the tendency will be to 
stretch out the indexation. 
  [O GLOBO] Do you believe we are vulnerable to a risk of 
hyperinflation? 
  [Persio Arida] The classic definition of hyperinflation is 
an 
inflation rate above 50 percent. That definition comes from 
Philip Cagan, and is based on the inflationary processes that 
preceded World War II, when the financial system was not as 
technologically sophisticated as it is today. Those were 
processes that entered into spontaneous combustion. Once the 
process got started, people took their money out of the banks 
and tried to buy more things. The more they bought, the higher 
prices rose and the worse things got for those who had not yet 
bought. Our experience at the end of the Sarney administration 
was different from classic hyperinflation. The economy was still 
functioning, more or less. 
  [O GLOBO] Even so, isn't the approval of the fiscal 
adjustment a race against time? 
  [Persio Arida] No question. The sooner it passes, the 
better. 
  [O GLOBO] If it is passed, will this country get the URV the 
following month? 
  [Persio Arida] The URV is a complex mechanism--the details 
are still being discussed within the administration. The basic 
concept was developed within a principle of flexibility. The 
stabilization process is like a game of chess. In that sense, no 
matter how well a good player can anticipate some of the moves, 
there is always the imponderable. That is why it is important 
that the mechanism be flexible enough to open up a range of 
possibilities. 
  [O GLOBO] Let us anticipate just one move: will the exchange 
rate between the new currency and the dollar be a fixed rate? 
  [Persio Arida] That question of the exchange rate has been 
framed as the biggest doubt about what will happen in the third 
phase. 
  [O GLOBO] In the Cavallo phase of the Brazilian plan? 
  [Persio Arida] You said that; I didn't. Any discussion of 
the 
third phase would be premature at present. I am not trying to 
evade the question, but there is something wrong with the 
Brazilian monetary system today. There needs to be an 
institutional change in this area. In Argentina, they 
established a fixed rule, an automatic rule. In Brazil, changes 
often require changes in laws. 
  [O GLOBO] How will it be possible to privatize 34 companies 
this year, as planned, if only one has been privatized in the 
four months since you took office? 
  [Persio Arida] The privatization process has a long 
gestation 
period. We will not be starting from zero in all 34 companies; 
many have already been appraised. Of course there are problems. 
It is easier to sell off a steel mill than an electric power 
company, which involves a public utility concession. 
  [O GLOBO] Even if it is technically possible, is there the 
political will to privatize 34 companies in the final year of an 
administration? 
  [Persio Arida] Privatization is an integral part of any 
stabilization process. It is a contradiction in terms to pursue 
a stabilization program without making progress in 
privatization. The state still has a regulatory and indicative 
role. The electric utility sector in the United States is 
completely private, but it is also completely regulated. Having 
state ownership is extremely costly. Look at the question from 
the standpoint of the public debt. On the one hand, the Treasury 
has properties; on the other, it has very high debt service 
costs. It reminds one of a man who owns a huge tract of land and 
is paying astronomical carrying charges, but will not sell a 
single piece of his property. 
  [O GLOBO] It would be wonderful if the administration, as a 
whole, believed that, wouldn't it? 
  [Persio Arida] That is a process of maturation. It goes 
slowly. Our culture had always been a culture of the 
paternalistic state. 
  [O GLOBO] Talking about the paternalistic state, what is the 
new role of the BNDES? 
  [Persio Arida] I am convinced that if the state resumes its 
growth at an accelerated pace, the bottlenecks in the 
infrastructure will show up very dramatically. These are 
projects that mature over a long time and are complicated to put 
together. They are projects for which the backing of a 
development bank is very important. The problem is that all 
these projects are under the control of the State. Given the 
State's financial crisis, guaranteeing a return on those 
investments is a very different task, depending on whether they 
are undertaken by the public sector or by the private sector. 
The process is intimately tied to the privatization of those 
same services; otherwise, the money gets lost in the web of 
reciprocal debits of the public sector. 
  [O GLOBO] But the BNDES has lost so much by lending to the 
private sector.... 
  [Persio Arida] We are working very, very hard to recover the 
sums owed us. If you look at the renegotiated credits, you will 
find the bulk of them are in the public sector. The BNDES does 
not make subsidized loans to anyone. Those days are over. 
Subsidies and forgiveness of debts no longer exist here. 
  [O GLOBO] Do you think BNDES employees are too highly paid? 
  [Persio Arida] Concepts of equity have been distorted in 
public administration. There are all kinds of inequalities: 
between branches of government, within the Executive Branch, and 
within the state enterprises. Salaries in the state enterprises 
are not too high in comparison with those in private enterprise, 
but they are ridiculously higher than those in the direct 
government administration. The entire direct administration 
earns very little. We need fewer civil servants, and higher 
salaries. Public officials should be well paid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Nelson Jobim by Luis Costa Pinto, </F>
conducted "last week," place not given; first two paragraphs are 
VEJA introduction] 
  [Text] Deputy Nelson Jobim, of the Rio Grande do Sul PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], is now one of the most 
overworked legislators in Brasilia. Three months ago, Jobim was 
elected rapporteur of the constitutional revision process--the 
corrections that are to be made in the 1988 Constitution. He has 
had not a moment's peace since then. After barely two weeks as 
rapporteur, he had to swap his cellular telephone with a friend 
and install an answering machine in his house. Jobim spends 
hardly any time at home now. He eats, drinks, and sleeps 
constitutional revision. "During the day, I even drink tea and 
coffee while talking about the revision," the deputy joked. The 
task is Herculean. The deadline for submission of amendments has 
now expired; there are a total of 17,000 suggestions. All of 
them will pass through a screening process coordinated by Jobim, 
who will have four deputy rapporteurs to help him with the job. 
  So far, all this work on a subject as important as the 
constitutional revision has been obscured by the Budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee]. Legislators will have 
to work hard from now on, if the revision is to be finished by 
15 March, the date set by Congress for promulgation of the 
revised text. The importance of the subject merits such an 
effort. "The country needs this revision," Jobim said. "The 
bottlenecks that hold back production and the economy are in the 
tax area, and in the concentration of monopolies in the hands of 
the government." At age 47, married, three children, an attorney 
on leave from his partnership in a law firm with offices in 
Brasilia and Rio Grande do Sul, Jobim will have even more work 
to do between now and 15 March. He wants to end government 
monopolies, change the social security system, establish an 
external control over the judiciary, and approve a tax reform 
package that will reduce the number of taxes and increase the 
number of taxpayers. Last week, in the midst of reading the 
proposed amendments, the deputy gave VEJA the following 
interview: 
  [Costa Pinto] Are you sure we are going to get a revision? 
  [Jobim] Yes, we will get a revision. All we need to do to 
make this more obvious to the general public is to agree on a 
minimum agenda listing the topics of the revision. Starting this 
week, I will hold separate conversations with all the party 
leaders to reach such an understanding. I am going to talk to 
parties that oppose the revision, such as the PT [Workers 
Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PC do B [Communist Party 
of Brazil], and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]. We will 
start the debate on the revision by discussing legislative 
immunity, a subject on which those parties cannot fail to 
express an opinion. Once we have given it an initial kick, the 
revision will get moving. 
  [Costa Pinto] What will be on this minimum agenda? 
  [Jobim] The agenda will represent a consensus of my 
conversations with the leaders. I see two blocs of issues. 
One--economic--includes tax reform, changes in the monopoly 
system, and restructuring of the pact between the federal 
government and the states. The other--political--concerns 
modifying the elections system. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will the revision generate a revised and 
expanded, or a revised and abridged, edition of the Constitution? 
  [Jobim] As rapporteur, I want to produce an abridged version 
of the Constitution. We have made a rule: no inventions. There 
is no room for unnecessary novelties, for creating new issues 
and new chapters. To the extent that more issues are placed into 
the Constitution, the powers of Congress are reduced and those 
of the judges, of the Judiciary, expanded. The 
constitutionalization of subject matter leads to the 
jurisdictionalization of politics, i.e., giving the Federal 
Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on everything that is done 
in this country, because everything becomes a constitutional 
matter; this curtails the freedom of the Executive Branch and 
the legislators. 
  [Costa Pinto] How will the Congress find time to debate the 
merits of the 17,000 amendments submitted for the constitutional 
revision? 
  [Jobim] We are not going to discuss the amendments one by 
one, only the topics of the revision and their merits. We have 
received 80 amendments that regulate the president's use of 
"provisional measures." I will not read all of them. We need to 
find out what the majority thinks about the subject and then 
draft consensus amendments inspired by those 80 original 
amendments. You would not believe how much repetition there is 
in those 17,000 amendments. 
  [Costa Pinto] Is the 1988 Constitution that bad? 
  [Jobim] I would divide the 1988 Constitution into two parts. 
The part on individual rights and guarantees, which is very 
good, and the part on the design of the State--which is faulty. 
We must redefine federalism and the system of government, 
because the Constitution is very unsatisfactory on those points. 
We have to do something about the Judiciary, an area where the 
1988 Constituent Assembly made no progress at all. The way money 
is spent in Brazil is wrong, and the CPI's are proof of that. 
When we drafted the present Constitution, we were looking 
backward. Everything that the military had done looked wrong to 
us. That is not reality. 
  [Costa Pinto] It is not for lack of laws that Brazil is in 
crisis. Do we really need this revision, which is, after all, a 
process of enacting new laws? 
  [Jobim] We do. The bottlenecks that hold back production and 
the economy are in the tax area, and in the concentration of 
monopolies in the hands of the government. In 1988, we gave 
special favors to outmoded monopolistic protectionism, something 
very common in mercantile capitalism, and we forgot to protect 
the user, the consumer--in short, the taxpayer. We ended up 
creating an economy of special privilege, a monopolistic economy 
that leans toward statism, that does not protect the ordinary 
Brazilian. This habit of creating laws is a fault we inherited 
from the Portuguese. They thought they could resolve things that 
way, and even today they have one of the world's most 
complicated bureaucracies. But, on the other hand, you cannot 
modernize institutions without enacting laws. Our big mistake 
was to transform laws into speeches, making everything polemic. 
  [Costa Pinto] In an election year, will legislators be 
capable of drafting a Constitution that reduces the size of the 
State, changes the tax system, ends retirement based on length 
of service, and redistributes the obligations between governors 
and mayors? 
  [Jobim] Administrative decentralization is one of the 
strongest trends that is emerging in this revision. It is a way 
of redesigning the State by redoing the federative pact. The CPI 
on PC Farias concluded that the corruption of the Executive 
Branch was possible only because of the concentration of powers 
in the hands of the president of the Republic and the ministers. 
States and cities, which won more revenues starting in 1988, 
must now assume new obligations, and the federal bureaucracy 
that is entrenched in Brasilia opposes this, because it would 
curb Brasilia's power. The suppliers are another group that is 
rising up against decentralization. It is easier to corrupt a 
centralized State--you just go to Brasilia--than to travel 
around the country buying special privileges. With 
administrative decentralization, you also dilute the power of 
politicians, who love to propagate problems so they can sell 
solutions. This renovation of the State has to be part of the 
party discourse. One legislator cannot take an unpopular 
position like this because he will get burned, but the parties 
have an obligation to adopt this line. After all, if they expect 
to come to power, they need to be concerned about what they will 
inherit. 
  [Costa Pinto] Why, and by whom, was the agreement made not 
to 
meddle with the so-called "social conquests" of the 1988 
Constitution? 
  [Jobim] I did that. Early last year, I was at a meeting of 
businessmen in Porto Alegre, attended by American economists, 
and everyone jumped all over the rights of workers as stated in 
the Constitution. I told them that if they thought the purpose 
of the revision was to take away worker rights, they were not 
only mistaken, but they would kill all chances of accomplishing 
anything. The revision would become ideologized, and centrist 
parties like the PMDB and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] would be shoved over toward the Left and forced to forge 
alliances with the PT and the communist parties. I made them 
realize that the important thing is to change the economic order 
and the social security system, end the monopolies, and 
modernize the federative pact. After that, the leaders of the 
PMDB and PSDB agreed to take a firm stand against changes in the 
social conquests. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] did not take a 
position, making it clear that it would go along with that 
agreement. 
  [Costa Pinto] Two polls, one by Diap and another by 
MultiConsultoria, found that more than 70 percent of the 
legislators want to change the electoral system by instituting 
mixed district voting. What kind of election system is Brazil 
likely to have after the revision? 
  [Jobim] The trend I have observed in the amendments 
submitted 
is toward the mixed district vote. Our election system has 
outlived its usefulness. It dates from 1932, which was the 
Getulio Vargas era, when Minas and Sao Paulo were taking turns 
electing the presidents, when there were no political parties. 
After this revision, we will probably have election of regional 
deputies and national deputies. The current election system is 
brutal: it induces the country not to think. No one gets elected 
on national issues. 
  [Costa Pinto] Might the revision vote on only the most 
pressing topics now and leave the rest to 1995? 
  [Jobim] No. There will be only one revision. The revision 
proposed by the 1988 Constituent Assembly has to begin and end 
without intermissions. And how could we carry out a revision in 
1995, with a new Congress and a new president? If new the 
president has a majority, he would conduct a revision in his 
image and likeness. If he is weak, he would become a hostage to 
Congress. 
  [Jobim] From what you have already read of the amendments in 
the tax area, what model of tax collection and how many taxes 
are likely to survive in the revised Constitution? 
  [Costa Pinto] There are eight kinds of complete proposals 
for 
tax reform. Six of them retain the classic concept of taxation 
on income, consumption, and property. What almost all of them 
have in common is elimination of points of over-taxation, such 
as a reduction in the burden on payrolls, in exchange for a new 
withholding tax rate of 5 percent that would catch all wages and 
salaries. There are also two more radical proposals, such as the 
one by Flavio Rocha, which would leave Brazil with only three 
taxes: the IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], the 
tax on foreign trade, and a tax on beverages and games of 
chance. Then there is a proposal by Deputy Luis Roberto Ponte 
that would leave us with eight taxes. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will Brazil have fewer state enterprises and 
be 
free of the monopolies after 1994? 
  [Jobim] The state enterprises are the thorn in the side of 
this revision, and this country. The State is no longer an agent 
of production as it was in the 1950's and 1960's. State 
enterprises are not a subject of the constitutional 
revision--monopolies are. Today we have three big state 
monopolies: petroleum, telecommunications, and nuclear energy. 
No amendments suggest changes in the nuclear field. As for 
petroleum, some amendments that would completely abolish the 
monopoly, leaving Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] 
with nothing to do. Others seek a middle ground--maintaining the 
monopoly on exploration and drilling for petroleum in the hands 
of Petrobras and privatizing the refining and distribution. Then 
there are amendments that would allow private enterprise to 
enter all phases, by government concession. The problems in 
telecommunications are exactly the same, and the proposals are 
similar. Now from what I have already seen and discussed in the 
Congress, I can say with certainty that the monopolies will not 
stay the way they are. How they will change, I cannot yet say. 
We need to get a feeling as to what kind of State the majority 
of congressmen want. An interventionist State? A regulatory 
State? A do-nothing State? This issue will split the body 
between neoliberals, advocates of greater flexibility, and 
statists. 
  [Costa Pinto] Hasn't the attention paid to the Budget CPI 
cooled off the debates on the constitutional revision? 
  [Jobim] Actually, it was a good thing that the spotlights 
were turned toward the CPI. Without unproductive debates on 
bureaucracy, the revision was able to get a head start on its 
deadlines and only now, when ideology and the different parties' 
plans for Brazil are coming to the fore, will we go back to 
discussing ideas. That is why the CPI did not hurt us, it 
helped. Now that the CPI's deadline has been extended to the 
24th, voting on the revision could start on the 26th. 
  [Costa Pinto] But the revision has to end on 15 March. And 
Carnival falls in the middle of that period. Isn't that too 
little time for the public to participate in the revision? 
  [Jobim] The timetable is certainly tight, but the public 
should and will participate in the debate. But I must remind you 
that this is not a Constituent Assembly, and nothing is going to 
be invented. We are only going to rewrite and delete. Tax 
reform, which is perhaps the most controversial topic and the 
one that most directly affects the average citizen, has been 
under discussion for two years now. The rest are well-known 
topics--they may be controversial because they are ideological, 
but I do not see the general public mobilizing against the 
revision. The vested interests are against it, yes. But it seems 
to me that they are also against citizens and taxpayers. 
  [Costa Pinto] How can a good Constitution prevent, or at 
least make it more difficult for thieves to get into the 
political machinery and how can it prevent reruns of CPI's like 
the ones on PC Farias and the budget? 
  [Jobim] We can close the loopholes in the Constitution that 
are open to corruption. We do not need to stiffen the penalties 
against corrupt individuals, what we need to do is prevent 
corruption by reducing the size of the State. If Brasilia's 
power over the aspirations of Brazil is diminished and the 
oversight mechanisms are strengthened, we will have made a fine 
contribution to this country. Increasing the repressive 
machinery does not reduce corruption; on the contrary, it raises 
the stakes in the battle of good versus evil, and makes the 
corrupt more creative. 
  [Costa Pinto] Will the revision tend to improve the 
relationship between the executive, judicial, and legislative 
branches, or will the three parties continue to clash with each 
other? 
  [Jobim] The American Constitution created three branches of 
government so that they could share the power. Now--and this is 
not merely a Brazilian phenomenon--we have separate institutions 
that fight among themselves for the power to be a branch of 
government. The Executive Branch wants to be the Legislative 
Branch and get rid of the Judiciary. The Legislative loves to 
play at being the Executive, and the Judiciary likes to be all 
three together. In a democratic state, power exists only if 
those who hold it are responsible to the nation. There is a 
social duty to be accountable to the ordinary people, but none 
of the three branches permit administrative oversight and they 
do not have independent sources of revenue. When people talk 
about external control over the Judiciary, they are talking 
about the rendering of an administrative and financial 
accounting. On that point I will not yield. There is no 
justification for a superior court judge--in Brasilia for 
example--to take two years to write up the opinion on a decision 
on which the full court has voted. The decision is not valid 
until the opinion has been issued, so why is that judge holding 
back those opinions? I don't know. But that situation exists, 
and it is going on right now. 
  [Costa Pinto] And the PMDB? Don't you feel uncomfortable 
belonging to a party that is the target of so many charges of 
corruption, one that has no platform? 
  [Jobim] We must not confuse personal relationships with 
political ones. The problem with the PMDB is that we have no 
party line. We have nothing to say to the country. We have no 
platform and no model for Brazil. Having a platform is crucial 
to party unity. If it does not exist, then unity moves into the 
personal field. In 1994, we peemedebistaswill take 
refuge in our regional realities and will, in the last analysis, 
be absent from the national political debate. We in Rio Grande 
do Sul decided not to leave the party because southerners have a 
hard time understanding such changes. We decided to stay and 
fight to purge the party of the bad apples and give the party a 
purpose. 
  [Costa Pinto] If Quercia or Sarney get control of the PMDB 
machine and become viable presidential candidacies, would you 
vote for them? 
  [Jobim] There is no possibility of my voting for either of 
them. I would even work against them, and would urge the PMDB in 
Rio Grande do Sul to rebel against them. 
  [Costa Pinto] Does the fact that the government has had no 
leader in the Chamber for three weeks now, and has not submitted 
proposals for the revision help, or hinder? 
  [Jobim] The administration's absence from the revision is 
unfortunate. The logic of the presidential system of government 
depends heavily on the president of the Republic. He sets the 
tone for the opposition. We lack an opposition simply because 
there is a feeling that we also lack a government. Itamar has 
forgotten that he sits in a chair where one is supposed to think 
about the country. 
  [Costa Pinto] And Itamar--does he help, or hinder? 
  [Jobim] He neither helps nor hinders, and that's the worst 
of 
it. He is neglecting his duties. His administration lacks 
substance. It's spongy. One minister pulls the government to 
one side, wanting to enact a tax reform and balance the books, 
but another minister wants to rehire 100,000 civil servants. 
Itamar is the head of a government that lacks direction. Note 
that I am not questioning the president's intentions--only the 
way he is doing his job.

  [Text] Quito's streets are totally paralyzed. No violence 
has been reported, but our correspondents in all of the 
provinces and throughout Quito indicated the strike has been in 
effect since this morning. The strike by workers, teachers, 
students, Indians, and other segments of society was called to 
demand the repeal of the increase of as much as 70 percent in 
the price of gasoline. 
  After the first two hours of this protest action, which has 
been described as preventative, there is a complete absence of 
public transportation; there have been no outbursts of violence; 
and all activities are suspended, even within the oil sector. 
Government Minister Marcelo Santos has appealed to the 
sensibility and understanding of the Ecuadoran people, but he 
did not rule out the possibility of a decree ordering a military 
mobilization if such a move becomes necessary. 
  So far, the toll of the student protests prior to today's 
strike amounts to 70 people arrested; 10 people injured, 
including both policemen and students; huge monetary losses; and 
the destruction of private property. In addition, the members 
of the economic team may face an interpellation. 
  A pot banging protest has been announced for Monday. On 
Tuesday, Indians will go on a nationwide stoppage. The economic 
measures have dealt a hard blow to the economy of the people, 
and protests are increasing.

  [Text] Quito, 3 Feb (EFE) -- Ecuador has been partially 
paralyzed today during the first few hours of a nationwide 
strike called by labor federations and other sectors to protest 
gasoline price increases of up to 71 percent. In Quito and 
other cities, mass transportation has been reduced considerably, 
and thousands of people are walking in the main streets, some 
going to work while others head to participate in demonstrations 
scheduled for today. 
  Local media estimate that only one out of 10 buses is 
providing service this morning. The few buses circulating are 
filled with passengers hanging out of doors and even windows. 
  Picketing has closed several main streets in Quito since 
early this morning, and it has prevented the circulation of 
private cars, whose number is fewer than normal. In some 
provinces in the Andean region, demonstrators have closed 
national highways. Military and police units are protecting 
many intersections and main streets, where some clashes with 
demontrators have already taken place. 
  Disturbances have not ceased in Quito for a week to protest 
the government's increase in gasoline prices. Police sources 
are reporting dozens of people are being injured and arrested 
every day, but there has been no official report giving overall 
figures. 
  The strike has been felt with greatest force in the 
industrial sectors of the capital and other cities in the Andean 
region. According to local media, the strike has not been felt 
as strong in Guayaquil, Ecuador's most populated city with 2 
million residents.

<F P=106> [Report by Eufemia Salazar and Jorge Ivan Melo from downtown </F>
Quito] 
  [Text] [Salazar] Roads leading to the Legislative Palace 
have been closed to traffic. Workers are picketing -- primarily 
workers from [words indistinct] municipal, Eugenia Espejo 
Hospital, and Isidro Ayora Maternity Hospital, who are blocking 
normal traffic and transportation. 
  Social Security Fund workers have also taken to the streets 
to protest the government-decreed increases in gasoline prices. 
Transportation has come to a virtual standstill. Pedestrians 
[words indistinct] groups of workers also are walking through 
the capital's streets to demonstrate. In general, operations of 
most businesses and commercial outlets are limited. 
  We have statements by workers from Quito Electric Co. who 
say 
that so far, in the first hours of the strike, the strike by the 
FUT [United Workers Front] has been absolutely successful. 
  [Begin unidentified worker recording] [words indistinct] we 
must protest [words indistinct] because this kind of measure 
adopted by the government adversely affects the people. Indeed, 
the government has betrayed us and is betraying [words 
indistinct]. This is the reason we are protesting, and we will 
continue to protest as long as [words indistinct] and eliminates 
measures on gasoline. [end recording] 
  [Salazar] Workers from Eugenio Espejo Hospital and Isidro 
Ayora Maternity Hospital also made statements favoring the FUT 
strike. Let us listen to the head of the Eugenio Espejo Hospital 
union: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified union leader] We feel as 
[words indistinct] these latest measures have worsened the 
economic crisis, not only for workers but also for citizens. We 
are here seeing that the patients are getting worse attention; 
they are going to die here [words indistinct]. We reject the 
government measures and ask that they be repealed as soon as 
possible, because workers will take this strike to its ultimate 
consequences [words indistinct] in a preventive manner. We are 
going to adopt more radical measures, just like the government 
is applying radical, terrorist, and criminal measures against 
the people and against the working class. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will you observe the call made by 
the 
FUT for a general strike? 
  [Worker] Regrettably we [words indistinct] we believe that 
[words indistinct] commitment with the government. We, as 
workers, will adopt our own measures. We heard this was a day 
of protest and we have come out to protest. [end recording] 
  These were the statements by the president of the Federation 
of Eugenio Espejo Hospital and Isidro Ayora Maternity Hospital 
Workers. Now, Jorge Ivan Melo has this news bulletin: 
  [Melo] Greetings to Radio Quito and Ecuador Radio 
Information 
System listeners throughout the country. 
  We are here near the Central Ecuador University, where 
students and police have clashed in recent days. We see very 
few university students in the area or nearby streets. They are 
burning tires and logs, and they are chanting slogans against 
the government for increasing gas prices by 70 percent. 
  On 10th of August Street and Carrion Avenue, where the 
Foreign Relations Ministry is located, there are some students 
accompanied by workers burning tires and logs. They have 
blocked traffic, and all vehicles have disappeared from this 
part of town. We can also report that only some stores in areas 
near the university are open.

  [Text] Because of strict security measures established 
around the Presidential Palace, no one can approach the area 
unless he can justify his reasons entering the building. 
Municipal workers, however, have arrived at the Municipal Palace 
building and are staging protests outside. They have said they 
will support any measure decided on by the United Workers Front 
[FUT] and labor organizations. 
  In Quito, demonstrations and clashes between the National 
Police and workers and students are slowly gaining strength, 
specifically in the Theater Plaza near the Ecuadoran Federation 
of Classist Organizations headquarters where some labor leaders 
are protesting. The protest is gaining momentum in nearby areas. 
People are blocking traffic in the El Tejar tunnels. Students 
and workers are sporadically gathering, and when they are 
dispersed, they gather somewhere else to continue their protests. 
  There is absolutely no transportation in downtown Quito. 
There is no means of transportation in the historic part of the 
city. Taxis have disappeared. In the [word indistinct] area, 
where buses were circulating, they have disappeared given the 
growing demonstrations. 
  This is where the bus drivers union, the Pichincha Drivers 
Union, is located. It has also been attacked by people who are 
protesting. Diverse sectors have rejected the transportation 
sector's attitude, which has not joined the strike. In the 
historic part of the city, the strike is all encompassing. We 
can observe hundreds of people walking through the historic part 
of the capital. 
  Businesses and banks have closed their doors due to protests 
and clashes between the police and workers. Also, people cannot 
go about their daily business activities. We were able to 
contact Roberto Paz, government under secretary and president of 
the National Traffic Council, who made statements assessing what 
has taken place in this strike by the FUT. According to the 
government spokesperson, everything is normal throughout the 
country. 
  [Begin recording] [Paz] Reports we have indicate that the 
disturbances are under control, especially in the [word 
indistinct] and the places where students are present. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have there been clashes? 
  [Paz] No, there have not been any clashes with the police, 
according to reports we have received. We hope there will not be 
any either. We urge the strikers to conduct the strike in a calm 
manner to prevent further disruptions. [words indistinct]

Government Minister Marcelo Santos Vera expressed a few minutes 
ago that it is not necessary to declare a state of mobilization

There is uncertainty. Nevertheless, I do not think this should 
take us to the extreme point of thinking about more drastic 
measures. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Santos] Not so far. As the situation now stands, there is 
no reason to decree a mobilization. We do not know the plans of 
the FUT [United Workers Front] leaders. I hope that in response 
to appeals from government officials and media representatives, 
they conduct their protests peacefully. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Police Colonels Miguel Angel Vasquez and </F>
Carlos Trujillo by an unidentified reporter in Quito on 3 
February; from the "Informative Antenna" newscast--live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We are here with Colonel Miguel Angel 
Vasquez [words indistinct] We would like to know the details of 
how the strike decreed by the United Workers Front [FUT] has 
progressed. 
  [Vasquez] I can give you an up-to-the-minute evaluation of 
how the strike is progressing. Regarding the police actions, we 
may say that everything is under control. The roads have been 
cleared, including the Panamerican Highway. 
  The five provinces comprising the third district, such as 
Azuay, Loja, Canar, Zamora, and Morona, are also clear; 
consequently, commercial and administrative activities in those 
provinces are being carried out normally. There are 
demonstrations and street protests, which have been definitely 
brought under control. 
  Police are carrying out a very specific task of prevention, 
avoiding direct contact with demonstrators, who sometimes become 
aggressive. To avoid additional problems, the police are taking 
precautions to avoid confrontations. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] reports that police have 
attacked a youth; this has caused resentment from [words 
indistinct] citizens. What is the police version of this case? 
  [Vasquez] I think citizens and the media are well aware of 
our duty. If one of these demonstrators attack and hurl Molotov 
cocktails at policemen, the police must react. We cannot let 
ourselves be attacked physically. We were forced to act, but 
this youngster was never treated with brutality. He was simply 
overpowered and arrested and was submitted to authorities. 
  We are examining our policemen's injuries to report them to 
the media. Medical examinations are being taken now. 
  [Reporter] What happened to General [words indistinct] 
developed the strike decreed by the FUT in this city. Colonel 
Carlos Trujillo is also here. He will analyze [words 
indistinct] regarding police measures. 
  [Trujillo] We will continue to implement the same provisions 
issued by the General Command and the [words indistinct]. Our 
police duty will be to prevent crimes. We hope citizens 
understand what are our duty and responsibility. We did not 
come out to hurt anyone. We must be viewed as representatives 
of public order and peace. We will come out and exercise 
control over the city and demonstrations. We will not move 
against demonstrators as long as they do not attack other 
individuals or public and private property.

  [Excerpt] Quito, 3 Feb (EFE) -- According to an official 
government bulletin, 10 policemen have been seriously injured 
and 130 demonstrators have been arrested in Ecuador within the 
past seven days as the result of disturbances in several cities 
prompted by an increase in gasoline prices. The bulletin was 
released today, with the country partially paralyzed by a 
general 24-hour strike called by labor unions and other sectors 
demanding that the government repeal the higher gasoline prices. 
  Several Quito radio stations have reported numerous clashes 
betweeen demonstrators and police in Quito, Cuenca, Guayaquil, 
and other cities during the morning. The police bulletin gave 
no figures for injured or arrested demonstrators [as received], 
but witnesses and the media are reporting that they run into the 
hundreds. 
  Leaders of the United Workers Front [FUT], the country's 
largest labor federation, said at noon that the strike is 
"widespread." FUT President Edgar Ponce said in a news 
conference that "the response has been very positive." He 
declared that, if the government fails to repeal the gasoline 
price hike, another strike, this time for an "indefinite time," 
will be called. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Despite the massive police presence in the city and 
the announcement made by the government minister that a 
militarization of the country had not been ruled out, the people 
were not frightened and disturbances continued as demonstrators 
threw sticks and stones and burned tires. 
  Based on statements made by several people, we surmise that 
the population is angry because although economists close to the 
administration say that the increase in the price of fuel is the 
best way to collect funds for the treasury without having a 
major effect on the increase in the price of other articles, the 
theory does not work in practice because even before the 
economic package was implemented, prices began to rise rapidly, 
thus adversely affecting the prices of basic foods in several 
cases. 
  The outlook at the marketplace was disheartening. Vegetable 
prices doubled and sometimes tripled. The increase in the price 
of gasoline, according to some experts, will also lead to an 
increase in medical fees, medicines, education, plane tickets, 
and other goods.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Melo from National Congress in Quito -- </F>
live] 
  [Text] Alfredo Corral Borrero, labor and social resources 
minister, has stated that 50 percent of employees at businesses, 
enterprises, and factories have halted their activities in 
response to the appeal issued by the United Workers Front [FUT] 
and other labor groups. The minister refrained from saying 
whether the national strike had been a success or a failure but 
asserted that such actions will not solve the country's critical 
problems. 
  [Begin Corral recording] Transportation workers have not 
joined this drastic measure, nor have construction workers. As 
far as this ministry is concerned, that is, speaking strictly 
about labor issues, the reports we have received from all labor 
inspection offices throughout the country indicate there has 
been a partial work stoppage at businesses, enterprises, 
factories, and so forth. Some cities have been more affected 
than others. If we establish an average evaluation for the work 
stoppage, we can say that it is approximately 50 percent. That 
implies that the other 50 percent of the workers have been 
working and continue to work despite the strike decreed by the 
FUT. Information received from the country's agrarian and 
livestock areas indicates that everything dealing with the labor 
sector has proceeded normally. Consequently, labor activities 
in the countryside are normal. [end recording] 
  Labor Minister Alfredo Corral also said that social 
compensations include the freezing of urban transportation 
service fares and a possible increase in some of the components 
of the Ecuadoran workers' salaries. [sentence as heard]

<F P=106> [News conference by Government Minister Marcelo Santos with </F>
unidentified reporters at the Government Palace in Quito; 
broadcast in progress; all reporters' questions are indistinct 
-- live] 
  [Summary from poor reception] "...I hope that in the next 
few days -- as I have already announced [words indistinct] in 
other sectors of the Ecuadoran community -- none of those [word 
indistinct] or demonstrations will generate violence. Such was 
the case today, because there was none of that anywhere in the 
country. I think the public force has displayed a temperate 
attitude in controlling demonstrations, but I also think that 
there have been regrettable and condemnable (?acts) executed 
probably by agitators, extremists, and people who [passage 
indistinct] that prompted the Workers Front to declare a 
national strike." 
  Through you, I want to thank the country for its behavior. I 
want to thank the large number of Ecuadoreans who, as I saw on 
television, did everything possible to go to work in the early 
hours. "That is what Ecuador needs; that is what the government 
demands from the Ecuadoran people; that is what the government 
does to benefit the Ecuadoran people: work." 
  Our efforts are directed at finding ways to develop the 
country. "To achieve this, sometimes we must take on the 
responsibility of adopting harsh, drastic measures." However, 
most Ecuadoreans today showed their willingness to work. The 
transportation workers went to work in large numbers early today 
while there were still no demonstrations on the streets. 
  As of now, there are virtually no demonstrations. According 
to information furnished by the Police, at least 50 percent of 
the transportation vehicles are circulating. If you have 
different information, we could estimate an average and reach an 
agreement about this. I am not claiming that this was the case 
throughout the day. "There were times when there were obviously 
no means of transportation on the streets, but now, if you go 
out into the streets, you will see that there is increasingly 
more traffic circulating." 
  "That is good, because it will allow those who found it 
difficult to get to work this morning to return home more 
easily." I want to tell the country that the government is 
pleased. It is thankful to the Ecuadoran citizens for their 
behavior. There have been no tragic developments in the form of 
violence, loss of life, or major destruction. 
  These types of actions, no matter how legitimate they might 
be, are not the best way to achieve goals because they actually 
cause irreversible losses for the country. "What the country 
loses in one day of paralysis cannot be recovered by redoubling 
efforts over the following days. The loss remains." 
  Genuine opposition in a genuine democracy is not 
destructive, 
it is not negative. Opposition is a basic, significant element 
that is inherent to the democratic system. It is unacceptable, 
however, when it is accompanied by a negative position, a 
position closed to reasoning or dialogue, much less to a violent 
position. 
  The government has the serious responsibility of managing 
the 
country. Our society has had a sick economy. "We have had to 
adopt measures directed at making the Ecuadoran economy healthy 
again. This will benefit everyone. We think we have a qualified 
economic team." We have been attacked for certain reasons and 
from various fronts. The sectors that have attacked us, 
however, admit that we are handling economic policy correctly. 
  After lowering inflation to less than 30 percent in a year 
and six months when the previous government could not do it in 
four years, we have rights. "We have managed to lower interest 
rates, and we have maintained a stable exchange rate. We have 
the right to tell the country that our economic performance is 
adequate, that it is well directed, and that we will maintain it 
as long as we do not reach the clear conclusion that it is not 
working well, that it must be changed or readjusted." 
  I received a report about half and hour ago. As for 
detainees, the Police force reports that 17 adults and 16 minors 
were arrested in Quito, and (?two) were arrested in Puerto 
Viejo. There were no other arrests. "These persons will 
obviously be turned over to the proper authorities to see that 
they are tried in keeping with their accountability." As for 
violence, several people have been injured by stones. 
  As for the complaints filed before the Tribunal of 
Constitutional Guarantees, the government presented its position 
through legal channels. We think that the sole measure adopted 
by the government -- because we cannot talk about measures -- 
was to increase gasoline prices. This measure was in keeping 
with current regulations and in keeping with the hydrocarbons 
law that was reformed days ago. 
  "We think that this was done legally and technically. We 
think this measure will solve the most serious budget problems 
that were facing the Ecuadoran state and seriously affecting the 
economy. With the awareness that things are being done 
correctly and hoping that they will yield results, the 
government is neither inclined nor has it any reason to think of 
backing down or withdrawing this measure. 
  "You mentioned possible subsequent acts, uprisings with 
unpredictable consequences, but I dare say that today's strike 
gives us an idea of what future actions could entail. We have 
held talks with the FUT [United Workers Front], and despite 
today's developments, we are willing to continue meeting with 
its leaders to discuss certain points that were touched upon 
during a meeting with the president of the Republic last week, 
and even to discuss overall aspects of the handling and 
development of our governmental policy and the FUT's actions, 
presence, and responsibility in the development of national 
life." 
  Obviously, we have the same willingness toward the Indians. 
I have read about an Indian mobilization scheduled for Tuesday 
and Wednesday of next week. It is said that there will be no 
violence; that the mobilization will be limited to certain 
actions on the streets and highways. 
  The National Transit Council two days ago adopted a measure 
for Ecuadoran families that is much more constructive than any 
salary compensation. It refrained from increasing 
transportation fares. Instead, it increased subsidies to promote 
the modernization and development of transportation laws. This 
is a very important social measure. "All the effects that the 
national government plans to achieve through the correct 
application of the economic policy, which will be facilitated by 
the decision made last week, constitute a social policy, because 
it is directed mainly at ensuring that the state has the 
resources it needs to create jobs through public projects and to 
meet Ecuadoreans' education, health, and social welfare needs." 
  "The subsidy is not granted to transportation workers but to 
the population. The transportation workers are paid so the 
population will not have to pay higher fares. Consider what an 
increase of 50 sucres in urban transportation means to each 
person and each family over the course of a week or a month." 
The government cannot promise that there will be any measure 
regarding the salaries to neutralize the effects of the action 
taken last week. 
  It is easy to say we will give compensation, but that is 
irresponsible. We must look at the overall picture, we must 
look at the interrelationship between economic and social 
aspects. This should never be neglected.

<F P=106> [Interview with United Workers Front President Edgar Ponce </F>
by unidentified reporter on 3 February; place not given; from 
"The Voz Andes" newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Ponce] The Ecuadoran people went on strike and 
expressed themselves in the streets, villages, and cities of our 
country. They rejected the government's economic policies, 
especially the increase in fuel prices, which has adversely 
affected the people's pockets. Those who tried to de-emphasize 
the people's response did not realize that there is a social 
commotion throughout the country brought on by the devastating 
economic measures. Consequently, this preventive strike is a 
warning to the government that if it does not change its 
economic model, if its does not rectify its measures, the 
struggle will continue. That is the great message the 
Ecuadoran people, workers, peasants, Indians, housewives, and 
all those who actively participated in the national strike want 
to send. 
  I would not describe the strike as successful. I would say 
it is a national plebiscite in which the majority of the 
Ecuadoran people assumed their responsibility and showed their 
willingness to continue with the struggle. 
  [Reporter] According to the labor minister, only 50 percent 
of all workers participated in the strike. What is the workers' 
point of view? 
  [Ponce] I believe certain officials are being irresponsible 
when they try to play down the workers' strike. Maybe he has 
different ways of measuring strike participation. Should we 
start suspending the pumping of potable water and oil and 
suspending electricity and telephone service so they will admit 
that the strike was successful? That is not the real way to 
measure the people's protest. We must point out that the media 
-- which, by the way, have not been very supportive of the labor 
movement -- had to recognize that the people were mobilized at 
the national level and showed signs of patriotism. The people 
issued a warning that if the president of the Republic does not 
change his ways on the economic front, if the vice president 
does not stop provoking the people as he did yesterday when he 
announced more economic measures, they will really be forcing 
the Ecuadoran people to react. 
  [Reporter] What would the reactions be? 
  [Ponce] Mobilizations, strikes, and marches. We are going to 
open up room for dialogue, which will allow us to move on. The 
workers are making a call to all patriotic sectors, to all 
sectors committed to the highest interests of the Ecuadoran 
people, to find solutions. As for the specific case of the 
fiscal deficit, there are solutions. Today we heard a series of 
political leaders, analysts, and deputies say there were 
solutions and that there was no need to increase fuel prices, 
but the arrogance of the government's economic team, their 
attitude of provocation, their disregard for the Ecuadoran 
people is unparalleled. They are really being irresponsible, 
therefore the struggle will continue in a much more organized 
manner. 
  [Reporter] According to the reports you have received, are 
workers being arrested or repressed? 
  [Ponce] We are currently collecting all the information. It 
is almost ready, but we can say that there has been repression, 
arrests, injuries, the occupation of buildings, and a series of 
incidents that have resulted from the actions of public order 
personnel. Actually, they were trying to downplay the effects 
of this popular, national movement.

  [Text] The third general workers' strike during this 
administration took place amid at atmosphere of uncertainty and 
concern. The strike was called by the United Workers Front 
[FUT] as a protest against the rise in fuel prices. Government 
Minister Marcelo Santos and FUT President Edgar Ponce expressed 
different viewpoints about the strike this morning and disagreed 
about the extent of its observation by workers. While the 
former said the country's workers woke up to go to work, the 
latter said the strike was a success and that the people 
rejected the rise in fuel prices. 
  Gasoline station workers joined the strike by suspending the 
sale of fuel, while (?power company) workers who had also joined 
the strike decided to provide service. 
  Marcelo Ramon, president of the Federation of Oil Industry 
Workers [Federacion de Trabajadores Petroleros], said that since 
they are nice people who love the country, they did not stop 
working in the refineries and oil fields.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Mexican deputies and senators have condemned foreign 
intervention in Mexican affairs. The congressional Permanent 
Commission has referred to the fact that the U.S. House of 
Representatives has instituted a series of hearings to evaluate 
the status of human rights in various places in the world, 
including the events in Chiapas. 
  Despite certain coincidences, the six Mexican political 
parties have failed to reach a consensus, however; consequently, 
two different points of agreement were produced to establish the 
position of the Mexican Congress. Senator Gustavo Salinas has 
read a statement in the name of the PRI [Revolutionary 
Institutional Party], the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the 
Cardenist Front for the National Reconstruction Party, and PARM 
[Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution]. 
  [Begin Senator Salinas recording] The congressional 
Permanent 
Commission hereby rejects absolutely the idea of hearings being 
held in the U.S. House of Representatives to debate matters that 
are exclusively Mexican. Such activities cannot be permitted to 
lead to intervention in our country. [end recording] 
  PRD [Party for the Democratic Revolution] Deputy Alejandro 
Encinas spoke in the name of his party and PAN [National Action 
Party]. 
  [Begin Encinas recording] We think it is desirable for the 
Mexican Congress to call for public hearings on violations of 
human rights, particularly against Mexicans living in the United 
States. This is a duty we should do as responsible citizens. 
[end recording] 
  During the Permanent Commission session, it was agreed that 
no special sessions will be held in February and that a 
consensus should be sought among all parties.

  [Text] The Foreign Secretariat has denounced hearings at 
the U.S. Congress requested by Congressman Robert Torricelli, 
and it has described the move as open intervention and 
anti-Mexican. 
  Deputy Foreign Secretary Andres Rozental said Mexicans find 
this attempt to cast judgment and besmirch our country's 
reputation to be unacceptable. He added that the move is 
apparently stems from the resentment of some people who do not 
like the fact that Mexico maintains normal relations with Cuba 
or who may be upset by the approval of NAFTA. 
  It must be made very clear, according to the official, that 
the implementation of NAFTA grants no one outside of Mexico the 
right to judge matters that are solely up to the Mexicans to 
resolve. We have never accepted, nor will we accept, the 
exercise of trusteeships over our sovereignty, Rozental stated.

  [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] Since the start of the Chiapas conflict, 
complaints 
have been filed accusing the Army of human rights violations. 
Although there is no evidence of it, the complaints are being 
investigated and have resulted in a discussion of the Army's 
function and responsibility. 
  [Begin recording] [Deputy Commander Marcos, identified by 
caption] Until now, war was just for them and peace for you. 
Now, war will be for the two of us. Before, war killed them and 
not you. Now, it could kill anyone from either side. [video 
shows Deputy Commander Marcos from his waist up wearing a ski 
mask then cuts to recorded interview with 31st Zone Commander 
Miguel Anel Godinez, identified by caption] [Godinez] The only 
thing the Army has done is defend itself from attack. We were 
attacked. We did not attack anybody. We did not leave our 
garrison to seek out these people. They came to our garrisons to 
attack us. 
  Who is the bigger criminal, the soldier who shot a man 
carrying a wooden rifle, when he saw him at a distance of 100 
meters at night and did not realize it was a wooden rifle, or 
the person who brought that individual with the wooden rifle? 
[end recording] 
  Today, alleged human rights violations by the Army in 
Chiapas 
State have become a matter to be judged by segments of society. 
Moreover, the issue has been raised in U. S. Congressional 
committee meetings. As yet, there is no evidence these rights 
were violated. The inquiries begun by the National Human Rights 
Committee and the Attorney General's Office have not yielded 
results yet, but some insist on discrediting the country, 
without even asking what is the Army's constitutional duty.

  [Text] The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine 
Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] has issued a new communique addressed to 
Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and 
national mediation commissioner, and to Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. The 
communique, dated 31 January 1994, has three points. 
  The first point reads: We received the letter from Peace 
Commissioner Camacho Solis dated 29 January 1994 regarding the 
release of Division General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. We 
have confirmed that the 38 prisoners mentioned were indeed 
released. Division General Castellanos Dominguez is in perfect 
health and knows he will be released soon. Division General 
Absalon Castellano will definitely be released. 
  The second point of the communique reads: We received the 
letter from Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis dated 29 
January 1994 regarding the establishment of buffer or gray 
zones. We inform you that we fully agree with the entire 
proposal from the peace commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas in this respect. 
  The third point of the EZLN communique reads: In saluting 
the clear intentions of the commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas to make advancements to alleviate the 
grave situation affecting the civilian population in the 
conflict areas, the CCRI-CG will order the immediate withdrawal 
of EZLN troops from Los Ejidos, San Miguel, Ococingo 
Municipality, and Guadalupe Tepeyac, Las Margaritas 
Municipality. The EZLN troops will withdraw once the 
International Red Cross occupies these two buffer or gray zones 
and installs its camps for humanitarian aid. 
  The communique is signed by Subcommander Marcos and issued 
in 
the mountains of southeastern Mexico.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 2 
February; source follows in parentheses after each item. 
  The National Foreign Trade Bank has offered the main 
financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia bonds 
totaling $1 billion. The bonds, which are issued for a 10-year 
period, are instruments regularly used in international markets 
by institutions such as the World Bank and the governments of 
certain developed nations. (Mexico City XEW Television Network 
in Spanish 0435 GMT 25 Jan 94) 
  Mexico exported nonpetroleum products worth $45 million in 
1993, an unprecedented figure in the history of Mexican foreign 
trade, the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development 
reported on 29 January. The main Mexican export products in 
addition to oil are silver, coffee, cotton and steel products, 
cattle, and vegetables. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2315 GMT 30 Jan 
94) 
  The Mexican Committee for Oil Exports has announced 
adjustments in the price of Mexican crude oil effective 1 
February to maintain the level of competitiveness in the 
international market. The price for isthmus-type crude oil on 
the American Continent will be increased 15 cents per barrel, 
while the price of Maya-type oil will be reduced 15 cents, and 
the Olmeca type will remain the same. In the European market, 
the price for isthmus-type oil will be increased 20 cents per 
barrel, the Maya type 15 cents. In the Middle East, the price 
of Maya-type oil will be increased by 40 cents, while the 
isthmus-type will remain unchanged. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 0419 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  Arturo Lomeli, president of the Mexican Association of 
Consumer Defense Studies (Asociacion Mexicana de Estudios para 
la Defensa del Consumidor) has said the price of 87 staple 
products increased .9 percent in January, compared with 2 
percent in January 1993. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in

  [Text] LA PRENSA contacted Malvinas Islands residents 
yesterday to sound islanders out about the climate in Puerto 
Argentino [Stanley Port] after learning the news about the deal 
finalized by Argentina [with the United States] on the purchase 
of [Skyhawk aircraft fitted with] state-of-the-art radar. A 
Kelper told LA PRENSA that "we do not understand the rationale 
behind Argentina's decision to buy the Skyhawk planes -- unless 
it is seeking to attack the islands." 
  Another islander, who is very close to the islands' 
government, added that "we do not trust Argentina, and even 
though it is terrible for us, we are not afraid because here we 
have the Royal Air Force to defend us." 
  The Malvinas Islands' representative in London, Suky 
Cameron, 
reported that the islands' government -- through the United 
Kingdom -- had lodged a strong protest before the Clinton 
administration about the sale of the U.S. Skyhawk aircraft. 
  Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella told LA 
PRENSA that "Cameron's remarks have caused a great 
disappointment in the Argentine Foreign Ministry, because it 
seems that she has not taken note of the fact that Argentina 
will continue to press its claim to sovereignty over the 
Malvinas by diplomatic and peaceful means, as it has every right 
to do." 
<H5>  "It Reached Clinton's Ears" </H5>
  For his part, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has disclosed 
that the dispute arising from Great Britain's opposition to that 
business transaction "even came to President Bill Clinton's" 
knowledge. 
  As the defense minister pointed out: "It is my considered 
opinion that the stance taken by the British is totally 
groundless and anachronistic. If this were not so, we would not 
have this favorable outcome now." 
  Camilion further stated that it was not possible that while 
Argentina was aligned with the UN Security Council, two of its 
leading members -- the United Kingdom and the United States -- 
"should be enforcing an arms embargo against Argentina." 
  He also said that "this is why this means that the arms 
embargo on Argentina has been raised by all the countries in the 
world except for Britain, until it decides to the contrary." 
  He likewise denied that Argentina was interested in buying 
F-16 fighter planes, noting that "our budget possibilities would 
never allow it; it would be impossible to find someone willing 
to sell them, and it would logically cause a regional imbalance." 
  In its 1 February edition, the FINANCIAL TIMES reports that 
the sale of the U.S. planes to Argentina represents "a severe 
blow" for the UK Government led by Prime Minister [John] Major 
and its relations with the United States.

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf on 2 February 
admitted that "we have not solved all the subjects inherited 
from the authoritarian Argentina," as he commented on the 
critical human rights report prepared by the Clinton 
administration for the U.S. Congress. 
  Ruckauf said that "the report's contents are not worse than 
other countries and above average for Latin America" since the 
document "describes the progress attained from pre-existing 
situations." 
  Ruckauf's cautious tone contrasted that of Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella, who told CLARIN that the report "is totally 
unjustified." The different tones used by Ruckauf and Di Tella 
on the same subject are due to their different cabinet functions. 
  While Di Tella is concerned over the possible influence the 
report might have in our relations with the United States, 
Ruckauf is the official who has had to look after the cases 
described in the document, like the attacks against journalists 
Marcelo Bonelli and Hernan Lopez Echague. Besides, he deals 
directly with the police in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Cordoba 
Provinces, which are directly questioned by the Clinton 
administration. 
  Thus Ruckauf maintained that there is a tendency "since the 
years of the dictatorships for the security organizations to 
overlook the legal norms," but he added: "This has diminished 
since the return of democracy and there increasingly is more 
freedom and democracy year by year." [passage omitted] 
  Although the U.S. report emphasizes the government's respect 
for human rights, Minister Ruckauf preferred to speak about 
Argentine society. He said: "In any society there are problems 
with the institutions' functioning, especially in a society like 
ours that has 10 years of democratic life and where there still 
are many authoritarian components." 
  Ruckauf said: "I am 49 and I cannot remember living in times 
of freedom like the present. I do not think there is any kind of 
action that has worsened any of the situations linked to 
security in the country." 
  Meanwhile, in Tunis, an hour after meeting with PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat, Di Tella said via telephone that "this does not 
affect in the least" relations between Argentina and the United 
States, nor Argentina's image with the First World, which seems 
to be an obsession for the Argentine Government. 
  What is your opinion of the U.S. document, CLARIN asked Di 
Tella. 
  "It is totally unjustified. For example, freedom of the 
press 
is totally respected; it is incredibly respected, I would say. 
Just read the newspapers every day and see the criticisms we 
must bear." 
  Don't you think the report mentions some known subjects like 
the government's alleged influence in the Judicial Branch, 
CLARIN asked. 
  "I think the institutions are working more than well. Of 
course nothing is perfect and everything can be improved," Di 
Tella said. 
  Di Tella added that these kinds of reports are "routine 
declarations by the U.S. Executive Branch every year. This is 
not the general U.S. opinion, according to the high-level 
meetings I have held. For example, last week I met with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and he did not tell me 
anything about this." 
  For Di Tella, "those who prepare this kind of report are 
second-rank officials who base themselves on extreme situations 
and adopt absolute positions."

<F P=106> ["Telephone interview" with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella </F>
in Tunis by "J.C." in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella met on 2 
February in Tunis with top PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. During 
their meeting they analyzed the evolution of the peace 
negotiations between the PLO and Israel and Argentine support 
for this process of understanding. 
  During a telephone conversation with CLARIN, Foreign 
Minister 
Di Tella gave details of his meeting with 'Arafat: 
  [J.C.] What was the purpose of your meeting with the 
Palestinian leader? 
  [Di Tella] We want to adapt our position to the constant 
changes in the world, and this process in the Middle East is an 
example of these changes. Argentina acknowledges the peace 
efforts of both the PLO and Israel, and now we have met with a 
man who is currently handling the weapons of peace. 'Arafat took 
our message of support for the peace process very positively. 
This is our small contribution to a process that is so important 
for the whole world. 
  [J.C.] Has 'Arafat been invited to visit Argentina? 
  [Di Tella] Yes; President Menem invited 'Arafat to come to 
our country as a gesture of support for the peace process, and 
'Arafat was pleased to accept the invitation. In the same way, 
'Arafat invited Menem to visit Jericho in the future when the 
Palestinian chief installs himself there. 
  [J.C.] Will Argentina support the Palestinian process of 
autonomy diplomatically and materially? 
  [Di Tella] One of the things we offered them is the 
construction of a school, a subject we are discussing with the 
Israeli and Arab communities in our country, which might make 
economic contributions. 
  [J.C.] What are the possibilities for the PLO to maintain 
diplomatic representation in Buenos Aires? 
  [Di Tella] There already is a Palestinian delegation in our 
country, and in order to make progress on this subject we must 
observe the functioning of all these peace agreements and hold 
talks with the Palestinians. It is still premature to speak 
about this. 
  [J.C.] Why was the meeting with 'Arafat kept secret? 
  [Di Tella] Because of 'Arafat's constant movements and the 
alternatives in the PLO-Israeli negotiations. The meeting could 
not be confirmed until the last moment. Those were the reasons 
why we did not want to release information about these talks. 
  [J.C.] Has there been any Israeli influence to prevent this 
meeting with 'Arafat from being made public? 
  [Di Tella] Not in the least. The Israelis knew about this 
meeting and did not object to it at all.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 3 
February. 
  A study by the Foundation for Latin America Economic 
Research 
shows that Argentina's industrial production has increased more 
than 40 percent since Argentine currency was pegged to the U.S. 
dollar at one-to-one parity in March 1991. Industrial 
production surged in 1991 and 1992 and leveled off in 1993, when 
it expanded only 3.5 percent. Industry's good performance is 
due mainly to the growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 27 
percent of the GDP, especially car manufacturing, which grew 460 
percent in that period. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in 
Spanish 1106 GMT 25 Jan 94) 
  Argentine and Brazilian officials on 27 January signed an 
agreement establishing a maximum of 340,000 metric tons of 
Argentine wheat exports to Brazil. The agreement will take 
effect in April and expires 31 December, the government 
reported. The Agriculture Secretariat said Argentina still can 
export 215,000 metric tons of wheat to Brazil left over from the 
1993 agreement. This will bring total 1994 exports to 550,000 
metric tons. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 28 
Jan 94 p 6) 
  Economic Programming Secretary Juan Llach on 31 January 
reported that the consumer price index increased 0.3 percent and 
the GDP 7.6 percent in January. He noted that investment rose 
22.5 percent, and 85 percent in the past three years. A 
Programming Secretariat report shows that gold and foreign 
currencies reserves went from $4.855 billion in 1990 to $15.1 
billion in December 1993, an increase of 211 percent. Imports of 
capital goods and spares totalled $15.05 billion in the past 
three years. It notes that 673,000 new jobs were created from 
October 1990 to October 1993. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS 
in Spanish 2307 GMT 31 Jan 94) 
  The consumer price index increased 0.3 percent in January, 
while wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent, Economic Planning 
Secretary Juan Llach said on 31 January. This brings inflation 
in the last 12 months to 6.8 percent for consumer prices, while 
the wholesale index has fallen 0.8 percent. (NA) (Buenos Aires 
BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 1 Feb 94 p 3) 
  With an 11,000 metric ton increase in the Hilton quota, 
Argentina will be able to export 32,000 metric tons of duty-free 
beef to the EEC this year. This translates into an additional 
$100 million in foreign sales, Agriculture Production Under 
Secretary Felix Cirio said on 31 January. He added that total 
beef exports in 1993 were 280,000 metric tons, a bit less than 
1992's 290,000 metric tons. (NA) (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES 
HERALD in English 1 Feb 94 p 3) 
  January's tax revenue was 4.2 billion pesos, 4 percent 
higher 
than the government target. Revenue was 14 percent higher 
compared with December 1993, the Public Revenue Secretariat said 
on 1 February. The revenue sources were: 

  -  Customs.....................................0.2 
billion 
  -  Social Security.............................1.6 
billion 
  -  General Directorate of Taxation.............2.4 billion 
  Revenue from the value-added tax accounted for about 
one-third of total revenue. Expenditures were divided as follows: 

  -  Treasury....................................0.9 
billion 
  -  Provinces...................................1.0 
billion 
  -  Social welfare..............................1.5 
billion 
  -  Federal sharing.............................0.3 
billion 
  -  Other.......................................0.5 billion

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 2 
February. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Central Bank has reported preliminary figures on the 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) up through June 1993. The 
"financial establishments, insurance, and other services" sector 
grew more -- 12.7 percent -- than all the other sectors that 
make up the GDP. 
  The GDP grew 6.3 percent; from 13.4336 billion colones in 
1992 to 14.3068 billion colones in 1993. The agriculture, 
hunting, and fishing sector grew 2.5 percent; the industry 
sector grew 7 percent; electricity and water grew 8 percent; the 
construction sector grew 6.3 percent; trade grew 8.5 percent; 
transportation and communications grew 10.6 percent; the real 
estate sector grew 3.1 percent; the general government sector, 
2.5 percent; and the other personal services sector grew 6.1 
percent. 
  The Central Bank added that the final yearly figures will be 
available at the end of 1994. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 19 
Jan 94, p 28A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales issued a communique 
based on data from the IMF saying Costa Rica attained one of the 
lowest inflation rates in Latin America and the Caribbean in 
1993. The communique points out that Costa Rica had a 
single-digit, 9.05 percent, inflation rate in 1993. (San Jose LA 
NACION in Spanish 20 Jan 94, p 8A) 
  Central Bank Director Alberto Franco Mejia has stated that, 
in accordance with the preliminary figures for 1993, the 
physical capital investment totaled 3.5966 billion colones, 
which is 15 percent more than the amount registered in the 
previous period and represents the highest amount in the history 
of the country. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 27 Jan 94, p 
12A) 
  On 2 February, Deputy Economy Minister Gustavo Gutierrez 
reported the inflation rate for the month of January 1994 was 
0.87 percent. He also said the consumer price index accumulated 
over 1993 was 9.58 percent, 2.42 percent less than the official 
projections and the lowest of the last 15 years. The official 
added that the goal for the current year will be 10 percent.

  [Text] The movement of the Chamber of Commerce and Haitian 
employers is gathering momentum and scale. According to a press 
release from the crisis committee, the objectives of the 25 
January resolution asking business people to close their doors 
from 28 January to 9 February were reasserted during a meeting 
between the crisis committee and members of the resigning 
government. The press release adds that some progress has been 
achieved. Additional meetings will be held on this topic on 
Thursday, 3 February, with national and international guests. 
The crisis committee of the Haitian private sector states that 
cooperation with the protest movement is increasing, translating 
the exasperation of a population facing arbitrary, inopportune 
sanctions that are being imposed on the nation by certain 
countries in the international community. Furthermore, this 
committee invites all the media which do not regularly receive 
press releases to contact the secretariat of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of Haiti as soon as possible. 
  It should be pointed out that the president of the Chamber 
of 
Commerce and Industry of Haiti, Raymond Roy, exchanged bitter 
words with Mr. Schrager of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. 
Chamber of Commerce President Roy, who is also a member of the 
crisis committee, called Stanley Schrager's comments on the 
Haitian employers' movement untimely and biased. The diplomat 
had described the resolution of the Haitian employers, announced 
on 25 January, involving the temporary suspension of commercial 
and industrial activities in the country until 9 February as a 
means of demanding a solution to the crisis and the lifting of 
the embargo, as dramatic. 
  The president of the Chamber of Commerce, in a press release 
issued on 2 February, pointed out that in the interest of 
protecting the constructive, harmonious relations with the 
United States while there is still time, the crisis committee of 
the private sector had asked the diplomats accredited in Haiti 
to avoid comments that could aggravate tensions.

<F P=106> [Report by Daly Valet; passages within quote in Creole -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In a news conference, Senator Thomas Eddy 
Dupiton denounced subversive maneuvers by some parliamentarians 
to involve him in the assassination of Antoine Izmery. He said 
he is the victim of machinations aimed at preventing him from 
becoming the possible president of the Senate office. Sen. 
Dupiton demanded overt evidence of his participation in any plot 
aimed at physically eliminating Mr. Izmery. Let us listen to the 
report by Daly Valet. 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] "On Saturday, 11 September 1993, 
at 
0925, several armed civilians burst into the Sacred Heart Church 
in Turgeau where a mass was being celebrated to commemorate the 
fifth anniversary of the Saint-Jean Bosco slaughter that caused 
the deaths of 13 people in 1988. [passage omitted] 
  ``During this news conference, Sen. Dupiton presented 
himself 
as innocent, having had nothing to do with Antoine Izmery's 
assassination. Sen. Dupiton accused Sen. Rony Mondestin of 
participating in a plot that he said the United Nations is 
hatching against him. 
  ``Furthermore, Sen. Dupiton insisted that Sen. Mondestin 
provide an explanation regarding the assassination attempt on 
Sen. Raoul Remy, [who was shot three times in Cap-Haitien]. 
According to Dupiton, Sen. Mondestin had threatened him, so he 
is the chief plotter. All of these things will come to an end, 
he said, because Colin Granderson must provide an explanation of 
the UN report involving me in the assassination of Antoine 
Izmery. These were Sen. Dupiton's statements.'' 
  [Dupiton] I am speaking of Sen. Rony Mondestin, who was 
identified by Sen. Raoul Remy as the one responsible for the 
attempt on his life because Remy identified Mondestin's driver 
and because Sen. Rony Mondestin had threatened the senator here 
during a session, in the presence of the assembly of senators. 
  "He had told him: I will get you in Cap-Haitien; I will get 
you in Cap-Haitien [repeats]; I will settle my disputes with you 
when I get to Cap-Haitien. Well, you see that Remy fell when he 
arrived in Cap-Haitien. Of course, Remy accused him personally, 
and all the documents were brought to me as president of the 
justice commission. Since then, he decided to give me a hard 
time. But this matter will come to an end because the United 
Nations must now explain where this report came from and what 
special committee participated in the preparation of this 
report, who was questioned, who saw people in my home." I 
welcome all of this. I am waiting for Mr. Granderson's answer. 
  [Valet] "Sen. Ebrane Cadet sat at the conference table with 
Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Cadet has already written to Colin 
Granderson, current UN representative in Haiti, to ask for an 
explanation of the referenced report and a copy of that report 
because, according to Cadet, Dupiton's name is cited in it." 
[passage omitted] 
  [Cadet] "We just wrote a letter to the United Nations, to 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali so he can provide us with precise, clear, 
explicit information not only on this case, but also on the case 
relating to the assassination attempts on Sen. Pierre Raoul Remy 
and Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, because I would like to have all 
this information so justice can be set in motion. It is time for 
dishonesty to end in Haiti." 
  [Valet] "So, according to what you just said, if Sen. 
Dupiton 
is guilty, you would like the justice department to prosecute 
him, would you not?" 
  [Cadet] "If Sen. Dupiton is guilty, the justice department 
must prosecute him. If we could catch all other senators or all 
other people involved in crimes in the country, we would be very 
happy to institute legal proceedings against them." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] A demonstration is scheduled for 4 February. 
Mobilization for National Development [MDN] plans to demonstrate 
against the embargo and in favor of the employers' movement. 
Professor DeRonceray, a fierce opponent of Father Aristide, 
asserts that the embargo has only undermined our economy and 
worsened the misery of the poor. It is urgent that he go down to 
the streets to say no to the embargo. The demonstration, which

and the U.S. Embassy. Let us listen to Hubert De Ronceray. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] Through this demonstration we 
will join with the businessmen, will say no to the embargo 
imposed on the people by the international community, and will 
say yes to a solution coming from inside the country. MDN 
invites all its partisans and friends in Port-au-Prince to 
participate in this demonstration, and all people living in the 
provinces and the rural sections to organize peaceful marches to 
force the deputies and senators to be done with the Aristide 
matter and to implement Article 149 of the Constitution. We will 
then have a provisional government of concord that will unblock 
the country, and will hold elections for the installation of a 
definitive government. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 3 Feb (EFE) -- A day after his inauguration 
and following a military parade in his honor, Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera today was involved in a minor traffic 
accident as his vehicle was leaving the Plaza de los Proceres in 
Caracas. 
  According to eyewitnesses, a television cameraman, while 
filming Caldera's departure, approached a horse of the Honor 
Guard escorting the presidential car, spooking the animal and 
prompting it to rear. 
  According to sources close to the president, the president's 
chauffeur was forced to brake abruptly to avoid hitting the 
horse. In the mishap, Caldera received a blow so sharp that it 
broke his pen into three pieces. 
  The president, who complained about pain in his ribs, will 
be 
examined by doctors at the Miraflores Palace, seat of the 
Venezuelan Government.

against the 8 million liters of reformulated gasoline that 
Venezuela exports every day has coincided with the European

Orimulsion's classification. Orimulsion is a new fuel developed 
by Venezuela that can be burned to generate electricity

reasons for rejecting the discriminatory actions against 
Orimulsion by the United States and the UK? 
  [Martinez] We are presenting a strong protest to the U.S.

UK Governments, through their respective embassies in the 
country, for the discriminatory treatment given, in the case of 
the United States, to the reformulated gasoline we export to 
that country, and in the case of the UK, for the unfriendly 
actions of the government against Orimulsion. The UK took an 
internal policy problem to the European Union and requested that 
Orimulsion, a new fuel developed by Venezuela, be inaccurately 
classified. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored through 2 
February; source is in parentheses following each item. 
  The National Bank will finance $40 million, which the 
Transportation, Communication, Housing, and Construction 
Ministry will use for infrastructure works. According to an 
executive decree published in the newspaper EL PERUANO, a joint 
operation between the two institutions to use funds from a loan 
granted by the Export and Import Bank of Japan was authorized. 
(Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 26 
Jan 94) 
  Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet has said the U.S. 
Government will reportedly pay in two weeks the first 
$30-million installment, which was promised in an agreement 
signed with the Support Group. He has added this was made 
possible thanks to the recent visit by Alexander Watson, 
assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs. Camet 
has also said the January inflation rate reached 1.8 percent and 
that there will be salary raises in 1994. (Lima Global de 
Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  Felix Murillo, National Statistics and Information 
Technology 
Institute chief, has said power, water, housing, and fuel 
services, which grew by an average of 4.1 percent, are the 
sectors that increased the most. The food sector grew by only 
1.1 percent. Murillo said this prompted a compensatory effect in 
the January inflation rate, which reached 1.84 percent. (Lima 
Radio Programas del Peru Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  Raul Otero, Special Privatization Committee member, has said 
the international bidding for the sale of the Hilo Copper 
Refinery was declared vacant, because there were no bids. The 
representatives of such international corporations as Maruven 
Inc., Mitsui, and Sauder Peru Copper Corporation have declined 
to submit bids, because they have claimed the $75-million base 
price was too high. (Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in 
Spanish 1800 GMT 2 Feb 94)

  [Excerpts] In a long letter signed by Foreign Minister Luis 
Maria Ramirez Boettner that was sent to U.S. Ambassador 
Glassman, the government headed by President Wasmosy questions 
the U.S. offer to send 600 servicemen to Paraguay to carry out 
an engineering project in San Pedro Department, and subjects it 
to the granting of immunity and privileges. The Paraguayan 
Government believes these privileges should be the same as those 
established by the Vienna Convention on diplomatic ties. 
Ramirez Boettner's letter responds to a letter Glassman sent to 
Wasmosy. 
  The letter states that the government has studied very 
closely the offer encompassed in the "Agreement between the 
United States of America and the Paraguayan Government on joint 
exercises known as Strong Roads 1994-South" and the "Memorandum 
of Understanding between the U.S. State Department and the 
Paraguayan Public Works and Communications Ministry." The 
Paraguayan Government expresses its thanks for the U.S. 
"interest" in building six schools, six wells, and one clinic in 
San Pedro Department. 
  "After a careful study of this operation, the value of which 
is not specified anywhere in the two aforementioned documents 
although the annex establishes that the amount is `to be 
specified' -- while statements to the radio and the press Your 
Excellency has said it will total $12 million -- we wonder if 
the amount will be invested in Paraguay through the works 
encompassed in this project, or if it represents the total cost 
that the United States will spend deploying 600 U.S. Army 
servicemen to Paraguay, the equipment (which will not be donated 
to Paraguay), and the maintenance of the personnel. In this 
case, it does not constitute cooperation for Paraguay but the 
financing of what the agreement calls `Joint Exercises' 
conducted in Paraguay." [passage omitted] 
  After stating that the requirements of the Americans for 
their arrival are "very costly," the Government insists that 
Paraguay "would be allocating far more resources than the United 
States." [passage omitted] 
  On the agreement to allow the entrance of U.S. servicemen, 
among other things, the government proposes "that the Paraguayan 
Army be the counterpart of the joint exercise, for which a 
sapper battalion will be designated; that the value the 
technical cooperation program be specified; that Congress 
authorize the arrival of the troops with their respective arms 
because this affects our country's sovereign rights; that the 
joint exercise will be carried out only in the areas specified, 
including ports, airports, and Paraguayan air space, clearly 
specifying the number and characteristics of the planes or 
helicopters to be used; and that the import of arms be 
restricted." The letter to Glassman also states that if these 
conditions are not met "It may be convenient for the Paraguayan 
Government to carry out these works with its own resources, 
without the cooperation of your country."

  [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon faces a new headache with the 
transportation strike, which entered its third day today, 
virtually paralyzing the entire country, four days after the 
constitutional referendum obtained a faint victory. 
  Interurban transportation owners are firmly maintaining the 
strike and have decided to defy de Leon Carpio, who has offered 
them a 10-percent tariff readjustment on costs of fuel 
transportation. 
  Some 2.5 million Guatemalans are directly affected today in 
the Guatemalan capital, where 1,500 buses and 1,100 minibuses 
that are used in public service are not running. 
  Rudi Maldonado, Urban Bus Transportation Association 
president, has announced the suspension of night service, adding 
buses will not provide service on 3 February due to a lack of 
fuel. 
  Most minibuses are not providing service either due to a 
lack 
of gasoline, according to bus owner Cesar Arellano. 
  Most gas stations that operate in the capital have depleted 
their reserves and have stopped operations, while hundreds of 
fuel trucks are at a standstill in the Atlantic and Pacific 
areas in support of the strike. 
  Miguel Angel Luna, president of the National Transportation 
Coordinating Board (CNT), has said the chief of state's decision 
is "unilateral," because they were not consulted at any moment. 
  According to Luna, the official proposal was rejected by a 
consensus of the owners of cargo, fuel, cement, and passenger 
transportation services. He has warned the strike will not be 
lifted until their demands are met. 
  The increase in the costs of fuel transportation is one of 
the seven points on their list of demands, he has said. Luna 
has said when the government announces their demands have been 
met they will lift the strike. 
  In an effort to overcome the transportation strike, the 
president announced a 10-percent tariff readjustment in the cost 
of transporting fuel, but the CNT rejected it. 
  On announcing the readjustment, de Leon said it was the 
government's final word, and he asked the bus owners to lift the 
strike immediately or otherwise bear the full weight of the law. 
[passage omitted] 
  The strike began on 1 February, two days after the 
referendum 
in which 43 constitutional reforms were approved by only 400,000 
of 3.4 million individuals eligible to vote, while 2.8 million 
Guatemalans preferred to stay home. To many people this 
evidences the lack of popular support for de Leon Carpio.

  [Text] The strike announced by the National Transportation 
Coordinating Board [CNT] is starting to lead to violent 
incidents promoted by angry travelers, particularly those living 
in and around the capital where people have had to resort to 
riding in pickups, cargo trucks, and other types of vehicles 
that are not considered safe for passengers. 
  At the entrance to Villanueva, groups of people stoned 
several buses as a way of protesting against the strike called 
by the owners of intercity buses, which has left hundreds of 
passengers on the streets. These people were unable to reach 
their workplaces because of the lack of mass transit buses. 
  At the time of the attack on the buses, which were severely 
damaged, several people were injured, including children who 
were assisted by municipal and volunteer firemen who quickly 
arrived at the scene. Policemen at the scene arrested three men 
caught stoning the buses. The detainees were taken to the 
National Police station in Villanueva and turned over to the 
courts. 
  Similar incidents of violence were reported in Boca del 
Monte, Villa Canales, San Miguel Petapa, and other 
municipalities that were adversely affected by the 
transportation strike. 
  We can also report that a bomb threat took place at La 
Quinta 
Shopping Center this morning in Zone 7 of the capital. The 
offices of the CNT and other associations are located in this 
shopping center, and it is believed the false bomb threat was 
aimed at the bus owners who decided to go on strike starting on 
1 February. 
  Firemen and National Police patrols arrived at the scene 
where they proceeded to search the place very thoroughly without 
finding anything. Normal activities at the shopping center were 
suspended while the authorities conducted the search. As is 
already known, the CNT, among other requests, is demanding that 
the government enact an intercity bus service law, approve a law 
to regulate the operation of shipping companies that operate in 
the country, approve an increase in cement transportation fares, 
authorize higher fuel transportation rates, and keep border 
customs offices open at night. 
  CNT President Miguel Angel Luna said the strike currently 
has 
the support of 80 percent of the CNT's members. He added that 
some attacks against several members of the transportation 
sector have already occurred, especially in Villanueva.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (AFP) -- The supply of 
gasoline has begun to run out at gas stations in Guatemala, and 
the situation could become critical within the next 48 hours due 
to the heavy cargo transportation strike, which is in its third 
day today, and government or transport owners are unable to 
reach an agreement. 
  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio threatened today to turn 
over 
the transportation routes to new companies if the strike is not 
lifted, but the strikers insist on maintaining it until the 
government agrees to approve a new regulation for the sector 
that would enable it to increase its profits. 
  More than 40 percent of gas stations have been left without 
fuel in the capital and the interior, according to estimates of 
the National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT), which 
organized the strike. This means the country might be at a 
standstill before the weekend. 
  Urban transportation, which is not participating in the 
movement, has, nevertheless, had to reduce services to maintain 
fuel reserves. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Industries and other 
business organizations have urged the parties to resume the 
dialogue. The transporters are asking for an increase in rates 
and greater profit margins as well as new regulations for their 
sector. 
  The government has not officially replied to the demands, 
though Finance Minister Ana Molina has said "five points have 
already been accepted." She did not specify the points. 
  Meanwhile, government workers have begun a staggered strike 
to demand higher salaries, increasing the pressure on President 
de Leon Carpio. 
  Local observers believe the government suffered a political 
setback on 30 January with the results of a referendum that 
approved a series of reforms promoted by the government but that 
registered an 85-percent rate of abstention, which has cast 
doubt on the legitimacy of the changes.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (AFP) -- The four-day-old 
strike of cargo transportation vehicles in Guatemala ended today 
after the government accepted all of the demands of businessmen 
and pledged in writing to respect them, a transportation 
association official has reported. 
  The National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT) 
announced it ordered all of its members to suspend the strike 
"immediately" because President Ramiro de Leon Carpio gave a 
"favorable" response to all of their demands. The resolution to 
the conflict came at a time when the supply of fuel at gas 
stations was beginning to run out and officials feared the 
nation would become paralyzed within the next 48 hours. 
  According to a CNT communique, telephone conversations were 
maintained "until the predawn hours" with President de Leon, who 
finally accepted the increase in rates and other demands made by 
transportation workers. The president had threatened to 
intervene and cancel current concessions with the striking 
businesses, transferring them to other enterprises. 
Nevertheless, De Leon ultimately yielded to the pressure of 
transportation businessmen.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio announced that the heavy truck 
drivers strike, which lasted nearly three days, ended after an 
agreement was reached with the strike leaders. 
  De Leon said that last night after midnight the National 
Transport Coordinating Board [CNT] accepted the new rates 
proposed by the president for the transportation of fuel and 
cement. On 2 February, De Leon announced the Council of 
Ministers adjusted the current fuel transportation rates by 10 
percent, and it ordered every carrier to have an insurance 
policy based on the number of gallons of gasoline or diesel 
transported. 
  The president did not rule out the possibility of 
eliminating 
control over these rates, but the Energy and Mines Ministry is 
the institution in charge of setting wholesale prices. The CNT 
is in session and its leaders are expected to confirm or deny 
the suspension of the strike sometime day. 
  The fuel truck drivers' strike caused a fuel shortage at 
city 
gas stations. Consequently, intercity and city buses could not 
circulate and street disturbances occurred. 
  Hundreds of Guatemalans could not return to their 
communities, while others were forced to travel in trucks or 
privately-owned vehicles in uncomfortable and unsafe conditions.

supplies are expected to return to normal in the next few hours 
and suburban transportation to resume. 
  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio confirmed that the 
transportation workers accepted the conditions proposed by the 
government. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] Yesterday they accepted the 
government economic policy proposed by the president. The only 
[words indistinct] is that today we will issue the respective 
agreements, but they accepted the economic policy. The CNT 
accepted the proposals and tariffs we presented, so we are 
satisfied because the problem has been resolved. There will be 
no strike. At this time today they must inform their members 
and transportation workers that the problem has been resolved. 
This is one less problem for the country. We are extremely 
pleased to see that the government's firm position was accepted, 
as the government's position must be and will be accepted when 
we are facing problems that require state decisions. [end

  [Text] More than 8,600 professional state employees began 
a progressive strike on 1 February to pressure the government 
and protest its noncompliance with the agreements signed in July 
1992, Lionel Ardon Rodriguez, president of the University 
Professionals Coordinating Board [Coordinadora de Profesionales 
Universitarios Coligados], announced on 1 February. 
  The decision was announced following the failure of more 
than 
six months of talks with Finance and Labor Ministry officials. 
Ardon said the government contended that it could not comply 
with the agreement due to a lack of budget funds. 
  Ardon added that the government failed to comply with five 
points of the agreement: the problem of underemployment of 
professionals, wage scales, establishment of a promotion list 
based on seniority, promotions by academic level or degree 
and/or positions occupied, and discussion and approval of a 
salary increase for 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Dubon; from the "News Patrol" newscast-- </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] [Dubon] Congress President Marco Villar Anleu has 
disclosed his position and Congress' regarding the results of 
the referendum. 
  [Villar Anleu] We want to tell Guatemalans and the media 
that 
Congress views with satisfaction the results obtained in the 30 
January referendum. We also want to express our concern over 
the high rate of abstention registered at the polls. Although 
we had anticipated some abstention, the rate was higher than 
what we had expected. This high rate of abstention was due to 
many reasons, such as the trend adopted by Guatemalans to 
refrain from participating, and a lack of civic spirit during 
past electoral events. 
  We are concerned greatly by an abstention rate of 
approximately 84 percent, and I believe the political sector 
must play a significant role in this regard. Had the political 
institutions participated effectively and actively, the 
percentage might have been different; in this sense, the 
referendum was a process in which Guatemalans participated 
conscientiously, without any influence from political parties. 
  [Dubon] Villar Anleu has said Congress will respect the 
Guatemalans' decision to ratify the reforms, but he spotlighted 
the fact these reforms had been ratified by only 10 percent of 
all eligible voters; this, he said, could deprive the results of 
their legitimacy. 
  He has urged all sectors to sit at the negotiation table to 
dialogue and reach an agreement of practicality so that the 
coming congressional elections are conducted within a legal 
framework.

  [Text] During the first six months of 1993, Honduran 
exports surged significantly. They generated more than $200 
million in foreign exchange, compared to just $154,925,109.93 
the previous year. 
  According to regional figures provided by the Export 
Processing Center (Centrex), exports to Central America between 
January and June 1992 generated $7,387,428.27, compared to 
$14,948,036.61 up to June of this year. 
  The European market was a favorable option for national 
goods; in the first half of 1992, earnings amounted to 
$59,637,682.46, while those for the period ending in June of 
this year amounted to $81,106,198.83, according to Juan Felix 
Garcia, regional director of the Economy Ministry. 
  He indicated that exports to the United States also showed 
positive growth, climbing from $67,210,171.85 in 1992 to 
$84,599,795.65 during the first six months of this year. 
  According to information provided by the official, exports 
to 
other countries totaled $20,689,827.35 during the first half of 
1992. 
  During the same period of this year, however, they fell to 
$20,048,153.20. This decline was due to changes in the import 
market, he indicated. 
  Garcia stated that the overall trend in exports is upward, 
with greater emphasis on nontraditional goods, including farm 
products. 
  He also pointed out that expectations are growing for 
nontraditional goods because the market is expanding, which 
leads to the conclusion that the development of large, medium, 
and small industries is a certainty. 
  In addition to traditional products such as bananas, coffee, 
and sugar, other exports include ornamental plants, parts of 
wicker furniture, cigars, cacao, wood products, melons, and 
plastic products.

  [Text] The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November 1993 
rose by 1 percent, more than the 0.7 percent recorded for the 
previous month. 
  The categories that make up the CPI basket are shown in the 
following table, [table not reproduced] where it is clear that 
the greatest increases occurred in health care (2.5 percent), 
clothing (2.2 percent), education, reading, and entertainment 
(1.7 percent), personal care (1.3 percent), and transportation 
(1.1 percent). 
  Given the different weights attributed to each category, 
however, it can be seen in the contribution column that the 
categories of food, clothing, housing and home upkeep, health 
care, and education, reading, and entertainment were the ones 
that exerted the greatest influence on the growth of the CPI 
this month, with figures of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1, respectively 
[as published]. They account for 90 percent of the total 
variation. 
  The sum of the contributions by category is not necessarily 
equal to the total, because they are approximations. 
  The goods and services that had the greatest impact on the 
variation in the CPI are listed below: [list not reproduced] 
  The products and services named in the above chart represent 
a net contribution of 0.5, and together they account for 50 
percent of the total variation in the CPI. 
  Marginal inflation (November 1992-November 1993) amounted to 
13.4 percent, higher than the 5.8 percent reported for the same 
period of the previous year. 
  The average index for January-November of this year rose by 
10.5 percent, higher than the figure for the same period of last 
year, 9 percent. 
  Cumulative inflation for December 1992 through November 1993 
was 12.3 percent, a greater percentage than that recorded for 
the previous period, 5.5 percent. 
  The average variation in the last 12 months (December 
1992-November 1993) was 10.2 percent, compared to 9.9 percent 
during the previous period.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa--The central government collected more 
than 2.8 billion lempiras in taxes as of the end of October, a 
considerable increase over current revenues for the previous 
year, reported Vice Minister of Finance for Revenues William 
Chong Wong yesterday. 
  Income tax revenues totaled 786 million lempiras; the 
property tax accounted for 26 million lempiras; 1.002 billion 
lempiras was collected for the tax on production, consumption, 
and sales; import duties amounted to 877 million lempiras; and 
service fees accounted for 109 million lempiras. 
  The official stated that although the figures are not 
comparable to those of the previous year because the entire 
general budget would have to be analyzed for that, they do 
amount to 333.2 million lempiras more as of the end of October. 
  Chong Wong noted that "we are meeting the collection 
targets" 
set for this fiscal year, even though the share revaluation tax 
has not yet been paid; it is expected to yield another 100 
million lempiras. 
  He complained that Hondurans are paying scant attention to 
this new tax, leaving everything to the last minute. The 
deadline for submitting applications is 30 November, and 
payments are due no later than 15 December, with no extensions. 
  So far, however, only 25 million lempiras has been collected 
on this tax.

<F P=106> [Report by Denis Garcia Salinas] </F>
  [Text] Granada -- The government stated clearly on 28 
January it will not tolerate chaos being intensified in Managua 
by a group of transporters who, that same day, called for acts 
of civil disobedience and declined to attend the meeting that 
ended on the morning of 29 January with an agreement that 
reduces and freezes the price of fuel and diesel. 
  After a tour through Granada, which included visits and 
meetings at private enterprises and the inauguration of a 
municipal office of the Social Action Ministry, Presidency 
Minister Antonio Lacayo said the government will not allow small 
groups to turn the country into a state of outrageous chaos. 
  "Civil disobedience means chaos, and in chaos very few 
people 
win anything. I do not believe we can solve Nicaragua's 
problems that way," the high-ranking official stated. 
  "I hope that is nothing more than a pressure tactic from 
them 
(Sandinist Labor Union) to make the negotiations advance," he 
said, adding the government "has been negotiating since last 
week." 
  Five transportation commissions--minus the pro-Sandinist CNT 
[National Transportation Commission]--reached an agreement this 
morning with the government for the reduction and freezing of 
the price of gasoline and diesel until 31 May and 30 April 
respectively. 
  Lacayo insisted dialogue must continue to be the "weapon" 
Nicaraguans have in "this new stage." "He who resorts to another 
method has been left behind in the past, and the Nicaraguan 
people will withdraw their support for him." 
  Regarding a question about the negotiations between the 
government and the International Monetary Fund, Lacayo reported 
that last year the IMF, known for its harsh adjustment policies, 
had recommended an "exaggerated" amount of saving that the 
people could not bear. 
  He explained, however, that the intention is to have the 
state, not the people, control its spending so that the 
government will spend less, operating from the taxes it 
collects, he said. 
  The intention is for the government to have a surplus so 
that 
part of the investments may come from revenues from the people, 
because "we suspect foreign aid will decrease gradually, and we 
Nicaraguans must be sure that we will be able to stand on our 
own feet through our own effort," he added. "Therefore, we have 
to start, as they say, becoming disciplined in order to live off 
our own effort, and that is what it is all about," he said. 
  The IMF has told the government it has to save more this 
year 
in order to allot more funds to production so that it will take 
off faster. 
  In principle, the government agrees with the idea of saving 
but disagrees with the extremely high amounts the IMF is trying 
to impose, he said. 
  Nevertheless, the government and IMF have been negotiating 
since April and September and have agreed on a "more moderate 
amount," Lacayo said, adding that "even this way, it is costing 
us very much." 
  "We believe, however, we already have different plans, 
including the privatization of part of Telcor [Nicaraguan 
Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute], which will 
help us achieve this goal this year."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 2 
February; source follows in parentheses after each item. 
  President Violeta Chamorro inaugurated a stock exchange on 1 
February for the first time in Nicaraguan history. This stock 
exchange will strengthen the national financial system, and, 
according to President Chamorro, its creation places Nicaragua 
on par with other Central American nations. (Managua Sistema 
Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  The government estimated today the five-day-old 
transportation strike caused losses of approximately 60 million 
cordobas, or, more than $9 million. An economist has said from 
that amount, which represents for Nicaragua the revenues earned 
from the total production of coffee, the government has lost 
over 3 million cordobas, the equivalent of $500,000, in taxes.

  [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 9 
January 1994 on page 12 reports that the National Development 
Bank (Banades) will make available 1.296 billion cordobas in 
loans to small and medium producers for the 1994-95 crop year. 
According to the article, the bank will attempt to eliminate the 
credit policy which concentrates the bulk of the available 
resources in the hands of just a few growers. The bank estimates 
that the new policy will reach an additional 9,700 customers for 
a total of 42,700; interest rates will range between 16 and 18 
percent. Silvio Baltodano, assistant credit manager at Banades, 
says that the bank will target nontraditional products, and that 
loans will be made to those in a position to pay off their 
loans. According to the article, for short-term financing 
Banades will devote 454.3 million cordobas for agriculture,

industry. Long-term financing will total 403.9 million cordobas.

  [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 13 
January 1994 on page 12 reports that, according to Finance 
Minister Emilio Pereira, in 1994 the government will back 
compensation bonds issued to owners of confiscated property for 
up to 954 million cordobas. Bonds were issued last year for 720 
million cordobas. Pereira urged bondholders not to sell their 
bonds at low prices. He explained that bonds can be used to pay 
taxes on capital goods and to pay utilities. Government assets 
to be sold to back the bonds include farm equipment, land, and 
businesses. Pereira said that thus far 328 people have received 
compensation bonds for confiscated property. The article reports 
that bonds awarded last year were used to purchase tractors, 
land, and construction equipment for a total of 143,605,000 
cordobas. As soon as the bonds were first issued, owners began 
to sell them through newspaper advertisements, according to the 
article.

posts in the Presidency Ministry were created in order to 
"delegate responsibilities and lighten the workload," according 
to Tomas Delaney, deputy minister for State Affairs. Delaney 
explains that his position was designed to coordinate the 
activities of the Executive branch with the Legislative, 
Judicial, and Electoral branches. Dayton Caldera, deputy 
minister for Government Affairs and director of the National 
Corporation of the Public Sector, denies that the new portfolios 
will add to the bureaucracy. Rather, according to the article, 
his duties include "coordinating the work of the Presidency and 
the Cabinet." The new deputy minister for Civilian Affairs, 
Boanerges "Pepe" Matus, is responsible for "civilian and private 
organizations, trade unions, and agencies in the country's 
interior."

  [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 21 
January 1994 on pages 1 and 5 reports that the National 
Directorate (DN) of the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) should be replaced with a "more representative 
organization," according to DN member Luis Carrion. Carrion, who 
is also coordinator of the FSLN Statutes Committee, explains 
that the FSLN must promote its program "under current 
conditions, which are not those of the 70's or the 80's...but 
those of a developing democracy." He explains that the DN should 
disappear because it belongs to a "moment in history" when "not 
one of us was elected, history put us there." The committee 
proposes to replace the DN with a "National Directive or 
Council" with approximately 25 members, including women, to be 
elected by the Sandinist Assembly. The council, in turn, will 
elect an executive committee whose term will run one year and 
which will be subordinate to the assembly. The article explains 
that the new council will be elected at the extraordinary 
congress, and the council will then elect the committee. Carrion 
says that Sandinists should no longer be categorized as 
"members" or "militants," but rather "everyone should be equal 
and have the same duties and rights." With regard to an FSLN 
presidential candidate, Carrion suggests that a candidate be 
chosen by the direct vote of all the Sandinists in the country.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 2 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria hailed the arrival of Rafael Caldera to 
the Venezuelan presidency, and he urged him to continue the 
binational integration process and overcome -- through frank 
dialogue -- any obstacle. 
  Gaviria said in a message aired in Santa Fe de Bogota on 
Wednesday on the occasion of Caldera's inauguration: "The 
challenge of those who today received the Venezuelan nation's 
helm, as well as of those who shall receive the leadership of 
Colombia in seven months, shall be to preserve what has been 
achieved and to attain what we still lack." The Colombian 
president did not travel to Venezuela because President Caldera 
did not invite any foreign presidents to his inauguration. 
  Gaviria noted that, now with Caldera as president, 
"Venezuela 
has a man of integrity, versed in public matters and with a 
vision and leadership recognized throughout the continent, whose 
serenity and experience will be the best guarantee that this new 
administration will achieve significant accomplishments." 
  Upon insisting on the need to continue the two nations' 
integration process, the Colombian president said, "the two 
nations' futures are inexorably tied together. Never before has 
the possibility been so close to make reality the dream of that 
universal Venezuela that you and we respect so much -- Simon 
Bolivar, the Liberator." 
  Gaviria acknowledged that the extensive shared border (2,000 
km) creates frictions, "but what we must understand, Colombians, 
as well as Venezuelans, is that the closer our ties and the more 
extensive our cooperation, the greater shall be our 
possibilities in successfully overcoming all obstacles."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 2 
February. 
  The Colombian Government has decided to cut its 1994 budget 
by 369.8 billion pesos in order to stop the revaluation of the 
peso and to ease the achievement of keeping the inflation under 
the 19-percent mark. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said 
this will cause the budget deficit to drop to only .16 percent 
of the gross domestic product. The government will subtract 
171.8 billion pesos from operation costs; 50 billion pesos will 
be saved in foreign debt payments and 98 billion pesos in 
investment. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 22 Jan 94, 
p 1B) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) 
and the National Customs and Tax Directorate have reported that 
while imports grew by 49.7 percent in the first 10 months of 
1993, exports grew by only 2 percent. Imports amounted to $8.08 
billion, compared to $5.403 billion over the same period in 
1992. The increase in imports was due mainly to the boom in the 
construction sector; coal was the only traditional export 
product that achieved a growth. Coal exports grew from $429 
million over the first 10 months of 1992 to $463 million in 
1993. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 27 Jan 94, p 1B) 
  Antonio Pretelt Emiliani, president of the Colombian Coal 
Enterprise (Carbocol), announced on 27 January that Carbocol 
will be put on sale this year and that, although the evaluation 
that will allow the authorities to set its minimum price is yet 
to be carried out, its approximate value is $1 billion. Pretelt 
confirmed the government is willing to privatize the state-owned 
portion of the Cerrejon coal mining complex, which includes part 
of the railroad and the port. He also said the enterprise has 
reduced its liabilities by $900 million and now has only $800 
million in debts. The Cerrejon Mine exported 13.8 million tons 
of coal during 1993 for an amount of 371.570 billion pesos ($464 
million). (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 Jan 94, p 
2B) 
  On 1 February Dane announced the inflation rate for January. 
It was 3.15 percent, which is less than the rate for January 
1993, when inflation grew by 3.24 percent. The cost of 
transportation increased by 9.23 percent, and the cost of food 
increased by 3.94 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Feb 94) 
  An economic report released by the Invest in Colombia 
Corporation states that foreign investment in Colombia increased 
by 24.6 percent in 1993 as compared to 1992. The majority of 
foreign investment went into the manufacturing sector, which 
received $198 million. The report states that some of the 
countries that invested the most in Colombia in 1993 were the 
United States, with 57.7 percent; Venezuela, with 15.1 percent; 
and Panama, which invested $49 million. The European country 
that invested the most was Sweden, with $27.7 million. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1753 GMT 2 Feb 94)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections, 
scheduled for 8 May. 
  Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party presidential hopeful, 
has 
responded to former President Alfonso Lopez, who said the 
presidential hopefuls had not expressed their position on the 
exchange rate. De la Calle reminded Lopez that when he spoke 
before the National Federation of Businessmen, he said that "the 
next administration must balance its public finances, because it 
is the only way we can avoid continuous currency reevaluations 
and maintain low interest rates." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 24 Jan 94 p 7A) 
  Ernesto Samper Pizano, Liberal Party presidential hopeful, 
committed himself to promoting agricultural activities and the 
tourist free zone and to developing the Magdalena region. 
Samper seeks to "promote products abroad and reactivate the 
agrarian fund, the national rehabilitation plan, and the IDEMA 
[Agricultural-Livestock Marketing Institute], which are pillars 
of the country's agricultural sector." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Jan 94 p 7A) 
  Carlos Lemos, former Colombian foreign minister and Liberal 
Party presidential hopeful, said on 25 January that if Colombia 
and Venezuela really want to resolve their border differences, 
they must "accept arbitration by a third party." A high-level 
bilateral commission appointed by the presidents has submitted a 
report to the two governments with its recommendations. (Paris 
AFP in Spanish 2106 GMT 28 Jan 94) 
  Andres Pastrana Arango, leader of the New Democratic Force, 
has confirmed that he will launch his presidential campaign on 
10 February. He will tour 192 municipalities of Antioquia only 
87 days before the elections. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 31 Jan 94) 
  Carlos Lemos, Liberal Party presidential hopeful, has stated 
that liberalism is being handled foolishly. In a statement made 
only two months before the elections, Lemos said the party must 
state its position regarding the concentration of wealth in 
Colombia. For his part, Ernesto Samper agrees that the party 
must be reformed but says "liberalism has shown its willingness 
to reform and modernize itself," unlike other parties. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 2 
February. 
  Planning Minister Delia de Cardenas reported today the 
Panamanian Government had taken the first step to restructure 
its foreign debt with private banks by issuing bonds for more 
than $450 million in European Currency Units, Yens, and 
Eurobonds. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0202 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  An Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) report has 
stated that Panama attained its economic recovery goal for 1992 
after the crisis of 1988 to 1989 by registering an 8-percent 
growth. According to the latest statistics available at the 
Comptroller General's Office, the Panamanian economy registered 
a 5.9-percent growth in its gross domestic product, and 
unemployment decreased from 14.2 percent to 12.5 percent in 
1992. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 31 Jan 94 p 17a) 
  According to a document issued by the National Baking 
Commission, the international banking center that operates in 
Panama increased its assets by 11 percent in the last quarter of 
1993 as compared to the same period in 1992. (Panama City LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 26 Jan 94 p 11a) 
  Panama's fuel debt with Mexico and Venezuela is more than 
$250 million, while interests accumulate at a rate of $800,000 
per month, Roberto Alfaro, commerce and trade minister, reported 
yesterday. Panama has presented two proposals to negotiate the 
fuel debt and is waiting for the response from both governments. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0001 GMT 26 Jan 94) 
  Eduardo Stein, president of the Foundation for the Economic 
and Social Development of Central America, has told members of 
the Panamanian Association of Business Executives regarding 
NAFTA that because 70 percent of Panama's gross domestic product 
is represented by the service sector, it, therefore, has a 
significant negotiating advantage over the rest of the Central 
American nations. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 29 
Jan 94 p 11a)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections, 
which are scheduled for 8 May 1994, monitored through 3 February. 
  Pedro Vallarino Cox, president of the National Renewal 
Movement (Morena), has invited Ruben Blades, presidential 
candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, to support the 
presidential candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles. When asked if 
Morena has been set aside now that the Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement (Molirena) has decided to name Carles as its 
presidential candidate, Vallarino Cox replied: "Carles is the 
Morena candidate, and I welcome the decision by other parties to 
support Carles." Presidential candidate Carles has visited 
David, Chiriqui Province, in the company of Molirena and Morena 
sympathizers. Carles told his supporters: "I am offering a 
government that will resolve problems with actions." (Panama 
City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 24 Jan 94) 
  Tomas Cabal writes in his "Hidden Truths" column that the 
candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles has gained strength now that 
Molirena has decided to support him. He adds: "Many in the 
Arnulfist Party and Authentic Liberal Party are also endorsing 
Carles, even though those two parties are supporting Mireya de 
Gruber's presidential candidacy." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA 
in Spanish 30 Jan 94 p6a) 
  Cesar Aparicio, secretary general of the National 
Integration 
Movement (Mina), announced during a news conference on 28 
January that the party's rank and file members are "going to 
support the presidential bid of Jose Salvador Munoz of the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party (PPD)." Earlier, Mina President 
Arrigo Guardia had thrown his support behind Molirena candidate 
Carles. Aparicio added the PPD will allow certain prominent 
Mina figures to run for office under the PPD banner. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p4) 
  Talking to San Miguelito residents, presidential candidate 
Ruben Dario Carles has promised to upgrade social services, such 
as education, health, transportation, and security. He has 
said: "The Metropolitan Sanitation Directorate has sufficient 
workers and equipment to collect garbage, but it is not doing 
its job." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 
GMT 31 Jan 94) 
  During a news conference, Carles has vowed he will strive 
"to 
stamp out corruption, influence peddling, nepotism, and 
cronyism." He has said the democratic regime that began on 20 
December 1989 "has been timid about ending corruption," adding 
he will take a hardline position against it with popular 
support. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 2 Feb 94 p2)

  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 28 Jan, CANA -- Dominica's trade 
minister, Charles Maynard, says he is more interested in having 
better Caribbean trade than in boosting trade among the wider 
developing nations. For example, he said, over any "South/South" 
trade, he would welcome an opportunity for "shipping things into 
Barbados." 
  "Let us look at more trade with our neighbours. Let us look 
at more trade in Caricom (the Caribbean Community). Let us look 
at more trade with Guadeloupe and Martinique," Maynard 
suggested. He was reacting to agronomist Arthie Martin's 
suggestion that Caribbean countries should engage in more 
South/South trade. 
  Martin said that traditional trading arrangement which small 
countries like Dominica have with the industrialised world might 
take a beating from international trade arrangements like the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  Maynard said: "We have engaged in a programme of moving into 
trade with Venezuela... Despite that, this has been on for more 
than a year ... We have not seen any breakthrough." He also 
pointed to trade-related matters with Colombia and other Latin 
American countries, which "have remained merely at the level of 
discussions." He urged local manufacturers here to try to expand 
their exports in and out of the region.

  [Text] President Fidel Castro last night attended the 
farewell reception held for Beatriz Paredes Rangel, Mexican 
ambassador to Cuba, with whom Castro talked at length. Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina and other government leaders, 
representatives of the different sectors of the national life, 
and the diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba also attended the 
reception. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has designated 
Ambassador Paredes, a distinguished Mexican political figure, 
chairman of the National Commission for Development and Justice 
for the Indian Populations of Mexico [Comision Nacional de 
Desarrollo y Justicia de los Pueblos Indigenas de Mexico]. 
  While serving as ambassador to Cuba, Paredes did outstanding 
work toward optimal development of the relations between the two 
countries, which has won her the respect and esteem of the 
authorities and the population of Cuba. 
  In the name of her government, the diplomat yesterday 
afternoon donated to Casa de las Americas 115 works of folk art 
from the various Mexican states, and she reiterated to the 
Cubans that Mexico has never, nor will it ever, abandon them.

  [Text] Today, official Mexican sources reacted against a 
meeting held in the United States on human rights in their 
country. According to (Andres Rosenthal), Mexican deputy 
secretary of foreign relations, yesterday's meeting, held by a 
subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which was 
summoned by Robert Torricelli, is anti-Mexican and seeks to 
interfere with the domestic affairs of his country. (Rosenthal) 
said that according to the Mexican people, it is unacceptable 
for the U.S. to try to judge or tarnish the reputation of his 
country because of some people's resentment that Mexico enjoys 
normal diplomatic relations with the Cuban Government. 
Furthermore, (Rosenthal) added, Torricelli is one of those who 
is offended at having lost the battle against the free trade 
agreement, which was recently established among Mexico, the 
United States, and Canada.

  [Text] The Brazilian Government has repudiated, through 
Brazilian newspapers, the annual report on human rights issued 
by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. report released 
yesterday included Brazil among the countries that violate 
civilian rights. 
  In its reaction to the U.S. report, the Brazilian Government 
considers as unfounded charges of disrespect for civilian rights 
because the document does not consider the efforts by the 
Brazilian federal, state, and municipal governments to solve the 
problem. 
  The Brazilian Government believes the subject must be 
discussed by international organizations and stresses that the 
accusation is unacceptable because the U.S. Government does not 
release reports on human rights violations in its own territory.

  [Text] The government has asked the people to remain calm 
during today's protest. Government Minister Marcelo Santos has 
not rejected the possibility of the government using a 
mobilization decree in the case of public disorder during the 
strike. 
  The government minister called on the United Workers Front 
[FUT] to execute the strike peacefully to avoid endangering the 
people's safety. Santos said the national strike is absurd, and 
he noted that it does not affect the government but the 
country's production sectors and the workers. 
  Two government spokesmen have reported there is no going 
back 
on the price measures. Regarding the unconstitutionality suits 
filed with the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal by several 
political parties, the government minister said he will defend 
the gasoline price hike within the extent of the law. He said 
the government will not derogate the price hike decree just 
because there are people demonstrating in the streets. 
  Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has stated it is not 
possible 
to modify the fuel price increase, and if someone in the 
government suggests it, he will oppose the motion. 
  Labor Minister Alfredo Corrales has said the government is 
studying the possibility of increasing workers' salaries in 
general. 
  National Congress President Samuel Bellettini announced that 
the National Congress will call on the economic front to explain 
the legal basis for the fuel price hike. 
  Meanwhile, FUT leader Juan Andrango said today's preventive 
strike has gained strength because it demands cutting back the 
gasoline price increase. Andrango told Radio Quito this morning 
that the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal must suspend the 
fuel price increase, and he warned that if it does not, the 
strike will be maintained indefinitely. He said there will be an 
empty pots-and-pans march next week and an Indian demonstration 
demanding higher salaries. Labor, Indian, peasant, and student 
organizations representatives met and formed a grand front to 
coordinate the preventive strike. Today's strike will be 
followed by bigger protests of indefinite length, including 
another Indian uprising. 
  Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador, said this criminal and reckless 
measure has harmed everyone. He urged all sectors to join the 
struggle as the only remaining alternative. 
  Yesterday, there were street demonstrations throughout the 
country. Demonstrations cause extensive traffic jams, trouble 
for the people, and property damage. The police arrested 16 
adults and 53 minors in different parts of the country. 
  Chambers of commerce have appealed for peace and talks as 
valid alternatives to overcoming the problem. The industrialists 
regret that the government's failure to put public finances in 
order has resulted in the adoption of measures that negatively 
affect the various economic sectors. 
  This morning, Quito Chamber of Commerce President (Nicanor 
Calixto) told Radio Quito that the private sector is worried 
about the high cost of fuel because this negatively affects the 
national economy. 
  (Calixto) criticized the president of Congress for calling 
for protests throughout the country and favored Finance Minister 
Cesar Robalino going to Congress to explain why the government 
has implemented this measure. 
  Meanwhile, Social Christian Party Deputy Heinz Moeller 
thinks 
the strike is a valid method for protesting the exorbitant fuel 
price increase decreed by the Duran-Ballen administration. He 
criticized the labor minister for saying there is an environment 
of unruliness in the country.

  [Text] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus told the 
"24 Hours" newscast that his election as OAS secretary general 
is guaranteed. He added that he is confident that Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria will not run for the post. 
  The Costa Rican foreign minister said he has been virtually

support of 23 countries: He needs 18 votes to be elected. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] If elections are held without

  Referring to the possible confirmation of Colombian 
President 
Cesar Gaviria's candidacy to the post, he clearly suggested that 
Gaviria give up the possibility of officially announcing his 
candidacy. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] Twenty-two or 23 countries are 
convinced this is fair. I am sure other countries will join 
them. Above all, I am sure -- and I say it with great respect -- 
that President Gaviria will take these aspects into 
consideration and abstain from officially announcing his 
candidacy. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy returned to 
his country this afternoon at the end of his two-day visit to 
Peru. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori bid farewell to his 
colleague in a formal ceremony at the headquarters of the 8th 
Air Group. Before leaving, the Paraguayan president held a news 
conference in which he said relations between the two countries 
will be strengthened and that the fight to eradicate poverty and 
drug trafficking can only take place with the unity of our 
countries. 
  Pleased to have paid a two-day official visit to Lima, 
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy told the media the 
following about the fight against drugs: 
  [Begin Wasmosy recording] This scourge cannot be fought 
alone. All countries must join forces. These include producing 
countries, which must seek alternative crops; countries used for 
trafficking drugs; and countries that serve as drug markets, 
which represent the most serious problem. The countries that 
are drug markets are the ones that encourage drug traffickers to 
seek this trade to earn a living. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to send a fraternal 
hug 
to the Peruvian people from this brother Paraguayan, who loves 
you and who hopes to get to know you better. United, we can all 
work for a better America, including Central and North America. 
Thank you very much. [end recording] 
  At the end of the news conference, the Paraguayan president 
went to the 8th Air Group, where President Fujimori was waiting 
for him. Both presidents reviewed the troops stationed in the 
area. After the playing of both national anthems, the 22 
members of the official Paraguayan delegation bid farewell to 
President Fujimori; the Armed Forces and police generals; and 
the foreign, economy, and education ministers. 
  At 1730, Wasmosy, accompanied by Fujimori, ascended the 
stairs of the Paraguayan Airlines plane, where both presidents 
gave each other a fraternal hug. Finally, just before entering 
the plane, a smiling Paraguayan president waved and bid farewell 
to our country for the last time.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 2 
February; source follows in parentheses after each item. 
  The Salvadoran economy has been growing at a rate of 5 
percent for the last two years, which denotes a strong economic 
growth in all areas, according to Central Reserve Bank (BCR) 
spokesmen. Economic growth was reported mainly in the areas of 
construction, services, the manufacturing industry, and 
commerce. "The country is no longer dependent on foreign aid. 
The U.S. reduction in aid should not have a major impact on the 
economy," the BCR spokesmen have said. (San Salvador EL DIARIO 
DE HOY in Spanish 27 Jan 94 p 29) 
  The cost of living increased by 1,115 colons in the past 
four 
years, showing that the economic growth mentioned by the 
government has not helped the poor. According to investigations 
conducted by the Consumer Protection Center (CDC), the poor in 
El Salvador do not benefit from the country's economic growth. 
Purchasing power has dropped by 18 percent in rural areas due 
to the inflation rate in the past few years. There has been a 
16-percent drop in urban areas, and there is a concentration of 
wealth in a few hands, the CDC states. (San Salvador Radio 
Venceremos Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 27 Jan 94) 
  Salvadoran exports reached $1.022 billion in 1993, which is 
$448 million more than in 1989, the BCR announced on 31 January. 
Guatemala is the leading importer of Salvadoran products, 
according to the BCR. Forty-two percent of all exports in 1993 
went to Central America, 30 percent to the United States, and 7 
percent to Germany. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2324 GMT 31 Jan 
94) 
  Official sources said on 2 February the Salvadoran 
Government 
increased credits for the agriculture sector by $199,000 in the 
last four years. The BCR said the sector received $149,000 in 
credits in 1989, but in 1993 it had increased to $348,000. A 
BCR communique also stated there was an increase in the 
production of basic grains from 18.4 million quintals in 1989 to 
more than 21 million quintals in 1993. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 2059 GMT 2 Feb 94)

  [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio and other 
high-ranking government officials reacted to the U.S. State 
Department's report on Guatemala this Wednesday. The president 
responded to a reporter's question about the report and the 
activities of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] The State Department report says 
many things [words indistinct]. You have referred to one of 
them; that is, possible human rights violations by the Army, 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, and security forces personnel in 
general. The report only mentions the issue but does not include 
any specific information or evidence. The State Department has 
done the same with Peru and other countries. We are reviewing 
[words indistinct] and I am studying it. The report includes 
several recommendations that are acceptable and, admittedly, 
several of the things mentioned are realistic. However, 
responsibility for human rights violations falls on the state 
itself -- be it this state or any other -- thus the report says 
nothing new. 
  Regarding the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, the government 
is willing -- especially this year, when we expect to sign a 
peace agreement -- to eliminate them gradually. They have 
already started to be turned into [word indistinct] legal peace 
and development committees. However, the most important issue 
is that [words indistinct] patrol members who commit crimes, 
just as any Guatemalan citizen, will be tried and punished if 
found guilty. 
  The State Department and the international community already 
know this. We sent a letter sent to President Clinton 
specifically expressing our willingness to improve the situation 
and outlining the positive steps taken by the government. This 
is alluded to in the report. As I recall, it mentions somewhere 
that there is hope and that with the arrival of President Ramiro 
De Leon Carpio, there has been a reversal in the attitude of the 
Guatemalan Government. Thus, the report is not entirely 
negative. We believe in some cases [words indistinct] is 
correct but in others, it is a bit speculative. The report does 
not present sufficient arguments or evidence to back its 
assertions. 
  Just like any other State Department report, we will have to 
study and review it. We will look at its ramifications and the 
annotations and suggestions it makes to several ministries 
regarding labor, economic, and social issues, on special [words 
indistinct], assembly plants, and so forth. I would say it is 
more or less a repetition of the reports that the State 
Department has issued every year for the past three or four 
years. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Alicia Talavera and Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] The Nicaraguan Government said yesterday that it is 
unaware of a 1993 U.S. State Department report on human rights 
that includes Nicaragua. The report claims -- among other 
things -- that this country "is still failing to persecute and 
punish those responsible for human rights violations." 
  Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo emphasized comments made 
last week by Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American Affairs, at a private meeting. Watson said it 
was "fascinating" that Nicaraguans had been on their way to 
solving their own problems in the past few months." 
  "I am unaware of such criticism," Lacayo said regarding 
press 
reports on the U.S. State Department report, which states that 
"the Nicaraguan judicial system is jammed and often follows the 
guidelines of political parties." The report added that this 
system has helped maintain impunity, statements that are not in 
keeping with Watson's praise of the new membership of the 
Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ]. 
  Lacayo had lunch yesterday with all members of the CSJ, 
which 
held a plenary meeting to incorporate new lawyers. For that 
reason, none of the magistrates was available for comment to 
BARRICADA on the U.S. State Department report. 
  Claudia Paniagua, spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Foreign 
Ministry, said that one must take into account that the report 
is for 1993. Paniagua focused on the statements made by the 
U.S. assistant secretary of state, who praised the fact that 
nearly all deputies have rejoined the National Assembly. 
<H5>  America's Watch, Too </H5>
  U.S. Ambassador John Maisto described the report as 
"concrete, objective, and balanced." He added that it deals 
with human rights in more than 150 countries. 
  "It is an annual report. I suggest you read it carefully. 
It is objective," the diplomat added, after meeting yesterday 
with Assembly President Luis H. Guzman. 
  A report by the Americas Watch human rights group also 
states 
that the human rights situation in Nicaragua in 1993 continued 
to be characterized by a highly polarized political environment 
and a weak central government. That report makes a similar 
comment about the Nicaraguan judicial system. 
  The Americas Watch report criticizes the "disproportionate 
and excessive" use of force on various occasions, especially 
against armed groups, labor strikes, and peaceful protests. 
  Incidentally, Mrs. Cinthia Arnson of Americas Watch is 
currently visiting Managua. In the past two days she has met 
with government officials, military judge advocates, the 
government minister, and leaders of the main human rights groups.

quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] This is the first official visit to Peru by a 
Paraguayan president. Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived in our capital 
at 1055 after a delay of more than an hour. President Fujimori 
welcomed him at the 8th Air Group with the honors befitting his 
high rank. The group then went to the Independence Heroes 
Monument on Jesus Maria Street to place wreaths. 
  After saluting the national flag, the Paraguayan leader went 
to the Government Palace where he met privately with his 
counterpart Alberto Fujimori for one hour and 10 minutes. 
Wasmosy made favorable comments about his first meeting with the 
chief of state and emphasized the possibility of establishing a 
free zone in (Puerto Suarez) to give Peru an outlet to the 
Atlantic: 
  [Wasmosy] "We had an open agenda. We discussed many issues; 
we talked about investments, commerce, drug trafficking, and 
complementary issues at the diplomatic and Consular Academy. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "What about the free zone? 
  [Wasmosy] "We offered Peru the same outlet we offered 
Bolivia 
along the Paraguay River through [words indistinct]. In turn, 
Fujimori offered us the same facilities Peru gave Bolivia. 
  [Reporter] "When will this take effect? 
  [Wasmosy] "We are just starting; this is the first visit of 
a 
Paraguayan president to this country. 
  [Reporter] "Will you hold meetings on the free zone? 
  [Wasmosy] "I hope so. We have not talked about that yet. 
  [Reporter] "Will the Bolivian president also participate in 
the talks regarding the free zone in (Puerto Suarez)? 
  [Wasmosy] "No, Peru and Bolivia already signed a trade 
agreement, which is very positive for the two countries. We are 
helping Bolivia and Peru secure an outlet to the Atlantic 
through (Puerto Suarez) or (Puerto Aguirre)." 
  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived at the 
Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] at 1600. He received the 
honors befitting his high rank. CCD President Jaime Yoshiyama 
greeted Wasmosy and escorted him to the Senate Hemicycle where 
the plenum officially welcomed him. During his speech at the 
solemn session, Yoshiyama emphasized the presence of the 
illustrious visitor by stating that it reflects a commitment to 
strengthen bilateral relations: 
  [Yoshiyama] "This is the first time in the republican 
history 
of our countries that a head of state of the sister Republic of 
Paraguay has paid an official visit to Peru. This represents the 
strongest political will to reaffirm the traditional ties of 
friendship that exist between two peoples." 
  Meanwhile, President Wasmosy commented on the possibilities 
of broad mutual support in various areas: 
  [Wasmosy] "We are living in difficult times that require 
careful study to make the most [word indistinct] decisions. You 
Peruvians and we Paraguayans [words indistinct]." 
  At the conclusion of the ceremony, the Paraguayan president 
and his official delegation, which included the foreign 
relations minister, politicians, union leaders, and businessmen, 
went to the Municipal Palace where Wasmosy was declared an 
illustrious guest and given the keys to the city. In a brief 
news conference where he expressed thanks for the welcome he 
received in Lima, President Wasmosy called the agreement signed 
on the morning of 31 January between Peruvian and Paraguayan 
businessmen at the Lima Chamber of Commerce historic. He added 
that Peru will receive the same treatment as Bolivia in gaining 
access to the Atlantic through Paraguay's largest river basin, 
and this in turn will promote greater commercial development in 
the region: 
  [Wasmosy] "We discussed this with the president, that is, 
making you the same offer we made Bolivia through (Puerto 
Aguirre), (Puerto Suarez), and (Tibush). This would be linked by 
railway. Peru will gain a outlet to the Atlantic through the 
[words indistinct]."

<F P=106> [Interview with President Alberto Fujimori by Alvaro </F>
Amoretti at Government House in Lima; date not given] 
  [Text] [Amoretti] Have you met Uruguayan President Luis 
Lacalle? 
  [Fujimori] I have. 
  [Amoretti] What is your opinion of him? 
  [Fujimori] First of all he is a good communicator. He is an 
eloquent president who always raises original ideas at 
international forums. 
  [Amoretti] Are you on good terms with him? 
  [Fujimori] Yes. I would say communication with Lacalle is 
good. We talked at several international meetings, and on 
several occasions he called me from Montevideo. 
  [Amoretti] And with Enrique Iglesias? 
  [Fujimori] We have excellent relations. He was among the 
first who supported us, and even today he is one of the few who 
has always been on our side. We have a lot for which to thank 
him. 
  [Amoretti] You ran in the 1990 elections as the leader of 
Change 90, a political group that no one thought would have good 
chances of winning the presidency. The victory of writer Mario 
Vargas Llosa, the leader of Fredemo [Democratic Front], was 
taken for granted all over the world, and also in Peru. Did you 
actually expect to win the elections? 
  [Fujimori] Right, very few people thought I had good chances 
of reaching the presidency. To tell you the truth, only four 
people and I were expecting a victory. 
  [Amoretti] And why do you think you won? Why did people 
choose an unknown person instead of a famous writer or the old 
APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]? 
  [Fujimori] First of all, because of the people being fed up 
with the Peruvian political system. People were tired of a 
system that offered no solutions. Peru lived in democracy, but 
what did people get from that? Second, I believe people realized 
that we were proposing a government without any links whatsoever 
with the major political and economic interests that were 
binding Peru. The other candidates, however, clearly represented 
continuism, after 500 years of failure. 
  [Amoretti] Did Vargas Llosa represent that continuism? 
  [Fujimori] Perhaps he did; perhaps he didn't. But that is 
not 
the only reason why Vargas Llosa lost and we won. He represented 
the elite of Peruvian society, and this drove him away from the 
masses. That is why we won. 
  [Amoretti] Vargas Llosa recently has criticized you and your 
government very harshly. What is your opinion of him? 
  [Fujimori] I'd rather not give an opinion on Vargas Llosa 
because I believe his political opinions do not merit 
consideration. Like everyone else, however, I believe he is a 
good writer. 
  [Amoretti] You like him as a writer, but not as a 
politician. 
  [Fujimori] Right. (laughter) 
  [Amoretti] You won the runoff election in 1990 and replaced 
APRA leader Alan Garcia. How was the country when you assumed 
power? 
  [Fujimori] It was a disaster. The worst disaster I saw in 
the 
history of my country. As an example, I remind you that Peru had 
the world's highest inflation rate, it was isolated from all 
international financial organizations, it could get no credit, 
it was full of debts, and its economy was in true chaos. As if 
all that were not enough, terrorists were ruling all corners of 
the country. When I took over, there was no solution in sight 
for terrorism. Summarizing, I received a country in a state of 
disaster and with no solution in sight. 
  [Amoretti] Do you think Alan Garcia's administration is the 
only one to blame for this "state of disaster"? 
  [Fujimori] No, his administration is not the only one to 
blame. Peru's problem has been dragging on 500 years. These 500 
years weigh heavily on our shoulders and have plunged us into 
this situation. 
  [Amoretti] What is your evaluation of your predecessor's 
administration? While Vargas Llosa has been hard on you, one 
should acknowledge that you have not been any easier on Alan 
Garcia and his administration. 
  [Fujimori] Look here, I think that Alan Garcia and his 
administration managed the economy to suit their personal 
interests and the economic circumstances prevalent at that time. 
Peru was isolated; it embarked on projects that were not the 
most cost-effective ones. Certain industrial sectors were 
strongly protected just to favor them. Governmental and legal 
instruments were used to benefit people close to the government. 
There was very little serious economic management in which 
national interests were not the government's overriding concern. 
  [Amoretti] The Peruvian Congress currently is studying 
charges of bribery made against Alan Garcia and his party. They 
had allegedly accepted bribes from the Italian Government to 
build an electric train in Peru. According to the latest public 
opinion polls, more than 60 percent of Lima residents believe 
Garcia is guilty. Do you feel that the charges against the 
former president are serious? 
  [Fujimori] I could not make a categorical statement on an 
issue under investigation. But the source that contends that 
the former president is implicated in bribery is precisely from 
Italy, where the case is already under investigation. This goes 
to prove that at least there is no manipulation of the case at 
the domestic level. 
  [Amoretti] Following Alan Garcia's administration, the APRA 
was soundly defeated in 1990. At present it comes in last in 
all public opinion surveys conducted in Peru. Do you think the 
APRA is mortally wounded? 
  [Fujimori] I think it does not stand a chance of coming to 
power with the current leaders it has. Nevertheless, I cannot 
overlook the fact that there are many card-carrying APRA members 
who still believe in the guidelines and teachings of their party 
founder, Victor Raul Haya de la Torre. These people cherish the 
hope that their party will change direction and find its course 
again. Meanwhile, the majority of its members is supporting the 
government. They are supporting my government. 
  [Amoretti] Is that what the surveys that you handle show? 
  [Fujimori] No, that is what the people in the Peruvian 
mountain range, forest, indeed in all of Peru, say. 
  [Amoretti] You say that the people who follow Haya de la 
Torre's principles currently are aligned with your government. 
What do you think of Haya de la Torre? 
  [Fujimori] I think he is a person who made history. He was 
important, a good counterbalance for the politicians who at the 
time were not very honest. I think he was a very honest 
politician. 
  [Amoretti] You came to government in 1990 and, according to 
your own words, you received the country in a "state of 
disaster." When did you begin to think of the possibility of 
dissolving Congress? When did you begin to see that that would 
be the solution to the crisis? 
  [Fujimori] I never revealed that, but to be sincere it was a 
process, an evolution. I realized the problem was not only 
Congress but the whole Peruvian political system. It was the 
whole political system that was not working as it should. 
  [Amoretti] ... and Congress represented that political 
system that did not work. 
  [Fujimori] Of course. I also began to see that the Judicial 
Branch did not work as it should and something had to be done so 
justice would fulfill its duties. I began understanding that. I 
realized that here we either defeat violence and establish 
order, or the country would crumble amid the "democracy" we were 
living in. 
  [Amoretti] What was the determining factor that led you to 
take that step? 
  [Fujimori] I had two options. One was to administer the 
violence and economic crisis, to carry on as best as possible, 
and leave government in 1995 as a democratic president. But the 
people did not elect me for that. Politicians must solve 
problems. That is why I took the other option. 
  [Amoretti] Uruguayan President Juan Maria Bordaberry made a 
reasoning similar to yours in the 70's. He dissolved Congress 
and continued governing with the Armed Forces' support. Did you 
know anything about the Uruguayan experience when you decided to 
temporarily dissolve the Peruvian Congress? 
  [Fujimori] I knew something about what happened in Uruguay, 
although not in depth. Anyway, I think there has been a great 
difference between the two processes since the administrative 
act. In Peru the process is being carried out by the people 
through the president of the Republic, who is not subject to 
military power. From what I know, that was not the case with 
Bordaberry. That is the difference. I am in command here. 
  [Amoretti] Is the president still in charge here? 
  [Fujimori] Of course; it is notoriously so. 
  [Amoretti] Aren't there some military officers who demand 
old 
shares of power they enjoyed in the past? 
  [Fujimori] There are some military officers who want to 
recover the power they once had over the political system. They 
are demanding the share they once had and no longer control. 
When General Salinas and his group attempted to overthrow me, 
they did so because they did not accept the political power over 
the military power. 
  [Amoretti] Do the military officers who think in this manner 
represent a considerable group within the Peruvian Armed Forces? 
  [Fujimori] There are 100,000 men in the Peruvian Armed 
Forces. There is place for all kinds of ideas among 100,000 men. 
But that is not the main issue. The main issue is that here 
there is a hierarchy and a command that are very strong and that 
they will have to respect. 
  [Amoretti] I would like to return to the subject on your 
decision to temporarily dissolve Congress. Was it difficult for 
you, a president elected by the people, to make a decision of 
this kind? What internal conflicts does a president have when he 
makes a decision of this kind? 
  [Fujimori] I did not have any kind of internal conflicts 
before making the decision. I was absolutely convinced of what I 
was doing. 
  [Amoretti] Sometimes people wonder with whom the president 
consults before making a decision of this kind. In your case, 
who did you speak with? 
  [Fujimori] In my case, I only consulted my conscience. I 
have 
documents that can prove my internal evolution of what I was 
doing until I reached that drastic decision. I made the decision 
on my own, and a few hours later I phoned a few people to inform 
them of my determination and the contents of the decrees I would 
release. 
  [Amoretti] Didn't you consult the military chiefs? 
  [Fujimori] A few hours before publicly announcing my 
decision 
I spoke with all the commanders. I simply gave them clear 
instructions. 
  [Amoretti] Didn't you even consult or discuss the measure 
with some of the members of your family? 
  [Fujimori] No. I did not speak with any member of my family. 
Nobody, nobody at all knew about my decision. The irrefutable 
evidence is that nobody knew about it and that it did not leak 
out. (laughter) 
  [Amoretti] We just tried to point out similarities between 
the Uruguayan and Peruvian processes. Not long ago, Bordaberry 
said in an interview with EL OBSERVADOR that at the moment one 
decides to dissolve Congress, one is alone. Did you feel this 
way? 
  [Fujimori] I did not feel alone. I felt broad support, and 
that was proven afterward in the streets. My decision was backed 
by the people. 
  [Amoretti] Weren't the words "dictator" and "coupist," which 
were used afterward in many parts of the world to refer to you, 
resounding in your head? 
  [Fujimori] I know what you mean. But I am not interested in 
adjectives. I am only interested in solutions. And the events 
speak in my favor. We currently have a much more efficient 
democracy; Congress is working; the Peruvian people have work 
and can travel happily and calmly anywhere because the threat of 
terrorism is being controlled. The country is beginning to rise 
up again. Adjectives are not important. 
  [Amoretti] Some people maintain that "traditional liberal 
democracy" lacks enough authority to impose itself over 
violence. Do you think the weaknesses of that "traditional 
liberal democracy" are the ones that nourished the appearance 
and increase of terrorism in Peru? 
  [Fujimori] But there was no democracy in Peru before 5 April 
1992, because if there had been democracy there would have not 
been terrorism and the injustices that took place would have not 
happened. That is the evidence that democracy did not work. 
Simply because that was not a democracy. If a democratic system 
leads to terrorism, misery, injustice, and corruption, that 
system cannot be called democracy. 
  [Amoretti] By what I see, a system is "democratic" for you 
as 
long as some human rights are respected, like the right to work, 
to private property, to life, to happiness, etc. 
  [Fujimori] When I speak of human rights I speak not only of 
the human rights of the terrorists, because that was the trend 
in the last 12 years. Instead I am speaking of the human rights 
of 22 million Peruvians. The principle of respect for the human 
being must not make us forget that the social and human rights 
of the majority of the population must not be violated. 
Therefore, one must not be afraid to place human rights at risk 
in order to defeat terrorism. My government has the decisiveness 
and will to fight terrorism, but respecting human rights. I 
said: "Total respect for human rights," but first come the 
human rights of 22 million Peruvians. If someone violated human 
rights here it is the Shining Path, and I have done everything 
to defend the human rights of all the Peruvian people. You can 
tour not only the interior, but the outskirts of Lima and ask 
the people: "Where is your right to education, to an honorable 
life? Those rights cannot be seen and have not been seen for 
many years. We must now try to conquer those human rights for 
ourselves." 
  [Amoretti] When you launched the offensive against the 
Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement [MRTA], 
very few people believed you could win that war. When the Armed 
Forces captured [top Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman and 
other members of the Shining Path's leadership, everybody 
thought victory already had been won. Do you feel victory 
already has been won in this war? 
  [Fujimori] Much remains to be done. We still must wipe out 
the last pockets of terrorism in Peru. You may rest assured 
that I am going to mop up or exterminate terrorists. I have set 
some goals for myself and I must confess that I have achieved 
them. I intended to mop up MRTA during 1993, and it had 
practically disappeared by the end of last year. There are only 
two leaders at large, but I am quite sure that sooner or later I 
am going to capture them. Meanwhile, with regard to the Shining 
Path, they have surrendered for all practical purposes, and this 
has brought about massive desertion. I hope the Shining Path 
will have been routed by 1995. 
  [Amoretti] What role do you assign to the Peruvian Armed 
Forces in that war? 
  [Fujimori] Well, the Peruvian Army is a victorious force. 
When I ascended to the presidency, I found that the Army's 
morale had been totally undermined, it lacked motivation, it was 
disoriented, on the defensive, and nearly defeated. The 
military had retreated to its barracks. Now things are 
different -- this is a new Army. People have changed their 
opinion about the Army. 
  [Amoretti] Owing to the fight against guerrillas? 
  [Fujimori] Not only on account of that, but also because the 
Army is driving tractors; it is collaborating with the 
population, opening roads and highways, repairing homes and 
schools razed by terrorists; it is engaged in community service. 
The Peruvian Army not only serves to combat violence, it also 
has been raised for times of peace. 
  [Amoretti] Terrorism has left in its wake thousands of 
orphans who lack family values and the basic necessities of 
life. This is especially true in some regions of the country. 
What do you feel every time a citizen asks you to meet one of 
these children during your frequent trips to the interior? 
  [Fujimori] It makes me feel indignant and sets me pondering 
about those children's human rights. Who ever spares a thought 
for children's human rights? 
  [Amoretti] Do you still believe in the death penalty for 
terrorists? 
  [Fujimori] Yes, I do. I think capital punishment ought to be 
meted out to those who murder others without a motive. 
  [Amoretti] Isn't that, in a way, a return to the principle 
of 
"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"? 
  [Fujimori] No, I do not think so. I am in favor of the death 
penalty for top leaders. Were a new Abimael Guzman to emerge as 
leader he would have to be eliminated at once. 
  [Amoretti] Since you dissolved Congress, several 
international organizations have criticized you for making that 
decision. Much of the criticism has come from the United 
States, where economic aid to Peru has been time and again 
blocked because it is considered there that there is no 
unrestricted respect for human rights in your country. Would 
you admit to charges that excesses have been committed in the 
war against terrorism? 
  [Fujimori] Yes, I admit to that. There have been isolated 
cases of excesses. Human rights are always violated in a war 
against terrorism. The war has been waged here with a great 
deal of intelligence and, naturally, with force. There have 
been isolated cases because human rights violations had preceded 
this war. The Army used to act in a certain way, and we can see 
that it continued to mechanically follow the same behavior in 
some isolated cases. 
  [Amoretti] Well, are human rights being respected now? 
  [Fujimori] There is unrestricted respect for human rights. 
  [Amoretti] Then how would you justify a statement made by 
Alexander Watson -- a U.S. Government representative who came to 
Peru to inspect the progress made in human rights -- to the 
effect that although some progress has been made, much remains 
to be improved? 
  [Fujimori] Look, Peru has been the target of 
disproportionate 
criticism. It has not been taken into account that terrorism 
has claimed the lives of 25,000 people in Peru. After hearing 
this figure, one may wonder: What would have happened in the 
United States had anyone killed 250,000 people? Would the U.S. 
Government have allowed the death of 250,000 people? [figures as 
published] Certainly not. It would have certainly adopted 
special measures. 
  [Amoretti] Do you believe the United States is being unfair 
to Peru on the subject of human rights? 
  [Fujimori] Human rights have been violated everywhere in the 
world in the fight against terrorism. These violations have not 
been limited to isolated cases, but rather have been systematic. 
Human rights also have been violated through the bombing of 
entire cities. 
  [Amoretti] Your latest remark seems to be alluding directly 
to the U.S. policy of military intervention in the world. 
  [Fujimori] What about the bombing of the Russian Parliament? 
How could a parliament building have been bombed? What would 
they have said had this happened in Peru? What about U.S. 
intervention in Vietnam, Iraq, and in many other places, 
shouldn't these actions be regarded as human rights violations? 
Look how damaging those wars were. 
  [Amoretti] You are saying that the United States has a 
double 
standard for judging, for instance, what Washington does and 
what Peru does. 
  [Fujimori] That is undoubtedly correct. 
  [Amoretti] Today you visited the southern part of the 
country, which is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining 
Path. Did you ask the U.S. representative to join you for this 
visit? 
  [Fujimori] I did. I thought it would be useful for him, if 
he is going to report on human rights, to speak with many people 
whose rights have been violated by terrorists. Unfortunately, 
Mr. Watson preferred to stay in Lima and write his report from 
behind a desk. My government has a different approach: We deal 
with problems where they happen. 
  [Amoretti] Have you received the support of presidents or 
representatives of international organizations? 
  [Fujimori] I have. I keep receiving expressions of support 
out of recognition for what we have achieved here. I am sure 
that other peoples recognize our achievements in this area. 
What people of Latin America would have accepted a situation 
like that existing in Peru? What people of Latin America would 
reject a government that has eradicated terrorism in less than a 
year and a half? I feel supported. Which government of the 
United States, France, or Great Britain has fought terrorism as 
effectively as we have done here? Peru was like a Latin 
American Cambodia! That situation was overcome in less than one 
and a half years without major social costs. This is why I say 
that the U.S. criticism is disproportionate. 
  [Amoretti] Today you emphasized that when you took over, 
the Peruvian economy was chaotic. What is the current situation? 
  [Fujimori] It is recomposed and it is being put on a 
healthier footing. We have difficulties. We were at a critical 
point last year, but we immediately began to grow. We have not 
yet reached the levels of 1990, but from now on there will be 
steady growth. 
  [Amoretti] How is the country doing from a macroeconomic 
point of view? 
  [Fujimori] I think it is doing well. Inflation has been put 
under control and we expect it to remain below 25 percent in 
1994. Foreign investment is growing, and the public deficit has 
become manageable. In this field we are doing well. 
  [Amoretti] Those who know Peru are aware that there is no 
consolidated entrepreneurial spirit in the country. In this 
regard, a whole retrofitting process should be implemented in 
order to develop a pure liberal model. 
  [Fujimori] We have drastically implemented industrial 
retrofitting, eliminating overprotection of vast sectors of the 
economy. Now everyone is compelled to invest more, risk more, 
and produce more and better. He who does not understand this has 
no future in the new Peru. 
  [Amoretti] And what about banking and finance? 
  [Fujimori] I would say this sector has not yet fully adapted 
itself to this process. But I am sure that the arrival of the 
international banking system in Peru will adjust the whole 
process. I hope the international banking system will in the 
short term arrive through privatization of various banks that 
are now being run by the state. 
  [Amoretti] You say that the economy, even if gradually, has 
improved and the country is well from a macroeconomic point of 
view. But how is the current life of the average Peruvian? 
  [Fujimori] Tight. People do have shortages, which does not 
mean that Peru has the type of poverty of some African or Asian 
countries. But people do live tightly. There is recession and 
growth, but the important thing is that the economy is now on 
the right course. 
  [Amoretti] In recent years, there have been several 
successful economic experiences in South America, like that of 
Chile and then Bolivia and Argentina. Meanwhile, the Mexican 
process is to the north. What are the economic models in the 
region in which you are interested? 
  [Fujimori] Look, I reiterate that the model we are 
implementing here is totally Peruvian. This is not a whim 
because when we took over we found some major problems that the 
economies you are mentioning did not have to confront. Here we 
worked and we will continue to work with pragmatism. 
  [Amoretti] Shortly after you took over, you set in motion a 
vast program of deregulation and reduction of the state. Peru 
has privatized and continues to privatize many state companies. 
Do you know that in a referendum in Uruguay, 72 percent of the 
population voted against the privatization program of President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle's government? 
  [Fujimori] I do. 
  [Amoretti] And why would you tell the 72 percent of 
Uruguayans who voted against privatization that the right course 
is to privatize public enterprises? 
  [Fujimori] I would tell them that the state apparatus should 
be as efficient as possible. At the present time the state 
cannot be a charitable organization that subsidizes jobs. We 
made a drastic reduction of the state here in Peru, and today 
our state is much more efficient. And to the people who lost 
their public jobs, we encouraged them to build their future in 
the private sector. And if we talk about public enterprises, 
you'll be surprised to know that Peru had an annual deficit of 
$2.5 billion. It was difficult to reduce this deficit. Very 
difficult. 
  [Amoretti] At the beginning of your term, you said the 
majority of public enterprises could be run by the state. Why 
did you change your mind and decide to sell all public 
enterprises? 
  [Fujimori] I changed my mind. I concluded that I had to sell 
everything because inefficiencies could not be corrected if they 
remained within the state. And I was not wrong because the 
enterprises that were privatized have increased their 
production, workers have kept their jobs, investment has grown, 
and their higher profits have yielded higher taxes. 
  [Amoretti] What are the economic achievements you would like 
to attain in Peru? 
  [Fujimori] I would like Peru to grow and overcome the 
backwardness of 500 years. 
  [Amoretti] When a person like yourself leads a battle 
against terrorism, I would think that you are quite aware that 
you, yourself, may be an eventual target. Nevertheless, you 
continue to visit towns nationwide and you stop and talk to the 
people without much protection. Don't you fear an attempt on 
your life? 
  [Fujimori] I fear for my children. I have and will continue 
to fear for their safety. Of course I have adopted some very 
specific precautions in this regard. I do not fear for my life. 
I am willing to take risks. I specifically go to those places 
where the Shining Path is present. I do not fear it. 
  [Amoretti] What did you feel when TIME magazine named you 
"Man of the Year" in Latin America? 
  [Fujimori] A great satisfaction, naturally. But if anyone 
has to take any credit it is the Peruvian people. This prize 
belongs to the people. It was the people who endured the burden 
of the measures that were implemented to push the country 
forward; therefore, it is their award. 
  [Amoretti] The entire country is talking about the 
possibility that you may run for the next presidential term in 
1995. Will you seek reelection? 
  [Fujimori] I have not yet considered the issue. I continue 
to work and have no time to think about reelection yet. 
  [Amoretti] When do you plan to make a decision in this 
regard? 
  [Fujimori] I believe I will be making that decision and 
reporting it a few weeks before the registration deadline 
expires. Before the end of the year I will be deciding whether I 
will seek reelection or not. 
  [Amoretti] Have you made any preliminary decisions yet? 
  [Fujimori] (hesitates)... No, I have not. 
  [Amoretti] Do you want to continue in government or are you 
tired? 
  [Fujimori] I do not feel tired. Every time I talk with the 
people I feel more encouraged. I am not an office person. 
  [Amoretti] If you decide to seek reelection, what political 
scenario do you foresee in 1995? 
  [Fujimori] I believe that all the other political forces 
will form a coalition in 1995. Everyone against me. I am sure 
about that. (laughter) 
  [Amoretti] If you run, that is... (laughter) 
  [Fujimori] If I run... (laughter). 
  [Amoretti] Today's world is managed on the basis of large 
economic blocs. Peru is a member of the Andean Pact, but it is 
also opening its economy to be able to join other pacts, such as 
NAFTA, comprising the United States, Mexico, and Canada; or 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What will be Peru's 
short- and long-term position regarding these two blocs? 
  [Fujimori] Peru is preparing itself to achieve an 
integration of this nature. We have eliminated almost all trade 
barriers and those still in force are to be eliminated. 
  [Amoretti] Do you reject the idea of requesting your 
country's membership in NAFTA or Mercosur? 
  [Fujimori] No. This is something we have been considering 
and for which we have been preparing ourselves. Peru is betting 
on integration. 
  [Amoretti] Which one, Mercosur or NAFTA? 
  [Fujimori] Time will tell which one we will join. As a 
government leader I will have to assess my country's interests, 
and particularly Latin American interests. We will make our 
decision on that basis.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Peruvian President Alberto </F>
Fujimori by "special correspondents" Celso Chavez and Justo 
Pastor Benitez in Lima during Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy's state visit -- date not given] 
  [Text] [NOTICIAS] How did this rapprochement with Paraguay 
start? 
  [Fujimori] It really started during the presidential 
inauguration in Asuncion. At the time, President Wasmosy and I 
became friends. This visit greatly strengthens our bilateral 
ties. I believe some steps will be taken to strengthen them even 
more. 
  [NOTICIAS] Do you believe [Latin American liberator Simon] 
Bolivar's dream of achieving a politically and economically 
united Latin America will ever be accomplished? 
  [Fujimori] I believe that each one of these markets, 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the Andean Pact, will 
have to consolidate themselves by establishing free markets that 
will lead to integration. It is very likely that some countries 
will become doorways between Mercosur and the Andean Group. 
Peru, and I believe all Latin American countries, are very 
willing to be part of a large bloc. 
  [NOTICIAS] What is your definition of Peruvian economic 
policy, because any integration is based on the macroeconomic 
factor? 
  [Fujimori] I believe that one of the issues that may delay 
this economic integration is the establishment of common customs 
tariffs. There is a wide variety of ideas on this issue. 
Peru's case in the Andean Pact is an example of this, at least 
temporarily. Peru has an open economic policy, with common 
customs tariffs ranging between 15 and 25 percent on products, 
while other countries have a differentiated customs tax. This 
is the main problem impeding an agreement. 
  [NOTICIAS] What is Peru's domestic situation? Is terrorism 
still a shadow? 
  [Fujimori] I hope you have the opportunity to witness for 
yourselves here in Lima, and throughout Peru, that people can 
walk freely and safely. Terrorism is not a problem for us 
anymore. In less than two years, we have been able to defeat 
two of the more violent groups in the world, not only in Latin 
America. By adopting specific and practical measures at all 
levels, and through an overall strategy, Peru is now able to 
overcome underdevelopment, precisely because terrorism was one 
of the factors that undermined this objective. 
  Right now we have launched a great battle: the fight against 
poverty. This is done, of course, without overlooking other 
areas such as the fight against drug trafficking. We are 
concentrating on this to strengthen domestic security. 
  [NOTICIAS] Do the Chiapas and Santiago del Estero cases 
worry you? 
  [Fujimori] Similar cases may occur in other places. We have 
suffered a terrible nightmare for the past 13 years. 
Fortunately, we are almost through with it and we have gained 
great experience. We are aware that pacification is achieved 
only through development. We are working on this, and this is 
why we have declared war on poverty. 
  [NOTICIAS] Mr. President, do you believe that the Fujimori 
approach in Peru as a Peruvian political experience can be 
applied in other Latin American countries? 
  [Fujimori] I do not believe that models applied in one 
country can be repeated elsewhere. But I do believe that people 
are questioning themselves, not only in Latin America but in 
other regions of the world as well, because the so-called 
democracies are not working. Peru's particular case, and 
probably that of some Latin American countries, is that the 
objectives and aspirations outlined by the government and the 
people are not fulfilled. This is the cause of frustrations 
resulting from a system that is mistakenly called democracy. 
  At the world level, there will be a need for reform that the 
peoples will bring about to improve the democratic system. 
  [NOTICIAS] Do you believe the Latin American political class 
is declining? 
  [Fujimori] It is being questioned and this is taking place 
in several places. If there is no rapid reaction, it is going 
to be challenged. 
  [NOTICIAS] Are you thinking about seeking reelection? And 
if that is the case, what will be your political support? Will 
you be supported by any particular sector? 
  [Fujimori] I reassert that I have not made up my mind yet. 
My entire government policy is based on the people, on the 
people's needs. 
  My party, Change 90 or New Majority, is the one that groups 
competent people. We do not have a party structure. 
  [NOTICIAS] How would you define democracy from your point of 
view? 
  [Fujimori] I believe one must defend democracy, but not a 
pseudo-democracy, which strives to hide improper situations. 
Democracy must be increasingly more open. It is within this 
framework that democracy and the people will win. 
  [NOTICIAS] Finally, what was [Shining Path leader] Abimael 
Guzman to you? 
  [Fujimori] A criminal...a criminal.

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Two handwritten letters issued by Shining Path 
militants have been delivered to LA REPUBLICA. The letters, 
within the context of the bloody and fateful subversive war that 
bled our country for more than 13 years, could lead to a new 
stage filled with grave and daunting consequences. 
  One of the clandestine or confidential documents is signed 
-- 
in the way pamphlets, pronouncements, or declaration are usually 
done -- by the "Prisoners of war of the Canto Grande Luminous 
Combat Trench [LTC]." 
  The other document is a letter addressed by the captured 
Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville (sentenced to life imprisonment) 
to a colonel. 
  Both documents stress "the ironclad and unconditional 
subordination to the party leadership" undoubtedly represented 
by Abimael Guzman Reynoso, whom they call "President Gonzalo." 
  The letters also express their indubitable support to the 
letters signed by "President Gonzalo" and "Comrade Miriam" and 
their request to President Alberto Fujimori for "a peace 
agreement." 
  The new and worrying aspect of these two letters is that 
together with the deceiving call for a "peace agreement" there 
is a call for a Shining Path "second congress." 
  In other words, the terrorist organization does not lay down 
its arms or surrender. It accepts talks or negotiations with the 
government leading to "a peace agreement" and conspires while 
getting reorganized through a call for a new congress. 
  There is another new element in these documents, the 
implications of which, without a doubt, deserve a broad national 
debate in light of official reports: 
  The Canto Grande inmates and Cox Beuzeville at no time 
mention the much publicized "internal war between Shining Path 
followers." (There is no separation of responsibilities with 
"Comrade Feliciano"). 
  The fourth paragraph of the Canto Grande document, moreover, 
mentions a "black campaign by opportunists and revisionists," 
followed by threatening remarks. 
  The Shining Path has usually used these adjectives to refer 
to leftist political parties, labor organizations, and even to 
nongovernmental organizations (ONG). 
  But what is worse, they have not only characterized them as 
opportunists and revisionists and threatened them. They also 
have used this type of verbal virulence to justify their 
cowardly and absurd crimes against these organizations' leaders 
and social workers. 
  There are, therefore, many answers and many explanations 
behind this disturbing and grim strategy of letters. 
  One of the explanations, for instance, must refer in very 
concrete terms to the revelation made by Cox Beuzeville that he 
has been allowed to leave prison, where he is serving a life 
sentence, to carry out "works" on behalf of pacification. 
  [First letter] 
  "Struggle for a peace agreement and establishment of the 
basis for the second congress. 
  "We, the fighting Communists and the masses of the Canto 
Grande Luminous Combat Trench, undeclinably accepting President 
Gonzalo's leadership in this historic and great test, reiterate 
our decision not to take a single step without President 
Gonzalo's personal approval for we are fully convinced that he 
is the greatest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist living on earth, and 
just as he lead us in the past he will lead us again today, 
tomorrow, and forever until we reach our objective, the much 
coveted Communism." 
  "It is convenient to stop for a minute in this paragraph. It 
is an organic statement, a statement of ideological 
ratification. It is an act of subordination to Abimael's 
personal leadership. 
  "We also salute and support the new strategic course 
established by him, unshakably sure that the proletarian 
leadership is decisive for victory. Even more so in these 
circumstances of new, complex, and difficult problems for our 
party, the people's war, the Peruvian revolution, and the world 
proletarian revolution." 
  This is a new course for Peruvian revolution. 
  "The fighting Communists and masses, closing ranks with 
President Gonzalo and the Central Leadership, firmly, 
decisively, and tenaciously support the call made by our 
leadership and Comrade Miriam to struggle for a peace agreement 
and establish the basis for the Second Congress, putting into 
practice the unavoidable task of Assuming and Struggle for the 
New Great Decision and Definition as Communists, Maoists, and 
soldiers of the proletariat, with deep revolutionary happiness 
and optimism, and committing ourselves to make Canto Grande a 
forward station of this new stage." 
  Establish the basis for the Second Shining Path Congress. 
  "With the deepest class hate, we totally and resolutely 
repudiate and condemn the sinister black campaign against 
President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam, the essence of which is to 
cunningly oppose the Peace Agreement. Those who always attacked 
us furiously have once more unleashed their infamy with even 
more audaciousness. Today more than ever they are moved by 
egotist electoral ambitions and political appetites. They are 
the usual opportunists, revisionists, and lackeys who again show 
their persistent opposition to the true interests of the deep 
masses and the people." 
  It is not against the traditional parties, the legal left, 
labor leaders, or the ONG's. 
  "Assume with firmness and accelerated willingness this New 
Great Decision and Definition because it serves the interests of 
proletarians and the people, hoisting as high as possible the 
always red flags of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Gonzalo's 
thoughts, our specific and main weapon." 
  "Close lines around President Gonzalo and the Central 
Leadership!" 
  "Raise the flag of the New Great Decision and Definition!" 
  "Struggle for a Peace Agreement and establish the basis for 
the Second Congress!" 
  "Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!" 
  "Lima, December 1993." 
  "Prisoners of War of the Campo Grande LTC." 
  [Second Letter] 
  "Colonel Savino Cayahuanca Farro" 
  "Director of E.P.R.E.M.C.C." [expansion unknown] 
  "Request of personal audience with the director." 
  "Mister Director." 
  "I come to you Mr. Colonel director of this EPREMCC to 
request a personal audience, which I have repeatedly asked 
through the official authorities of diverse services as of 10 
December 1993, the date I returned from my latest exit from this 
prison, as you know. The purpose of the audience will be to 
discuss directly with you some necessary and important questions 
referring to what we agreed upon in other instances on the 
development of the works and meetings in favor of a successful 
end of the negotiation for a peace agreement. It is true, Mr. 
Colonel, that these tasks are not easy or simple. The struggle 
for a peace agreement is complex, difficult, and risky, and 
involves the difficulties proper of something new!" 
  "Ever since the first time you were so kind to receive me I 
clearly told you, sharply and explicitly, my firm and decisive 
agreement, voluntary support, conscious identification, and full 
adherence to President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam's letters, 
published and disseminated by President Alberto Fujimori. My 
commitment is, therefore, full, total, unconditional, public, 
decisive, and defined for the course of realizing what today has 
become a need for all: the Peace Agreement. In this way, 
`Peace, everyone's task,' as you rightfully ordered painted at 
the entrance, should be the slogan permitting everyone to 
cooperate in this praiseworthy objective. This cooperation 
should have necessary flexibility, within current laws, 
regulations, and discipline in effect in this prison, which is 
an undeniable fact that is part of this government's success and 
your personal merit." 
  "I reiterate to you, sir, my willingness to discuss all 
problems that might come up and solve them favorably and in 
accordance with the Peace Agreement. This is a norm of behavior 
I adopted ever since I entered this prison, within the framework 
of mutual respect, and in an attempt to serve the objective of 
our national reconciliation without winners or losers: making 
more visible and comfortable our relations between authorities 
and inmates." 
  "I beg of you Mr. Director, to attend to this request and 
agree to it." 
  "EPREMCC, 3 January 1994" 
  "Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville"

  [Excerpt] Shining Path members hoisted a big flag in San 
Juan de Lurigancho district yesterday [23 January] and asked 
Shining Path members "to lay down the arms" and to obey 
"President Gonzalo." Meanwhile, that evening a terrorist 
commando dynamited the Presidente Hotel in Huancayo, causing 
considerable damage. 
  These two events, which occurred almost simultaneously, and 
the two murders committed by subversives in the city of Huancayo 
prove that inside the terrorist organization there is a radical, 
fanatic group that does not want the "peace agreement" demanded 
by Abimael Guzman and wants to continue to ravage the country 
with selective murders and acts of sabotage. 
  Although there are indications that the Shining Path faction 
that wants to "lay down its arms" (it can be deduced that this 
expression means sort of "cease fire" from their point of view) 
is the majority and predominant sector, it is also obvious that 
the fanatic group who do not want to stop their insane bout of 
murders and attacks is still active in several places in the 
country. 
  From the letters recently written by the Shining Path 
members 
held at Canto Grande prison, and by their leader Cox Beuzeville 
-- and also from the big flag displayed yesterday -- it can be 
seen that Shining Path members are in no way considering 
surrender, much less giving up their arms. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In an eventful session, the plenum of the 
Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] approved the commissions 
for the next legislature. Most of them will be headed by 
representatives of the ruling alliance. The opposition factions 
opposed this and even walked out of the session saying they had 
been neglected. 
  The majority, with 39 votes, imposed their will on the 
formation of the new ordinary commissions, thereby ensuring the 
ruling party's supremacy in and control of the commissions. 
  The following members of the ruling alliance and allied 
factions are commission presidents: Carlos Blanco, New Majority 
Movement, Human Rights; Carlos Torres, New Majority Movement, 
Constitution and Rules and Regulations; Jorge Velasquez, New 
Majority Movement, Economy; Marta Chavez, New Majority Movement, 
Supervision; Cesar Fernandez Arce, New Majority Movement, 
Justice; Cesar Larrebure, We Are Independent, Agriculture; Celso 
Sotomarino, Popular Christian Party, Production; Romulo Guerra, 
Change 90, Health and Family; Jorge Figueroa, Change 90, Budget; 
Rafael Rey, Renewal Movement, Education and Sports; Carlos 
Reategui, New Majority, Energy; Genaro Colchado, Change 90, 
Environment; Ricardo Marcenaro, New Majority Movement, Labor; 
Luz Salgado, Change 90, Decentralization; Osvaldo Sandoval, New 
Majority Movement, Foreign Relations; and Andres Reggiardo, 
Change 90, Defense and Internal Order. 
  The opposition vigorously complained, primarily questioning 
Roger Caceres' removal from the Human Rights Commission. The 
ruling party was accused of removing and appointing minority 
congressmen at will, while ensuring control of key commissions 
for themselves. The opposition deputies subsequently left the 
floor. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The list 
of commissions has been approved without a quorum. They are 
lying to the country and have continued the session without a 
quorum. Whatever is approved here must be rejected, even through 
legal action. 
  [Second unidentified congressman] I must stress that no 
congressman has been denied participation in the commission of 
his preference. The only difference is that the commissions in 
which they are not chairmen they can be secretaries, but no one 
has been neglected or denied participation in the commission of 
his choice. 
  [Third unidentified congressman] I have taken note and there 
are only three or four problem cases whose solutions depend on 
agreements to be reached. We are only waiting for the cases to 
be sent to us, and we will approve whatever is decided. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 4 Feb, CANA -- Three motions 
dealing with the Caribbean Community (Caricom) charter of civil 
society, the establishment of a Caribbean court of appeal and an 
assembly of Caribbean parliamentarians were unanimously passed 
in Guyana's parliament Thursday, but the government ran into 
some criticism. 
  Guyana's foreign minister, Clement Rohee, moving the first 
motion on the charter, said it was, in his "humble opinion," 
non-controversial and should be welcomed in all Caricom member 
states. 
  Rohee, however, faced criticism from the main opposition 
People's National Congress (PNC) and the small Working People's 
Alliance (WPA). 
  PNC shadow foreign minister, lawyer Clarissa Riehl, noted 
that the Guyana cabinet had considered the draft charter at a 
sitting in August last year. He said the draft should have been 
circulated in high schools, universities and in other public 
fora. 
  Riehl, who said the PNC supported the motion in principle, 
questioned whether any consultation on the charter had ever 
taken place and what form it would take in the future. 
  "I would like to know why a copy of the charter was not laid 
in parliament itself at some date prior to today's date and even 
at a minimum, why a copy of this charter, as a common courtesy, 
was not appended to the motion paper," the former magistrate 
told parliament. 
  "This administration, Mr. Speaker, appears to have the 
greatest difficulty in assimilating this term -- consultation. 
They banter the word around and they don't seem to understand 
the meaning of it." 
  Riehl also asked about the structured programme to raise 
public awareness on the charter of civil society, suggesting the 
draft copy should have been "sent around" to become a talking 
point in the country. 
  She added: "Mr. Speaker, one gets the distinct impression 
also that this government is only paying lip-service to West 
Indian togetherness because these things are treated with such 
disdain." 
  Riehl also pointed out several similarities in the charter 
with principles enshrined in Guyana's Constitution, which she 
said were piloted by the PNC, including equality before the law, 
political rights and women's rights. 
  She urged Rohee to get the "largest number of people" 
involved in the consultative process regarding the charter. 
  WPA leader, economist Clive Thomas, said his party had long 
called for such a charter, but added it remained "disappointed" 
with the draft. 
  "I think that the charter, in our age, must be a charter 
which moves from the declaration of principles, from the 
statement of intent to the activation of enforceable covenants 
and rights for people with due procedures and institutions and 
mechanisms for redress," Dr. Thomas remarked. 
  He said the current charter is basically useless without any 
mechanisms for enforcement and any legal or other procedures to 
ensure it becomes an obligation for caricom states. 
  "Without the entrenchment of the rights in this charter into 
the laws of the institutions and the procedures of this land and 
in the rest of the Caribbean, it will remain the piece of paper 
on which it is written," he told parliament. 
  He questioned the point of having a charter talking about 
respecting the right to life which at the same time does not set 
up standards by which governments should be measured regarding 
children and maternal mortality and life expectancy. 
  "What can be more fundamental to the right of life than 
being able to live? How can you have a charter of civil society 
that ignores any standards altogether of the determination of 
the social rights of people in this caribbean region?" he asked. 
  "How can you speak about access to social services without 
defining precisely and in enforceable terms how people will get 
access to education, to health services, to sanitation and so 
forth that you can take to the court or some body for redress 
because the charter has the force of law?" 
  Thomas also criticised the West Indian Commission-proposed 
charter for the "vaguest of vague" references to environmental 
concerns and ignoring Amerindian rights. 
  "It doesn't even mention the word indigenous, almost as if 
it is completely abstracted from Guyana or even the part of the 
Caribbean where indigenous peoples still survive," Dr. Thomas 
declared. 
  He said the draft should be nothing more than a starting 
point for debate. 
  The charter, first proposed by the West Indian Commission, 
deals with a wide range of issues such as respect for 
fundamental civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights, the rights of women and children, greater accountability 
and transparency in governance and a fair and open democratic 
process. 
  Leader of The United Force (TUF), Manzoor Nadir, also said 
he supported the bill in principle. 
  The Guyanese foreign minister defended the charter, saying 
the process has to start somewhere. He said it was not drafted 
by the Guyana Government, but was a regional document with 
inputs from all the countries. 
  "We have to start the process somewhere," Rohee said. "The 
process of consultation will be spread throughout the length and 
breadth of Guyana as far our possibilities allow." 
  Debate, he added, will begin after the motion has been 
passed in parliament. 
  Rohee also denied the Guyana Government has gone to sleep on 
a proposal put forward by Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister, 
Patrick Manning, calling for an economic and political union 
involving Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad. 
  "The Manning initiative has been overtaken by the proposal 
that was raised by the honourable prime minister of Barbados 
(Erskine Sandiford) who called for a confederation of Guyana, 
Trinidad and Barbados after or during the course of the heads of 
government meeting in the Bahamas (in 1993)," Rohee said. 
  Sandiford, Rohee added, has promised to circulate his 
thoughts on the confederation. "It is in the light of that 
development, Mr. Speaker, that the Manning initiative lost its 
momentum and was overtaken by the proposal advanced by the 
distinguished prime minister of Barbados."

  [Text] Quito, 4 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuador began this Friday with 
complete calm following a nationwide workers strike yesterday to 
reject a recent 71.2-percent increase in gasoline prices. This 
morning sanitation workers were removing debris left from the 
barricades erected by demonstrators in the streets. 
  Activities were returning to normal as urban buses began 
providing service. On Thursday the buses paralyzed a large part 
of the country when they stopped operating to avoid being 
damaged by demonstrators. 
  There were no major incidents as rightist Ecuadoran 
President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen confronted the third workers strike in the 
first 18 months of his administration, which will conclude in 
August 1996. On Saturday Duran-Ballen implemented a price 
increase from 1,460 to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22) a 
gallon (3.785 liters) for the most widely used gasoline in the 
country. This measure was rejected by political, social, 
student, and labor sectors. More than 12 demonstrators and 20 
policemen were injured during the clashes, which also caused 
heavy damage to public and bank buildings in Quito and the port 
of Guayaquil. 
  The United Workers Front (FUT), which includes the most 
powerful labor federations, ordered the 24-hour strike to demand 
wage increases and the cancellation of the fuel price hike. It 
announced it is planning another nationwide strike in the next 
few days for an indefinite period, as well as an empty-pot march 
by housewives and an Indian uprising [levantamiento de 
indigenas], scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.

  [Text] Quito, 4 Feb (DPA) -- The general strike against the 
economic policy of the liberal government of President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen ended at 0600 (1100 GMT) with very modest results 
because it was limited and incomplete. Nevertheless, street 
demonstrations have continued. 
  In Quito and Cuenca, the two cities where the strike was 
felt 
the most, labor and student groups held demonstrations for the 
fifth consecutive day today, while Indian leaders reiterated 
their call for a peasant uprising next week. 
  Nevertheless, yesterday's unusual strike, smaller than 
previous strikes, evidently weakened the position of the labor, 
peasant, teacher, government worker, and student organizations 
that called the strike. Signs of division appeared among them 
today. 
  The United Workers Front claimed sole responsibility for the 
"complete success" of the strike today, disregarding the 
existence of a "national coordinating board" with leaders from 
other sectors, sparking angry protests from several 
organizations. 
  This week's demonstrations left an official toll of 21 
injured, including 13 policemen, and 163 people arrested. Losses 
are estimated at approximately $200 million. 
  Today, at the end of the strike, the government stated the 
increase in fuel prices, which caused the strike and several 
days of disturbances, is "completely irreversible" because, as 
Energy Minister Francisco Acosta said, "there is a fiscal 
deficit that must be covered and this is the way to do it." 
  Nevertheless, today, the opposition political parties which 
control Congress insisted the Constitutional Court should 
declare the increase illegal, and they should suspend it. They 
also said the energy minister would be called to a political 
hearing, and Social Democratic leader Andres Vallejo said "we 
will remove him if the government does not repeal the measure." 
  The fiscal deficit, which reportedly amounts to $600 
million, 
was caused by the drop in international petroleum prices, which 
earns more than 40 percent of Ecuador's revenue.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
evaluated relations between Bolivia and the United States. He 
said they are "narcotized," adding that Bolivian and U.S. 
antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results. 
  The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and 
alternative development programs. He admitted that "they have 
had no visible effects" in either the United States or Bolivia. 
  Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is 
"controversial" and has caused confrontations in the search for 
consensus. 
  He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia 
has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S. 
market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers "have had no 
guarantees on the sale of their products to that country." 
  The minister said the peasants have found no market for 
their 
products and, because of the economic nature of this problem, 
they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort. 
  Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained 
between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations 
was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit 
established. 
  He said: "This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very 
great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the 
cultivated areas." He added: "This caused a debate on the 
benefits of the policy and on its success or failure." 
  In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the 
traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical 
significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which 
is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements. 
  This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized 
Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and 
exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression 
of traffickers with alternative development.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Murillo] </F>
  [Excerpts] During a closed-doors session, the Senate 
yesterday approved the promotion of two police chiefs to the 
rank of general. MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and 
Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland] senators walked out of 
the session that dragged on until nearly midnight because they 
challenged the promotion of two officers. Those promoted to the 
rank of general are Colonel Luis Rocha Martinez -- who is 
mentioned as the most likely candidate for the post of police 
commander -- and Colonel Rogelio Vargas -- whose candidacy was 
questioned by MIR and Condepa due to his involvement in the 
thwarted burning of precursors in the Huanchaca case. The 
Senate did not approve the promotion of Colonel Willy Arriaza -- 
whose candidacy was also questioned by the parties that walked 
out of the session. [passage omitted] 
  Condepa Senator Andres Solis Rada said: 
  [Begin recording] I want to report that Condepa and MIR 
senators walked out of the Senate session because senators of 
the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] and UCS [Solidarity 
Civic Union] ruling coalition joined forces with ADN 
[Nationalist Democratic Action] to promote Col. Arriaza, who 
worked as Arce Gomez's [interior minister under General Luis 
Garcia Meza] aide at the time of the terrible Harrington Street 
massacre which claimed the lifes of eight young MIR members. 
[passage omitted]. 
  They even wanted to overrule the Bolivian Police command who 
believe only two officers should be promoted. Our decision to 
leave the session was instrumental in making the Senate stop and 
think about this. In the end only two officers were promoted. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] At 1800 this afternoon President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de Lozada installed recently promoted General Luis Rocha 
Martinez as the new commander of the Bolivian police. 
  Before installing the new police commander, the president 
praised the work done by the deposed General Einar Lopez: 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We must outline the important 
contribution made by Gen. Lopez, who is leaving this post, not 
only because of his absolutely honest performance, but also 
because of his dedication to the institution, his service to the 
community, and his important contribution to the beginning of a 
process, a plan, a project to reorganize the institution. [end 
recording] 
  The president said the country will need the services of 
Gen. 
Lopez when analyzing the measures necessary to bring the police 
closer to the people. 
  Gen. Einar Lopez was not present during the ceremony at 
government palace. The president also said that Gen. Rocha 
Martinez, the new police commander, was a man of unblemished 
honesty. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alejandro Noemi tendered his resignation as Codelco 
[Copper Corporation] executive manager, which was accepted by 
President Patricio Aylwin at Cerro Castillo Palace this morning. 
  Alejandro Noemi leaves his post as top leader of the most 
important Chilean enterprise exactly 10 days after the scandal 
affecting Codelco was made public. 
  The first indications of his pending resignation appeared 
yesterday when the report on the investigation headed by Noemi 
himself stated that the Codelco executive manager was mainly 
responsible for the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila. 
  This morning, however, nobody thought Noemi would tender his 
resignation today. This morning everything seemed normal at 
Codelco. Executive Vice President Maximo Pacheco was the only 
one to enter Codelco offices on Huerfanos Street. 
  Outside the building some workers were mopping up the eggs 
thrown yesterday by a group of pensioners. 
  The calm atmosphere did not last long. The announcement made 
at 1300 by Interior Minister Enrique Krauss unleashed a storm. 
  [Begin Krauss recording] Today Alejandro Noemi Callejas 
tendered his resignation as Codelco executive manager. The 
president of the Republic has decided to accept his resignation 
even though he will place this information at the disposal of 
Codelco management, which will make the final decision on the 
subject. [end recording] 
  From then on the media frenetically searched for the 
resigning manager and did not find Noemi until 1700 as he 
arrived home from Cerro Castillo. 
  [Begin recording] [Noemi] I think I have done what I had to 
do following this disaster. We have completed the investigation 
and I think it is clear...[changes thought] you saw it and 
learned about its contents yesterday. Moreover, the necessary 
measures have been taken. The path to be followed has been 
defined in order to administer these losses. I do hope the 
losses will drop. I have done my duty to show my face, as you 
have seen during these past few days, and there is no point in 
me remaining at Codelco after this regretful episode. It is 
very hard to continue at the head of an enterprise... I can no 
longer show face. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How do you feel having to resign for 
a mistake you did not make? 
  [Noemi] Such is life. I am very sorry. I am very sad and 
do not feel as calm as I look. I am very sad, very sorry. It 
will be very sad to be remembered as manager of this enterprise 
because of this mistake. [end recording] 
  Noemi added that despite the modernization carried out 
within 
Codelco these past four years there is still a lot to be done, 
and proof of this is the disaster caused by Juan Pablo Davila. 
  Noemi said that in the future the enterprise must be more 
agile. He also was asked whether he will receive indemnization. 
  [Begin recording] [Noemi] Yes, I am entitled to it, but I 
am not going to accept it, not because I feel guilty but rather 
because I am too hurt to even think about it or think that 
someone may misinterpret it. Yes, I am entitled to it; it is 
part of my pay. I believe I have done a good job at Codelco and 
hope this will be noticed with time. 
  [Reporter] How do you feel about the fact that the other 
three Codelco managers did accept indemnization? 
  [Noemi] I feel it was a major mistake, a major mistake, and 
hope they will return it. [end recording] 
  Noemi's resignation should be ratified on 7 February by 
Codelco management, which also must accept the president of the 
Republic's proposal that current Finance Under Secretary Jorge 
Rodriguez head the most important Chilean enterprise for the 
next 37 days.

  [Text] Deputy Jorge Pizarro, chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, has stated that 
it is neither reasonable nor proper to say that Chilean-Peruvian 
relations are risky. This was Pizarro's reaction to a report 
from the Libertad Institute. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Marcela Torrejon] Jorge Pizarro, 
deputy for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] and chairman of 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, has 
stated that the Libertad Institute's claim that relations 
between Chile and Peru are risky is unreasonable. The 
Institute, which has ties with the opposition National Renewal 
Party, released a document stating that Chilean-Peruvian 
relations were risky because the Peruvian Constituent Congress 
does not want to ratify the Lima Convention which the Aylwin and 
Fujimori administrations had signed to resolve certain matters 
that the 1929 peace and friendship treaty had left pending. 
  Deputy Pizarro believes that the relations between Peru and 
Chile are good and pose no political or commercial risks. He 
emphasized certain landmarks in the process of rapprochement, 
such as Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's visit to Chile and 
the fact that he will also attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's 
inauguration in March. 
  Pizarro acknowledged that after the plebiscite and in light 
of the approaching elections, the discussion of the Lima 
Convention has awakened nationalistic predjudices which deserve 
respect because in Chile too there are people who have this kind 
of prejudice. He stressed, however, that in Chile this issue 
has always been left in the hands of the state. 
  [Pizarro] The important thing is to strengthen the role of 
the state in setting the course for Chile's foreign policy 
toward its neighbors. In this context the report of the 
Libertad Institute could be misinterpreted. 
  [Torrejon] Deputy Pizarro explained that the Chilean 
Congress 
believes that the Lima Convention should be ratified. This is 
not the case with the Peruvian Constituent Congress, where the 
majority opposes the ratification of the convention. 
  [Pizarro] We do not believe that it is appropriate for 
Congress, be it Peruvian or Chilean, to revise or amend an 
agreement which has already been signed by the foreign ministers 
of both countries. Thus, I disagree with the proposal of Mr. 
Victor Joy Way, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of 
the Peruvian Constituent Congress, because I feel that he has 
taken the wrong approach to the matter which is delaying 
ratification of the agreement, and is sending signals that 
contradict President Fujimori's stated will to get the 
convention approved. 
  [Torrejon] According to Deputy Pizarro, the explanations 
wielded by the Peruvian Constituent Congress in its attempt to 
deny approval for the convention which the Aylwin and Fujimori 
administrations have already signed are improper. [end recording]

  [Text] During a meeting in La Paz, Bolivia, to discuss the 
struggle against drug trafficking, Chilean and Bolivian 
Government representatives agreed to exchange information on 
juridical affairs, customs, drug trafficking and the prevention 
of drug abuse, and social rehabilitation programs. 
  Gustavo Villalobos, secretary of the Chilean National 
Council 
for Drug Control, noted that the level of cooperation between 
the two countries is very high even though they do not maintain 
diplomatic relations. 
  Villalobos added that the bilateral cooperation efforts to 
fight trafficking also benefit other countries in the region. 
  Bolivian Social Defense Secretary Marcos Solis said the 
struggle against trafficking requires considerable international 
solidarity. 
  The two countries agreed to exchange judicial resolutions 
and 
letters rogatory. The representatives also discussed the 
possibility of extraditing traffickers.

  [Text] Today in Dresden, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, 
president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, 
said that U.S. President William Clinton has modified the U.S. 
policy toward Cuba, even though an eventual softening of the 
blockade would take place only if he were to be elected to a 
second term. In statements to DPA, Alarcon de Quesada pointed 
out that Clinton inherited the U.S. policy toward Cuba from the 
Bush administration, along with the Torricelli Law reinforcing 
the blockade that has affected Cuba for more than 30 years. 
  According to the same source, Alarcon de Quesada expressed 
moderate enthusiasm to his German hosts on the possibility of a 
softening of the blockade on Cuba during the second half of 
President Clinton's current term or in an eventual second term.

  [Text] The Secretariat of Overseas Cooperation (Secretaria 
de Colaboracion del Exterior) of the Provincial Assembly of the 
People's Government in Havana reported that last year the Cuban 
capital received more than $4 million from foreign nations and 
international organizations. The report adds that in this 
context, the Secretariat maintained relations with more than 300 
cities from different countries of the world. 
  Outstanding among these was Spain, where 200 towns 
contributed support. Buses, street cleaning equipment, 
ambulances, and school and automotive equipment were part of the 
donations made in 1993 in an effort to alleviate the shortages 
prompted by the U.S. blockade and the demise of the 
international socialist community.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- In the opinion of the 
Cuban official press, the Summit of the Americas summoned by the 
United States is a "new maneuver" to halt Cuba's increasing 
links to Latin America and the Caribbean. The objective of this 
meeting slated for the second half of 1994 is "to cloud the 
broad continental recognition that Cuba has received in Latin 
American summits," published GRANMA, the official Communist 
Party of Cuba mouthpiece. 
  If Washington "intends at this stage to use their summit 
against Cuba, we believe they are too late. All the world's 
unipolarity could not attain such a goal, as anachronistic as it 
is shameful," according to the newspaper. 
  President Fidel Castro had also condemned this summit of 
Latin American heads of state organized by Washington when 
closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting held in 
Havana on 28 January. "They want to hold summit meetings without 
Cuba, to make us even more isolated, to make their criminal 
blockade even more rigorous," Castro said when referring to 
Washington's decision announced by Vice President Al Gore during 
a visit to Mexico. 
  The Cuban Government has taken part in three Ibero-American 
summits -- Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991; Madrid, Spain in 1992; 
and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil in 1993. 
  GRANMA also charged that Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di 
Tella had spoken as if he were the official State Department 
spokesman when he said in Washington that the summit had been 
postponed until Secretary of State Warren Christopher completes 
a tour of the area. 
  OAS spokesmen praised the summit but warned that it should 
not be held without the OAS because there is no need to 
duplicate continental mechanisms. 
  One previous summit of American heads of state was held in 
Panama (1955) and summoned by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. 
The other was held in Punta del Este (Uruguay/1967) at the 
request of Lyndon B. Johnson. 
  The Cuban newspaper recalled statements attributed to 
Professor Henry Raymont, an expert in Latin American studies, 
who says that the United States should have summoned the summit 
within the framework of the OAS, from which the Fidel Castro 
government has been suspended since 1962.

Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and FAR 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces] minister, has inaugurated the 
nation's first center for mountain-area research and 
development. This center, built at a cost of over 13 million 
pesos, is located in the Limonar area of El Salvador 
Municipality, Guantanamo Province. 
  In a speech she made at the inauguration ceremony, Rosa 
Elena 
Simeon, member of the PCC Central Committee and president of the 
Cuban Academy of Sciences, emphasized that one of the center's 
objectives is to intensify the work aimed at increasing 
production of foodstuffs, both traditional and new, for human 
consumption. Simeon also announced that a scientific hub will be 
created soon in Guantanamo Province. 
  Raul also visited the organic plots located in Montesano. 
The

president of the Council of State; General Ulises Rosales del 
Toro, first vice minister of the FAR and head of the general 
staff; Esteban Lazo and Julian Rizo, respectively PCC first 
secretaries in the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Camaguey;

  [Text] Havana, 6 Feb (AFP) -- General Raul Castro, minister 
of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) warned Cubans 
against any illegal immigration from the country via the U.S. 
Guantanamo Base (1,000 km east of Havana), and stressed that any 
such attempt could disturb the calm that currently prevails 
around the base. 
  "The crime of illegally leaving the country is extremely 
serious when the attempt is made at this border military zone," 
Raul Castro said. 
  It is a "provocation, a treacherous act against Cuban 
national security," and a real "crazy exploit" because of the 
danger of the mined zones and the presence of numerous forces, 
from both sides, in the "no man's land" that surrounds the 
base," Raul Castro said in a statement published today in 
JUVENTUD REBELDE, a newspaper issued by the Union of Young 
Communists (UJC). 
  "An incident occurring by chance or deliberately provoked by 
the enemy in the no-man's land could lead to a conflict of 
unpredictable proportions," he added in protest of the U.S. 
attitude, which according to him, encourages the illegal 
immigration of Cubans. 
  While the United States welcomes illegal Cuban immigrants 
with open arms, "Haitians fleeing from extreme poverty and 
bloody repression are stopped on the high seas and are 
forcefully returned to their martyred country," Raul Castro said. 
  "In order to contain the economic immigration of millions of 
Mexicans and Central Americans, the Yankees are building a tall, 
long fence, comparable not only to the Berlin Wall, but also to 
the ancient Chinese Wall," he went on. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE did not specify the exact date which the 
defense minister, who recently toured the eastern part of the 
country, made that statement. The weekly did say, however, that 
Raul Castro issued the warning during a visit to the military 
hospital in Santiago de Cuba (900 km east of Havana), while 
visiting a young soldier who was seriously injured by a mine in 
early December in an effort to stop four fugitives from reaching 
the Guantanamo Base. 
  With the worsening of the economic crisis in Cuba, attempts 
to illegally leave the country -- particularly by sea -- to go 
to Florida (United States) have increased from the northern 
coasts of the archipelago and also from the Caimaneras Region, 
bordering the Guantanamo Base. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 1743 GMT on 6 February 
reports that according to Army Gen. Raul Castro, the illegal 
departure from the country through the Guantanamo area, where 
two Armies have been deployed, is very serious and constitutes a 
provocation, "an act of treason against the national security of 
our country. [quotation marks as received] 
  Raul Castro, first vice president of the Council of State, 
accused Washington of encouraging for the past three decades the 
illegal immigration of Cubans, who according to him, receive 
exclusive and special treatment in U.S. immigration laws. 
  He recognized, however, that in the past year, during 
William 
Clinton's administration, there has been an atmosphere of 
tranquility on both sides of the U.S. military base, which 
occupies 117 square kilometers. 
  This Sunday, JUVENTUD REBELDE stated millions could be 
killed 
if the "cowboys of the unipolar world" were to fabricate an 
incident that served as a "pretext" to invading Cuba. 
  "We have the right to be tough in applying sanctions. Those 
who play around with sacred values cannot go unpunished," the 
Cuban newspaper stated.]

  [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasin Bin-Jabbur 
Al Thani today is beginning a three-day visit to Cuba. He will 
meet with his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, and other 
Cuban leaders. 
  Qatar, a desert peninsula of 11,000 square km, borders on 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Persian Gulf. 
Doha, the capital, groups almost half of the almost 400,000 
Qataris who live on the exports of petroleum and its byproducts. 
  Before the discovery of oil deposits in the 1940's, the 
basic 
activities were fishing and pearl cultivation. 
  Qatar was under the rule of the British and the Ottoman 
Empire until its independence in 1971. The following year, 
Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani assumed power. He nationalized the 
oil in 1977 and has kept the 1970 provisional constitution which 
does not allow political parties or elections. 
  Despite its different system, this Arab absolute monarchy 
has 
had good diplomatic relations with Cuba since their 
establishment in December 1989.

  [Excerpts] American Ambassador William Lacy Swing is 
visiting the Senate of the Republic. The ambassador was 
received by the current president of the Senate, Firmin 
Jean-Louis. Edner Jean reports live: 
  [Jean] The meeting between the two men lasted about an hour. 
This meeting allowed Ambassador William Lacy Swing and President 
Firmin Jean-Louis to proceed to an assessment of the country's 
general situation and to the inventory of the perspectives of a 
solution to the crisis. Both parties expressed their common 
concern about the degradation of the social, economic, and 
political atmosphere as well as their real willingness to 
proceed quickly toward the resolution of the crisis. This visit 
by the United States ambassador in Port-au-Prince was mainly a 
gesture of support for Firmin Jean-Louis who is threatened with 
being discharged by some senators of the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion with the firm and determined support of 
those elected in the contested 18 January vote. On 2 February 
the resolution asking for the discharge of Firmin Jean-Louis 
almost made it to a vote. The ambassador insisted at length on 
the importance that his government gives to the legislative 
agenda within the scope of the Governors Island and New York 
accords. Furthermore, he pointed out the key role that the 
parliament must play in the search for a solution to the crisis 
and in the building of democracy in Haiti. [passage omitted]. 
The ambassador also answered journalists' questions regarding 
the conflict between the United States and France on a total 
blockade against Haiti. The ambassador reaffirmed that the 
United-States and the three other countries -- the friends of 
Haiti -- maintain a common position and demand once more the 
return of democracy in Haiti. [passage omitted]. The presence 
of Mr. Kosak [not further identified], who has just arrived from 
the United States, should be noted. He participated to some 
extent in the talks between Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis and American 
Ambassador William Lacy Swing. Right now, the ambassador is 
talking with the president of the Lower Chamber, Deputy Frantz 
Robert Monde.

  [Text] The Fort-Saint-Clair Group [Platfom Fosenkle] 
opposes the 4 February demonstration demanding the lifting of 
international sanctions. Once again, the group demands the 
return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti and denounces 
the situation prevailing at the Senate of the Republic. Firmin 
Jean-Louis is the Senate president and cannot be dismissed 
arbitrarily, according to the group calling for a return to 
order at the Senate. 
  [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] We in

Fort-Saint-Clair Group feel very indignant at the national 
conference that the Committee of Actions for National 
Reconciliation wants to hold on 6 and 7 February. We are also 
opposed to all demonstrations scheduled for 4 February by the 
macoute sector that never works in the interest of the people in 
a country where human rights are not protected and where the 
criminals who staged the coup d'etat are using violence. This is 
why we in the Fort St. Clair group say first that the United 
States should stop stalling for time while speaking of the 
Governors Island and the New York pacts. We unreservedly support 
a demonstration to be held on 6 and 7 February by the masses and 
all worthy military so democracy can be established in Haiti 
with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in power. [end recording]

  [Text] The political movement FRAPH, Revolutionary Front 
for the Haitian Advancement and Progress, will be in the streets 
of Port-au-Prince on 4 February. The leaders of the party are 
calling for a demonstration demanding the lifting of the embargo. 
  [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording, in Creole] We in FRAPH 
are calling for a demonstration to ask the international 
community to lift the embargo that is causing the Haitian people 
to groan. Not many Haitians know how Aristide lives abroad. He 
lives like a human being while we in FRAPH, who are living here, 
we know the sufferings that the Haitian people are facing: Food 
is expensive, there is no gasoline, the business sector has 
stopped, there is no transportation, the hospitals are closed. 
In a word, national life is blocked. Who is the cause of that? 
We say aloud: It is Aristide, who is living the good life with 
no thought of the sufferings of the Haitians who voted for him. 
Today, we are standing up and are asking for lifting the 
embargo because Aristide does not have a feather [as heard] in 
Haiti; he does not have a child. We in FRAPH are asking 
everyone: Who is not affected by the embargo? Therefore, 
everyone, come to Colon Square on 4 February at 1000 so that we 
can say that we are tired of the embargo; please lift it for us. 
[end recording]. This initiative is supported by PDCH [Haitian 
Christian Democratic Party], MDN [Mobilization for National 
Development] and PARADI [Haitian Party Of God] as well as by the 
Capois La Mort organization. 
  On the other hand, a people's organization of the Bel-Air 
district is against this demonstration.

illegal embargo imposed by the international community and 
Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide that is destroying the Haitian 
nation, those parties and socioprofessional organizations say 
they are staging this demonstration on 4 February to show that 
all social components in the Haitian nation require the 
immediate lifting of the embargo and the establishment of a new 
order in Haiti for a Haitian solution to the crisis. This 
solution should be worked out by the authentic representatives 
of the true country. In this spirit, the parties and 
organizations calling for this demonstration confirm their 
interest in and consent to the principle of holding a true 
national conference through which all political sectors and 
social strata -- bar none -- will be able to express themselves 
freely on the future of their country as soon as the embargo is 
lifted. 
  The political parties and professional groups have invited 
all adherents, all members, all employees in both public and 
private sectors, peasants, representatives of the nine 
departments, and all patriots in general, without distinction as 
to political sensitivity, to participate massively in the 
demonstration to begin this morning at 1000 at the Colomb Quay 
and proceed to the Haitian parliament and the General 
Headquarters of the Haitian Armed Forces in Place du Marron 
Inconnu. 
  Among the parties listed as adhering to the movement are: 
Democratic Movement of the Haitian Youth, of Gerard 
Mecklembourg; Liaison of Democratic Forces Federative Party, of 
Daniel Narcisse; Mobilization for National Development [of 
Hubert De Ronceray]; Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement 
and Progress, of Louis Jodel Chamblain and Emmanuel Constant; 
and PNR [expansion unknown], of Claudette Gourdet. Other parties 
such as the Haitian Party of God, the Haitian Christian 
Democratic Party, the Alliance for the Rebirth of Haiti, and 
unions such as the Union of Independent Drivers have joined with 
this demonstration movement which has already begun. Let us 
listen to Jean Luckenson from the streets of Port-au-Prince: 
  [Luckenson] "On 4 February at about 1100, hundreds of young 
men and women occupied the streets, demonstrating against the 
embargo. At the head of the demonstration is a big red-and-black 
flag and one guinea-fowl emblem. On the flag is written: Up with 
Duvalier for life. The demonstration began at the Red Cross, 
then went down La Saline Boulevard. The demonstrators were 
bearing placards on which were written such slogans as: Down 
with Aristide; Up with Article 149, the sole solution; and We 
need a revolutionary government. The demonstrators were 
chanting." 
  [Demonstrators chanting] "Down with necklacing; we must end 
this matter; down with necklacing; down with embargo; [words 
indistinct]" 
  [Luckenson] "We must tell you that several trucks coming 
from 
the Artibonite area, from L'Estere, Gonaives, and Saint-Marc 
brought people to [participate in] the demonstration. We are on 
the spot, we are there, we will inform you at the appropriate 
moment. This was Jean Luckenson from downtown Port-au-Prince for 
Signal FM Radio."

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To kill two birds with one 
stone, the U.S. ambassador went to the lower chamber to meet 
with the new president of the Chamber of Deputies. However, they 
did not reach the common position that was the case at the upper 
chamber, because William L. Swing and Frantz Robert Monde 
expressed differing points of view on the Haitian crisis and the 
measures adopted by the international community. President 
Monde, once more, called on the Americans for more humaneness 
toward Haiti and solicited the lifting of the embargo: 
  [Begin recording] [Monde] It is the richest country in the 
world, the most prosperous, the most powerful that is imposing 
economic sanctions on the weakest, poorest one on earth. We 
asked him to ask the international community to view the crisis 
on a more humane angle -- the unfairness, the human aspect of 
the embargo -- the solution to the crisis in order to avoid a 
social explosion, according to critics of the policy of the 
international community which is adhering to the Governors 
Island accord. 
  [Reporter] What was the ambassador's answer? 
  [Monde] The same: It is not our fault; it is the military's 
fault. However, they did not realize that their approach to the 
crisis was greatly biased, which explains the fact that they 
have personalized the crisis as between two men, making a 
solution very difficult. [end recording] 
  This visit by the U.S. ambassador comes at a time when the 
Chamber of Deputies has basically resumed normal operations, 
while the Senate of the Republic is heading for a new rupture 
that is becoming more and more imminent. [end recording]

  [Text] Some senators from the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion interpreted the meeting between U.S. Ambassador Swing 
and Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis as a threat against 
national sovereignty. Thomas Eddy Dupiton is demanding the 
discharge of President Firmin Jean-Louis, whom he accuses of 
being an agent of the international community: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] We see that Firmin Jean-Louis, 
as I told you yesterday, is at the service of the international 
[community]. They had to come and give him instructions. But the 
instructions that he receives -- it is not the Senate of the 
Republic that would execute them. Those are instructions for 
Firmin and all the hired hands of his ilk. What do you see 
happening today? Firmin is taking orders from foreigners. He has 
blocked the Senate of the Republic since he ratified Malval. 
  When Firmin has the entire international [community] behind 
him, the office that the country would have supported -- that 
all men of good faith would have supported -- this office would 
be accepted and would be imposed on those who still stand up in 
this country, those who do not crawl and who do not take their 
orders from foreigners. [end recording] 
  These statements were made on 3 February by Senator Thomas 
Eddy Dupiton in reaction to the visit of U.S. Ambassador William 
L. Swing to the Senate of the Republic.

  [Text] Christian Democratic Assembly [RDC] leader Eddy 
Volel opposes the demonstration scheduled for 4 February. 
According to Volel, some sectors have the right to demonstrate 
in the streets whereas others do not. 
  [Begin Volel recording, in Creole] There is a sector that is 
struggling for democracy, but that does not have the right to 
speak, even less does it have the right to stage demonstrations 
or to hold meetings. We in the RDC are always against this 
stance that favors a person or a group of persons to the 
detriment of another person or group of persons. We could never 
offer our support, we never offered our support, and we will 
never offer our support to anything done against the interests 
of the people. So, we do not offer our support: We oppose this 
demonstration. We are against this disorder because those 
people, who are staging the demonstration, have never done 
anything for the Haitian people. On the contrary, they have 
always tried to destroy the people, to destroy the country. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel </F>
Burelli Rivas by Maria Victoria Cristancho; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Cristancho] What path should Venezuelan foreign 
policy follow in the next five years? 
  [Burelli] Venezuelan foreign policy must reflect order in 
our 
country and domestic dignity. Restoring the image of our 
country overseas is a priority, but leaving aside an excessive 
extroversion, which is not convenient for a country facing a 
critical economic situation. 
  [Cristancho] Do you share the view that there is a campaign 
to tarnish Venezuela's reputation overseas? 
  [Burelli] Actually, there is such a campaign, but it can be 
fought by putting our house in order. This -- putting the house 
in order -- requires the assistance of the Venezuelan media so 
that they do not contribute to those who, from overseas, call us 
a chaotic nation. If we convey a negative image to the foreign 
sensationalistic media, we will never be able to attract foreign 
investors. 
  [Cristancho] But governments have also been accused of a 
lack 
of coherence in their handling of foreign policy? 
  [Burelli] That is true. The Foreign Ministry must be the 
only one to coordinate the country's foreign policy. There 
cannot be a parallel foreign ministry, as once existed, 
operating in a place other than the Yellow House. State 
governments cannot hold autonomous foreign relations because 
Venezuela is a federal republic with a central and presidential 
government in which the president is responsible for conducting 
relations with other nations. 
  [Cristancho] What are your priorities as the new foreign 
minister? 
  [Burelli] The defense of national sovereignty, international 
cooperation, and the conquest -- via friendship and 
understanding -- of all the benefits Venezuela is entitled to as 
a member of the international community. In order to do this, a 
national international policy is necessary; in other words, a 
consistent policy is necessary. I am determined, with President 
Caldera's authorization, to revive the Foreign Relations 
Advisory Committee, and activate it so that its criteria and 
experience can be used to guide and direct Venezuelan foreign 
policy. 
  Regarding cooperation, Venezuela has always been very 
generous, and although this attitude pays off somewhat, we will 
examine whether we should keep or rectify this policy, giving 
preference to our problems over those of other countries. 
Venezuela is not a superpower, but a medium-sized country, 
whose strength lies in its dignity rather than squandering. 
  [Cristancho] Will that view be reflected in the 
restructuring 
of the Foreign Ministry? 
  [Burelli] I will focus on economizing with human resources. 
In other words, I will keep officials for their talent and 
devotion to work, and will thank and send home those who do not 
meet these requisites. Diplomatic missions often have too many 
employees. Since employees were earning dollars, the missions 
became a popular place to practice patronage. 
  [Cristancho] How will Venezuelan relations with other 
nations 
be? 
  [Burelli] We should act with the certainty of being a 
country 
that has always played by the rules. There are priorities in 
our foreign relations such as our friendship with Colombia, 
Brazil, the United States, and in general, with all countries. 
These relations are significant because some of those countries 
can offer us capital, technology, and guidance while others can 
support us in international organizations such as the OAS and 
the United Nations. 
  [Cristancho] What does globalization mean? 
  [Burelli] Globalization is the norm of our times, based on 
the global village the current world has become. However, there 
are problems we have that must be considered from a universal 
viewpoint. In addition, there should also be a regional outlook, 
which is more realistic and in which we move via alliances, 
cooperation programs, and hemispheric organizations. I believe 
globalization is harmony between the region and the world. 
  [Cristancho] Do you believe, contrarily, that between 
Colombia and Venezuela there is an asymmetrical relationship, 
which is detrimental to us? 
  [Burelli] That was the case in the past. Probably, the 
Colombian Government is already taking steps to prevent 
Colombians from coming to Venezuela as much anymore because the 
economic situation has improved, despite other difficulties. I 
believe the flow of Colombians into Venezuela will decrease. 
  [Cristancho] Regarding issues such as the theft of 
vehicles, Venezuela is still suffering from a lack of interest 
on the part of Colombia. 
  [Burelli] Regarding that particular issue, Colombia 
recognizes through its government that there has been neglect 
and even complicity by its border authorities. 
  [Cristancho] Then, should not a tougher stand be demanded 
from Colombian authorities? 
  [Burelli] Of course. I have told Colombian officials that 
the agreement regarding the return of stolen vehicles must be 
complied with because they know we care about that very much. 
  [Cristancho] Could this not be used as a negotiation 
instrument by Colombia? 
  [Burelli] I don't think so. The best thing that could happen 
to the two countries is that this flow of stolen vehicles on the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border stops. 
  [Cristancho] But shouldn't we speak more forcefully to 
Colombia so that it complies with the agreement? 
  [Burelli] I do not believe we should be more forceful. We 
should speak with dignity. It is not necessary to speak 
forcefully when we speak the truth. 
  [Cristancho] Regarding the delimitation of marine and 
submarine areas in the Gulf of Venezuela, do you believe a 
short-term solution might be reached? 
  [Burelli] I have no current knowledge of any talks held in 
this regard. It would be dishonest to express my view on such a 
controversial issue without knowing about the progress made by 
the negotiating commission. 
  [Cristancho] Do you believe the delimitation issue is more 
political than real? 
  [Burelli] The delimitation issue involves various aspects. 
It is a legal and, basically, a political issue. Its solution 
is more urgent than other common problems. Neither country can 
afford not to resolve this problem when very successful deals 
are occurring in other areas. 
  [Cristancho] Is the gulf issue the stumbling block in the 
relations between Colombia and Venezuela? 
  [Burelli] Yes, because it is a difficult issue and if it is 
not resolved, other obstacles will continue to exist. It is a 
major problem. The fluid way in which other issues are being 
handled should encourage us to reach an agreement on it. 
  [Cristancho] Colombia has lacked the will to avoid border 
incidents? 
  [Burelli] I think some attention has been lacking on the 
part 
of its government. 
  [Cristancho] What is the vulnerable point in Venezuela's 
relations with Brazil? 
  [Burelli] The stage setting of our relations with Brazil is 
the obscure and immense jungle that separates us. The approach 
to the border issue is different in this case because this is 
not an operative border. Last year, the limelight was on 
rambling gold-diggers [garimpeiros] and the Yanomami Indians and 
a conflict almost ensued but the two countries wisely prevented 
it. The issue is not easy. President Caldera plans to develop 
the southern region. The Brazilian and Venezuelan Governments 
should have an intense dialogue on this. The presidents of the 
two countries will meet at the beginning of March to try to 
jointly find a solution to common problems. 
  [Cristancho] How should hemispheric strength be promoted? 
  [Burelli] The OAS must make efforts to strengthen each of 
the 
member states, which must realize that the OAS must be the 
setting for discussing hemispheric matters. 
  [Cristancho] What is the role of the Group of Three, the 
South American Common Market, the Caribbean Common Market, and 
the Andean Group? 
  [Burelli] If the OAS works well and is used and respected by 
all, there is no need for subregional groups. There should be 
no bypassing the OAS because this weakens and brings discredit 
to this organization. 
  [Cristancho] Do you maintain your candidacy for the post of 
secretary general of the OAS? 
  [Burelli] The Venezuelan candidacy remains firm and we will 
continue to work to secure that post. The Foreign Ministry post 
is not contradictory to being a candidate to that OAS post. If 
you don't believe me, ask Bernd Niehaus, the Costa Rican 
aspirant to that post.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 2 
February. 
  Three subsidiaries of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, 
namely the Venezuelan Bauxita Company, Interalumina, and 
Venalum, owe the Treasury about 820 million bolivares for the 
1990-93 period. This debt accumulated as a result of delays in 
the payment of customs duties, which amounts to 700 million 
bolivares, and the value-added tax, VAT, which amounts to 120 
million bolivares owed by Interalumina alone. (Caracas EL 
UNIVERSAL in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p 2-4) 
  The General Bank Superintendency in 1993 signed several 
adjustment plans with credit institutions to ease the financial 
intermediation caused by increases in interest rates and by a 
reduction in the credit demand. Such plans call for capital 
increases, review of managerial processes, rationalization of 
expenditures and expansion programs, as well as the required 
modification of the data included in financial statements. 
(Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p E-1) 
  Superintendent Anselmo Chuecos Perez has said that although 
the Foreign Investment Superintendency, Siex, is in charge of 
monitoring foreign investments, it is also responsible for 
evaluating which sectors should receive more investments. This 
facilitates an in-depth analysis of investment behavior and 
ensures the allocation of funds to sectors that need them most. 
He added that many foreigners are investing in the cement, 
steel, and iron industries because Venezuela has enough 
exploitable resources. He pointed out that $6 billion have been 
invested in the country and that the Netherlands was the country 
that invested the most in 1993. Siex does not monitor the 
hydrocarbon, banking, and insurance sectors. (Caracas Venezolana 
de Television Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Jan 94) 
  It was officially reported that foreign investments 
decreased 
by $1.676 billion in 1993. Siex Superintendent Anselmo Chuecos 
reported that foreign investments amounted to $256 million in 
1993. Investments in the manufacturing and financial sectors 
increased by 58 percent and 31 percent, respectively. 
Investments in the tourism sector increased by only 1 percent. 
(Paris AFP in Spanish 1606 GMT 26 Jan 94) 
  Central Statistics and Data Processing Office figures show 
that Colombia became the main market for non-traditional 
Venezuelan exports in 1993. Exports, other than oil and iron, 
to Colombia amounted to $765 million, which is a 64-percent 
increase from 1992. Meanwhile, Colombian imports amounted to 
$409 million, which is a significant decrease from 1992.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senator Fernando de la Rua from the Radical </F>
Civic Union, UCR, for Buenos Aires, by Analia Argento in Buenos 
Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] [Argento] Is the internal party election in Buenos 
Aires unavoidable? 
  [De la Rua] We want to participate in the party convention 
and present a homogeneous discourse there. We believe we must 
attend the convention without feeling subjected to the pact and 
having the possibility of voting against the clause on 
reelection of a president who is in office and of reassessing 
the Buenos Aires Government's autonomy. 
  [Argento] Wouldn't it be more convenient to present a 
homogeneous discourse at the national level? 
  [De la Rua] Generally speaking it would, but with regard to 
this issue it would not be advisable because not everybody is of 
one mind. Here we have been presented with a fait accompli -- 
there was no prior debate on it. 
  [Argento] You lost the debate when the UCR party convention 
approved the Democratic Pact. Shouldn't you conform to what the 
majority wishes? 
  [De la Rua] That is precisely what we are demanding in 
Buenos 
Aires City. You must bear in mind that programs and platforms 
for this type of election are put together by each constituency. 
  [Argento] Why do you think the pact is detrimental to the 
UCR? 
  [De la Rua] Because it has bowed to the government's wishes. 
What the pact has incorporated in the constitutional reform does 
not limit the monopoly control of power. On the contrary, it 
increases it by vesting the president with the power to issue 
decrees in cases of extreme necessity or emergency; by seeking 
to make all terms of office the same length; by incorporating 
the partial veto and the position of prime minister, which is a 
hybrid that has no power of its own. And above all, because it 
makes the role of the opposition wishy-washy and presents it as 
if it were backing the government. 
  [Argento] [Raul] Alfonsin contends that had the pact not 
been 
signed the country would have lurched toward chaos. 
  [De la Rua] The government was then considered a threat. Why 
should one trust it now? There is a contradiction in terms. 
The long and short of it is that the government has brought 
pressure to bear on us and we, the leading opposition party, 
instead of withstanding it, have surrendered our stronghold. 
  [Argento] Are you saying that the UCR "got cold feet?" 
  [De la Rua] Oh, absolutely. 
  [Argento] Given the UCR's infighting, how will you be able 
to 
keep the promise of being the guarantors of the constitutional 
reform pact? 
  [De la Rua] It has nothing to do with that. That is an 
election slogan that people can accept or reject. To gain 
credibility in our capital we have to base our campaign on the 
stance we have always had, namely being against the president's 
reelection and a constitutional reform that serves the 
government's interests and purposes. 
  [Argento] Criticism has been voiced of certain positions 
like 
that of Alberto Kohan [secretary general of the Justicialist 
Party National Council] concerning the possibility of 
Constituent Assembly members having different positions from 
what the pact establishes. What image will the UCR give then if 
it also fails to present a united front? 
  [De la Rua] I have never changed either my stance or my 
discourse. The government, however, signed a pact and some of 
its officials say they can disregard it. Now, on closer 
examination, Article 6 of the law does not say that voting must 
be in keeping with the terms stipulated in the previous articles 
but rather that everything that does not fall under the rules 
established in Articles 2 and 3 will be considered null and 
void. Therefore, there are constraints on the fields, i.e. the 
issues that can be discussed, and not on the resolution made 
there. 
  [Argento] Are you going to head the list of Constituent 
Assembly members? 
  [De la Rua] I would love to. 
  [Argento] Can it be interpreted as a strategy to recover the 
ground lost in the October parliamentary elections? 
  [De la Rua] No, it is rather my duty vis-a-vis Buenos Aires 
residents. Now if my fellow party members want me to be a 
Constituent Assembly member (this issue does not rob me of my 
sleep; this is not my overriding concern), I will be one. 
  [Argento] [UCR Deputy] Leopoldo Moreau some days ago said 
that de la Rua "has no chance" of becoming a presidential 
candidate. 
  [De la Rua] He shares President Menem's views and it is only 
natural that he should do so. 
  [Argento] Will there be a rift within the UCR? 
  [De la Rua] Absolutely not. We have always wanted to have a 
united party and we will continue struggling within our party. 
  [Argento] Would you leave the UCR? 
  [De la Rua] Never. 
  [Argento] Alfonsin denied that he intended to intervene in 
the Buenos Aires City constituency. Do you think there will be 
sanctions? 
  [De la Rua] (He laughs) That would be just the thing that is 
missing to deepen the crisis we are enmeshed in due to the 
current UCR leadership. 
  [Argento] What is your forecast for the 10 April elections? 
  [De la Rua] Some public opinion polls show that the 
Justicialist Party has an overall majority. This process is 
already under way; the constitutional reform has for all 
practical purposes been passed, the government already has got 
it at hand since it is already discussing who Menem's running 
mate will be in 1995. 
  [Argento] Do you then think the UCR will limp badly? 
  [De la Rua] I wish just the opposite, but I must be 
pessimistic.

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde asserted 
that the Cuban meningitis vaccine "will be used" in Buenos Aires 
Province, where in the last few hours a new meningitis case was 
reported -- a five-month-old baby girl. 
  Duhalde said that "it has been proven that the vaccine is 
very effective in those older than five," but "not so for those 
younger than five." He said: "This is the only meningitis 
vaccine that exists so we are going to use it." [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Segura; from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Brigadier General Mario Guillermo Fromow, National 
Defense Secretariat judge advocate general, stated he is 
investigating complaints of two alleged executions by the Army 
in Ocosingo, Chiapas State. 
  [Fromow] "When soldiers succeeded in liberating Ocosingo 
Square they found a number of corpses covered with blood, but 
they had been killed some time earlier. Two of them do appear to 
have been shot in the head with a small caliber firearm. It is 
not the type of firearm the Army uses. Others had wounds caused 
by rifles. The Army does not use those either. In sum, we are 
investigating that." 
  He said action will be taken if soldiers are found 
responsible. 
  [Fromow] "We will proceed immediately against anyone, no 
matter who it is, if he belongs to the Army. I can tell you this 
is an act of violence against people, nothing less than 
homicide." 
  The judge advocate general stated that his office handles 
the 
complaints filed by the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH]. 
  [Fromow] "In Chiapas' case, this office has received 25 
complaints. I am already responding with full information to the 
CNDH so it can have the elements and judge whether or not the 
rights of a citizen were violated or the law was broken." 
  During an interview with Television Azteca, Gen. Fromow 
talked about the attitude of some servicemen and their 
involvement with the complaints that have been filed. 
  [Fromow] "Generally these cases involve the arrests of 
certain people by soldiers. That is not far from the truth. They 
were arrested, but they were immediately handed over to regular 
or federal authorities with medical certificates attesting to 
their physical well-being." The Army carried out no bombings 
in the Chiapas conflict, the judge advocate general stated. 
  [Fromow] "One cannot even imagine that the Army bombed 
towns. 
First, not a single bomb was used, because it was not necessary. 
We are not going to get to that point either. The Army has 
strafed those individuals who conducted attacks." In sum, he 
said, we are seeking peace, because servicemen have suffered in 
the conflict. The Army has sustained casualties, and soldiers 
are risking their lives. 
  [Fromow] "More than anything else, the Army wants peace and 
tranquillity. It wants peace the most, because soldiers know the 
consequences of these incidents; they know they are losing or 
risking their lives."

  [Text] Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas Gutierrez 
and Chiapas State Governor Javier Lopez Moreno have signed the 
1994 social development agreement. The document establishes 
that 750 million new pesos will be assigned to the development 
of social projects in that state. 
  During the ceremony, the social development secretary said 
that the public projects and investments that have been carried 
out are not enough because the situation in the state is the 
product of centuries of backwardness. This is why it is 
necessary to respect the decisions of the community and to 
listen to and heed their proposals and their truth, he said. 
  Javier Lopez Moreno said that efforts to integrate a 
political coalition government will continue because this is 
what the current situation demands. 
  At the end of the ceremony, the officials went to Comitan, 
Chiapas, where they inaugurated one of the 16 health centers 
that will function in the state for peasants and Indians.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, has said in Mexico City that no date 
has been set to begin the talks with the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN]. In a communique, he noted that he has 
yet to receive a firm notification concerning the place and date 
of the meeting. He insisted that written communication between 
the EZLN and the peace commissioner is the only valid source of 
notification, adding that, because of the importance of the 
meeting, it is imperative to maintain a single source of 
notification. In this way, he was denying reports that the 
dialogue would take place on Saturday [5 February]. Here is a 
report from Jaime Guerrero: 
  [Begin recording] [Guerrero] Chiapas and its images of war 
have been viewed around the world, and nobody wants this to 
happen again. Reports indicate the peace process in the 
country's poorest state is clearly advancing toward 
reconciliation. On Thursday, Camacho Solis left Los Pinos 
Presidential Residence after meeting with President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari for 90 minutes. 
  Although the two sides have yet to sit down at the 
bargaining 
table, Camacho has been in contact with the Zapatists for a 
month. He told reporters that he believes the EZLN has assumed a 
responsible attitude. 
  [Camacho] This is why we have been able to advance in the 
peace process. I also want to say -- indeed, I think this is an 
important point -- that I found a responsible attitude on the 
part of the EZLN. With each and every message, we have received 
a corresponding response. 
  [Guerrero] When asked about the interventionist attitude of 
U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli and his virtual impact on the 
negotiations, Camacho replied: 
  [Camacho] This is a matter we, the Mexican people, are going 
to resolve. That is the position of the EZLN and the 
government. This is the position of all political forces. 
  [Guerrero] And so, the process continues. Camacho Solis said 
there have been private communications on several points, 
including the one dealing with General Absalom Castellanos. The 
peace commissioner told the press that until now he has not made 
a statement that has not been in line with the facts. He showed 
an optimistic outlook, but he warned there is still a risk that 
the talks with the EZLN will reach an impasse -- a situation 
that would bring about negative consequences. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F>
and reconciliation in Chiapas; in San Cristobal de las Cases, 
Chiapas State on 4 February; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening. This is the public communique I am 
sending to the command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN]: 
  The de facto strategy, including messages, has yielded 
fruits. Written communication, both public and confidential, has 
been serious and has contributed to maintaining the cease-fire 
and the gradual return to calm in the region. 
  I have received your confidential communication on holding 
meetings for peace and reconciliation. I agree with your 
proposal. In a confidential document I am answering your 
questions on the final details. 
  The dialogue can begin: 
  1. The meeting will proceed based on the agenda we have 
mutually accepted. I will listen to your points of view on 
other issues of interest, knowing that national issues will not 
be included in the resolutions. 
  2. Regarding the International Red Cross, I inform you that 
the participation of this institution is based on the terms of 
the formal request the International Red Cross made to the 
Mexican Government. The position of the Mexican Government and 
this institution is that the activities of the International Red 
Cross in Mexico should be restricted to its strictly 
humanitarian purpose and that they should not represent meddling 
in the domestic affairs of the Mexican state. 
  3. The objective is an honorable peace. We have started 
from the principle that peace must be secured while safeguarding 
the full sovereignty of the Mexican people. All of us -- 
Congress, the political parties, society, the government, and 
the churches -- have spoken in favor of a national solution to a 
Mexican problem. There is no need for internationalizing this 
conflict. We will have neutral space and offer the guarantees 
you demand in your confidential document. 
  4. My tasks are clear: to propose to the government, based 
on what you tell me, measures aimed at resolving, without gaps, 
the situation. This is what I have been doing. I also have the 
task of keeping the people informed and creating an awareness in 
society that together with a solution to your demands should 
contribute to the construction of peace. 
  5. The purpose of the dialogue is to find solutions. All of 
us, as Mexicans who enjoy equal rights, can propose solutions. 
This way we can make progress on the most difficult aspect of 
all negotiations. We can create a framework of respect that will 
facilitate the peace process. 
  I realize that needs that have been built-up for decades 
cannot be resolved overnight, but I also know that progress can 
be made by making big and honest efforts. We will march forward 
as fast as you are ready to march. 
  6. I know that solutions to this conflict are complex, that 
this is not a matter of simply increasing investments or 
programs but of generating, with your participation, economic, 
political, and social solutions that will allow the 
establishment of a new relationship between the authorities and 
the communities. 
  I am certain that the Indian communities you represent that 
form part of the EZLN require a new kind of relationship with 
the institutions of Chiapas and Mexican society. 
  The Mexican nation has the strength of its intrinsic 
diversity and cultural wealth. My starting point is: respect 
for the dignity of the Indian communities. 
  Thank you very much. You are very kind.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (AFP) -- "Subcommander Marcos," 
the military strategist of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] rebels who took up arms on 1 January, warned during an 
interview published today by the local daily LA JORNADA that if 
the Mexican Government isolates the guerrillas politically, 
there will be "carnage." 
  At a meeting with a group of journalists in an unidentified 
region of the Lacandona Jungle, in southern Mexico, Marcos spoke 
about the reasons for the uprising, the imminent dialogue with 
the government, and the issues on which there is no agreement. 
Marcos said that "there is the risk of the government 
politically isolating us at the national level. Obviously, this 
would lead to a renewal of the military option." He noted that 
"the next time there will be a great deal of carnage because we 
are not going to perish alone, and we are not going to move to 
another place." 
  Marcos said that the EZLN has agreed to negotiations (that 
could begin in the next few hours) because "we owe it not to the 
government or Manuel Camacho (commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation) but to the civilian society. We want to sit 
down and talk with civilian society." 
  Recalling a passage of the Mexican conquest, he insisted 
that 
"if the government succeeds in isolating us," the guerrillas 
"prefer to jump into the river than to surrender their weapons." 
The subcommander, who approached reporters escorted by armed 
Indians and wearing a military uniform, his already traditional 
"sky mask," and a black poncho, noted that "the total 
annihilation of our forces is improbable. It is in fact 
impossible." 
  Regarding the dialogue, for which no date or place has been 
set, Marcos said: "We are thinking about holding it in the 
city." He added that "we don't want to hold it in the jungle" 
because "here we cannot guarantee the security" of Camacho or 
guerrilla mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. 
  Marcos said that the negotiations must take place "in a 
place 
where they (the government) will feel obligated to act 
properly." He did not discard the possibility of holding talks 
in the Mexican capital. 
  Regarding the dialogue, Marcos said that the EZLN "has 
forced" the government to engage in negotiations. However, 
commenting on the official refusal to discuss national political 
issues, Marcos said he has doubts about the possibility of the 
government complying with an agreement. Marcos said that "it is 
not right for Camacho to say that he is not going to negotiate 
national policies with an armed group. The government is 
washing its hands before reaching an agreement, and if there is 
an agreement, it would not comply with it." 
  Marcos noted that the government "does not want to discuss 
issues over which there is consensus." He added that there is 
no "democratic room in the nation" in which the Indians 
participate. He explained that "it is wrong to think that our 
problems will be resolved at the state (Chiapas) level." He 
added that "we know that this can only be fixed if there are 
changes higher up. Now," he analogized, "they are changing the 
tree's leaves, but the tree's roots are rotten." 
  He went on to say that "the predicament is not whether to 
have peace with democracy. As we see it, the matter is to 
either have peace or war with dignity." 
  Marcos criticized the official decision to recognize the 
EZLN 
as "a political force in formation," and not as a belligerent 
force, as his organization had demanded. He said that "it now 
happens that the Indians are no longer children but adults in 
formation," although "they will continue treating us like little 
children."

<F P=106> [Report by Freddy Martin Perez] </F>
  [Text] Guadalupe Tepeyac, Mexico, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The 
self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] allowed 17 
journalists into this area in observance of the agreement with 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas State. 
  The caravan of journalists was received by some 150 
inhabitants in downtown Guadalupe de Tepeyac, a village in 
Chiapas State in southeastern Mexico. Local resident Manuel 
Jimenez Santis said that residents are hopeful that hostilities 
will end. The EZLN accepted Camacho Solis' proposal to create 
two "free zones" or neutral areas in San Miguel and Guadalupe 
Tepeyac and on 2 February ordered its followers to withdraw from 
both areas. 
  The peace commissioner's proposal stipulates that once the 
two "free zones" are created, the International Red Cross will 
begin humanitarian aid and support operations for the civilian 
population in these two places. Jimenez Santis said that 
several dozen Lacandona jungle inhabitants have transferred 
their sick for medical attention in response to the announced 
arrival within the next few hours of International Red Cross 
members. 
  Jimenez Santis summoned Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, to come and learn 
the communities' most urgent needs. "We peasants have no land, 
no work, we have no good food, housing, education, or health 
care. What we want now is peace," Jimenez Sanits said. 
  NOTIMEX toured several communities and was able to verify 
that food and medicines had become scarce, while here in 
Guadalupe Tepeyac, where about 160 [as published] inhabitants 
live, the Solidarity Hospital was unharmed by the conflict. 
  The Mexican Government and the EZLN have maintained a 
cease-fire since 12 January following armed clashes that began 
on 1 January and left, according to official reports, about 100 
persons dead. Maria Gomez Hernandez, a housewife, said milk, 
sugar, rice, flour, oil, and other basic staples are urgently 
needed. She requested that Camacho Solis visit the area to work 
within the peace process in communities isolated by the conflict. 
  Possibilities increased this weekend for the first direct 
talks between the EZLN and the peace commissioner. "The 
dialogue may start," Camacho Solis said when announcing last 
night that both sides agreed on the discussion agenda after the 
EZLN proposed on Friday to include the topic of "national 
political life" without seeking agreements on this point. 
  In a message broadcast from San Cristobal de las Casas, 
1,200 
km southeast of Mexico City, Camacho Solis said that the 
contents for the direct dialogue "is the agenda on which we have 
mutually agreed."

<F P=106> [Report by Luis Granovsky] </F>
  [Text] Acapulco, Mexico, 3 Feb (AFP) -- Despite official 
denials regarding an eventual presence of subversive groups in 
Guerrero State, Mexico, the country's press has continued to 
insist "the existence of armed groups that invite the population 
to join the guerrillas is a widely known secret," as the daily 
NOVEDADES proclaimed today. 
  Under the headline "Subversion Is Promoted in the Costa 
Chica 
Region," the newspaper published on its front page a map of the 
"area with a possible guerrilla presence" and quotes statements 
from a police commissioner, a bilingual teacher, and other 
witnesses who have informed the authorities of the presence of 
armed individuals in the area. 
  The Acapulco newspaper EL SOL, on the Pacific Coast, had 
written on 2 February that there are military training camps, 
that more than 20,000 AK-47 assault rifles had entered the state 
over the last few weeks, and that there is a "red alert" in the 
state due to the danger of "a new guerrilla front, similar to 
the one in Chiapas State." 
  There was a guerrilla uprising in the southern State of 
Chiapas on 1 January, and for weeks national newspapers and 
magazines have been insisting that in the mountain and forest 
areas of Guerrero State there are armed groups, in addition an 
intense police mobilization to search for them. 
  Jose Ruben Robles, Guerrero State government secretary, said 
on 22 February the information published by EL SOL reflects a 
"lack of responsibility and little professionalism," because "no 
subversive groups have been found, much less any military 
training camps." 
  The newspaper also quoted an official document, existence of 
which the government has denied, but EL SOL Director Eloisa 
Lopez has confirmed to AFP that it exists and that she has a 
copy. 
  NOVEDADES' envoy to the area has described such cases, 
however, as that of Huehuetonoc, where the bilingual teacher has 
reported that armed individuals, with beige uniforms, had 
invited the Indian population to join the guerrilla movement. 
This was also denounced by the town's police commissioner. 
  It has also mentioned the arrest of a retired police 
sergeant 
who was bearing "prohibited weapons" and who had allegedly 
confessed to forming part of a group of eight people armed with 
AK-47 assault rifles and M-1 carbines and members of a "town 
police." 
  The government does not deny the presence of armed groups 
but 
identifies them as crooks, criminals, or kidnappers, not as 
subversives. 
  In Guerrero State there was, in the early 1970's, a 
guerrilla 
uprising that the Army annihilated quickly. 
  It is recognized that in the region there are many groups of 
drug traffickers that have already clashed several times with 
the Army, which is fighting them, and even amongst themselves 
for control of the exit routes of the marijuana grown in the 
mountains. 
  There have also been dozens of kidnapings, mostly of wealthy 
landlords who have had to pay large amounts of money to be freed. 
  The only point on which the different versions agree is that 
there are many weapons circulating in Guerrero State: the 
disagreements regard who has them and for what they use them. 
Meanwhile, there is a psychosis of possible clashes in many 
towns in the state.

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has asked Mexican 
nongovernmental organizations to create a "peace cordon 
[cinturon de paz] to avoid pressure, intimidation, or even 
attacks" by the parties involved in conflict. 
  In a communique dated 1 February and released in this 
southeastern Mexican city on Saturday [5 February], it was noted 
that the request was made in view of the imminent start of peace 
talks between Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis and the EZLN. The fact that the dialogue could be 
held within a conflict zone would entail risks of provocation 
that could obstruct or bog down the dialogue. 
  "With the goal of reducing undesirable tensions to a minimum 
between the parties involved, a security or peace cordon should 
be formed around the dialogue site to avoid pressure, 
intimidation, or even attacks by one of the parties involved in 
the conflict against the other." 
  Meanwhile, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said here 
today that the direct talks with the EZLN "will be held very 
soon," and he added that "everything is set and there are no 
problems in holding the meeting." 
  After meeting with Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de 
Las Casas -- the link between the armed group and the 
commissioner -- Camacho said "we will come out ahead" in efforts 
to find a peaceful solution in Chiapas. Buffer zones were 
created to hold the meetings in the area of Los Altos de Chiapas 
at the request of Camacho Solis. This request was accepted by 
the armed group on Thursday. The towns of San Miguel and 
Guadalupe Tepeyac, in north central and southeastern Chiapas, 
respectively, were proposed as the two areas that will remain 
free of any armed presence and where the International Red Cross 
would provide assistance to the civilian population. 
  Camacho Solis explained this idea is intended "to create 
areas of detente" to support the population that has been 
adversely affected by the conflict. The armed group added that 
it would withdraw its men from San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac 
when the International Red Cross installs its camps to provide 
the humanitarian aid. 
  On Saturday, the International Red Cross Committee announced 
it would restore medical services in certain areas of Chiapas 
and would organize a program to supervise the health centers run 
by Mexican personnel. According to the plan, the International 
Red Cross will only provide humanitarian aid to the civilian 
population and medical treatment to all, including the 
transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas or anywhere 
else in the country as required. 
  Another action that contributed to the progress of the peace 
process was the EZLN's sending of a communique to Bishop Ruiz. 
In the communique, the rebels announced they would "shortly" 
release former Chiapas State Governor Absalon Castellanos 
Dominguez, who was kidnapped on 2 January. 
  In another communique addressed to the Executive 
Coordinating 
Commission of the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations, the EZLN said those Zapatists who "had verbally 
assaulted local residents who did not support our struggle have 
been reprimanded." This communique added: "Neither physical nor 
verbal threats to force anyone to join our struggle will be 
tolerated from our troops and supporters. Our war laws are very 
clear in this regard, and we have already taken action to 
correct the damage done and to prevent the problem from 
recurring."

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 6 Feb (Notimex) -- Today 
the nongovernment organizations (NGO'S) accepted a proposal to 
create a security cordon around negotiations between government 
and Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) representatives. 
  Yesterday, Saturday, the armed group requested that in light 
of an imminent dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, and the 
EZLN, the NGO'S could lay out a security cordon which would 
prevent both sides from interfering in the physical space of the 
dialogue table. 
  Gerardo Gonzalez, spokesman for the Coordinating Board of 
Nongovernment Human Rights Organizations (CONPAZ) in this city, 
indicated this group's interest in also becoming a permanent 
observer of the Chiapas peace process. He added that the 
security cordon would be implemented either on foot or by using 
vehicles operated by CONPAZ members, the Red Cross, the Health 
Secretariat, and nongovernment human rights organizations which 
will cover the area where the talks will take place. The CONPAZ 
representative indicated that the objective is to observe all 
movements of troops and aircraft, as well as national and 
international correspondents sent to cover the dialogue. He 
added that this will serve to prevent any irregularities which 
may affect the first rapprochement to ensure peace and 
reestablish legal order in the region. 
  "(Today) we expect to deliver the EZLN acceptance letter to 
[Monsignor] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas 
dioceses and national mediation commissioner, as well as to 
Camacho Solis." He mentioned that the letter was sent to all 
representatives of the 130 nongovernment organizations in the 
country inviting their representatives to participate in 
implementing the security cordon in order to ensure the dialogue. 
  Gonzalez believes the communities of San Miguel, the 
municipality of Ocosingo, and the city of Comitan are ideal 
sites for the talks aimed at setting the foundations of a true 
reconciliation between Chiapas inhabitants and state and federal 
authorities. 
  The spokesman for CONPAZ, an organization which consists of 
approximately 11 local groups, was interviewed at the conclusion 
of a citizen's march for peace and reconciliation that ended 
with a meeting in this community's central plaza. 
  As of the start of the negotiation process between the peace 
commissioner and the EZLN, under the mediation of Bishop Ruiz, 
both sides have agreed to initiate a dialogue based on a 
prearranged agenda. The dialogue is aimed at solving the 
Chiapas Indian community problem. 
  Beginning on 1 January the EZLN staged an uprising in four 
communities of the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, and 
presented demands for Indian grievances. 
  It is expected that this Sunday Camacho Solis will announce 
the date and place where the first direct talks will take place.

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Feb (AFP) -- In an interview 
published by the local newspaper LA JORNADA, Zapatist rebel 
leader "Marcos" said the Mexican guerrillas intend to negotiate 
an "autonomy law" for Indians and discuss "the agrarian topic." 
  In the interview conducted in the mountains of southeastern 
Mexico, the military strategist of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) said the rebels do not intend to take 
over power with weapons, which they have obtained "without 
foreign support." He said the main "detonator" of the 1 January 
Chiapas uprising was the land problem and, especially, reforms 
to Article 27 of the Constitution, by which the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari limited the existence of 
ejidos [a form of land tenure] in the area inhabited by more 
than 1 million Indians. 
  "These reforms canceled all legal possibilities of having 
access to land," and they "closed the door on Indians surviving 
in a legal and peaceful manner," according to "Marcos." He added 
that "the agrarian problem should once again be discussed." 
Salinas' reforms should be eliminated as "a first step in 
opening wider discussions aimed at keeping the countryside in 
mind." 
  He added that during the dialogue with the government, the 
date and place of which has still not been decided, the EZLN 
will call for the establishment of an "autonomous region similar 
to what the Basques or Catalans have [in Spain]" in order to 
attenuate the Indian communities' "distrust" toward the 
government. "We must negotiate an autonomy statute where our 
government and our administrative structure will be acknowledged 
by the Mexican government and we may live together without 
anyone interfering with us," "Marcos" asserted. 
  After denying that the Chiapas Catholic Church had supported 
the guerrillas ("there was not even consent"), the rebel leader 
stated that the "Zapatist thunder of thousands" of Indians came 
after the "failure" of legal mechanisms to guarantee 
participation, self-government, and food self-sufficiency in the 
region. "If the Indians decided to organize cooperatives, right 
away they were lambasted. If they decided to organize to demand 
land, they were rejected. If they organize to take over land by 
force, they are killed. They have no health facilities; they 
are dying," he commented. 
  Although he denied that the Zapatists intend to take over 
power by force, the guerrilla leader did say that the EZLN does 
favor "a national revolutionary movement" and that their demands 
"are nation-wide [nacionales]." 
  With respect to the origins of the weapons under guerrilla 
control and reports that they had been training for the past ten 
years, he indicated that the weapons were obtained by 
"stockpiling bit by bit" -- "black market" weapons seized by the 
police from drug traffickers, weapons taken from the "white 
guards [guardias blancas]" (paramilitary) working for the 
region's farm owners, and rudimentary hunting weapons used by 
the peasants. 
  "Marcos," whom reporters describe as a 40-year-old mestizo 
pointed out that the weapons in the hands of the EZLN consist of 
(Russian manufactured) AK-47 and (U.S. made) M-16 rifles, German 
UZI machine-guns, as well as lower caliber hunting rifles. He 
also added that the EZLN "originated as a self-defense group." 
  The rebel leader, whose identity is still not known, said he 
is a "by-product" of the 1968 Mexican student movement and 
"everything else that came afterwards, mainly election fraud." 
He did not specify when he decided to go to the southeastern 
mountains but did indicate that he takes orders from an Indian 
group that makes up the EZLN "General Command." "Marcos" added 
that he became "subcommander" only after being a junior 
lieutenant, lieutenant, second captain, and then first captain.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (AFP) -- The private radio 
station Radio Red reported this Saturday that there were two 
explosions this morning at installations of the state-owned 
enterprise Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) in the southern State of 
Tabasco. 
  In a report from its correspondent in Villa Hermosa, 660 km 
southeast of this capital, the radio station reported the 
explosions took place at the Pemex installations named Gregorio 
Mendez and Santa Isabel near that city. 
  The explosions, the radio station added, occurred at 
approximately 0700 GMT and caused large fires at the site. 
Several ambulances were sent there. 
  The radio station stated it is yet unknown whether there are 
victims, but there is great concern, because several communities 
are located in areas near the site of the explosions.

  [Text] Villahermosa, Mexico, 5 Feb (AFP) -- At least 15 
people were wounded while 800 were evacuated this Saturday from 
Gregorio Mendez, a hamlet in the southern State of Tabasco, as 
the result of a strong explosion at a state-run Mexican 
Petroleum [Pemex] plant, a Red Cross spokesman has told AFP. 
  The spokesman has said the explosion, the cause of which is 
still unknown, occurred after noon and caused a large fire at 
the site, located in the Cunduacan region, near this city. 
  So far, the spokesman added, there are 15 wounded but no 
fatalities from the catastrophe, which reportedly had spread to 
another Pemex installation in the bordering town of Santa Isabel. 
  The Red Cross had mobilized to the site 12 ambulances--which 
were "all that were available" in the area--and coordinated the 
"rescue operation" of the individuals who were affected by the 
fire, the spokesman said. 
  He said the catastrophe was already under control and that 
the wounded had been moved to Pemex's hospital in that area. 
  Tabasco government and fire department sources of that city 
also said they ignored the elements that caused the explosion at 
the petroleum installations. 
  Tabasco State, 660 km southeast of this capital, borders 
Chiapas State, where on 1 January an Indian rebellion broke out 
against the government, which still has been unable to establish 
a dialogue with the rebels.

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (AFP) -- The private radio 
station Radio Red has released a first account of the explosion 
on Saturday afternoon at a state-owned Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) 
plant in the southern State of Tabasco. The explosion killed at 
least 10 people, and 20 were seriously wounded. 
  The causes of the explosion at the Ninive Plant of the oil 
company and a fire between the towns of Gregorio Mendez and 
Rancho Nuevo, Cunduacan Municipality, approximately 660 km 
southeast of this capital, are still unknown, the radio station 
reported, adding that one of the plant's internal pipelines is 
what exploded. 
  So far 10 people are known dead, four of who were passing in 
front of the Pemex installations in a particular vehicle, inside 
which "they were carbonized." 
  The other six dead were workers of the enterprise who formed 
part of a team of 26 workers who were working at the site at the 
time of the explosion. The remaining 20 are seriously wounded, 
the radio station reported. 
  The area Red Cross has confirmed to AFP some of the wounded 
were taken to Pemex's hospital located near the oil plant, 
others to medical centers located in the city of Villahermoza, 
capital of Tabasco State. 
  The gas pipeline explosion occurred in a 200-meter stretch 
and left a crater seven meters deep, the radio station reported, 
adding that "more than 100 trees were blown down" by the 
concussion of the blast. 
  Firemen controlled the resulting fire, although it prompted 
the immediate evacuation, by the Red Cross, of at least 800 
people who inhabit the town of Gregorio Mendez. 
  Pemex personnel were trying in the afternoon to prevent 
contact between gas and crude oil circulating in the different 
petroleum pipelines in the area by injecting water into the 
plants near the Ninive Plant, where there are several ejidos 
(communal lands). 
  Radio Red stated Pemex concentrates most of its drilling and 
production activities in the Cunduacan area, where there is a 
vast oil-drilling infrastructure.

  [Text] Villahermosa, 6 Feb (AFP) -- According to a report 
disclosed to AFP today by Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) spokesman 
Mario Martinez, authorities of the state-owned corporation are 
investigating the causes of an explosion that occurred on 
Saturday at a gas pipeline located in the southern State of 
Tabasco. At the same time, the Pemex spokesman denied that the 
explosion had resulted in several casualties. 
  Martinez denied reports disclosed on Saturday by Radio Red, 
a 
Mexico City radio station, on at least 10 persons having died 
and 20 others having been wounded as result of the explosion and 
fire at a pipeline located in the municipality of Cunduacan, 
near Villahermosa, 600 km southeast of Mexico City. "There were 
no fatalities," the Pemex spokesman emphasized, and indicated 
that only nine persons were injured as a result of burns, 
including Pemex workers and residents of the communities of 
Gregorio Mendez and Ranch Nuevo, both which are near the area. 
  Martinez pointed out that the explosion took place at a gas 
pipeline connected to the petroleum installation known as Iride. 
He added that the cause of the explosion is "still being 
investigated," starting first by cleaning up the area and then 
examining materials through laboratory analysis. Pemex 
technicians and specialists from the Attorney General's Office 
[PGR] are investigating the explosion and fire which resulted in 
damages to an area measuring approximately 300 meters, mainly to 
trees and pastures, he specified. 
  A Red Cross spokesperson told AFP on Saturday that the 
disaster prompted the evacuation of at least 800 persons living 
in the nearby communities whom, according to Mario Martinez, 
"have already returned to their homes." He stipulated that 
Pemex is also investigating damages to nearby properties. Pemex 
will compensate the owners for any damaged property. 
  The Pemex spokesman acknowledged that the Iride installation 
lacked "adequate attention to normal maintenance procedures," 
but attributed this to the fact that peasants in the area "have 
blocked entry" to the site by staging constant "protests for 
alleged damages" caused by the petroleum plant. "These 
installations have been blocked from the first months of 1993 to 
date by persons unjustly demanding compensation for alleged 
damages," Pemex indicated. 
  Residents of the region of Cunduacan where Pemex 
concentrates 
a vast petroleum drilling and production infrastructure have 
complained about damage caused by the state-owned company which 
they accuse of polluting the area in which they live.

  [Text] Voting on the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] has been 
postponed until 7 February. During the final congressional 
session of the week, congressmen approved just one amendment; 
which grants more power to legislators. 
  Congress will probably vote on the amendment that creates 
the 
FSE on 7 February. Yesterday congressmen approved a proposal to 
invert the agenda and vote on this amendment before others. For 
lack of quorum, however, everything was postponed until next 
week. Only an amendment that grants more power to Congress was 
approved yesterday. As a result of this amendment, congressmen 
can now summon for questioning by the Congressional 
Investigation Committees not only ministers but also 
second-echelon officials and directors of state-owned companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonio Marcello] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- International agreements, draft bills, 
provisional measures, presidential messages and vetoes: More 
than 200 bills are paralyzed in Congress, the Senate, and the 
Chamber of Deputies as a consequence of a permanent lack of 
quorum or of unresolved party negotiations. Without the bills 
being analyzed by the technical committees, there are 221 
proposals on the agenda of the congressional chambers, an amount 
that increases daily with the arrival of new draft bills. 
  The situation became worse over the past few months with the 
Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], the fiscal 
reform, and the constitutional review. The paralyzation of the 
plenary halls, while discussions outside them became more 
heated, has created difficulties for both the executive and 
legislative branches. The Senate has managed to impose a 
minimum of discipline on the plenary by establishing a calendar 
of sessions, but surprises in voting sessions, like the one on 
the fiscal reform, have forced senators to hold meetings late 
into the evening. 
  Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de Oliveira (PFL-PE) 
[Liberal Front Party-Pernambuco] insists on the approval in the 
lower house of a resolution establishing sessions every day of 
the week. A resolution is a legal measure on any internal issue 
in either of the two houses. Only one weekly session is being 
currently held; it is scheduled for Mondays -- when the quorum 
is reduced to nearly zero which thus prevents voting on 
important subjects. Daily sessions will also serve as a 
parameter for the time the Constitution and Justice Committee 
(CCJ) will have to judge the congressmen whom the Budget CPI 
recommended be stripped of their political rights. Inocencio 
guarantees that this is not the reason behind his draft bill. 
"We have more than 70 draft bills on which to vote. The House 
cannot remain paralyzed," he maintained. 
  His draft bill was included in the agenda last 24 January, 
but a petition by PDT [Democratic Labor Party] leader Deputy 
Luiz Salomao (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro], and supported by the PT 
[Workers Party] and the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], 
postponed the voting session. The leaders want the subject to 
be further debated to avoid charges that the bill was placed on 
the agenda to reduce the period of defense of the deputies 
accused by the CPI. According to the internal regulations of 
the Chamber of Deputies, the term for their defense is five 
sessions. If these are weekly sessions, the judgment process 
will take much longer than was thought. Inocencio wants the 
bill approved on 31 January. 
  The executive branch also suffers from the delayed voting 
sessions. There are at least 14 draft bills in Congress 
establishing supplementary credits for ministries, like the 
Health Ministry, which are on the congressional agenda and ready 
to be voted on but which remain on the waiting list. 
  Among the 97 subjects to be discussed or voted on, and which 
are on the Congress agenda, are 17 draft bills, 22 resolutions, 
14 provisional measures, and 44 decisions on executive branch 
vetoes. In the Senate there are 27 accumulated subjects: 7 draft 
bills, 10 resolutions, and 10 legislative decrees. The Chamber 
of Deputies has 97 bills: 19 urgent decisions, 56 draft bills, 5 
resolutions, 10 legislative decrees, 1 message from the 
executive branch, and 6 preliminary resolutions on decisions 
suggested by technical committees. 
  Here are some of the subjects on the waiting list of 
Congress, the Senate, and the Chamber of Deputies: 
<H5>  In Congress </H5>
  A draft bill that establishes the revision of the 
Multi-Annual Plan for 1994 and 1995. It has been on the agenda 
since 7 November. 
  A draft bill that estimates the income and establishes the 
expenses of the Federal Government for fiscal year 1994. It has 
been on the agenda since 6 December. 
  A draft resolution that modifies the structure of the Mixed 
Committee of Public Plans, Budget, and Fiscal Control. It has 
been paralyzed since it was first read in Congress on 22 
December 1991. 
  A draft resolution that creates the Permanent Mixed 
Committee 
for the Control of Illegal Drug Trafficking and Prevention of 
Drug Abuse. This has been paralyzed since it was first read on 
10 March 1992. 
  A draft resolution that creates the Permanent Mixed 
Committee 
for Nuclear and Strategic Affairs. This has been paralyzed 
since it was presented for a vote in the Senate and the lower 
house in 1991. 
<H5>  In the Senate </H5>

<F P=106> [Report by Beth Veloso from Congress] </F>
  [Text] Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the 
Senate, said the government may adopt radical measures if the 
social emergency fund bill is not approved next week. He said 
today that the government may adopt strong measures with radical 
effects to curb inflation. He also said Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso may resign his post if Congress 
continues delaying a decision on the economic plan. 
  [Begin Simon recording] His argument is that if the bill is 
not approved all the government can do is return to what we all 
know, that is, strong measures like radical economic packages 
and the plans we already have lived through and whose results 
are known. He is capable of resigning if the bill is not 
approved. [end recording] 
  Sen. Pedro Simon said that in his speech to the nation on 7 
February, Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will make a final 
appeal to the congressmen to turn up in the plenary hall and 
assume their responsibility. 
  [Begin Simon recording] In his speech, the minister will 
explain the whole issue and he will call on congressmen to vote 
either in favor or against the bill. It would be fantastic if 
they vote against it because they would be rejecting a bill 
that, although it was prepared by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, was 
totally modified by Congress. Congress must give a reply. Do the 
congressmen agree that we must solve the public deficit? Do they 
agree that the government must stop borrowing money from the 
bank to pay interest it cannot pay? Don't you agree with this? 
The congressmen must approve the bill they modified. [end 
recording] 
  Sen. Pedro Simon said the government needs the social 
emergency fund bill to be approved on 8 February in order to 
honor its commitments to its international creditors and then be 
ratified on 10 March.

  [Text] Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the 
Senate, says his comments on what could happen if Congress does 
not approve the creation of the social emergency fund bill, 
necessary for the stabilization plan, were misinterpreted. 
  Sen. Simon said he never talked about shock measures: 
  [Begin recording] The plan will be approved because, 
although it was prepared by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, it now 
belongs to Congress, which fully altered and modified it. This 
is why I maintain that the plan will be approved. If not, I 
believe Fernando Henrique might resign, but I cannot say there 
will be shock measures because I have no clue about this. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Lage, vice president of the Cuban </F>
Council of State, by unidentified O ESTADO correspondent, "this 
week" in Riberao Preto] 
  [Text] [O ESTADO] The United States is about to lift the 
20-year-old embargo on Vietnam. Does Cuba see any indication 
that the embargo against it may be lifted in the short or medium 
term? 
  [Lage] We do not see that possibility nor any indication 
that 
the United States will lift the blockade against Cuba in the 
short term. That is an ignorant and criminal policy that cannot 
be maintained indefinitely while there increasingly are forces 
that express their rejection of the blockade. 
  [O ESTADO] The names of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and 
Raul Castro are mentioned as the strongest candidates to replace 
Fidel. You allegedly also are on the list. 
  [Lage] No. Raul Castro is on the list. He is vice president 
of the Council of State and second secretary of the party, and 
the one who would replace Fidel. Why think of his successor if 
the two are alive? 
  [O ESTADO] The Cuban regime seems to be implementing a 
transition rhythm different from that preferred by the United 
States and Cuban dissidents. Could you explain how this 
transition works and where it will lead? 
  [Lage] We are not engagin in a transition to capitalism. We 
are adapting our socialist economy to conditions abroad. 
  [O ESTADO] How are subjects like a multiparty system being 
dealt with? 
  [Lage] Our concept is of a single party. In Cuba, a party is 
not an electoral party that organizes itself to win or to 
participate in an election and then lacks power to organize or 
conduct society. From our point of view, a single party is more 
democratic. There are multiparty elections in many countries but 
barely 30 or 40 percent of the people participate in the 
elections so the winners have barely 30 or 40 percent of the 
votes. 
  [O ESTADO] Is it true that Fidel admires former President 
Collor? 
  [Lage] The truth is that Collor, while he was president, had 
a positive attitude toward Cuba and resisted U.S. pressures. We 
do not forget that.

<F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener] </F>
  [Text] The star of the PT [Workers Party] is shining beyond 
the frontiers of our homeland. At the request of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) -- the leftist Salvadoran 
guerrilla group that has ended its armed struggle -- two PT 
communications experts spent eight days in El Salvador advising 
Ruben Zamora, who will run for the presidency on the FMLN ticket 
on 15 March, on his election campaign. Sao Paulo reporters Jose 
Americo Dias and Dulce Cardoso were chosen by the PT 
International Affairs Secretariat to assist their Salvadoran 
comrades in everything from devising Zamora's campaign strategy 
to producing pamphlets, placards, and radio and television 
advertisements. Dias, 40 -- editor of the party newspaper 
BRASIL AGORA and radio and television coordinator of Luiz Inacio 
Lula da Silva's presidential campaign in 1989 -- told ISTOE: 
"The PT constitutes a major political frame of reference for 
the left in El Salvador together with the Democratic Party of 
the Left -- the former Italian PC [Communist Party], and the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] -- Mexico's leading 
opposition party." The Salvadoran Association for Freedom and 
Democracy, a nongovernmental organization linked to the 
Salvadoran left, defrayed the two journalists' travelling 
expenses. The advisers did not charge anything for their little 
help. They were so delighted with this experience that they are 
contemplating supporting other fellow parties in Latin America. 
Who would have ever imagined it -- the left, which at the time 
of the Cold War was accused of exporting its revolution, is now 
exporting peaceful electoral support. "The Mexican PRD already 
has shown interest in this exchange of experience," said Dias. 
  Dias stated: "Our main objective in El Salvador was to lend 
a hand in the training of personnel for the election campaigns 
of Zamora, San Salvador mayoral candidate Shafick Handal, and 
leftist coalition deputies grouped around the FMLN. We also 
discussed the need to divide the campaign publishing pamphlets, 
specifically targeting the youth, intellectuals, peasants, and 
especially women." Public opinion surveys show that Zamora has 
very little backing among women. 
  The FMLN and the Salvadoran Army were fiercely engaged in a 
civil war that claimed nearly 75,000 victims from 1979 to 1992. 
An agreement signed by the guerrilla group and President 
Alfredo Cristiani -- from the conservative Arena Party -- two 
years ago spelled the end to fighting and transformed the FMLN 
into a legal party. The latest public opinion poll by the 
Technological University last December showed that 40.2 percent 
of people intend to vote for Armando Calderon Sol from the Arena 
Party while only 22.2 percent intend to do so for Zamora and 
14.1 percent for Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena. In light 
of the fact that Zamora and Chavez Mena have centered their 
campaign on criticism of the government's performance in the 
economic sphere, it is possible that they may join forces for a 
possible runoff. 
  Contrary to what happens in Brazil, there is no free air 
time 
for election campaigns in El Salvador. It has to be bought, 
and it is precisely on television spots [preceding word in 
English] that the Arena Party is obtaining its greatest success 
thanks to the help of U.S. experts in electoral marketing. 
Brazilian election campaigns have held a certain fascination 
for the FMLN for a long time. A former representative of the 
guerrilla group in Brazil, Gregorio Ernesto Zelayndia, exported 
to his country one of the keynotes of Bahia State elections, 
namely cavalcades [carreatas], which, as a matter of fact, have 
been quite successful in that small country of 5.5 million 
inhabitants. 
  Dias said: "The greatest problem confronting the FMLN is 
ceasing to be a guerrilla group and changing itself into a legal 
party. Carrying a rifle is not quite the same thing as going 
door to door canvassing for votes." The Technological 
University survey also shows that Salvadorans' overriding 
concern is crime. The crime rate soared in the wake of the 
civil war due to the demobilization of thousands of soldiers and 
guerrillas who do not have jobs. Banditry mingles with the 
action of extreme right death squads, which the peace agreement 
could not totally eliminate. The PT journalists were able to 
see this serious problem for themselves. As Dias commented, 
"every time we accompanied the former guerrilla leaders in their 
cars, they were escorted by bodyguards armed with machine guns," 
adding that "everything was normal so far, except that there 
were always spare weapons on the floor of the car in case the 
other passengers had to repel an attack."

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rodrigues: "Fleury's Popularity Topples </F>
to 19 Percent"] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho (PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]) is in a touchy situation 
as he completes two years and nine months of his term. For the 
first time since the first poll was conducted 30 days after he 
took office, his rejection rating has jumped to 30 percent and 
now exceeds his approval rating (19 percent), according to a 
poll conducted in the capital of Sao Paulo State. 
  Governor Fleury found his approval rating (the number of 
respondents rating his performance "very good or good") 
beginning to fall after he had been in office one year and three 
months. At the time, the PMDB governor was enjoying a 
comfortable approval rating of 40 percent. That percentage 
dropped to 36 percent after one year and six months, 30 percent 
after one year and eight months, and 26 percent after two years 
and four months, and is now down to 19 percent. 
  The Sao Paulo governor is managing to maintain an "average" 
rating for his administration. Of those polled, 46 percent feel 
that the Fleury administration is "average." That percentage has 
ranged from 43 percent to 49 percent. The biggest surprise was 
actually the jump of 11 percentage points (from 19 to 30 
percent) among Sao Paulo city voters who consider his 
administration "bad or very bad." 
  Fleury's rejection rating is the third largest among those 
of 
the 10 governors evaluated in the DataFolha poll. Fleury is 
outdone only by Leonel Brizola (PDT [Democratic Labor Party], 
Rio de Janeiro)--the champion, with 54 percent rating him "very 
bad"--and is technically neck to neck with Helio Garcia 
(independent, Minas Gerais), whose rejection rating was 31 
percent. 
<H5>  Magalhaes Improves, Gains on Ciro Gomes </H5>
  Two years and nine months after taking office, Ceara 
Governor 
Ciro Gomes (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]) is still in 
first place as the governor receiving the best performance 
evaluation in his state's capital, according to the DataFolha 
poll conducted in 10 capitals on 16 and 17 December. In the 
opinion of 69 percent of Fortaleza's voters, Ciro's 
administration is "very good" or "good." The second-best 
performance was that of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 
(PFL [Liberal Front Party]), whose administration was rated 
"very good" or "good" by 67 percent of those polled. 
  Although belonging to different parties, Ciro Gomes and 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes are two of the governors who have not 
spared the current federal administration their criticism. 
Another point of similarity is that they have always avoided 
attacking each other. 
  But whereas Gomes has remained at the 69-percent level--the 
same score he had in the previous poll, which evaluated the 
governors after two years and four months in office--Magalhaes 
is still climbing. The Bahia governor's popularity started 
soaring as soon as he took office. He began with a "very 
good/good" rating of 25 percent, and the curve has been moving 
almost constantly upward since then. He is up three percentage 
points since the last poll: from 64 to 67 percent. 
  Besides Gomes and Magalhaes, two other governors were 
approved by a majority: Pedro Pedrossian (PTB [Brazilian Labor 
Party], Mato Grosso do Sul) and Roberto Requiao (PMDB, Parana). 
Pedrossian had an approval rating of 54 percent, and Requiao's 
was 49 percent. 
  Five governors were rated "average" by the majority. They 
were Alceu Collares (PDT, Rio Grande do Sul), Vilson Kleinubing 
(PFL, Santa Catarina), Helio Garcia (independent, Minas Gerais), 
Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho (PMDB, Sao Paulo), and Joaquim 
Francisco (independent, Pernambuco). The ratings of two of those 
governors--Collares and Garcia--are almost unchanged from the 
previous poll. 
  The surprises in the group of "average" governors concerned 
Fleury, Joaquim Francisco, and Kleinubing. Joaquim Francisco's 
rejection rating fell dramatically--from 40 percent to 27 
percent--while his rating as "very good" or "good" rose from 16 
to 25 percent. The Pernambuco governor was rated "average" by 45 
percent of those polled in Recife. 
  Vilson Kleinubing maintained his "average" rating (a slight 
drop from 50 to 47 percent), but his administration's rejection 
rating showed a large jump. In the view of 28 percent of those 
polled in Florianopolis, the governor's term has been "very bad" 
or "bad." The figure was 20 percent in the last poll. The number 
considering his administration "very good" or "good" also fell: 
from 25 to 20 percent. 
<H5>  Brizola </H5>
  Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) is still the 
poll's rejection champion. Of those polled in the city of Rio de 
Janeiro, 54 percent say that Brizola's administration is "very 
bad." The figure is down from 59 to 54 percent, but the 
difference is almost equal to the margin of error for that city. 
  But there are indications in DataFolha's poll that the 
reaction to Brizola among his voters in the state capital is 
changing. His approval rating ("very good/good") is up from 8 to 
14 percent, and that is well above the margin of error. Despite 
that improvement, he still has the lowest approval rating of all 
the 10 governors evaluated. 
  Brizola, who is a potential candidate for president of the 
republic in this year's election, is showing signs of recovery 
in this new poll by DataFolha. Since the governor has the 
residual support of a group of voters regarded as being 
convinced Brizola supporters, it would seem that all he has to 
do is keep a low profile and he will regain the support of those 
voters.

<H5>  Understanding the Methodology </H5>
  The DataFolha poll is a survey by stratified sampling based 
on sex and age quotas. This poll, which was conducted on 16 and 
17 December, consisted of interviews with 1,076 individuals in 
Sao Paulo, 646 in Rio de Janeiro, 432 in Belo Horizonte, 432 in 
Salvador, 432 in Porto Alegre, 432 in Curitiba, 431 in 
Florianopolis, 432 in Fortaleza, 428 in Recife, and 431 in Campo 
Grande. 
  The margin of error for the sampling process is plus or 
minus 
3 percentage points in the city of Sao Paulo, 4 percentage 
points in Rio de Janeiro, and 5 percentage points in the other 
cities. 
  DataFolha is headed by sociologists Antonio Manuel Teixeira 
Mendes and Gustavo Venturi. Their assistants are Mauro Francisco 
Paulino, Emilia de Franco, and statistician Renata Nunes Cesar. 
Wilson Aganathios Chammas coordinates the opinion polls with his 
assistant Ailton Gobira. The sample was planned by Sandra Regina 
Dorgan. Solange Rodrigues handled the data processing.

  [Excerpt] The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry in no way 
authorized the departure of Major Ismael Lopez. It was only 
after he had left that the U.S. Embassy informed the Ministry 
that Lopez had departed but without specifying how, Salvadoran 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. 
In addition, Salaverria said the U.S. Embassy has been asked to 
explain how Lopez left the country. 
  Salaverria pointed out that the Foreign Ministry has no 
jurisdiction over who leaves the country and that this is the 
Immigration Department's duty. He said that, according to 
international law, Maj. Lopez, who allegedly killed bodyguard 
Crescencio Diaz, enjoys diplomatic immunity and that therefore 
he will be tried in the United States. "Maj. Lopez' diplomatic 
immunity precludes his being interrogated in El Salvador," 
Salaverria said. He also said that the Foreign Ministry had 
checked Lopez' diplomatic immunity in the Ministry's files.

  [Text] The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry released a 
communique at noon [1800 GMT] today confirming that the U.S. 
Embassy kept the Ministry abreast of the incident in which Major 
Ismael Lopez's bodyguard was killed. The document asserts that 
authorization was never requested for the U.S. officer to leave 
the country because the U.S. Embassy only kept the foreign 
minister abreast of the situation by telephone. 
  Upon confirming the incident, the U.S. Embassy promised the 
Salvadoran Foreign Ministry to prosecute the officer in 
accordance with U.S. legislation as stipulated under the Vienna 
Convention. Despite the official explanations provided by the 
U.S. Embassy, the communique states, the Salvadoran Government 
is not fully satisfied. Consequently, a letter of protest has 
been sent to the Clinton administration demanding penalties 
against the individuals who violated El Salvador's laws, 
especially its immigration laws.

  [Text] We have received the following press communique from 
the Foreign Relations Ministry which reads as follows: 
  "With respect to opinions voiced on the painful case 
involving the death of Mr. Jose Crescencio Diaz Alvarado, which 
took place this past 21 January, and in which U.S. Major Ismael 
Lopez is implicated, this Foreign Ministry would like to clarify 
the following: 
  "1. Although it is true that the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador 
did limit itself to telephonically notifying the Foreign 
Ministry on the circumstances involving the death of Mr. Diaz 
Alvarado, this Ministry hereby states that in no way was it 
requested to issue a permit in favor of Maj. Lopez, and in any 
case, it is not up to this Ministry to issue said exit permits. 
  "2. Communication between the Embassy of the United States 
of America and the Foreign Ministry was limited to a telephonic 
report on the circumstances involving the death of Mr. Diaz 
Alvarado the same morning events took place, and that since Maj. 
Lopez had diplomatic immunity, the U.S. Embassy committed itself 
to put him on trial a per U.S. laws, as stipulated by the Vienna 
Convention with respect to diplomatic relations. This Foreign 
Ministry has been able to confirm that Maj. Lopez is accredited 
as a U.S. diplomat in our country, and as such enjoys diplomatic 
immunity. Subsequently, that afternoon the U.S. Embassy once 
against contacted the Foreign Ministry to report that Maj. Lopez 
had left El Salvador in order to be put at the disposal of U.S. 
judicial authorities through a court martial. 
  "3. This Foreign Ministry in due time requested information 
from the U.S. Embassy as well as from the Salvadoran immigration 
authorities on the circumstances and procedures used by Maj. 
Lopez in abandoning the country. 
  "4. Due to the fact that explanations provided by the U.S. 
Embassy are not sufficiently satisfactory, this Foreign Ministry 
has been forced to send a protest note to the U.S. Government 
through its embassy, at the same time demanding penalties for 
those responsible for breaking El Salvador's immigration and air 
transportation laws. 
  [Issued] San Salvador, 4 Feb 1994."

<F P=106> [Report by Daisy Villalobos from the "Facing the Moment" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Salvadoran Government will lodge a formal 
protest with the U.S. Government for violating immigration 
procedures in the case of Major Ismael Lopez, President Alfredo 
Cristiani stated on 4 February. The U.S. officer, who is 
accused of killing a Salvadoran bodyguard last January, was 
taken out of the country illegally by U.S. Embassy officials who 
flew him in an aircraft to Panama. 
  On Tuesday, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Salaverria said the diplomatic mission violated the country's 
laws. [sentence as heard] Today, President Cristiani abandoned 
the foreign minister's position, and he said a protest will be 
forwarded to the U.S. Government. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] A protest will be submitted to 
the U.S. Government, because the country's immigration laws have 
been violated with the departure of Major Lopez. We cannot 
tolerate this, regardless of who has diplomatic immunity. We 
feel that our country is willing to respect all international 
laws. There was no reason why Maj. Lopez was taken out of the 
country without going through the country's immigration 
procedures. This is the statement that will be sent to the 
State Department. We are demanding that the U.S. Government, in 
keeping with international agreements, impose penalties on those 
people responsible for violating the country's immigration 
procedures. [end recording] 
  According to the president, the diplomatic mission also 
ignored a series of legal procedures with which it should have 
complied before taking the U.S. officer out of national 
territory. The head of state also said instructions have been 
issued to control the exits and entries of all types of aircraft. 
  Regarding compensation for the relatives of the victim, the 
Salvadoran president said his government has included this in 
the protest note, because the judge in charge of the case in the 
United States must be made aware of this. The U.S. Embassy has 
announced that Maj. Ismael Lopez will be tried by a military 
court in the United States. In this respect, President 
Cristiani said the government has requested the presence of a 
representative of the District Attorney's Office as an observer 
at Maj. Lopez' court-martial.

<F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa 
said Salvadoran authorities could not prevent the departure of 
U.S. Major Mike Lopez as the U.S. Embassy acted in accordance 
with the Vienna Convention, which protects diplomatic officials. 
  Although Gen. Corado deplored the murder of Salvadoran 
bodyguard Crecensio Diaz, he said that in his opinion the U.S. 
Embassy acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention articles 
that regulate diplomatic relations. Nevertheless, Corado added, 
diplomatic immunity does not mean that embassy officials cannot 
be punished according to the laws of their own countries when 
they commit a crime. 
  [Begin Corado recording] The Salvadoran Government has the 
right to remain vigilant in this case and demand from the U.S. 
Government, which represents U.S. interests, that Maj. Lopez be 
judged according to U.S. laws in an impartial trial. [end 
recording] 
  According to Corado, if Maj. Lopez left the country in a 
U.S. 
aircraft, it could not be intercepted, because the personnel and 
the infrastructure, including ground vehicles and air vessels of 
foreign missions, are also protected by diplomatic immunity. 
  [Begin Corado recording] Extraterritoriality exists in 
embassies, aircraft, or any other type of vehicle owned by the 
embassy. Therefore, whenever a foreign citizen or diplomatic 
official is aboard an embassy aircraft, car, or any type of 
vehicle, it is as if he were in his own country. [end recording] 
  On another subject, regarding the fact that many Central 
American countries are reorganizing their armies, Corado said 
that the Salvadoran Armed Forces are not opposed to changes as 
adjustments consonant with the current situation in the country 
can be made.

  [Text] The presidents of El Salvador and Colombia, Alfredo 
Cristiani and Cesar Gaviria, respectively, have backed coffee 
producers by issuing a joint statement promising to conclude the 
trade and investment agreement between both countries, 
Venezuela, and Central America and to implement it promptly. 
The leaders stated that they will continue to support the 
coffee-producing countries' efforts to permanently upgrade the 
bean's international prices. 
  Regarding their bilateral relations, the heads of state 
agreed to continue working to establish the Colombian-Salvadoran 
Commission on 24 and 25 February in San Salvador. This 
commission will allow them to formulate an effective cooperation 
program. Gaviria and Cristiani will request that the commission 
gear its work toward reaching an agreement on judicial 
cooperation and mutual legal assistance issues "so as to 
establish a common front to counter all kinds of criminal 
organizations," in reference to drug-trafficking activities. 
  The leaders agreed that factors, such as extreme poverty, 
persist and negatively hinder their countries' possibilities to 
achieve the desired socioeconomic development. In this respect, 
they expressed their support for preparation of the Social 
Development World Summit to be held in Denmark in March 1995. 
The presidents stated their conviction that full respect for 
human rights and basic liberties are an essential part of all 
democratic systems and praised the efforts made by their 
administrations in this respect. 
  The presidents underscored the importance of the Uruguayan 
Round negotiations and of the free trade agreement 
implementation between Mexico, the United States, and Canada on 
international trade. They also reaffirmed their decision to 
continue strengthening the solidarity and cooperation between 
their countries, which are fundamental to confronting the 
world's challenges and requirements.

<F P=106> [Article by Laura Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Recalling Heredia as the seed of Costa Rican 
education, Miguel Angel Gutierrez, Social Christian Unity Party 
(PUSC) presidential hopeful, announced his commitment to make 
education a priority in the country if he is elected. 
  At a public plaza gathering, which occupied the five blocks 
west of the National University (UNA), the PUSC candidate said 
education is the instrument that permitted the country to 
achieve its current living standards. 
  Rodriguez guaranteed his supporters, who waited for two and 
a 
half hours in the middle of a chilly January day, that preschool 
education will be implemented nationwide and primary education 
will be improved. In that sense he insisted that he will give 
students opportunities through student bonds and high school 
education scholarships. He vowed to strengthen this sector as 
well as education in arts and crafts schools. 
  He stressed that his administration will totally fulfill the 
financial agreement for state superior education so that 
universities and businesses can jointly carry out investigations 
that will net revenues. 
  In the area of coffee plantations, Rodriguez criticized the 
departure of former Finance Minister Fernando Naranjo, who is 
now a Liberal Party leader and who left his post because he 
refused to reduce the coffee tax. He underscored that the 
current administration, on the contrary, created the coffee fund 
for $665 million colones, which permitted 5,000 families in 
Heredia to face the international market price crisis. 
  Most of the speakers who preceded him attacked opposition 
Liberal Party candidate Jose Maria Figueres and appealed to 
honest Liberal Party members to vote for the PUSC in the coming 
elections. 
  Among the speakers who preceded Rodriguez was Gujillermo 
Chacon, candidate for province alderman; Sergio Salazar, deputy 
candidate; political leader Bernardo Benavides; former Security 
Minister Victor Emilio Herrera; former presidential candidate 
Juan Jose Trejos; Mabel Nieto, candidate for second vice 
president; and Abel Pacheco, candidate for first vice president. 
  The rally was also attended by Deputy Danilo Chaverri, 
former 
President Mario Echandi, and Lorena Clare, the presidential 
hopeful's wife.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Fuentes] </F>
  [Text] In addition to explaining that in the next elections 
voters have to choose between two platforms, Jose Maria 
Figueres, presidential candidate for the National Liberation 
Party [PLN], during a rally held last night in a public square 
in Parrita de Puntarenas, has promised to support production, 
tourism, and housing. 
  When talking to the crowd, which area residents said was 
much 
larger than the one that came to hear Oscar Arias Sanchez during 
the 1986 campaign, Figueres said: "The PLN platform is much 
different than the other party's." The PLN platform, a 
platform by which our standard of living has increased, puts us 
back on the course of progress and development, but theirs 
(Social Christian Unity Party) is the neoliberal platform, a 
platform by which the government has concentrated wealth and 
increased poverty," he said. 
  According to the PLN candidate, the Social Christians are 
talking of social programs due to the campaign, but the first 
thing they did was to dismiss cooks from school lunchrooms, 
because saving a few colones is more important to them than 
feeding hundreds of thousands of children." 
  He has told the area residents he would stimulate tourism, 
rectify the housing problem, and amend import rates to boost the 
productive sector, because "an economy car should not pay higher 
taxes than a luxury car." Others to speak at this rally were 
Mario Alvarez, Parrita candidate for deputy; Mario Charpentier, 
former public security minister; and Luis Paris, former campaign 
chief for Jose Miguel Corrales. Paris has referred to the 
unity within the PLN, saying differences were a thing of the 
past. "Today, our party is united to face the neoliberal 
politics that are threatening Costa Ricans, politics that have 
lowered our levels of health, education, and raised the cost of 
living." Figures has said the current government closed 68 
health centers in the last year alone, which led to a strong 
decline in health in rural areas. For that reason, old 
diseases, such as dengue, measles, and malaria, have reappeared, 
and we have new ones, such as cholera, he has said.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Jose Maria Figueres, 
National Liberation Party (PLN) presidential candidate, said it 
is necessary for Costa Rica to review its relations with Cuba 
within the framework of new international relations. 
  During an impromptu news conference a few hours before the 
start of this country's general elections, Figueres cited the 
need to evaluate the current state of relations between Costa 
Rica and Cuba "without deviating from the issue of human rights, 
which concerns all Costa Ricans." 
  "By respecting each country's decisions and internal 
situation, we are obligated to analyze, review this case to 
ascertain whether our position responds to current world 
realities," the presidential candidate said. 
  He dodged voicing an opinion about the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba, saying "what should concern us is our relations and 
policies toward Cuba, and that is what we are going to 
reevaluate." 
  "At any rate, I believe every country on the continent that 
still does not have relations with that nation (Cuba) should 
also review their policies," he added. 
  Figueres said "the world evolves. Nothing should remain 
static. I believe we all must evaluate the possibility of 
improving things, seeking, of course, that all our countries and 
people, including the Cuban people, may have a better future." 
  With respect to the possible reestablishment of diplomatic 
or 
consular relations during his eventual administration, the 
presidential candidate responded "first we must review our 
policies in light of world conditions; afterward, we will 
decide."

  [Text] San Jose, 6 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican polling 
stations opened at 0500 (1100 GMT) today allowing 1.8 million 
Costa Ricans to elect a new president and reelect Legislative 
Assembly and municipal authorities. 
  The voting, which will continue until 1800 (0000 GMT), began 
with absolute normalcy, a large turnout, and great enthusiasm at 
the 8,363 polling tables throughout the country. 
  Initial results will begin to be known by 2000 (0200 GMT) 
and 
shortly thereafter the winner, who will govern the country for a 
four-year period beginning 8 May, replacing Rafael Angel 
Calderon, will be announced. 
  On the eve of the elections, the two main presidential 
candidates, Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez and Social 
Democrat Jose Maria Figueres maintained a close tie, according 
to several surveys. 
  As part of the elections, besides electing a president and 
two vice presidents, Costa Ricans will reelect members to the 
Legislative Assembly, composed of 57 deputies, and authorities 
of 81 municipalities throughout the country. 
  Approximately 3,000 policemen will guarantee order during 
the 
process. All through the day and until tomorrow, a "dry law" 
banning the sale of liquor will be enforced. The restriction 
began Friday night, when electoral propaganda also stopped to 
give voters a 48-hour reflection period.

in any other activities. 
  The TSE is receiving messages from all across the country. 
People are already voting, the polling stations are open, and 
there is a good turnout at the various polls. As we have done 
in the past, we will place our homeland very high on the list of 
privileged democratic countries.

  [Text] San Jose, 6 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Channel 7 Television 
announced tonight that, according to the Victor Borge and 
Associates specialized polling firm, opposition presidential 
candidate Jose Maria Figueres has won today's elections. 
  The firm carried out its survey at 100 voting centers 
throughout the country, and the results show that Figueres -- 
the candidate of the opposition National Liberation Party (PLN) 
-- obtained 51.6 percent of the votes. The same poll shows 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez, the candidate of the ruling Social 
Christian Unity Party (PUSC), with 46.2 percent of the votes. 
  The difference of 5.4 percent (some 80,000 votes) places the 
results outside the 3-percent margin of error that Borge and 
Associates, along with similar companies such as CID-Gallup and 
Unimer, uses as a guideline. 
  The results show a clear victory for Figueres in the 
provinces of San Jose, Heredia, Cartago, and Puntarenas. They 
show a virtual tie in Alajuela, and a loss for Figueres in Limon 
and Guanacaste. The specialists say the trend continued through 
noon and it is not possible for it to change. 
  Victor Borge, the president of the polling firm, reiterated 
that the poll has a margin of error of 3 percent and added that 
the remaining five political contenders received a total of only 
2.3 percent of the votes. 
  Elections were held today in Costa Rica to chose a 
president, 
two vice presidents, 57 deputies to the Legislative Assembly, 
and 1,000 councilmen. 
  The electoral process concluded at 1800 hours (0000 GMT 7 
February), and the official results may be known at 2000 GMT.

<F P=106> [Statement by Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Costa Rican Social </F>
Christian Unity, PUSC, presidential candidate, in the Corobici 
Hotel in San Jose -- live] 
  [Text] I do not want to make the people wait any longer for 
this statement. All I was waiting for was the chance to have a 
personal communication to wish [Figueres] the greatest success. 
  The goal of this entire campaign has been a [words 
indistinct] [applause] and this continues to be our [words 
indistinct]. I wish every success for the new government in the 
coming four years because it has to do with the well-being of 
Costa Ricans. I wish and pray to God [words indistinct] our 
goal is that every Costa Rican should have greater well-being 
[words indistinct]. This continues to be [words indistinct]. I 
therefore pray to God and all Costa Ricans that we rally around 
the national flag and help this country come out ahead in the 
best possible way. Our goal is that all of you should enjoy the 
best possible standard of living. [applause] 
  I want to thank you first of all; you, the people who paid 
me 
the great honor of voting for me and those who did not vote for 
me. I thank you all. For many months you allowed me the 
privilege of walking these streets [words indistinct]. I 
received the affection of those who support and supported me. 
[Words indistinct] I thank all of you. [applause] 
  What is there to say about the leaders of this extraordinary 
party? They all gave me their heartfelt support [words 
indistinct] when it seemed as if there was not the slightest 
chance for this campaign to achieve as important results as we 
have received. When the going got tough, they supported me, 
they gave me their dreams, hopes, we shared pains [words 
indistinct]. For all of you I [words indistinct]. [applause] 
  Those who lead the campaign, those who worked in the cantons 
or in the neighboring circuit districts [passage indistinct]. 
For all of you my sincerest appreciation. I am sure the 
fatherland and God will appreciate this. This campaign is a 
campaign of [word indistinct]. It is a campaign of great 
ideals, a campaign that has called for us to be better, a 
campaign that has called on us to act in solidarity with others. 
This has been a campaign that asks us to (?follow the good 
example of the great Costa Rican institutions). [applause] 
  I am convinced that all of us who supported this great 
campaign have not done so in vain because today many Costa 
Ricans understand better the need to work for their own 
improvement and the [words indistinct]. This has made the 
campaign worth it. 
  There are so many people I should mention, but I will not 
mention them because I would always run the risk of leaving 
someone's name out. I would like to mention one person. I want 
to shower on this person all the affection, all the gratitude, 
all the emotion that I feel for all the people in this marvelous 
country. I want to thank all of you through my wife Lorena. 
[applause] 
  Lorena has been an extraordinary companion. She went much 
further than what seemed physically possible for a human being. 
The endless work, the toughest tasks, the greatest affection 
for all party leaders. My office became, during the difficult 
moments, the living room where practically everyone sought 
advice, consolation, and encouragement. She is the reflection 
of our belief in women's struggle; she is the reflection of our 
endearment for all Costa Ricans. In her I see the work of my 
children, my relatives, the work by the campaign directors, work 
by canton leaders, the work of those who were in the schools 
today, the work of those in charge of transportation, the work 
of those who acted as receptionists and guides throughout the 
country; the work of all Social Christians and all Costa Ricans. 
[applause] When I give Lorena a big kiss to thank her for her 
dedication I am thanking all Costa Ricans. 
  The country must continue united toward progress. We have 
accomplished a great task. I hope that President-elect Mr. Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen chooses the best group, that he will go 
down the path of good, have the wisdom to distinguish what is 
good for Costa Rica and what is good (?for the people) who 
require our government's support and solidarity. I wish all 
Costa Ricans to join us tonight to pray to God to bless Costa 
Rica. God bless Costa Rica! [applause]

  [Text] San Jose, 6 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican President-elect 
Jose Maria Figueres promised today to form a government "for 
those in greater need," encourage health and social welfare 
programs, and establish a family basket that will protect 
workers wages. 
  In his first statements following his victory in the Sunday 
elections, Figueres, a 39-year-old engineer and businessman 
stated that Costa Rica must "conduct itself intelligently" in 
confronting the challenges of the world economy. He insisted on 
the need to encourage technological development as well as 
promote competition among productive enterprise. The new 
president promised to encourage small businesses and to continue 
promoting a process of industrial modernization in Costa Rica. 
  Figueres refused to talk about his plans for the first 100 
days of his administration and said that his task will be 
oriented to the four years of his government which is scheduled 
to being on 8 May. He reiterated his commitment to control 
increases in the cost of living with the establishment of a 
"modern family basket." 
  The president-elect added that his administration will 
double 
housing programs, stress preventive health programs, and reopen 
health clinics in the rural areas which were closed by the 
current Social Christian government of President Rafael 
Calderon. He indicated that he will further plans to raise the 
quality of education, include a second language in the primary 
and secondary school programs as well as promote sports 
activities.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (AFP) -- Today, Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bern Niehaus expressed his support for the OAS to be in 
charge of organizing an American summit scheduled for next 
November to strengthen this organization and discuss North-South 
cooperation. 
  Niehaus, who appears to be a favorite in the March elections 
for the position of OAS secretary general, said that the time 
has come for the OAS to become a center for discussing the 
problems facing the continent. During a meeting with foreign 
media correspondents, Niehaus noted that "the OAS should play a 
leading role in solving problems facing the region and should 
advocate greater North-South cooperation." 
  In a clear reference to Fidel Castro's government, Niehaus 
stated that only "democratic countries" should participate in 
the American summit, which was originally called by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. Although he favors seeking a negotiated 
solution in Cuba to "pave the way for democracy and promote 
respect for human rights," Niehaus emphasized that he does not 
approve of Cuban government delegates attending the summit. 
Niehaus pointed out that "there are other mechanisms that can be 
used to solve the Cuban issue because no one in his right mind 
could favor bloodshed in that nation." 
  Niehaus, who in the past criticized the government of 
Alberto 
Fujimori, said that he would favor Peru's participation in the 
summit because "there has been sufficient evidence of a return 
to democracy." 
  In addition, Niehaus rejected any changes in Costa Rica's 
foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Report by William Cespedes from the Presidential Palace; </F>
from the "Radio Reloj Newscast;" -- live] 
  [Text] President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier says that 
satisfactory progress is being made in negotiations with Mexico 
for a free trade agreement. Yesterday afternoon Calderon talked 
with his Mexican colleague Carlos Salinas de Gortari on the 
phone. We need to tie up certain aspects related to the field 
of agriculture, even though President Calderon says that both 
Mexico and Costa Rica have partially yielded to arrive at an 
agreement, which should be the case in any negotiation. 
  The sugar topic was resolved at the beginning of the week. 
There have also been agreements on the topic of meat, which 
only leaves pending dairy products and derivatives as well as 
other agricultural products of great demand in the Mexican 
market. President Calderon added: 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] All this is very important in 
our negotiations with Mexico. I had the opportunity to talk 
with President Salinas; he in turn spoke to his minister. I did 
the same with [Economy and Industry] Minister [Roberto] Rojas. 
Thus, any minor differences that could possibly remain, 
especially with industrial products, could be solved if we all 
give in a little. 
  Minister Rojas feels very optimistic. He has scheduled the 
last work session with Don Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican commerce 
and industrial development secretary, for 14 February -- the 
last meeting at the ministerial level. We expect white smoke to 
emerge and enable us to announce a new treaty. 
  The topic of agriculture, which is being studied by the 
deputy agriculture ministers, is pending. Our deputy 
agriculture minister was in Mexico. I am waiting for a meeting 
next week between [Agriculture and Livestock] Minister [Juan] 
Lizano and Professor [Carlos] Hank Gonzalez, Mexican agriculture 
and hydraulic resources secretary, to reach a final agreement on 
the topic of agriculture. I feel very optimistic. I believe 
that we have now moved ahead substantially and it is very 
possible that we can have the draft ready in February. 
  [Cespedes] In what specific areas in the industrial field 
did 
Costa Rica give in? 
  [Calderon] No, it is not that we gave in. Well, all of us 
have yielded a little. Since formal talks began three years ago 
both Mexico and Costa Rica have yielded a bit from their 
original stance. This is normal for any negotiation between two 
sides. If both sides had chosen to remain inflexible, we would 
have never been able to reach an agreement. 
  [Cespedes] [question indistinct] 
  [Calderon] This is precisely where a very satisfactory 
formula has emerged; we are just waiting for Mexico to ratify it. 
  [Cespedes] What is the formula? The meat topic? 
  [Calderon] The sugar topic is practically resolved. This 
leaves only the meat and dairy products. The reports I have 
seem to indicate that the meat topic is practically resolved. 
Anyway, these are the details that I am precisely expecting to 
receive from the agriculture minister with an updated report. 
[end recording] 
  President Calderon expects to sign the free trade agreement 
with Mexico before the end of March. This treaty will allow 
Costa Rica to penetrate a market of 90 million inhabitants where 
most Costa Rican agricultural products are very well accepted 
and are much in demand, which will in turn benefit the Costa 
Rican economy.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 5 Feb (Notimex) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio denied rumors related to a 
possible coup by military officers dissatisfied with current 
Defense Minister Mario Enriquez. 
  According to de Leon, the democratic process in Guatemala is 
going through a period of great consolidation and stipulated 
that he has not been requested to remove the defense minister, 
whom he considers to be one of his most trusted allies. 
  Local radio stations, citing confidential sources, reported 
that a group of military officers "dissatisfied with Enriquez' 
management style had called for his dismissal or there would be 
a coup during the next few days." 
  The radio reports contrast sharply with the calm in the 
streets adjacent from the presidential palace and the government 
house where security measures remain normal.

  [Text] For the first time ever, Defense Minister General 
Mario Rene Enriquez Morales admitted yesterday that the Army has 
always opposed the establishment of a Truth Commission because 
it considers that such a commission would be used for actions of 
revenge instead of to reconcile the Guatemalan people. 
  Enriquez Morales, who participated in the Peace Commission 
for two years, said the talks have always had this objective as 
their sole purpose and that the Truth Commission, which he 
called "the vengeance commission," would only polarize society 
further. 
  He added: The formation of this commission has always been 
opposed, and I will tell you why. We object to it because it 
will attempt to open the wounds of events that occurred in 1980, 
1981, and 1982, and this would not help the country at all but, 
quite the contrary, would promote confrontation. 
  The defense minister concluded: We would accept the 
formation 
of a commission, but of real truth and not the one you formed 
because, in this case, the actions are aimed against the Army 
and the government in general, because the clandestine guerrilla 
would not be identifiable. [sentence as published]

  [Text] Panama's relations with Cuba and Peru have not 
deteriorated, "but no great steps have been taken to improve 
ties with these two nations, either," Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino noted yesterday, adding that he trusts relations will be 
fully restored before he leaves office. 
  Mulino explained that bilateral relations with Cuba "have 
not 
been broken or suspended," adding that contacts with the Cuban 
Government are continuing even though Panama does not have an 
ambassador in that country. Mulino said, "Relations are very 
friendly, and there are no reasons for them to become marred." 
  Relations between Panama and Cuba cooled off because of 
differences that emerged following the 20 December 1989 U.S. 
invasion of Panama, an action that put an end to the military 
government that had remained in power for 21 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmen Elida Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the opposition party Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD] announced they will form an alliance 
with the Liberal Republican Party and the Labor Party [Pala]. 
According to PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, this alliance will be the great coalition against 
hunger, unemployment, and mismanagement. 
  Balladares stated: "I believe the great alliance will be one 
against hunger, unemployment, neglect, and government 
inefficiency, and the alliance is already formed." 
  At a meeting of the National Directorate, some 296 PRD 
members approved their party's alliance with Pala and the 
Liberal Party and confirmed their support for the presidential 
ticket headed by Perez Balladares with Tomas Gabriel Altamirano 
Duque and Felipe Virzi as first and second vice presidents, 
respectively. 
  Perez Balladares criticized Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya 
de Gruber's and former comptroller general Ruben Dario Carles' 
programs. Carles is supported by the Civic Renewal Party, 
Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], and the 
National Renewal Movement [Morena]. Balladares argued the two 
tickets reflect "the official state of affairs and contain the 
same proposals but in different packages." 
  Perez Balladares, who did not reject the possibility of 
other 
nonofficial groups joining his alliance before 8 February, said: 
"It is not a matter of sharing the cake, but of sharing an idea, 
a program. It is a matter of reaching an agreement as to the 
basis for a program." 
  Perez Balladares criticized candidates such as Carles, de 
Gruber, and Arias Calderon, who "live in and cling to the past" 
and who "will blatantly fail in 1994" when the problems and 
situations have changed. 
  The PRD's directorate reiterated its support for mayoral, 
legislator, and alternate-legislator candidates nominated by its 
new allies. 
  Meanwhile, Pala, which also held its political convention 
yesterday, restated its decision to form an alliance with the 
PRD and the Liberal Republican Party, and nominated the Perez 
Balladares-Altamirano-Virzi presidential ticket. 
  Pala President Carlos Lopez Guevara pointed out that 
although 
Pala is not represented on the presidential ticket, all the 
members support a "Torrijist alliance" to reach power together 
next May. 
  At its convention yesterday, the Republican Liberal Party 
unanimously supported the alliance and presidential ticket led 
by Perez Balladares.

  [Text] Yesterday the Solidarity Party announced its 
presidential ticket. It is headed by Samuel Lewis Galindo, a 
businessman. The party also authorized its national directorate 
to negotiate an electoral alliance to face the upcoming 8 May 
elections. 
  The Solidarity Party held its convention at the Atlapa 
Convention Center. The other members of the presidential ticket 
are Carlos Clement as the first vice presidential candidate and 
Marisin Villalaz de Arias as the second vice presidential 
candidate. In his acceptance speech, Lewis Galindo promised more 
jobs, better education, and renegotiation of the foreign debt. 
  The Solidarity conventioneers also agreed to authorize the 
party's national directorate to negotiate before 8 February -- 
the deadline established by the Electoral Tribunal for engaging 
in alliances -- a possible political alliance with other 
parties. According to Villalaz de Arias, the Solidarity Party is 
talking with the National Unity Mission and the Papa Egoro 
Movement about the possibility of an alliance. The presidential 
ticket can be changed to adjust to the results of negotiations, 
a source said. 
  Meanwhile, at the Doctrinal Panamenista Party [Partido 
Panamenist Doctrinario -- PD] convention, Jose Salvador Munoz 
was nominated as the presidential candidate. The nominee for 
first vice president is Rodrigo Bernal, and the nomination for 
second vice president went to Julia Suria. In his acceptance 
speech, Munoz described his party as the third force and the 
best option. According to him, the oligarchy that governed the 
country during the past three years and the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party and its allies, who represent 21 years of 
"military dictatorship and repression," must be discarded. 
  According to reports from the Electoral Tribunal, 1.5 
million 
Panamanians, out of a population of 2.5 million, have been 
called to participate in the general elections in May. According 
to authorities, these will be the first democratic elections 
ever to take place.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The Honduran Journalists Association 
(CPH) yesterday ordered accredited professional journalists to 
abandon the Presidency as a new way to show President Reina that 
they deserve respect. 
  This resolution, which EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS will honor 
and support, is a result of the very bad treatment journalists 
have received not only from [Presidential Private Secretary] 
Lucio Izaguirre, but also from President Reina, who labeled us 
as "money changers." The following is the official communique 
issued by the CPH Board of Directors. 
<H5>  Communique No. 1 </H5>
  The CPH Board of Directors orders all affiliates, members, 
and licensed students who cover the Presidency to immediately 
cease all news coverage related to Presidential House activities. 
  This measure will be in effect until the corresponding 
authorities negotiate with the CPH to allow journalists who 
cover the Presidential House to return within a framework of 
dignity and responsibility. The problem will not be solved in 
an atmosphere of luncheons and dinners as has been irresponsibly 
suggested. 
  [Signed] The Board of Directors

Revolutionary Party [PRD], escaped without injuries Friday night 
from an attack, during which a person accompanying him, Melania 
Lora, received a bullet wound in her left leg. 
  Lora, the leader of the Education Department of the

Pena Gomez, senate candidate Milagros Ortiz Bosch, and she were 
participating in a march in Maquiteria, a densely populated east 
Santo Domingo neighborhood. She explained that the three had 
been in a vehicle. When they stepped out to initiate a walk in 
favor of the PRD, rocks were thrown at them from the roof of a 
nearby building and shots were heard. 
  Lora affirmed that she was wounded because she was beside 
the 
presidential candidate and that the attack was directed against 
him.

  [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (EFE and TELAM-SNI) -- The Argentine 
Embassy in Yugoslavia has denied that Argentina sent weapons to 
the Bosnian Muslims, as charged by the Serbian press, which, in 
turn, based its information on a VOA broadcast. 
  "The Committee for the Control of Sensitive Exports and 
Weapons has never permitted the sale of weapons to the countries 
of the former Yugoslavia based on the fact that Argentina 
strictly respects the UN resolution that prohibits such 
activities," states the communique from the Argentine Embassy in 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  To avoid the spread of war in the Balkans, the United 
Nations 
prohibited, in September 1991, the sale of weapons to the 
parties at war. However, during the eight months of the war in 
Croatia and the 22 months of confrontations in Bosnia, the 
Croatian forces and the Bosnian Muslims have clandestinely 
obtained weapons to fight against the powerful Army of 
Yugoslavia, a country which is currently made up of the 
Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and which inherited the 
military arsenal from the government of Belgrade when the 
Republic of Yugoslavia was dismembered. 
  The Argentine Embassy note refers to a commentary by U.S. 
military expert Paul Beaver transmitted by the U.S. radio 
station which included Argentina in a list of countries that 
supplied weapons to the Muslim forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
openly violating the embargo imposed by the United Nations to 
prevent the worsening of the Balkan conflict.

  [Text] Mexico City, 2 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Military authorities 
have said there were no "bombings" in the confrontation with the 
armed group in the Mexican southeastern state of Chiapas, and 
they rejected media reports alluding to such alleged actions. 
  The National Defense Secretariat stated: "The reported 
`bombings' never took place, and the proof of this is that there 
is not any evidence of such actions" in the conflict area. The 
Secretariat pointed out that the effects of aerial bombs cannot 
be hidden because of the degree of destruction they would cause 
on any type of terrain, "particularly in populated areas." 
  Military authorities assigned to the conflict zone have 
taken 
journalists to places where, according to media reports, the Air 
Force had "bombed the civilian population," and the journalists 
were able to confirm that nothing of that sort had occurred. 
  In a communique, the Secretariat discussed the actions 
conducted by the Air Force during the confrontation with the 
armed group. All military actions were suspended entirely on 12 
January following the cease-fire ordered by President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari. 
  The Secretariat indicated that the Air Force's planes and 
helicopters carried out reconnaissance and meteorological 
flights, transportation of personnel, and shipment of provisions 
to soldiers and civilians, in addition to rescue and evacuation 
operations in isolated areas. The Secretariat also noted that 
the Air Force provided "direct support to soldiers in 
unpopulated areas by opening machine-gun fire and by firing 
rockets in efforts to combat pincer and ambush operations" set 
up by the armed group against military personnel. 
  Military authorities indicated that by reiterating these 
statements issued on 11 January, they seek to reject any 
references to presumed "bombings" and "heavy activity by 
military airplanes." 
  The communique stated that: "With these statements, the 
National Defense Secretariat rejects categorically and strongly 
the occurrence of any `bombings' in the Chiapas conflict, 
attacks in populated areas or attempts to damage personal 
property." 
  The situation in the conflict area has become relatively 
calm 
and favorable because a direct dialogue appears "imminent" 
between Chiapas Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the 
so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army, which began the 
conflict on 1 January.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Verisimo from Planalto Palace] </F>
  [Text] The committee that will investigate corruption in 
the executive branch was installed this morning in Planalto 
Palace. The committee, which was created last December through a 
decree, is headed by Federal Administration Secretary Romildo 
Canhim and made up of seven society representatives. The 
committee must investigate all the charges of corruption inside 
the Executive Branch. 
  Minister Romildo Canhim already has created an executive 
secretariat made up of several technical subgroups: personnel, 
budget, internal control, legislation, bids, and contracts. The 
starting point will be the Budget CPI's [Congressional 
Investigative Committee] final report, which actually prompted 
the creation of this new committee. The committee will 
investigate the involvement of Executive Branch employees in the 
budget mafia. 
  Minister Romildo Canhim said the committee will have to 
suggest legislative measures or other government actions to 
correct the mechanisms that currently exist within the public 
administration and that have been promoting corruption: 
  [Begin recording, in progress] ...as of today, a real 
picture, an X-ray, of the public administration system of 
authorizing funds. We must close the windows that favor 
corruption. [end recording] 
  The committee will send quarterly reports to President 
Itamar 
Franco to report on the status of the investigations. The 
committee is made up of professor Candido Mendes de Almeida, 
lawyer Daniel Quintela Brandao, businessman Emerson Kapaz, 
former Justices Evandro Gueiros Leite and Miguel Jeronimo 
Ferrante, retired Division General Francisco Batista de Torres 
Mello, and Modesto Cavalhosa, president of the Brazilian 
Attorneys Association's ethics court.

group of peasants from Tava'i Borda who are allegedly involved 
in guerrilla activities in the area. The attorney general has 
lodged a formal protest before the court against the peasants on 
charges of illegal association for criminal purposes, and for 
perpetrating crimes against persons and the security of the 
state. [passage omitted] 
  The report adds that in the Tava'i Borda II area, groups of 
peasants are allegedly armed with guns, including submachine 
guns. 
  The alleged leaders of the guerrilla group have been 
identified as Elvio Benitez and Venancio Zeballos. They 
reportedly persecute those who disagree with them and 
indoctrinating the rest to engage in unlawful practices in the 
area, such as stealing cattle and the illegal lumber trade.

<F P=106> [Report by Mauricio Martinez S.] </F>
  [Text] A fierce battle is being fought by the two sides, 
which remain scoreless with only 10 minutes remaining in the 
game, and they zealously seek the weapon that will allow them to 
gain the final victory. 
  Upon their return from the Christmas truce, the National 
Liberation Party (PLN) and Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) 
are in the home stretch, aware of the close [poll] results and 
difficult battle they face. Their propaganda strategies to 
achieve this differ and in the case of the Social Democrats, 
perhaps, is more reactive. 
  The Social Christians, who announced a strong campaign 
against PLN candidate Jose Maria Figueres since late 1993, have 
fulfilled their pledge. They renewed reports about the 
opposition leader's alleged involvement in certain 
irregularities and, in certain cases, they revealed some new 
ones. 
  The PLN launched a campaign under the slogan "The Safe Way," 
based on promises of social welfare and the party's principles. 
However, the ruling party's harassment reportedly provoked a 
drastic change in the PLN's preliminary strategy. 
  This is gleaned from a propaganda analysis prepared for this 
newspaper by specialists Victor Flury, Victor Ramirez, and Jose 
Alberto Ramirez. The analysis covered the period 2-10 January 
and studied 23 different ads in newspapers and 35 television 
spots. This is the sixth report on political propaganda, and the 
experts have added their reviews of other issues, including 
public speeches, debates, and polls. 
  Referring to the last three weeks, the analysts predict the 
PUSC will continue to attack Figueres; it will strengthen some 
campaign promises; and it will give a triumphant-reflexive 
feeling to its messages. 
  PLN members, they predict, will continue to proclaim the 
party's victory, extol the polls which give them the advantage, 
and exert themselves to deal a psychological-political blow: 
Former President Oscar Arias' eventual participation in 
proselytization activities. 
  Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez believe the resumption of the 
electoral battle in January provoked a national debate on 
whether the parties were carrying out a dirty campaign (mutual 
accusations) or a confrontation of ideas. 
  According to predictions included in the previous report, 
which was published on 29 December, the PUSC attacked Figueres 
with strong moral and business charges. Moral issues involving 
the candidate's actions prevailed. Hence the slogan "Careful 
with Figueres Olsen, there are problems wherever he goes." This 
was followed by messages on Figueres' recent involvement, 
according to the Attorney General's Office, in a possible 
embezzlement with bonds and mines, as well as the removal of 
seven Telenews journalists from Channel 7, reportedly a result 
of pressure exerted by PLN leaders. 
  According to the three professionals' analysis, PLN 
reportedly reviewed two scenarios in December to counter the 
ruling party's attacks: 
  A) Launch a January campaign reviewing ideas and programs, 
but -- given the PUSC's onslaught -- argue they had no other 
choice but to launch a counterattack. 
  B) Opt for a positive campaign because party leaders figure 
the people are tired of attacks. Nevertheless, given the 
strength of the Social Christians' charges, a fierce internal 
discussion took place and the decision adopted was to change 
strategy lest the adversary's blows undermine its support. 
  Nevertheless, two days after PUSC presidential candidate 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez' attacks, the PLN went on the offensive 
by reporting the manipulation of poor people and an apparent 
purchase of votes. Also, it terms as slander and dirty campaign 
what was reported by the PUSC. The PLN launched a series called 
"We cannot vote for Miguel Angel," recalling alleged 
irregularities in the distribution of taxi license plates, the 
sale of high school diplomas, and the use of construction 
material. Nevertheless, the analysts believe these actions have 
no influence on voters and they claim those were "isolated 
events" of no importance that "will not directly affect the 
party or the candidate." 
  In fact, when comparing the type of charges made by the PUSC 
and the PLN, Flury, Ramirez, and Rodriguez say those of the 
latter will have a lesser impact. 
  The two parties are criticized because they planned 
propaganda messages in a general way, without taking into 
consideration the characteristics of the press or television. 
  The TSE [Supreme Electoral Tribunal] deserves a special 
mention in all this. Ramirez believes it played an exaggerated 
role that was totally uncalled for. One specific example: its 
fruitless efforts to stop the parties from attacking each other. 
Analysts believe the TSE's frequent prohibitions have limited 
the debate and confrontation of ideas. 
  Generally speaking, the three specialists believe the PLN 
strategy mainly intends to depict Miguel Angel as a threat by 
stereotyping him as a neoliberal. They think the concept is not 
necessarily understood by most of the population. Social 
Democrats will reportedly offer the voters a party with 
experience, achievements, and a security tradition that, 
according to them, is guaranteed by every PLN government. 
Likewise, they predict that, in the end, undecided voters will 
give more importance to issues such as a government team and 
party tradition rather than honesty. 
  It is believed the green-white party's strategy is guided by 
the incentive-reply concept given the Social Christians' 
actions. In addition, the analysts emphasize the fact that, 
even though Carlos Espinach is in charge of the PLN campaign, he 
is unknown by voters, reticent, and totally out of contact with 
the media. 
  Referring to the PUSC's strategy, experts observe a tendency 
to present its candidate with more vehemence and firmness than 
in the recent past. Furthermore, they say Social Christians 
will try to send voters the message that Figueres is a person 
who cannot be trusted to rule a country, particularly due to the 
moral and business charges he has faced. The ruling party's 
strategists also believe undecided voters will eventually choose 
the most honest candidate rather than the one who offers more 
benefits to the people.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal Sanchez has 
announced the Nicaraguan Government rejects the U.S. State 
Department's report on human rights and other topics of national 
life regarding our reality. The Nicaraguan foreign minister said 
a note will be sent very soon to the U.S. Government rejecting 
the report. 
  [Begin recording] [Leal] We believe the report is not fair. 
We find the report unacceptable. It reports things that occurred 
in the past, but it tends to imply there is a systematic policy 
of human rights violations in our country. We find reports by 
Amnesty International and other organizations are more objective 
in their analysis. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] Does the Nicaraguan Government 
reject 
the part of the report which says that military authorities are 
not under civilian control? 
  [Leal] Well, basically, we cannot accept that either. You 
have heard and read the president's speech from 2 December 1993. 
What we are trying to do here is institutionalize and 
professionalize the Armed Forces. In fact, very soon the 
executive branch will be sending the Legislative Assembly a 
draft law on the military organization process and social 
security for the military. 
  [Reporter] Does this mean relations with the United States 
are not good? Why has the White House drafted a report which 
says human rights are being violated in Nicaragua? 
  [Leal] I do not think relations with the United States will 
sour because of the report. We do not agree with the report. We 
are not saying violations have stopped. Unfortunately, there are 
still cases of human rights violations in our country. The 
government is completely convinced and determined, however, to 
ensure strict respect for human rights. 
  [Reporter] Will the government take steps to reject the 
report? 
  [Leal] We are drafting a response to the document, 
certainly. 
What [U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American 
Affairs] Mr. Watson has said in the past few months is 
completely different from what the State Department is saying 
now. This document, which you should have, relates the cases 
that occurred in 1993. It refers, for instance, to 
confrontations between recontras and recompas. It refers to 
clashes between Sandinists and non-Sandinists, which we all know 
have occurred in the rural areas of our country. This does not 
mean, however, that the government wants these things to happen.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Text] Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 
presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles has advocated the 
creation of special commissions to investigate the scandal with 
the Social Security Fund's (CSS) housing projects, the National 
Financial Corporation's (COFINA) operations, and the Van Dam 
Bridge project. 
  According to the former comptroller general, the 
recommendations that the Directorate for the Recovery of State 
Property (DRP) made to the Legislative Assembly must be made 
again. These recommendations found no fertile ground before and 
were rejected. In a document entitled, "The Position of 
Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles With Regard to 
Corruption," the Molirena politician explains his views about 
the creation of commissions to speed up the cases on dealings 
investigated by the Comptroller's Office and the DRP. 
  Carles also recommended adopting legislation concerning 
seized funds. These funds should be deposited at the National 
Bank and used to finance social projects. With regard to legal 
matters, Carles proposed profound changes to the penal and 
judicial codes. As to the Fiscal Code, he maintained that it 
must be modified in the area that pertains to contracts in which 
the public sector is a party. 
  He also proposed serious regulation of the civil service 
system to improve bureaucracy. According to Carles, corruption 
does not only mean stealing but providing bad service. 
  Concerning the administration of justice, Carles noted that 
since the outset of the democratic government in December 1989 
the Attorney General's Office has experienced a continuous 
crisis, one that "reached a climax with the investigation, 
trial, and ruling on the case of former Attorney General Rogelio 
Cruz. However, this did not end the crisis at the Attorney 
General's Office. This government office is safeguarding dozens 
of millions of dollars linked to drug trafficking or money 
laundering without making any progress in the investigations 
that are to lead to the respective trials," he stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Vasquez] </F>
  [Text] Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Armed Forces commander in 
chief, stated that the jeering received by the Armed Forces 
Superior Council at the National Stadium was a demonstration of 
the freedom and democracy in Honduras. 
  "Logically, interested parties manipulated the masses to do 
this. If you study psychology you will see that people can 
easily be prompted to do such things. Honestly, it is nothing 
more than a reflection of the democracy achieved in this 
country," he added. 
  Discua Elvir also denied that this is an attitude shared by 
Hondurans in general. "The population does not just consist of 
people in Tegucigalpa. There are 5 million inhabitants in this 
country, and there were only approximately 15,000 people at the 
stadium. They do not represent the entire country." 
  He said that what has most affected the institution's image 
are the mistakes committed by the military in the past. "As 
responsible persons, we must face the challenge. We must never 
look back, and we must continue on." Discua Elvir explained that 
in Honduras "we must look for what is best. A great future is 
envisioned for the country. Dr. Reina was very clear in his 
inaugural speech when establishing the rules of the game, so let 
us hope that the people support him." He stressed that people 
must pay attention to the last part of the president's speech, 
when he said that "united people can solve their problems." 
  The chief of the Armed Forces expressed that he does not 
feel 
like people showed disrespect for him. "I think it was a very 
well organized demonstration. This is not the first time this 
kind of action has taken place." 
  Discua Elvir regretted this kind of demonstration, however. 
He added that it divides the Honduran people because "the 
members of the institution are part of society; they have 
children and other relatives; no matter what, we are part of the 
Honduran family." Consequently, he said that "if we begin this 
government with division in the family, I think we will not go 
anywhere." 
  Discua Elvir asserted that he hopes the people do not leave 
President Reina alone and that in the next few days he can 
consolidate part of what he has said. Concerning the promise 
made by Reina during his campaign on the application of a 
military education service, Discua Elvir revealed that the Armed 
Forces are "absolutely ready. We have reviewed our system and 
determined that it is too costly. It would be more suited for a 
developed country." He explained that countries such as Mexico 
and South American nations do not use a system like this for 
youngsters to fulfill this citizens' duty. However, he added 
that Honduras cannot be the first Latin American country to 
implement such a system. "As we are a very cultured and 
educated people, it is going to turn out alright," he said in a 
sarcastic tone. 
  Regarding the possibility of eliminating the position he 
holds, Discua Elvir remarked that he has not heard such a thing. 
Nonetheless, he said that in other countries information is 
being sought, while "here it is being taken away." [sentence as 
published] "I have no problem with that," he continued. He 
stated that if the post of chief of the Armed Forces is 
eliminated, the defense minister would have to assume his post. 
  He noted he has some ideas on the police and the country's 
defense that he will present to President Reina. "We are 
advancing in keeping with Latin America's political reality. 
Let us hope it all turns out alright and Hondurans can 
reconcile with themselves, which is so much needed." 
  Gen. Discua Elvir concluded that many new reforms could be 
implemented during the present presidential period.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Feb (EFE) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria has said the presence of the U.S. 
soldiers in Colombian territory does not violate the country's 
Constitution, because there is no transit of troops and their 
mission is to provide technical assistance and do engineering 
work. 
  Gaviria, in a letter sent to the State Council, which has 
asked him for explanations, has said the presence of U.S. 
military personnel on the Pacific Coast and in the eastern 
plains is in accordance with international treaties that have 
been formally accepted by Colombia in the past. 
  In a long document, Gaviria rehashes the legal evolution of 
the international law and the Colombian legislation, saying the 
operations of mutual defense and military assistance do not 
require authorization from the Senate or State Council. 
  Gaviria refers to the work by the U.S. soldiers at the beach 
town of Juanchaco (Valle Del Cauca Department), where they are 
building a school, a medical center, and a road, and in Puerto 
Lopez (Meta Department), where they are building a river port. 
  "The U.S. soldiers are not in the country to execute warlike 
activities against third parties," but their presence is in 
accordance with agreements for technical cooperation to supply 
logistic support so that the Colombian authorities may fight 
crime, he adds.

  [Text] Ernesto Samper, the Liberal Party presidential 
hopeful with the best chances of winning the election, is ready 
to fight against the presence of U.S. soldiers in Juan Chaco. 
  When referring to the presence of U.S. troops in Juan Chaco, 
Ernesto Samper Pizano said President Cesar Gaviria allowed the 
U.S. Government to pull a fast one on him. During a visit to 
Buenaventura in Valle del Cauca Department, Samper said the 
gringos are better tourists than builders of schools, and he 
added that, if elected president of Colombia, he would not allow 
the nation's sovereignty to be violated in this way. 
  [Begin Samper recording] We do not need foreign soldiers to 
build schools or roads, much less in this region where we have 
twice as much unemployment as the rest of the country. What we 
need are public works projects that put our own people to work. 
I believe the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry has 
pulled a fast one on President Gaviria. [end recording] 
  Samper also said there is a need to integrate the Pacific 
region into the nation's development plans.

  [Text] A wave of terrorist attacks in Medellin on 3 
February has caused property damage but no fatalities or 
injuries. Authorities attribute the attacks to urban guerrillas. 
  Colonel Daniel Peralta, subcommander of the Medellin 
Metropolitan Police, said four bombs exploded during the day and 
three were deactivated in a wave of attacks perpetrated by 
guerrilla commandos against U.S. companies. Col. Peralta said 
the attacks were made on a stationery store, two educational 
centers, and a construction site near a bus terminal. 
  "The bombs, each made with 3 kg of dynamite, exploded at an 
English language school, a German language school, and a travel 
agency. Two other bombs were deactivated at the Citibank and 
Diner's Club main offices," Col. Peralta reported. 
  He added that the most serious incident occurred at the "El 
Ancla" stationery store, located in downtown Medellin, where the 
explosion started a fire causing damage estimated at 20 million 
pesos. 
  According to reports, the blast caused millions of dollars 
in 
property damage due to shattered windows and glass doors and a 
fire, which started in one of the offices that was attacked, but 
there were no fatalities. 
  "The attacks were perpetrated by guerrilla commandos 
protesting the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia," Col. 
Peralta said. Authorities attribute the bomb attacks to 
guerrillas from the Army of National Liberation and the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which declared U.S. 
companies and citizens living in Colombia military targets to 
protest the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia. 
  Currently, there are 249 U.S. soldiers in Colombia working 
on 
humanitarian and social assistance projects, training programs, 
and the installation of radars for the fight against drug 
trafficking. 
  The largest group, 156 soldiers, are building a school, a 
hospital, and a road in the town of Juanchaco, in Valle del 
Cauca Department. The other units are constructing a military 
base in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department. 
  A week ago, rebels blew up two Mormon churches and a Coca 
Cola plant in the city of Bucaramanga, and kidnapped two 
missionaries in eastern Colombia.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Feb (DPA) -- A commando unit 
of the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
has claimed responsibility for the latest terrorist escalation 
that took place this morning in the northwestern Colombian city 
of Medellin. 
  The subversives sent a clandestine communique to Medellin 
radio stations, justifying the planting of explosives at U.S. 
facilities to reject the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia. 
  Four bombs exploded at Citibank branches and at an English 
academy in several Medellin locations. Meanwhile, the police 
defused three other explosive devices. 
  The FARC said the presence of U.S. soldiers harms Colombian 
interests; thus, it is exerting pressure for their immediate 
departure. 
  About 250 U.S. soldiers are building bases in Puerto Lopez, 
Meta Department, and in Araracuara, Amazonas Department, to 
detect drug traffickers' planes. In addition, the troops are 
building a school, a health center, and a road in Juanchaco, in 
the western Valle del Cauca Department. 
  Mauricio Navas Talero, a former Attorney General's Office 
high-ranking official, filed a petition today for protection, a 
judicial mechanism used to protect constitutional rights, 
requesting the departure of foreign soldiers. 
  Navas explained the Colombian Constitution does not empower 
the president "to tolerate, consent, or allow the entry of 
foreign troops in the country." This would be acceptable if the 
Council of State issued an authorization. 
  He added "to defend this constitutional right, I am asking 
the courts to urge President Cesar Gaviria to order the 
immediate departure of the troops." 
  Judicial sources have said the courts will issue a ruling on 
the petition for protection within 10 days.

  [Text] Cucuta -- On Wednesday the Army frustrated a 
terrorist plan prepared by the Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
(CGR) when the 5th Mechanized Group, based in Cucuta, seized a 
large amount of arms and ammunition intended for the ELN [Army 
of National Liberation]. 
  According to the version given by military detachment 
commander Colonel Henry Dominguez, the seizure dismantled a 
major part of the CGR's logistical structure tasked with 
supplying arms and quartermaster supplies to the various groups 
who operate in the Departments of Santander and Norte de 
Santander, the southern part of Cesar Department, and Bolivar 
Department. 
  The operation began at 0500 [1000 GMT] on 2 February and 
ended 12 hours later. Alfredo Angarita Torres, "Hermes," 
logistic wing leader of the northeastern war front; Jesus Emilio 
Ovalle Rodriguez, "Chucho;" and sisters Angelina and Barbara 
Perez Duran were captured in house No. 3-77 on 21st Avenue, in 
the Tasajero neighborhood.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 6 Feb (DPA) -- Military sources 
informed DPA that tonight a commando unit of the Simon Bolivar 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) attacked a Colombian Army 
base on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Medellin. 
  From positions in surrounding buildings and in the Medellin 
metro (under construction), some 20 snipers fired repeatedly at 
the Palermo Battalion installations, located in the densely 
populated Aranjuez sector. An elite Army corps known as the 
"men of steel" is trained at this base. Its members are tasked 
with patrolling Medellin's poorest neighborhoods, where crime 
has been rampant for the past few years. 
  Precisely in one of these neighborhoods today a clandestine 
armed group known as the "People's Militia" -- which was devoted 
to meting out "private justice" -- announced its disbandment. 
The "People's Militias" are accused of having committed 
hundreds of crimes against criminals, vagrants, and drug addicts 
who roam the streets of Medellin's poorest sectors. The Army's 
"men of steel" not only patrol these areas; they also help 
build schools, health care centers, and day care centers, and 
perform other social works. 
  The Army High Command has not issued any statement regarding 
the attack on this battalion, and there have been no reports 
regarding casualties.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The military 
chiefs of the weakened Medellin Cartel in Colombia are willing 
to negotiate a peace agreement with the enemies of that dreadful 
organization to prevent their total extermination, the local 
press revealed today. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, during the past 70 days the 
survivors 
of the Medellin Cartel who are currently in jail have 
unsuccessfully sent letters to their emissaries in Cali, the 
country's third largest city, seeking a peace agreement with the 
Mafia in that region. 
  Some time ago, the clandestine group "Pepes" [Persecuted by 
Pablo Escobar], reportedly made up of members of the Cali 
Cartel, announced it would reactivate its struggle against the 
men of slain drug trafficker Pablo Escobar until all the members 
of the once powerful organization are exterminated. 
  "Afraid of what could happen to them -- after Escobar's 
death 
-- the terrorist chiefs of the Medellin Cartel have offered to 
pay their debts in jail and for the first time have considered 
the possibility of dismantling whatever is left of their armed 
redoubts," the newspaper said. "In exchange, they have requested 
respect for their relatives' lives and negotiations for their 
money and properties," with Pablo Escobar's widow Maria Victoria 
Henao. 
  Since its creation a year ago, "Pepes" has killed more than 
50 of Pablo Escobar's men and destroyed some 30 properties 
belonging to the Medellin Cartel. According to the police, the 
hunt for the survivors of the Medellin Cartel who are free has 
continued after Escobar's death and this is keeping the people 
related to this organization in a state of fear. The source 
said that "the authorities have evidence related to the killing 
of several cartel agents in Medellin one week ago." 
  One of Escobar's trusted men has said: "Either we kneel or 
they kill us all." This man has confirmed that the terrorist 
chiefs of the cartel are making efforts to secure a peace 
agreement with their enemies.

<F P=106> [Article: "Cali Surrender Stalled"] </F>
  [Text] On Tuesday afternoon, after several high-level 
meetings, President Cesar Gaviria telephoned the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] director, Fernando 
Brito, to request his presence at the meeting with the attorneys 
of two presumed traffickers from Valle. It was due to be held 
the following day at the office of the prosecutor general of the 
nation, Gustavo de Greiff. 
  What the president wanted was to establish his position on 
the policy of surrender, after rumors citing previous talks in 
which the presumed drug traffickers requested house arrest 
during certain phases of the surrender process. 
  However, what most concerned Gaviria was the fact that the 
matter of confession apparently had not yet been clearly 
explained during the previous talks with the attorneys of 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Julio Fabio Urdinola. 
  For those reasons, the president decided to send Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez and the DAS director to the meeting at 
the prosecutor general's office. 
  The fact is that, until that Wednesday, 12 January, the 
talks 
had been conducted through the prosecutor general and the 
attorney general of the nation, Carlos Gustavo Arrieta, who, in 
turn, were reporting to the government. Nevertheless, in 
December the president decided to take part in the matter and, 
at several meetings between De Greiff and the justice minister, 
agreement had already been reached on the government's presence 
at the meeting planned for early January. By that time, a 
tentative date had been set, but the exact day and time had not 
been decided. 
  On 11 January, Gonzalez, with the prosecutor general and 
attorney general, confirmed the date and time of the meeting: 
Wednesday, 12 January, at 1500. 
  When Brito and Gonzalez arrived, the prosecutor general and 
attorney general were already conferring with the drug 
traffickers' attorneys. Some tension was felt there, due mainly 
to the presence of the DAS director, because only the minister 
was expected. Moreover, the fact of not knowing in advance who 
was going to attend apparently annoyed the prosecutor general, 
according to one source. 
  Then, with the attorneys, the determination was made that 
this was an informal meeting, and it was agreed that, when the 
surrender processes actually began, each government department 
would play its part. In other words, they would be judicial 
proceedings that no one from the government would have any 
reason to attend. 
<H5>  The Meeting Began </H5>
  Finally, at 1510, the meeting began. 
  First, one of the lawyers took the floor, stating that it 
was 
Rodriguez's and Urdinola's desire to surrender based on the 
expedient of house arrest, in the course of a process that 
should culminate in one result, either: dismissal of all charges 
or sentencing to a prison term. 
  The next to speak was Minister Gonzalez. The official 
explained to the attorneys the design of the surrender policy, 
indicating that anyone who surrenders must have a real 
willingness to submit to a process, to collaborate effectively 
with the authorities, and to confess his criminal activities. 
  Nevertheless, the traffickers' lawyers used the argument 
that 
it was very important to their clients not to make a mandatory 
confession. They noted that it was the intention of the two 
presumed traffickers to submit to a trial without meeting that 
requirement. The justice minister, for his part, claimed that a 
surrender and repentance did not suffice. 
  The other attorney intervened, also declaring that what the 
two presumed drug traffickers wanted was to have the information 
supplied by them to break up the Medellin Cartel taken into 
account in their case. 
  However, according to sources queried by EL TIEMPO, that 
decision is incumbent solely on Prosecutor General De Greiff, 
who must assess the veracity of those reports, which could 
become a part of the government's policy on collaboration. 
  After the remarks, the DAS director spoke, claiming that the 
government did not consider house arrest part of the surrender 
policy. He added that anything other than the terms of that 
program was not associated with the state's position. 
  The two lawyers, somewhat shocked, commented that such 
blunt, 
clear talk was quite positive, making it possible to obtain 
information on the government's thinking. Furthermore, they said 
that, from this standpoint, the process could not continue until 
they first consulted with their clients. 
  Prosecutor General De Greiff then remarked that the decision 
on house arrest was a judicial determination, but the DAS 
director reaffirmed the negative position on house arrest. 
  Specifically, the official declared that the government did 
not interpret the policy of surrender in that way, and that the 
issue being treated had to be viewed clearly. 
  Gonzalez, for his part, claimed that they were not dealing 
with any criminal organization or common crimes, and that, for 
the persons under discussion and the crimes with which they were 
charged, it was impossible to seek house arrest. 
  Finally, Brito asserted that the government would not, under 
any circumstances, permit house arrest, among other reasons, 
because its implementation would have no acceptance on the 
international level. 
  After 1700, when the two government officials concluded 
their 
remarks, De Greiff declared the informal meeting adjourned, and 
remained in a hearing with the attorneys. 
  According to the government, the essence of the matter is 
that various conditions must be met for the process to continue: 
imposition and effective serving of adequate sentences in 
regular jails, and real, effective collaboration with the 
administration of justice. In other words, the state must be 
allowed to solve crimes and to sentence those judicially 
culpable. 
  Hence, in the government's opinion, the surrender of the 
Cali 
Cartel members is muddled, for the present; because it is 
assumed that they will not fully accept the surrender policy. 
However, a second meeting has already been arranged; and, as one 
government official aptly observed: "All is not lost."

  [Text] The new coffee price has been set from today. The 
agreement to set the domestic price was reached in the pre-dawn 
hours today following 15 hours of heated arguments. In the end 
the price [carga] went from 105,000 pesos to 120,000 pesos [unit 
not given]. 
  Tired after fighting for so many hours, negotiators emerged 
at 0330 with the news. The price of coffee went from 105,000 
pesos to 120,000 pesos, effective today. Of this amount, 
103,000 pesos will be paid in cash and 17,000 in coffee savings 
bonds. It was a 14.28 percent readjustment. 
  [Begin Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes recording] The 
government decided to give in and accepted this large increase 
-- more than a 30 percent increase since August 1993. In real 
terms, this is a gigantic increase since August. [end recording] 
  Even though the government, led by President Gaviria, made 
an 
all-out effort, the coffee growers replied with resignation. 
  [Begin Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Federation of 
Coffee Growers, recording] This was the best price obtainable in 
the present circumstances. We sincerely believe this is a very 
good price when you take into account the current international 
market. [end recording] 
  Everything seems to indicate that this will be the last 
adjustment this administration will make. In October, when a 
new increase is expected, the coffee growers will possibly have 
to speak on different terms.

  [Text] Despite the much-awaited coffee price increase, 
coffee growers are not satisfied and insist that the 120,000 
pesos [unit not given] do not even cover production costs. 
  [Begin recording] [Coffee grower Alfonso Lopez] I see this 
as 
something wicked by the government, because it is a well-known 
fact that this price will never cover costs. 
  [Coffee grower Jairo Barragan] The price the government has 
just set is not what we coffee growers expected. We are 
demanding a 30 percent increase to make this profitable. 
  [Coffee grower Manuel Hernandez] It does not make up for the 
costs involved, especially when you take into account the stalk 
borer plague. 
  [Coffee grower Aurelio Suarez] The truth is that this 
government was unable to resolve the coffee problem. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What are you going to do now? 
  [Coffee grower Jose Acosta] Go hungry. What use is this 
increase? 
  [Coffee grower Enrique Angel Mejia] We are disenchanted and 
worried about the new coffee prices because to balance out 
production costs and income the increase should have been at 
least double. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] As it has every year since 1988, this year 
SEMANA contracted for a poll aimed at learning the opinion of 
Colombians regarding some 20 issues. It compared the results 
with those from previous polls, in order to analyze the people's 
changing views on these matters. 
  For this purpose, it contracted the services of the Gallup 
Colombia firm, which collected the information between 3 and 13 
December 1993: in other words, during the 10 days following 
Pablo Escobar's death. That event had unquestionable 
implications for the general attitude and mind-set of 
Colombians. The poll was taken at 100 sampling points in Bogota, 
Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, among 1,000 men and women over 
age 18, belonging to the three social classes. 
  On this occasion, SEMANA attempted to make use of the 
information accumulated during the six years of polling, to 
compare the changes in opinion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Because the poll was taken during the days following the 
death of Pablo Escobar, the "capo's" image receives a high 
degree of mention among those polled, exceeding President 
Gaviria, with whom he shared first place a year ago. As an odd 
note, Carlos Vives appears in third place, ahead of Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff, soccer player Faustino Asprilla, and 
the best known political leaders. Noemi Sanin is by far the 
leader among the women in this ranking. 
<H5>  How Gaviria Is Faring </H5>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|All things considered, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way in w-| 
|hich Cesar Gaviria is performing as president of the republic? (figures ar-| 
|e percentages)                                                             | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Satisfied         |Dissatisfied      |Don't know/no opi-| 
|                  |                  |                  |nion              | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Dec 1992          |22                |71                |7                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Dec 1993          |44                |49                |8                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It is indisputable that 1993, with its economic results and 
the death of Pablo Escobar, was the year of the recovery of the 
president's image. Nevertheless, the indicator obtained last 
December is lower than those recorded in 1991 when, after 
Escobar's surrender and the approval of the Constitution, 
Gaviria's performance attained degrees of satisfaction exceeding 
65 percent. 
<H5>  Gaviria's Reelection </H5>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|If Cesar Gaviria should run again as a candidate for the presidency, what  | 
|is the likelihood of your voting for him? (figures are percentages)        | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Would vote for him|Wouldn't vote for |Don't know/no opi-|

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities                 |

  In this question as well, one can perceive that the recovery 
of the president's image is a long way from the popularity 
levels of 1991, when 59 percent declared themselves willing to 
reelect him.

  It is interesting to note that insecurity is currently 
considered the most serious problem by far, having displaced the 
guerrillas and violence combined, which had traditionally led in 
this ranking. The higher ranking of the corruption problem is 
also significant, now registering 9 percent, compared with only 
1 percent the previous year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Just as last year, the guerrillas are being regarded as a 
more serious problem than drug trafficking. However, when 
corruption is included among the options, it wins by a wide 
margin: something that never happened in the past. 
<H5>  Guerrillas and Armed Forces </H5>


What should the government do about the guerrillas? (figures are 
percentages) 

             Combat them        Hold dialogue    Both         Don't know/no 
             militarily         with them                     opinion 

Dec 1992     53                 38               6            3 

Dec 1993     39                 51               6            4 


  When this question was asked at the end of 1992, the cruel 
guerrilla offensive that had begun with a massacre of policemen 
in Putumayo was just being unleashed. This could explain why, 
last December, that question again produced the traditional 
results, showing that Colombians favor dialogue with the 
guerrillas. Nevertheless, this 51 percent supporting dialogue 
falls far short of the 72 percent obtained by the National 
Consulting Center in a poll taken during December 1991 in the 
five major cities. 


Do you think that the Armed Forces' ability to defeat the guerrillas is 
better, equal to, or less than it was a year ago? (figures are percentages) 

               Better           Equal           Less           Don't know 

Dec 1992       41               30              23             6 

Dec 1993       51               27              16             6 


  Those polled think that the Armed Forces have improved their 
capacity to combat the guerrillas. This means that, if the 
majority now support dialogue, it is because they believe in a 
political solution, and not because they consider the guerrillas 
invincible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Last December, just after Pablo Escobar's death, the country 
registered its highest degree of happiness, at least for the 
past four years. Three-quarters of those polled declared 
themselves "very happy," compared with 63 percent a year before. 
The November 1990 figure, which revealed a high rate of 
unhappiness, should be read carefully, because it relates to a 
poll taken in 20 large, medium, and small cities, and is not 
readily comparable to a poll taken in the four capitals. 
Nevertheless, it indicated a very high degree of dissatisfaction 
among Colombians with their lives. 


Would you say that your life, compared to that led by your parents, is better, 
the same, or worse? (figures are percentages) 

                 Better           Same           Worse           Don't know 

Nov 1990**       49               10             39              2 

Dec 1991*        72               12             15              1 

Dec 1992         44               19             36              1 

Dec 1993         53               19             26              2 

* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities 

** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities 


  In this question, one can see the same positive state of 
mind 
in December 1993 as in previous years. The difference from 1992 
(the year of Escobar's escape) is considerable. 


Do you believe that your children's lives will be better than, the same as, or 
worse than yours? (figures are percentages) 

                 Better           Same           Worse           Don't know 

Nov 1990**       39               11             44              6 

Dec 1991*        45               13             38              4 

Dec 1992         31               10             53              6 

Dec 1993         41               11             40              7 

* National Consulting Center poll in the five major cities 

** National Consulting Center poll in 20 cities 


  Just as at the end of 1991, the optimism regarding the lives 
that the children will lead is slightly greater than the 
pessimism. Again, one notes a significant difference from the 
previous year, when the degree of pessimism among Colombians 
appeared high. 
<H5>  Economic Situation and Openness </H5>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Compared with a year ago, do you feel that your economic situation is bett-| 
|er, the same, or worse? (figures are percentages)                          | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Better            |Same              |Worse             | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Dec 1992          |33                |35                |32                | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Dec 1993          |46                |36                |18                | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The difference between the end of 1992 and that of 1993 is 
appreciable. Nearly half of those polled admit that their 
economic situation has improved. Only 18 percent claim that it 
has worsened. 


How good or bad do you think economic openness has been for the country? 
(figures are percentages) 

        Very    Rather    Totally    Rather    Very    Totally    Don't 
        good    good      good       bad       bad     bad        know 

Dec     16      39        56         15        20      35         10

1993 


  Economic openness, a policy against which many leaders 
preached, believing that they would thereby gain the people's 
support, is becoming more popular every day. At present, 60 
percent of those polled consider it good: four points higher 
than the previous year's figure.

  The Catholic Church has maintained a leadership in this 
respect for years; although, as may be observed in the question 
asked of practicing Catholics, they do not, in fact, pay much 
attention to its severity concerning the sexual issue. The high 
degree of confidence in the Army is underscored; not so in the 
case of the police, who rank as low as the trade unions (victims 
of major discreditation). Their poor image is exceeded only by 
that of the Congress and the political parties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Lins Da Silva] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government last night studied the 
suitability of answering the declarations of U.S. Trade Deputy 
Secretary Jeffrey Garten at the World Trade Center in Miami. 
Garten said Itamar Franco's administration is "resuming trade 
protectionist practices." 
  Garten mentioned two areas (telecommunications and 
informatics) where this protectionism is, in his opinion, more 
obvious. He also cast doubts on the chances for success of 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic programs, 
although he recognized Brazil's "potential." He added that the 
country's economic future is full of "uncertainties." 
  Garten's speech comes during a week when relations between 
Brazil and the United States are affected by friction in various 
points. Talks on the issue of intellectual property rights 
continue in Washington and there are good possibilities the 
United States will apply commercial sanctions against Brazil on 
28 February unless there is an unexpected and radical change in 
Brazil's policies on the issue before then. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de 
Lima 
is in Brasilia. He delivered a personal message from U.S. Trade 
Representative Michael Kantor, with whom the ambassador talked 
on Friday [not further specified] about the issue, to Minister 
Celso Amorim. 
  The harsh Planalto Palace note of 2 February answering the 
State Department report on human rights in 193 countries 
continues to have bad repercussions in the U.S. Government, 
where many people think the study has even been soft on Brazil. 
  Despite the difficulties, the Brazilian Government thinks 
the 
strategy of swiftly and harshly answering any attack against the 
country is proving to be appropriate and must be maintained. 
The most recent example of the success of a quick answer was 
World Bank President Lewis Preston's letter to Ambassador Flecha 
de Lima regretting "the embarrassment" provoked by criticism 
against a Bank of Brazil's vice president, which was rejected in 
harsh and unusual terms by the ambassador on 31 January.

  [Text] AGENCIA BRASIL reported that Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim, indirectly referring to the United States, yesterday 
criticized the adoption of unilateral measures by some countries 
"without respect for international law and to the detriment of 
the development of countries such as Brazil and Cuba [no closing 
quotation mark as published]. The foreign minister said Brazil 
refuses "to admit the imposition of other countries' laws" 
within its territory, alluding to the Torricelli Law which 
punishes U.S. companies that do business with Cuba, even though 
they are subsidiaries installed in other countries. 
  Amorim's observations came during a speech at a lunch 
offered 
in honor of Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage who began a 
two-day visit to Brasilia today. Amorim expressed hope that the 
political changes being implemented in Cuba today will "help to 
facilitate, as we all wish, Cuba's full reinsertion in the 
hemisphere's coexistence." 
  The Brazilian foreign minister said Brazil and Cuba can join 
forces "to overcome our weaknesses," citing as examples the 
benefits that might be derived from the recent bilateral 
agreement for the purchase of medicines in Cuba; exchanges in 
the agroindustrial field, particularly on sugar and alcohol; and 
bilateral scientific and technical cooperation. 
  The Cuban vice president said that during his conversation 
with Amorim the Brazilian foreign minister reiterated Brazil's 
position against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. "The embargo has 
caused our country many difficulties and it is important that it 
is rejected by all Latin American countries," Carlos Lage said.

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "The End of the </F>
Vietnam Era"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Senate last week approved a resolution 
urging President Bill Clinton to normalize economic ties with 
Vietnam. The proposal was submitted by a Vietnam war veteran 
and prisoner of war, and supported by other senators who are 
also Vietnam war veterans. Because the resolution was a mere 
recommendation, it was believed that it would be merely another 
step in the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese ties, which 
has been dragging since 1991. Extremely propitious conditions 
-- particularly the insignificant opposition of groups demanding 
the identification and location of those soldiers missing in 
action in Vietnam -- allowed President Bill Clinton a few days 
later to lift to commercial embargo in force for 19 years. 
  In fact, the timetable established by the Bush 
administration 
to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic ties is being fulfilled. 
One year ago, Vietnamese authorities helped to locate those 
missing in action and as a result of the Vietnamese troops 
withdrawal, Cambodia was able to hold elections. Thus the 
international and domestic prerequisites the U.S. Government 
announced as essential for normalizing its ties with Vietnam 
were met. 
  The process was delayed because of the action of outspoken 
veteran groups, which have important electoral clout, that were 
dissatisfied with the almost insignificant progress to locate 
the almost 2,300 soldiers missing in action. One of the 
remaining myths of the war is that U.S. prisoners are still kept 
in concentration camps, which is like saying that the fictitious 
Rambo films are true. 
  Once the precautions of election year were left behind, 
reason and business prevailed. Vietnam is a rapidly growing 
market of 70 million people offering good business opportunities 
that were previously denied to U.S. manufacturers. The 
Vietnamese market grows 8 percent per year and the socialist 
rigors applied to the economy have almost been nonexistent since 
the end of the 1980's. These considerations weighed heavily on 
President Bill Clinton's decision. It is true that Clinton can 
only lift the embargo now that the painful "Vietnam drama" -- 
the feeling of self-inflicted defeat that undermined U.S. pride 
for two decades -- is already part of the past. 
  By allowing the normalization of business ties -- diplomatic 
ties will be restored shortly through which Vietnam will have a 
more favorable status which in turn will promote trade -- 
President Clinton ends a stage in history that enables the world 
to know the true limits of power and force and opens a stage of 
business cooperation that will benefit all involved nations.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Brazilian Finance Minister </F>
Fernando Henrique Cardoso from Planalto Palace in Brasilia on 7 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening ladies and gentlemen. In view of an 
inflation rate of nearly 40 percent per month and the 
difficulties being faced by the Brazilian people, the government 
has sent to Congress an economic plan to defeat inflation. 
  This plan has three stages: first, it adjusts the 
government's own accounting, reduces expenditures, and balances 
the budget; second, it creates a stable monetary index, which is 
known as the Real Value Unit, or URV, to adjust the prices of 
our economy; third, it transforms this index into a new national 
currency, which will be strong and guaranteed by the Central 
Bank, thus reestablishing our currency's credibility and 
defeating inflation. 
  Since my installation at the head of the Finance Ministry, I 
have insisted that we should not fool the country by skipping 
stages. We must first balance our budget. Unless we do that, it 
will be impossible to definitively force inflation down. To put 
a decisive end to inflation, the government cannot spend more 
than it possesses. Otherwise, it will have to resort to the 
banks and ask for loans or issue money and, as a result, we will 
have more and more inflation. This is a simple accounting rule: 
If I have 100, how can I spend 150? If I spend more than I have, 
I will have to get money to cover the difference. When the 
government prints money, it is the people who have to pay for 
it. There is no doubt about that. When the inflation rate is 
high, the common people lose more. The common people who have no 
deposit accounts in the banks or even the possibility of having 
a savings passbook are more affected because they have no way to 
defend themselves from currency devaluation. They become poorer 
by the day. President Itamar Franco's administration is doing 
its best to balance its expenses and defeat inflation. 
  My friends, in this year's budget, the government reduced 
the 
expenditures of the administrative machinery and its investments 
by nearly 40 percent. We have also succeeded in doing something 
that the pessimistic people declared to be impossible: states 
and counties have reached agreements with the federal government 
and are paying their debts in accordance with the rules 
established by Congress. We must also mention our stern fight 
against tax evasion, which has already yielded concrete results. 
We have put an end to tax havens and the privileges of those 
whose accounts had never been investigated. Despite all these 
efforts, however, we still need billions of real cruzeiros to be 
able to obtain a zero deficit in our public accounts. Worst than 
that, reducing expenses is not enough, because the Federal 
Government is forced to give most of its revenue to the 
governments of the states and counties and to finance other 
expenses contemplated in the Constitution. Out of each 100 real 
cruzeiros collected by the Federal Government, 80 are already 
earmarked for mandatory obligations. Only 20 are left to pay for 
all government expenses, which include health assistance, the 
antifamine fight, transportation, agriculture, science and 
technology, and other indispensable programs. How can we balance 
our expenses? How can we defeat inflation? Society is tired of 
paying taxes because most of the taxes are unfairly paid by the 
poor instead of by the wealthy people. 
  This is why the government has proposed a constitutional 
amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]. The FSE will 
help distribute the national resources better. It will not force 
us to make new expenditures. It will be used to finance the 
social programs that cannot, and should not, be subjected to 
more cutbacks. Unless we have this fund, the government will 
continue to make debts to cover essential expenditures, as we 
did in December, when we issued certificates for more than $1 
billion -- with interest rates of real 25 percent per year -- to 
pay for our debts to hospitals and other social programs. 
  Most of the estimated $16 billion required by the FSE, will 
result from reallocation of resources. Only $3 billion, i.e. 
nearly 20 percent of the FSE, will result from tax hikes. This 
increase is indispensable to cover urgent expenses. Who will pay 
for it? Those who have more; those who make more than 5 million 
real cruzeiros per month; the financial institutions, which will 
pay 30 percent more of their profit in social contributions; the 
upper middle class members, whose income tax will be increased 
by well below 2 percent; and the banks, which are not 
contributing to the PIS [Social Integration Program], and will 
have to do so from now on. 
  This tax effort will not affect either the workers or most 
of the middle class. We are trying to make inflation stop being 
a tax that affects the poor to become a tax on the wealthy. Even 
so, there are always demagogues who contend that the government 
is merely increasing taxes without cutting its expenses. 
  Let us speak clearly and without protocol: without the FSE, 
it will be impossible for us to fight the worst of all taxes; 
that is, inflation. The government is convinced that this 
program is the best way to achieve the desired stability and to 
ensure a sustained economic growth. 
  Yet, only together and acting in partnership -- society, 
government, and Congress alike -- will we be able to overcome 
the difficulties. 
  The government neither can nor wants to impose its program 
on 
the Congress. Most of the economic plans implemented by 
previous governments -- most of them containing shock measures, 
confiscations, and freezes -- had been endorsed by the Congress 
practically without disputes. 
  Today, fortunately, the Congress is not acting that way 
because democracy entails participation. Nor does our program 
have characteristics similar to those implemented in the past. 
Never before has a Brazilian finance minister conferred so much 
with members of Congress to effect the approval of an economic 
plan. 
  I held lengthy talks with my congressional counterparts. I 
accepted good suggestions. I made as many concessions as I 
could as long as it would not be detrimental to our proposal of 
approving a zero deficit budget. 
  I agreed to avoid touching the resources of state 
governments 
and municipal governments because they need these resources. I 
did what I could. I pushed my possibilities to the limit. 
  What is going to be voted on this week is the result of this 
extensive negotiation. A joint effort has been made by the 
government and the Congress itself. 
  The Congress must now make a decision, not because the 
government wants it to do so, but because Brazil is in a hurry. 
We again grew in 1993 and we should increase even more in 1994. 
By making adjustments, the private sector of our economy has 
made progress. Industrial production grew by 9 percent in 1993. 
Our exports totaled nearly $39 billion and our trade balance 
yielded a $13 billion surplus. Salaries increased by more than 
10 percent and employment rose by 3 percent. Our country's 
international reserves today stand at more than $33 billion, a 
record figure. 
  Our foreign debt to private banks, the negotiations of which 
must be concluded by 10 March, does not exceed $35 billion. The 
inflow of foreign resources into our financial market was more 
than $12 billion. We have also received $1.3 billion as direct 
investments. Foreign investors have given a vote of confidence 
to Brazil. Yet, much remains to be done. 
  We must yet implement constitutional revisions in the area 
of taxation, social security, and we must redefine the powers of 
the state governments, of municipal governments, and of the 
Federal Government, just to mention a few examples. 
  These are fundamental changes that are needed to once and 
for 
all balance the government's accounts. We must yet implement a 
broader privatization program -- I am fighting for this -- in 
order to consolidate our economic stabilization. 
  There is a major contradiction today in Brazil. The Congress 
and other sectors agree on the need to stop inflation and to 
implement constitutional reforms, but there are still those who 
are objecting to these necessary measures. Some members of 
liberal blocs want constitutional revision, but they disagree 
with aspects of our economic program. Progressive blocs 
partially support the economic program, but they do not want a 
constitutional revision. Many people advocate the market and 
free enterprise, but they do not stop pressuring government 
coffers. They want freedom, but they are afraid of competition 
and risks. 
  Some of them talk about downsizing the state, but they are 
vulnerable to pressure groups that are contrary to streamlining 
the state apparatus. There are others who boycott 
privatizations and advocate a misguided nationalism by defending 
stagnant monopolies, even those in nonstrategic areas. They are 
capable of asking and demanding, but they fail to discharge 
their responsibilities. 
  Today, Brazil clearly needs everyone to assume his share of 
responsibility. As President Itamar Franco said: Governability 
is a responsiblity for each and everyone of us. Either changes 
pick up momentum now or it will not occur any time soon. The 
Congress, which through congressional investigating committees 
is making politics credible again, must act responsibly in the 
economic area. Congress must decide. It must say yes or no. It 
must neither fail to act nor postpone its decision. 
  If Congress does not agree with the proposed plan, let it 
turn it down, because there will always be those who may look 
for alternate courses. 
  If Congress approves the entire program as submitted, a huge 
task will be awaiting the finance minister. Our people have 
always excelled for their patience, but our country can no 
longer wait. Each of us is responsible for making decisions and 
for acting in a timely manner, both in the government and in 
Congress. Brazil is in a hurry and the government is prepared 
to act. 
  Thank you and good night.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Cuban Government will sell Brazil 
$30 million in generic medicines that will arrive in the country 
between 30 and 60 days. This commercial agreement will be used 
to pay part of the Cuban debt with Brazil, which totals $48 
million. This was reported by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage 
D'Avila, who is visiting Brazil to negotiate investment 
strategies in the country. 
  Lage met yesterday with President Itamar Franco and with 
Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Lage stated that Cuba is 
able to supply several medicines to Brazil at good prices. He 
said Cuba can sell Brazil generic medicines, like antibiotics 
and anesthetics. 
  Carlos Lage explained that the Cuban Government is 
"patiently" awaiting the Brazilian discussion over the 
effectiveness of the antimeningitis meningococcic B-type vaccine 
produced in Cuba. "We are aware this issue is being thoroughly 
discussed in Brazil but I would like to remind everyone that we 
are the scientific proof of the vaccine's effectiveness."

<F P=106> [From the "Economic Panorama" column by Miriam Leitao] </F>
  [Text] According to one of President Itamar Franco's 
frequent advisers and interlocutors, Planalto Palace views the 
current crisis as follows: 
  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is admirable. He 
has fought courageously. "He has been a man of dialogue" but he 
should have submitted to Congress a permanent reform and not a 
provisional measure on reducing cuts on taxes collected by 
states. 
  The economic team is highly criticized. There are 
"philosophical conflicts among them" said the presidential 
adviser adding ironically: "You cannot put too many peacocks in 
one room because they are unable to show off their feathers." 
  If Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso leaves the 
government, there will be chaos with an escalation of the 
inflation rate, falls in the stock markets, and recession. 
  The Federal Revenue Department secretary "is good at 
collecting taxes" but because of ethics, he cannot be finance 
minister. The presidential adviser said: "He would not have 
sufficient elbowroom which would transform his administration 
into a permanent arm wrestling match with powerful businessmen." 
  Professor Mario Henrique Simonsen's warnings to the effect 
that the stage in which the URV [Real Value Unit] will serve as 
the economy's leading reference index should be skipped are 
being studied. 
  Accusations heaped on Congress over the last few days have 
been exaggerated. The finance minister's party [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party, PSDB] is also blamed, especially [Ceara] 
Governor Ciro Gomes [PSDB] -- "an impulsive man." Moreover, the 
whole government is blamed for paying no heed to "the silent 
majority in Congress" made up by deputies who are totally 
ignored by ministers, even when the former's requests do not 
involve an increase in government spending. 
  The blame for the passing of the decree on the agricultural 
debt is mainly laid on government leaders in Congress and 
parliamentary advisers. "No minister or president is 
omniscient. They must be kept informed by government leaders 
and advisers about projects that are of interest to the 
government."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Former Governor Orestes Quercia 
yesterday launched his candidacy for the nomination by the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] convention as the party's 
presidential candidate, thus openly entering the presidential 
race. Quercia talked with PMDB party president Deputy Luiz 
Henrique da Silveira (SC) [Santa Catalina] and with Deputy 
Tarciso Delgado (MG) [Minas Gerais], the PMDB leader in the 
Chamber of Deputies. He told them that the talks between the 
two leaders of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and 
PDT [Democratic Workers Party] in search of an alliance are 
valid, but argued that the party must have its own candidate. 
  "If other parties want to support the PMDB candidate, fine," 
the former governor and former PMDB president said. 
  Quercia said it is important to achieve unity around one 
candidate, and without feeling intimidated suggested a PMDB 
convention or a primary to chose its candidate, in case someone 
else wants to represent the PMDB at the presidential race 
  He said that he is a PMDB soldier, that he will participate 
in an election by the convention and win it. The ideal thing is 
to get consensus. He said that if it is not possible we should 
have a convention. At a convention, as the saying goes, the 
most powerful cries least. He added that whoever has the force 
and support will become the candidate. We could also have a 
primary. A person who fails to win a primary cannot be any 
party's candidate. 
  Quercia said he has taken the initiative to begin preparing 
a 
development project for the country. He criticized the PT 
[Workers Party] government program, characterizing it as 
"outdated," poked fun at Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio 
Fleury's ambition to become a PMDB candidate, and again 
criticized Itamar Franco's administration characterizing it as 
"weak and incompetent." 
  "The government must have the necessary political force in 
Congress to have its programs approved," Quercia said.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro warned that the crime of 
illegal departures from the country is very serious when it is 
attempted through the U.S. military base in Caimanera because in 
that area of the national territory, an incident caused by 
chance or deliberately provoked by the enemy could lead to a 
conflict of unknown proportions. At the same time, the minister 
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] stated that in the past 
year there has been a atmosphere of tranquility on both sides of 
the fence separating the national territory from that occupied 
by the foreign military base. 
  The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba referred 
to the madness of and provocation by those who attempt to leave 
the island through Caimanera. He pointed out that this was 
madness because they have to cross a densely mined field on both 
sides of the fence. He added that this constituted a provocation 
and an unwitting act of treason against the national security of 
Cuba, because armies which are not friendly have been deployed 
on both sides of the fence. 
  Raul made these declarations on visiting (Elmis Brooks 
Chivas) of the border patrol brigade, who is hospitalized at the 
military hospital in Santiago de Cuba. The 22-year-old soldier 
lost one leg as he tried to rescue a group of people crossing a 
field mined by the Yankee base in an attempt to leave the 
country illegally. 
  During the visit, Raul was accompanied by Juan Almeida 
Gomez, 
who read the agreement designating (Brooks) a member of the 
Cuban Revolution Veterans Association. At the same hospital Raul 
visited Simon Despain, a civil worker of the FAR who also lost a 
leg while carrying out technical work on the same border in 
Caimanera.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Israeli Chief Rabbi Yisra'el Lau </F>
in Havana by Ya'el Dan and Arad Nir -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Nir] We will now turn to Cuba, where Chief 
Rabbi Yisra'el Lau just ended a meeting with Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro. Shalom to you, Rabbi Lau. 
  [Lau] Shalom. 
  [Nir] How did the meeting with the Cuban leader go? Are 
there any messages you would like to relay at this point? 
  [Lau] First, I must digest it all. The meeting ended half 
an hour ago, and it lasted exactly three hours: from 2155 to 
0055. It was filled with so many issues and emotions, and the 
hour is so late, that I am having a hard time digesting it all. 
All in all, he is a very wise, brave, levelheaded, and cautious 
man. As you know, I did not try to approach him from the 
political point of view but rather from the spiritual and 
humanitarian aspects. Two issues are very close to him: First, 
the Holocaust, because he is a big enemy of anti-Semitism; 
second, he is very interested in the peace talks between Israel 
and its neighbors, but he knows I am not a political man who 
relays political messages. The issue of relations between our 
two countries came up in one way or another on various 
occasions. The only news I can impart to you is that although 
he did not promise anything, he evinced keen interest -- as he 
was escorting me to the elevator, he wrote down the names of Ron 
Arad and our three MIA's from the Sultan al-Ya'qub battle. 
  [Dan] Does the establishment of diplomatic relations with 
Cuba seem likely in the wake of your meeting with Fidel Castro? 
  [Lau] I am not acting on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, 
which retains full responsibility for such issues. He spoke 
with great admiration about the prime minister and the foreign 
minister. After having spoken to him for three hours on this 
and other related issues, I can say that he is waiting to see 
the progress made on the peace process. He wishes for -- and I 
am quoting him -- fair peace, final, and lasting [last five 
words in English]. I have more than a feeling that as progress 
is made on this issue, he will be more responsive and open on 
the question of relations. 
  [Dan] Do you think it is a condition? 
  [Lau] We did not use such words. He referred to it from the 
humanitarian point of view. He spoke about all the years he was 
isolated, especially by his neighbor, the strongest superpower 
in the world, which he has been facing empty-handed, and he 
noted that with the disintegration of the Soviet regime and the 
ensuing collapse, he has been left with very few friends around 
the world, some of whom are our neighbors. It is hard for him 
to take a step that will not be accepted by those who stood by 
him in times of distress. I believe I have made myself clear. 
I am speaking from the official guest house of the Cuban 
Government. 
  [Dan] Did he acquire a new friend as a result of your 
meeting? 
  [Lau, laughing] Did he acquire a new friend? I do not know 
what you call a friend. I do not see him visiting Israel 
tomorrow or the day after, but he is a great friend of the 
Jewish people. He deeply abhors anti-Semitism. He explained to 
me that during his childhood, people tried to instill in him 
notions about the Jews being guilty for the fate of Jesus. He 
is very non-Catholic on this issue. He was very glad when I 
mentioned that we hold fond memories of the Cuban Government and 
the Cuban people for opening their country to European refugees 
upon the rise of Nazism to power. He was very touched by this. 
  [Nir] What sort of man did you find him to be? He may be 
the last vestige of an era. 
  [Lau] He is not a dogmatic man. In my opinion, he is very 
educated. He is an interesting man, very knowledgeable about 
the Bible. There is no doubt that he is charismatic. God 
willing, when I return home tomorrow I will tell about the 
situation here and the admiration felt toward the man 
nevertheless. Then you will understand that the man is simply 
brimming with personal charm. 
  [Dan] Thank you very much, Rabbi Lau. You say you are due 
back tomorrow. 
  [Lau] God willing, tomorrow I will start on my way back. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 8 February 
carries a report on Rabbi Lau's meeting with Castro, adding that 
"Castro emphasized that he has never denounced Israel and said 
he is sorry about reports in the Israeli media that Israel is 
not interested in establishing relations with Cuba. He asked 
Rabbi Lau to relay a message to Prime Minister Rabin and to 
Foreign Minister Peres expressing his admiration for the Israeli 
Government in view of the courage it has evinced in the peace 
process."]

  [Text] On 6 February, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani concluded his visit to Cuba. 
According to his own statements prior to his departure from the 
Jose Marti International Airport, the 24 hours he spent in Cuba 
were very productive. The foreign minister met with Commander in 
Chief Fidel Castro, with whom he analyzed various issues of 
bilateral interest, and said that he was very impressed by the 
meeting and Fidel Castro's personality. In that respect, the 
visitor said that they arrived at an agreement on how to 
continue developing the relations between the two countries. It 
was agreed to take the relations between Cuba and Qatar to the 
ambassadorial level. 
  Regarding cooperation, the Qatari minister said that the 
results had been very positive. He announced that the two 
countries would exchange interests in the health care sector, 
especially in areas of medical and paramedical personnel, 
medicine, and vaccines. He also stated that his country has a 
special interest in the area of sports advisers. 
  Regarding the agreement signed by Foreign Ministers Roberto 
Robaina and Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, Cuba will open 
its embassy in Doha, the capital of Qatar, within the first six 
months of 1994; Qatar will do the same in Havana during the year. 
  At the ceremony, Robaina described the visit of his Qatari 
counterpart as a point of reference to increase ties of 
friendship between the two countries, which need to advance on 
the path of cooperation and exchange. The visitor also met with 
Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee 
for Finance, and expressed interest in the conditions that exist 
in Cuba for the investment of foreign capital and the signing of 
mutually beneficial agreements. The foreign minister of Qatar 
stated that this was the first step for possible future 
agreements.

  [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir Al 
Thani said his meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro was 
very fruitful and positive. They discussed issues of common 
interest during the meeting. The foreign minister said: I was 
very impressed by this meeting, and we reached an understanding 
on how to continue our work to foster bilateral relations. 
  The Qatari foreign minister delivered to President Castro 
greetings from Qatari Amir Khalifa bin-Hamad Al Thani and from 
the crown prince, as well as his wishes of prosperity and 
well-being for the Cuban Government and people. 
  The two parties expressed their satisfaction with the 
development of their bilateral relations, whose diplomatic ties 
were established in 1989. They also discussed the prospects of 
stimulating trade ties and the exchange of visits by 
businessmen. The Qatari foreign minister, who headed a 
delegation of government officials, ministers and businessmen, 
just ended his official visit to Cuba.

  [Text] An editorial published in today's TRABAJADORES 
newspaper states that control of prices and inventories, as well 
as the discipline of collection and payments are the weapons 
against corruption. The text comments on the black market as a 
subject of the workers assemblies that are being held throughout 
the country. In these assemblies, the collective analyzes the 
economic effectiveness of each work center and the financial 
state of the country. 
  The black market economy is taking most of the workers' 
income because of high prices, a reflection of an inflationary 
phenomenon barely seen in the policy of state prices. The 
editorial comments that the high prices of black-market products 
invite crime since many people who operate with state resources 
not only purchase on that market, but also become salespeople 
when they exploit the lack of administrative control and 
responsiveness to the so-called deficits [faltantes]. 
  This black market, efficient organizer and duplicator of 
crime and corruption, involves more and more citizens who 
normally would not commit criminal acts, but whose scruples, 
under the current situation, are weakened, and who try to 
justify the mentality of "save yourself if you can," which is 
contrary to their normal way of being and thinking. 
  The editorial goes on to state that in the workers 
parliaments, there has been a consensus to take radical steps 
against those who have accumulated large amounts of money and 
property through shady or fraudulent means. There cannot be a 
respectable administration or a work collective with patriotic 
spirit that does not fight in favor of control, not just because 
of its effect on the economy, but to protect the morale, 
prestige, and dignity of the workers. 
  The editorial states that every labor union movement should 
take the matter in hand and demand that the administrations 
adopt measures to cut connections between the state economy and 
the black market. If every work center hoists the flag of 
honesty above any justifiable trend, then we are creating 
conditions for the success of future financial measures and 
subsequent restructuring of the management system. 
  TRABAJADORES acknowledges the importance of preparing 
ourselves to attack the problems at their roots. The editorial 
adds that we need to organize and protect morale so our ranks 
are not weakened, and so Marti's thought is strengthened: 
Poverty may pass; what does not pass are the dishonorable acts 
men commit, using poverty as an excuse.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The newspaper TRABAJADORES published a lengthy 
article in today's edition by reporter Carmen R. Alfonso on 
migration policy, entitled: "Open or Closed Doors." Following 
are some of its most important aspects. 
  Stating that migration laws are customary, and more than 
that, necessary in any contemporary state, she notes that these 
laws vary according to political, economic, social, military, 
and other interests, and that Cuba is no exception to these 
general conditions. 
  Carmen Alfonso states in her analysis that our case cannot 
be 
ignored when analyzing the migration issue and its complexity 
within the Cuban-U.S. conflict, taking into account that a large 
number of Cubans have traditionally migrated to the United 
States because of its geographic proximity and economic 
development. 
  In addition to those who travel to other nations for work or 
for other official reasons, there are also those who travel for 
personal reasons. Among them, we can mention three categories: 
those who wish to leave and return; those who definitely want to 
reside in another country; and those who request residence 
authorization abroad. 
  At present, temporary leave is authorized for those over 20 
years of age, although men up to the age of 26 or 27 years old 
who wish to reside abroad must first fulfill their military 
obligation. Minors under 18 must be authorized by one of their 
parents. It is appropriate to mention that last year, Cuba 
authorized temporary leave for 100,000 people, but only 40,000 
managed to leave the country because the others had their 
requests denied, usually by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
  There are also conditions for Cubans who already left the 
country. Those who left before 1959 must use the consulate of 
the country in which they are residing, and those who left after 
1959 also have the chance to return to their native country 
through various programs devised for that purpose. 
  However, U.S. Immigration policy toward Cuba has an 
essentially political nature, which justifies the exceptionally 
privileged treatment of Cuban immigrants, especially those who 
violate the laws that are in effect in our country. 
  Nevertheless, an agreement signed in 1984 provides for the 
annual granting of up to 20,000 visas for those who wish to live 
in the United States. But the failure of the U.S. to fulfill 
this agreement has been notorious. Paradoxically, the 
TRABAJADORES article notes, risky, illegal departure is 
facilitated without exception or restriction of the number of 
immigrants.

  [Text] Upon conclusion of a six-day visit to Brazil, Carlos 
Lage Davila, Cuban Council of State vice president, said today 
in Rio de Janeiro that the United States is increasingly more 
isolated in its blockade against Cuba. Lage Davila has already 
left by plane for Colombia. 
  Lage said that an example of that isolation is approval for 
two consecutive years by the UN General Assembly of resolutions 
rejecting the U.S. blockade. He added that in the second year, 
the number of countries supporting the resolution for Washington 
to suspend the embargo on Vietnam has increased. He said that 
the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam is the result of the 
heroic struggle and victory of the Vietnamese people, thus 
making more evident to international public opinion the unjust 
and cruel nature of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  In Brazil, Lage Davila and his delegation visited Sao Paulo, 
Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro. They also met with President 
Itamar Franco and the ministers of foreign affairs, the economy, 
and health, in a series of activities that yielded positive 
results.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Raul Amado-Blanco, vice president </F>
of the National Bank of Cuba, by Marianela Samper; place and 
date not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] Cuba's total foreign debt currently amounts to 
approximately $7 billion, and since 1986 dialogue between the 
National Bank of Cuba and its creditors -- the Paris Club and 
the Bank Coordinating Group -- has not resulted in specific or 
important actions. This was pointed out to Radio Havana by Raul 
Amado-Blanco, vice president of the National Bank of Cuba. He 
also noted that in spite of this situation, progress may be made 
this year, which will prove very useful for all sides involved. 
  [Begin Amado-Blanco recording] We would like to move the 
dialogue along, so to speak. There are many issues to be 
reviewed. Our liquidity, from the viewpoint of freely 
convertible currency, as you are well aware, is not very good 
for conducting any sort of negotiations at this time. However, 
I believe an agreement can be reached if we sit down and talk 
and if, to begin with, our creditors acknowledge the efforts 
Cuba made for a number of years between 1982 and 1986 to repay 
its loans. They must also acknowledge the situation Cuba is 
currently experiencing. If we accomplish this I believe we will 
have established a solid foundation that will change our current 
status of immobility where the debt is concerned. [end 
recording] 
  As for the island's real likelihood of obtaining loans, the 
vice president of the Cuban National Bank said that some 
institutions undoubtedly lack the resolve to grant loans. 
Amado-Blanco said he has even discussed all the requirements 
for a loan and been ready for the final signature when the other 
side said the negotiations could not continue. 
  [Begin Amado-Blanco recording] In our case, since at this 
time we are working primarily with private banks, things are not 
done that way, although private banks are sometimes subjected to 
political pressure. However, I do not believe this pressure 
comes from either the IMF or the World Bank but from certain 
governments, the governments of third countries. Bank members 
may eventually hold important positions in the United States, 
and they fear jeopardizing those positions by granting loans to 
Cuba. 
  There are, unquestionably, countries with which we have 
debts, but in spite of this they have still granted loans to 
Cuba and have kept open certain lines of credit to the island. 
They are aware of our position, but they have political resolve. 
There are countries in Europe and on other continents that have 
done this and they are worthy of praise. In my opinion, their 
conduct constitutes a declaration of independence as far as 
their relations with Cuba are concerned. 
  In general, the issue of financial markets is a complicated 
one for Cuba at this time because of the many problems the 
country is facing, but we have had some success. We are trying 
our best to repay the new loans we have received. We are paying 
to the extent that we can, and we are being very careful not to 
request loans that we know we cannot repay. This, of course, 
restricts us because, as you know, our exports have decreased 
considerably. I have remained optimistic throughout 26 years at 
the bank, and I believe that as of 1994, or rather 1995, we are 
going to be quite successful in some areas. We will improve our 
overall image on the market, which is very important. Loan 
payments, first of all, are very important, and our 
possibilities and prospects are very important as they pertain 
to the analyses conducted by banking and financial institutions 
when they are considering loans for countries. [end recording] 
  To conclude, I discussed with Amado-Blanco the loan of $10 
million granted by a Chilean bank to finance the exportation of 
food products from that South American country to the island. 
Amado- Blanco said an institution takes such a step only when 
it has confidence in a country, adding that a loan will not only 
allow Cuba to import food, which is quite positive, but to 
intensify its relations with a country like Chile, with which it 
maintained excellent relations until the 1973 military coup.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Feb (EFE) -- The International Bank of 
Commerce (BICSA) has become the second trade enterprise with 
operations in Cuba after the Cuban financial authorities granted 
the corresponding license, it was reported today, Sunday. 
  For 10 years the International Bank of Finance has been 
operating in Cuba and was the first to carry out this type of 
financial activity, the local press indicated. 
  BICSA has a capital worth 1 million pesos payable in German 
Marks contributed by local corporations that make up the group 
of shareholders. The banking institution seeks to encourage 
foreign trade and to participate in the development of local 
enterprises to produce products and services targeted for export 
or sale in a freely convertible currency. 
  BICSA president Jose Vaz explained that the bank's creation 
"is in response to the nation's policy aimed at multiplying 
banking activity to strengthen and develop it." Until a decade 
ago, such activity was concentrated in the National Bank of Cuba 
and the People's Savings Bank, Vaz recalled. He added that among 
BICSA's possible main customers are the industrial and trade 
companies, as well as persons who wish to use the checking 
account and security box services. 
  According to the official, a network of correspondents in 
approximately 70 nations "will guarantee that the users can 
carry out their transactions in Canada, almost all of Latin 
America, Europe, the main Asian trade centers, and some African 
nations."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 1 and 4 February. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February reported that an 
agreement of cooperation was signed between the Cuban Ecumenical 
Council and the Sugar Industry Ministry to build a biogas plant 
in Matanzas to reprocess residues of other industries into 
cooking gas. The agreement establishes that German churches will 
finance the project while the Cuban Government will be 
responsible for the construction and technological assembly of 
the plant, which will also eliminate an important source of 
environmental pollution. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February adds that the 
Agriculture Ministry phytosanitary board saved $800,000 last 
year by conducting a biological control program in Matanzas. The 
program succeeded in controlling the spread of plagues and 
diseases, thereby saving money spent in the past to purchase 
pesticides. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 2320 GMT on 1 
February report that 11,000 people are self-employed in Santiago 
de Cuba Province with positive results for the economy of that 
province. According to estimates by the state labor committee, 
approximately 2 million pesos were collected during the last 
quarter of last year through registration fees. Drivers, 
craftsmen, tailors, and handicraft vendors are the services most 
in demand. Special studies are being carried out in Santiago de 
Cuba better to control and organize the self-employment jobs. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 2 February reports that 
Matanzas 
Province's farmers planted 330 caballerias of tubers, 
vegetables, and grains in January, the highest figure for a 
similar period in the cold-season planting campaign in the past 
10 years. At the end of January, Matanzas farmers had planted a 
little over 810 caballerias of miscellaneous food crops in the 
cold-season planting, which includes 162 caballerias of potatoes 
that are looking good. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 February reports that the 
Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] has announced that, 
nationwide, sugar sector workers planted a total 863 caballerias 
of cane in January, exceeding the month's plan by 48 percent. 
Minaz reports that all provinces except Villa Clara, Las Tunas, 
and Granma met their schedule for the month. This is a good 
beginning for the spring planting, which takes place "from 
January to 30 June," by which time 18,090 caballerias of cane 
are to have been planted. 
  Radio Reloj in Spanish at 2030 GMT on 2 February reports 
that 
electricity supply to the eastern region has been increased by 
approximately 100 megawatts with the establishment of modern 
Russian-made equipment at the Vicente Substation in Ciego de 
Avila. Several towns between Ciego de Avila and Guantanamo will 
receive the benefits of this equipment. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 3 February reports that the 
Claudio Arguelles Bicycle Factory in Havana has held a 
Parliament in the Workplace. During the discussions, one 
participant noted that no one wants Cuban bicycles "because they 
are very bad. They have no quality whatsoever, none whatsover." 
Another noted that the cost of producing a bicyle in 1993 was 
140.95 pesos, and that the bicycle sold for 95 pesos; therefore, 
these bicycles were subsidized to the tune of "some 2 million 
pesos." A third participant pointed out that the poor quality 
was not the fault of the assembly plant but lay, instead, in the 
poor work done by the workshops that produce the parts assembled 
at the Claudio Arguelles plant. 
  Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 4 
February 
report the following: 
  Three new 15-megawatt turbogenerators were installed at the 
Panama agricultural complex in Vertientes Municipality in 
Camaguey. 
  In 1993, the Department of Transit in Havana City reported 
1,825 traffic accidents, in which 348 people died and 1,605 were 
injured. Comparison to 1992 figures shows a 40-percent drop in 
the number of accidents and 16 percent in injuries. In 1992, one 
person died in every nine accidents; in 1993, one person died in 
every five. 
  The Comandante Pinares General Hospital in Pinar del Rio 
Province benefited from a donation by the German Government to 
the Cuban Red Cross of 12 tons of food valued at $100,000. The 
German company, Mercedes-Benz, also donated an intensive care 
ambulance valued at $50,000 to the Cuban Red Cross. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 February reports the 
following, citing the 4 February edition of GRANMA: Cuba had 
6.644 billion cubic meters of water in its reservoirs at the end 
of January 1994, 74 percent of their potential. 
  Cuba has almost 4,000 minidairy farms. Import costs of $5 
million dollars were avoided in 1993 by practicing recycling. 
  Of the over 800 Basic Cooperative Production Units in the 
agriculture-livestock sector in Cuba, 238 are in miscellaneous 
crops and 431 in commercial cattle-raising. The rest are in 
activities related to coffee, rice, and forestry.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Luckenson from the national conference </F>
convened by the Committee of Actions for National 
Reconciliation, CARENA, in Port-au-Prince on 6 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] A national conference opened on 6 February at 
the Holiday Inn in Champ-de-Mars. Conference organizers invited 
the delegates to commit themselves in a patriotic spirit to 
untangle the crisis. Jean Luckenson reports: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] We have patiently set out today 
to seek a solution to the crisis the country is experiencing. It 
is perhaps one of the gravest crises ever experienced in our 
national history. We must find a solution, an effective remedy 
to this cancer gnawing at our society at the end of this 
century, because the times are grave. We need peace in a Haitian 
society that is examining its future. Today, our concern is an 
urgent solution so that coming generations do not judge us. 
These statements were made by Fritz Bissereth, CARENA national 
coordinator, in his speech opening the national conference at 
about 1100 on 6 February. [passage omitted] 
  Bissereth went on to say we must set aside our divergences 
or 
political opinions, regardless of sector, so we can find an 
urgent solution within the next 48 hours. After the opening 
speech, the audience stood up to observe one minute of 
meditation. A delegation then placed a spray of flowers before 
the altar of the homeland. 
  The high point in this rally today was the statements of the 
delegates and the various resolutions they introduced. Of the 
100 [invited], 65 guests representing political parties or 
socioprofessional organizations were present. Divergent opinions 
were presented in the delegates' statements. Some opted for the 
application of Article 148 of the country's fundamental law; 
others demanded [the application of] Article 149. National 
Coalition spokesman Carl Denis asked for a clean sweep, as a 
true solution, or a triumvirate or five-member consultive 
council. For his part, the representative of the National Rally 
Party [PARAN] has withdrawn because, in his opinion, there is no 
presidium managing this national conference. According to the 
PARAN representative, Frantz Gerard Verret, the CARENA members 
are acting as sole sovereigns whereas, in principle, the 
National Assembly should be making decisions. [passage omitted] 
  The panel was made up of the Reverend Aurel Chery; Gabriel 
Miracles, representative of the Autonomous Organization of 
Haitian Workers for the union sector; Max Beauvoir, 
representative of National BODE [BODE Nasyonal, voodoo 
organization, expansion unknown]; Manfred Antoine, 
representative of the people's sector and the National Front for 
Change and Democracy; Dr. Rony Durant, representative of the 
Higher Institute of Political and Juridical Sciences; and 
Colonel Wilson Eustache, representative of the Army. We should 
tell you that the representatives of the resigning government 
were not present, nor was the diplomatic corps. The rally took 
place in a very calm atmosphere. The room was very crowded. We 
saw a big national flag and slogans advocating peace and 
reconciliation. On the whole, this was the situation at the 
Holiday Inn. Jean Luckenson for Signal FM. [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 7 Feb (NA) -- Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion thinks that the United Kingdom "is wrong in 
considering" the purchase of 36 Skyhawk A-4M airplanes equipped 
with late-generation radars "as a conflict with Argentina." 
  In Camilion's opinion, the diplomatic mishaps generated by 
the purchase of this materiel from the United States are 
"artificial conflicts and a false problem," because these 
airplanes "do not imply any potential display of military power." 
  According to the minister, the U.S. decision to sell the 
airplanes to Argentina "was made a long time ago," but it was 
postponed given "the strong opposition expressed by the United 
Kingdom before all levels of the U.S. Government." 
  "Thus, the Western countries' arms embargo on Argentina has 
ended, except for the United Kingdom," the defense minister told 
EL CRONISTA newspaper. 
  Camilion said that during his last trip to the United States 
he told former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin that "it is 
incomprehensible" that the UN Security Council of which the 
United Kingdom and the United States are key members should ask 
for "Argentina's participation in peace missions and at the same 
time apply an arms embargo on it." 
  Camilion said that Argentina "never intended to fight with 
anyone over this operation which, from the military point of 
view, is not very important because the airplanes will be used 
to train pilots." 
  When asked about his expectations regarding the British 
reaction, Camilion said that the United Kingdom "has more 
diplomatic experience than any other" country and that Argentina 
"must maintain the good level of dialogue through diplomatic 
channels in its claim for the Malvinas." 
  As for the reasons that led Argentina to buy these airplanes 
if there is no possibility of an armed conflict here, the 
minister said that states "are security organizations that 
require a minimum deterrent capability in case of possible 
aggressions." 
  He also said that some additional credits will be left over 
from the purchase of the Skyhawks and they will be used this 
year to purchase a nonpolluting naval unit to operate in the 
Antarctic zone.

  [Text] Jose Maria Figueres gave his first news conference 
as president-elect of Costa Rica and reiterated his commitment 
to the needy, stating that his government will focus primarily 
on strengthening social programs. He added, however, that 
socioeconomic programs are two sides of the same coin as one 
cannot be separated from the other. He reiterated that during 
his administration important [word indistinct] will be made for 
the agriculture sector, as well as for small and medium 
producers, who will grow stronger as they are given the 
necessary resources. 
  Women will also play a leading role in the policies of the 
coming National Liberation Party administration. Figueres 
stated that his government will continue its efforts in the 
health and education sectors. He also reiterated his support 
for private education but added that public education must be 
improved to keep it at the same level as private education 
[words indistinct]. 
  Figueres said very significant trade relations will be 
generated with various nations with which current relations are 
maintained. Figueres said he will respect international 
financial organizations and international economic policies. 
However, he reiterated that his government does not approve of 
the (?third) structural adjustment program in its current form 
and said it must undergo several changes so it does not harm the 
country's less fortunate sectors. 
  Here is an excerpt of Jose Maria Figueres' statements at the 
Hotel Costa Rica: 
  [Begin Figueres recording] I am happy and very grateful for 
the trust and affection expressed by the Costa Rican people, a 
majority of whom voted for the National Liberation Party and 
allowed us to win the elections and to win in Congress. I am 
certain they will allow us to win a majority in the 
municipalities throughout the nation. 
  I think there were certain factors that could have caused 
objections to the final election results. Starting early in the 
afternoon I perceived an air of triumph among the National 
Liberation Party family when party members were saying we had 
won all across the nation. Some started to celebrate before the 
final results were in. You are the best witnesses that 
throughout the afternoon we used the media many times to urge 
people not to celebrate in advance and to work until 1800 or 
until we obtained [words indistinct]. 
  In any case, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the 
trust placed in us to fulfill the commitments we made during the 
campaign. It is time to leave differences aside, to unite the 
Costa Rican family, and to meet the goals we have set. [end 
recording]

  [Text] San Jose, 7 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that his successor, Jose Maria 
Figueres, will receive a country in better shape than he did in 
1990, because poverty has been reduced and economic growth has 
increased. 
  After congratulating Figueres on his election victory over 
Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez in yesterday's 
elections, the president noted that "we have a country with the 
highest growth in Latin America" (6.5 percent last year), which 
has reduced poverty from 23 to 17 percent and has brought the 
fiscal deficit under control, according to official figures. "I 
feel that the new president will bring his own ideas to the 
government and will have his focus, but it is very unlikely that 
the trend toward national unity will be broken," declared the 
head of state, who will surrender power on 8 May. 
  According to Calderon, the fiscal deficit projected for this 
year -- 1.5 percent of the GDP -- is five times less than that 
for 1990, when he assumed office from social democrat Oscar 
Arias, a fellow party member of Figueres. The president 
explained he hopes to meet in the next few days with Figueres to 
begin the transition process. 
  Calderon, 44, and Figueres, 39, are two of the youngest 
presidents in Costa Rican history. They are both sons of two of 
the most prominent leaders and former presidents the country has 
had in this century, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia (1940-44) and 
Jose Figueres (1948-49, 1953-58, and 1970-74). The two former 
presidents were adversaries in a civil war in which the father 
of the next president of Costa Rica came out victorious and 
which marked the beginning of the model democracy this country 
has today.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus today said the U.S. blockade against Cuba 
"is not the proper medicine" to get this country to return to a 
democratic system. According to Niehaus, a candidate for post 
of OAS secretary general, "bloodshed" has to be avoided in Cuba, 
and a change in Cuba's current political system -- a system that 
has been in place for more than 30 years -- has to be achieved 
through dialogue and respect for the people's self-determination. 
  The head of Costa Rican diplomacy said: "None of us want our 
Cuban brothers to shed one drop of blood. We have to talk to 
them to avoid this. They are part of the American family that 
is outside" the OAS because of the isolation decreed against it 
by the organization in the 1960's. 
  Nevertheless, Niehaus warned that for Cuba to be readmitted 
as a member of the American community of nations, it has to 
respectfully adhere to the principles of the OAS Charter and to 
the defense of human rights. In this sense, the foreign 
minister said, he agreed that Cuba should not be invited to any 
American Summit -- the next summit has been scheduled in the 
United States at the end of 1994 -- until a democratic change 
takes place on the island governed by Fidel Castro, the Marxist 
leader who took power in the 1959 revolution. 
  According to Niehaus, had Western Europe isolated the Soviet 
Union, "we would still have the USSR." In this way, he 
reiterated that it was counterproductive to continue using the 
method of isolation to achieve change in Cuba. Regarding the 
renewal of relations between Cuba and Costa Rica, which were 
broken off more than 30 years ago, Niehaus said this is not the 
only way to get closer to the Havana regime, and he added that 
Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon was the one who had 
to ultimately decide this issue. 
  Today Niehaus met with foreign reporters covering Costa 
Rica's electoral process that ends tomorrow with the election of 
a new president, two vice presidents, 57 deputies, and 
authorities for the 81 Costa Rican municipalities.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Feb (Notimex) -- Today, the 
Guatemalan Defense Ministry rejected the guerrillas' proposal of 
a "Unity and National Salvadoran" government, calling it 
"illogical." 
  The Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE) 
pointed out that "the current government is democratic, and it 
is very difficult to accept proposals from an illegal group that 
is constantly breaking the law." 
  Nevertheless, DIDE said the Armed Forces will adhere to any 
decision made by General Commander and President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio. It also warned that any guerrilla position must remain 
within the framework of their negotiations with the government. 
  The rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) 
stated in a communique released in Mexico City that the 
constitutional and institutional changes the country needs can 
only be accomplished through a "Unity and National Salvation" 
government. 
  The URNG views the approval of constitutional reforms 
through 
the referendum held last Sunday as a "failure" and pointed out 
that the popular consultation confirmed the government's lack of 
credibility and legitimacy. 
  The guerrilla's claims are prompted by the results of last 
Sunday's popular consultation, in which only 10.75 percent of 
the 3.4 million electorate voted to approve 37 constitutional 
reforms. 
  Vinicio Hernandez, leader of the Guatemalan Workers Trade 
Union, told Notimex it is impossible to establish a united 
government because, to begin with, the peace negotiations are 
being held in secret. "We believe that rapprochement efforts are 
very positive but if the civilian, labor, Indian, or student 
sectors do not participate in the dialogue we will never reach a 
firm agreement," Hernandez added. 
  The labor leader said there has been talk of an imminent 
signing of peace to end the 30-year armed conflict, but 
pacification "will not be accomplished unless there is consensus 
among the people who are affected." 
  Meanwhile, the Peasant Unity Committee (CUC) has said that 
as 
long as there is a shortage of land, housing, and health care in 
Guatemala, a "Unity and Salvation" government will rapidly 
disintegrate. CUC leader Sebastian Morales said: "as long as 
there is hunger, cold, disease, and human rights violations, 
peace will be very far away." The peasant organization said it 
might join the URNG's initiative as long as the solutions 
proposed are specific. 
  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who has not commented on 
the 
rebel statement, claims he "won" the popular consultation by a 
margin of seven to one votes. 
  According to the president, the referendum results are the 
first step toward ending the political crisis that was unleashed 
on 25 May when former president Jorge Serrano Elias, who is 
exiled in Panama, disrupted constitutional order.

  [Text] Over the weekend, residents of some areas near the 
main exits of the capital were surprised by the movement of 
military trucks transporting soldiers, which was nothing more 
than a routine movement, military sources have confirmed. 
  In our editorial room, we received several telephone calls 
reporting the military movements. 
  Meanwhile, upon being asked, the Army Information and Press 
Department reported that normally early in every month, members 
of the Zavala Marshal Brigade, the Honor Guard, or La Aurora 
Guard, a former tactical detachment, conduct routine military 
training. Following the referendum on 30 January, the rumors of 
a possible social outbreak or, worse yet, a coup d'etat remain 
in the air. 
  Political leaders who were asked but who chose to remain 
anonymous said that, in reality, they were also alerted by 
friends or relatives of a potential military movement by the 
government's military leadership. One of the interviewees 
recalled that after the visit by U.S. Ambassador Marilyn McAfee 
to Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Vielman Ruiz last Friday, 
rumors regarding destabilizing movements against the government 
have been going around, and even though they have not been 
confirmed, they have not been denied either. 
  In diplomatic circles, no opinions were given on the current 
situation. The ambassadors who were asked, said only that there 
currently is an effort under way by Guatemalans to demand 
respect for order and legality.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
Government denied here today that military sectors carried out a 
new coup attempt in the past hours. 
  Presidential spokesman Felix Loarca said the rumors about 
top 
military commanders planning tactical movements to oust the 
former human rights ombudsman were "groundless." He said: 
"Ramiro de Leon is working at the presidential residence and 
carrying out his routine activities." "The president has 
reiterated that peace prevails in the country and that its 
institutions are stronger than ever today," he added. Loarca 
pointed out that the Guatemalan officers accept their role in 
the democratic system and that the reports are simply rumors," 
he pointed out. [no beginning quotation marks as received] 
Loarca called on the population not to pay attention to the 
coup rumors that attempt to destabilize the country's 
institutions. 
  This past weekend, the local PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO 
VEINTIUNO 
morning newspapers reported on troop movements in different 
areas in Guatemala City. Such movements are similar to the ones 
that have preceded previous coups d'etat in the country. 
  The Defense Ministry has reported that the military 
movements 
were routine actions and reaffirmed its full support for 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon. "Our objective is to 
further the consolidation of the democratic process and to 
ensure, as the institution in charge of the country's security 
and sovereignty, that institutional order is maintained," 
Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez stated. 
  On Sunday, SIGLO VEINTIUNO hinted at the possibility of "the 
military coup ghost in Guatemala" and advanced that "a very 
important general" in the Armed Forces had stated at a secret 
meeting that "it was impossible for a victorious Army to be led 
to the losers' territory." The officer, thus, referred to the 
president's decision to accept the presence of a UN 
representative at the peace negotiations with the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) rebels. 
  According to the newspaper, if a coup d'etat occurs now, 
when 
the rebels are almost annihilated, it would give the URNG some 
air, mainly in the international sphere where its position has 
deteriorated after the fall of previous President Jorge Serrano. 
  In a parliamentary election early on 6 June 1993, de Leon 
assumed the Guatemalan presidency which was left vacant by 
Serrano who, after a brief self-inflicted coup d'etat, abandoned 
the country and took asylum in Panama.

<F P=106> [From the "Facing the Moment" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A high-level Guatemalan guerrilla commission met 
with Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, the UN Observers for El Salvador 
[Onusal] mission chief this morning. The Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity [URNG] delegation was headed by Commanders 
Gaspar Ilom and Pablo Monsanto and members of the rebel 
diplomatic commission. 
  Augusto Ramirez Ocampo reported that the URNG delegation had 
come to learn of the role played by the United Nations in the 
verification of the Salvadoran peace process. On his part, 
Commander Rodrigo Asturas, alias Gaspar Ilom, said the agreement 
signed by the URNG and the Guatemalan Government on 10 January, 
allowed them to anticipate a positive future for the 
negotiations. 
  [Begin Asturias recording] [Words indistinct] specially 
significant to us, especially based on our evaluation of the 
Salvadoran negotiations and peace process. At the same time, we 
wanted to verify, in situ, the United Nations' weight in this 
peace process. In our case, we asked for UN participation as 
soon as we initiated talks in Guatemala. We ratified our 
request in the agreement signed on 10 January. We have called 
on the United Nations to act as a mediator in the process and 
this, of course, includes verification of all the agreements. 
[end recording] 
  URNG Commander Gaspar Ilom, who is the son of Miguel Angel 
Asturias, a nobel laureate for literature, considered that the 
UN experience in verifying the implementation of the agreements 
in El Salvador is promising. Ilom said the Guatemalan peace 
process will be very complicated but not, as a result of this, 
irresolvable. He added that they hope to reach agreements 
leading to peace very soon. Ilom insisted that the main points 
of the negotiation are to establish the role of the Army in a 
democratic society, the country's economic problems, and issues 
related to the Indian problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Schvartzman entitled "Computer </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] It is said that a former president of a small and 
poor country travelled to the United States last December. 
Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent -- after 
looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the 
computer -- asked him to wait, ordered a customs personnel to 
bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby office. The 
visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: "What is wrong?" The custom 
official explained: "Your name coincides with that of another 
person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is your age -- 
the custom official complicated matters even more so -- and he 
is registered as a drug trafficker." The foreign visitor 
indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: "That cannot be." 
He complained: "I was president of the Republic and fought drug 
trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. Let me 
phone the U.S. ambassador in my country." 
  The former president managed to get through: "Ambassador, I 
am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a 
drug trafficker with my name." He explained his problem 
sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: "Yes, they 
have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is 
a computer problem." The ambassador promises to do his best, 
saying: "We will resolve the problem." 
  It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90 
minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the 
former president was able to comply with the immigration red 
tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression 
that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning. 
  This anecdote is an example of the political language of 
"demonstrations," like military maneuvers, street 
demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose goals 
-- which exceed their disclosed purposes -- are uncovered, 
sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or 
speculation. 
  The case of the former president delayed by an immigration 
agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres 
Rodriguez -- who perfectly fits the antihero in the anecdote -- 
made to the U.S. Government about handing over the protectors of 
drug trafficking and dismantling their infrastructure. 
  If for the political process the transition meant building 
the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of 
the political institutions and elect -- based on these 
conditions -- the first civilian president, for the U.S. 
Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for 
drug traffickers. 
  The United States was especially concerned about this 
because 
the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed 
Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the Executive 
Branch. The proposal to "dignify" the Armed Forces by the 
rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S. 
aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from 
engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities 
in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state 
resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who 
protect traffickers. 
  The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if 
military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who 
will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges, 
of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone? 
More than four years of transition government have elapsed and 
the strategists received the expected answer: The process to 
dignify the Armed Forces failed -- we have the disastrous 
example of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General 
Bernal who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling 
of the Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly 
upset the United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the 
first stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of 
the members of the high command were and are trapped by links 
related to commitments and protection. 
  The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of 
stones that should have been cast was transferred to [President 
Juan Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under 
the vertical domain regarding military issues of a very 
ambitious general. The situation remains unchanged: The process 
to dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed 
Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous 
facade of a civilian government. 
  So, in view of the careful protection granted from high 
spheres to traffickers -- detected and monitored by U.S. 
intelligence -- it was decided to materialize a plan under which 
U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build 
schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San 
Pedro Department as "training for the shipment of construction 
material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War," as 
Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this 
project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and 
direct: One typical "demonstration" that the U.S. troops 
sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a "Persian 
Gulf-type" intervention in Paraguayan territory. 
  Everyone understood the message of the "demonstration" of 
the 
military social actions. The less discreet commented that 
"there are concealed purposes," without understanding the 
opportuneness of the maneuver. 
  "There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the 
country," commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus 
supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and 
allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the 
dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general. 
For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the 
arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the 
privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted 
the "demonstration." 
  Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of 
protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first 
impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So, 
on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to 
Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to 
the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint 
actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly 
established -- Congress having approved the project it should be 
noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights -- 
the operation zones must be restricted, the importation of 
weapons restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel 
to enter the country should be disclosed, and that it should be 
clearly established whom will be granted privileges and 
immunity. Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the 
old yankee anti-imperialist wave. 
  This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken 
aback by the offense, commented that "similar offers to other 
Latin American countries were never rejected." General Oviedo, 
as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3 
February, asked journalists: "Do you think we would reject 
something that benefits the Armed Forces?" Military strategists 
read between lines: "The interests of the protectors?" The 
almost dramatic answer was: "We have withdrawn the draft bill, 
but beware the consequences." Watch out. 
  That same evening a cable television channel showed a 
documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega 
was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another 
"demonstration"? 
  One can expect anything if this relationship between the 
United States and the military leadership continues to be simply 
horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the 
computer screens in the future?

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish at 0200 GMT on 2 February broadcasts its regularly 
scheduled 60-minute weekly "Democracy 94" program which this 
week consists of a live interview with Ernesto Perez Balladares, 
presidential candidate for the Revolutionary Democratic Party, 
PRD, by "Democracy 94" host Hugo Enrique Famania. 
  Famania begins by giving the following resume: "Dr. Ernesto 
Perez Balladares has a Ph.D. in Economics and Business 
Administration from a U.S. university. He was born in Panama 
City on 28 June 1946 and spent most of his youth in Chiriqui 
Province. He was Citibank's corporate credit manager for Panama 
and Central America in 1971. He entered public life as a member 
of the Legislative Commission in 1975. Perez Balladares was 
minister of finance and treasury and of planning and economic 
policy during President Basilio Lakas' administration; President 
Aristides Royo kept him as minister of planning and economic 
policy; and President Ricardo de la Espriella appointed him 
general manager of IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and 
Electrification]. He also stands out as member of the 
negotiating team for the 1977 canal treaties. His political 
life began when the PRD was founded in 1979. He rose in this 
organization, which was the political arm of the military 
regime, and went from grass-roots group president -- the lowest 
echelon in the party's organizational chart -- to PRD general 
secretary in 1982. His estrangement and reserve with the 
party's line goes back to when Manuel Antonio Noriega was made 
commander of the then National Guard in 1983. His coolness 
increased after the 1984 elections. This attitude, however, 
contrasts with his decision to accept the appointment to be the 
campaign manager for Colina [National Liberation Coalition] 
presidential candidate Carlos Duque Jaen in 1989. After the 20 
December 1989 U.S. military action, he assumed a more critical 
and active position in the PRD. He actively participated in the 
party's internal reorganization and won the PRD internal 
election to again occupy the post of general secretary in 1992. 
He was elected presidential candidate for the May 1994 
elections at the PRD convention held on 31 July 1993, and thus 
became the first elected citizen to run for this position. 
Since then, the polls indicate that his popularity ratings have 
increasingly expanded and currently place him as the front 
runner." 
  After this profile, Famania asks Perez Balladares why he 
distanced himself from the PRD in 1983 to return later as 
Duque's campaign manager. He replies that the party had 
requested that he be Duque's campaign manager in an electoral 
process that was very difficult and was practically lost. He 
adds: "I could have refused but this would have been disloyal 
to my party. I assumed my responsibility at the time and 
absolutely do not regret anything I did." Famania asks the 
candidate what his position was when the military tried to cheat 
in the 1989 elections. Perez Balladares replies that his 
management of the Duque campaign ended on election day and that 
Duque and himself had recommended that the government "and those 
who gave orders at the time" accept Guillermo Endara's victory 
and that "Mr. Noriega try to find an honorable solution to his 
situation." 
  Famania mentions that the PRD lost the 1989 elections 
overwhelmingly and has now appeared, with him as a candidate, 
for the 1994 elections and is leading all the polls. The 
candidate explains that the PRD is a totally new party, which 
has been reorganized democratically and thus become much 
stronger. Famania notes that analysts have stated that the PRD 
has received positive poll ratings because it started 
campaigning before the rest of the parties. Perez Balladares 
laughs and says: "I believe that is wishful thinking by our 
opponents." 
  Famania recounted that the Arnulfist Party candidate has 
called "all the political parties to unite in a large civil 
alliance against the PRD" and asks Perez Balladares if he thinks 
such an alliance is possible. The PRD candidate says he does 
not know if it is possible but notes that this alliance is based 
on vested economic interests and "not based on programs to solve 
the country's problems." The candidate adds that the PRD will 
contend with the candidates its opponents present and that they 
will continue with their campaign "to explain our programs, 
proposals, solutions, and the opportunities we hope to offer. 
The Panamanians will be the ones to decide on election day." 
  Famania asks him if the PRD will form alliances to control 
the Legislative Branch and Perez Balladares answers that the 
word alliance has been used in an attempt to unite forces to 
parcel out the country and that "what we really need is for all 
sectors in the country to reach a national agreement" to lead 
the country through the especially delicate period of the turn 
of the century. 
  Famania asks: "Don't you think the PRD's ties with the 
last period of the military regime could negatively impact your 
popularity rating?" He replies: "I believe it is evident that 
a return to the past, in addition to being stupid, is absurd. 
The immense majority of Panamanians understand this is totally 
impossible, even if someone, who would not be us, wanted to 
return to the past. We do not propose a return to any past 
system, but there are people who seem to be anchored to such an 
idea. They can only see the country as it existed in 1989. Let 
me tell you something: The people and country demand that we 
solve the problems of today, 1994, not the ones of 1989." 
  Famania asks Perez Balladares if he would be willing to 
bring 
Noriega back to Panama to have him complete his prison sentence 
here; the candidate dismisses emphatically this possibility, 
adding: "We have many problems to solve in the future. We have 
a big national challenge and cannot distract ourselves with 
subterfuges, such as bringing people back to the country, 
persecuting people, carrying out retaliations, or digging up 
past issues. We have much to do ahead of us. We do not have 
time for this." 
  The program host mentions that Balladares has promised to 
build an expressway to Colon and other works if he wins the 
elections and asks how he plans to finance them. The candidate 
answers: "They are not promises. I have presented proposals to 
the country. My proposals are based on the need to find quick 
alternatives to promptly solve our serious unemployment problem, 
which will be my government's number one priority." He adds: 
"How will they be financed? The works will be financed in the 
same way they have been financed by all the developing 
countries; the private sector and the government join efforts to 
carry them out. All our proposed works can be carried out 
effectively. I have already received concrete offers from three 
firms to build the Panama-Colon expressway." 
  Famania says it has been noted that the firm that builds the 
expressway will not recover its investment within the 20-year 
term established by the law. He asks if the PRD plans to change 
the laws, to which Balladares replies: "We will have to give 
the firm that builds the road the necessary time for it to 
recover its investment and make a reasonable profit." The 
program host asks if his government would invest in such works, 
and Balladares answers: "There has to be a participation. I 
believe the government--in the extent that we generate internal 
savings--will have to participate together with the private 
firms." Famania then asks how will the government "generate 
internal savings," and Perez Balladares says: "Savings are 
obtained with an austere government program." 
  Famania broaches the issue of privatization, saying the PRD 
maintains that public services should not be privatized. He 
asks: "Isn't this a bit like swimming upstream, because all the 
countries are privatizing their public services to make them 
more efficient?" Balladares says: "We say there are basic 
services that have to be government monopolies. One of them is 
the Idaan [National Water and Sanitation Institute]. I believe 
water is a priority item in any country and that it must be 
managed by the government. Another item is the distribution of 
electricity. There is no incentive for any private firm to 
implement a rural electrification program, because it is not 
profitable. For the government such a program is fundamental to 
integrate the marginal population, mostly in the interior of the 
Republic, to the country's development." He adds: "To talk about 
an out-an-out privatization process or to oppose such actions 
based on an ideological premise is a mistake. As a government, 
we have to do the things that will provide more social benefits, 
be it with private, public, or mixed firms." 
  Famania questions the benefits of having the government 
manage basic services, which are not offering quality service. 
The candidate says: "I believe some of those services can be 
privatized, because the government does not have the needed cash 
flow to increase or improve the services rendered by those 
institutions. Somehow, those services--especially the ones I 
mentioned--must continue to further national development and, 
thus, must be controlled by government." He adds: "Let me tell 
you something else: Those services are not efficient, because 
we made the last investments to produce water, for example. We 
built the Chilibre water-processing plant a long time ago. 
Nothing else has been done in this field. What was the last 
major thoroughfare built to alleviate the serious traffic 
problem in Panama City? It was the Tumba Muerto Avenue, which 
we built in 1971 or 1972, more than 20 years ago. Nothing more 
has been done since then." 
  Famania says the current economic order is different to the 
one that existed in the 1970's, and he asks if a PRD government 
will be able to build such works now. The PRD candidate 
emphatically answers affirmatively. "We can do so because we 
are creative and will involve the private sector, unions, and 
all public and private organizations interested in solving the 
country's problems," he added. 
  Famania asks Perez about the PRD candidates filling the 
ballot as presidential and vice presidential candidates -- 
instead of "splitting the cake" -- in spite of the alliance with 
the Labor Party, PALA, and the Liberal Party. Perez responds 
that the cake belongs to the Panamanian people and adds: "The 
fact that we have achieved an alliance or a concerted effort to 
be able to carry out a work program by broadening the 
participation to other political parties while maintaining our 
original proposal, clearly means that we are definitely not 
willing to distribute political spaces but, instead, to carry 
out a program for national solutions with those persons in our 
political group, our friends who now share with us this 
concerted effort, and other sectors -- independent or from other 
parties -- who have the capacity for the job. The best men for 
the public offices." 
  Famania goes on to ask about the plans for fighting 
unemployment and Perez answers that the way to fight 
unemployment is to attack the root of the problem which, in his 
opinion, is the lack of proper education. Perez claims 
education is not currently directed at the available job market. 
He says they propose an integration of private enterprise with 
the different universities and training centers so that, and 
together with the Government, they can guide education toward 
the jobs that will be available at the beginning of the 21st 
century and in accordance with the demands from investors. 
  Then Famania says that the continuous teachers strikes will 
be an to that goal and Perez contends that the last teachers 
strike was one of the many wars caused by former Comptroller 
General Ruben Dario Carles, of which he won none. 
  Perez criticizes the way the Current Government lost the 
golden opportunity it had for buying the foreign debt and claims 
his government would deal with the commercial foreign debt. 
  Later the two discuss the security in Panama and Perez says 
that for the citizens' safety there must be a professional 
police force and that a civilian must be kept at the head of the 
police force. He adds: "What happens is that, according to the 
very persons who have been dealing with the topic over the last 
four years, there has been a policy of not backing, economically 
-- and mainly from Mr. Carles' Comptroller's Office -- the 
professionalization programs for that police force." Famania 
then claims that young men do not want to be policemen due to 
the low salaries and Perez responds that professionalizing the 
police also means increasing their salaries. 
  Regarding the borders, Perez says the border with Colombia 
must be watched by a professional force to control the illegal 
aliens and drug trafficking. 
  On the subject of the defense needs of the Panama Canal in 
accordance with the Canal Treaties, Perez says that an army is 
not necessary for the defense of the Panama Canal, that such a 
claim "was a subterfuge used to justify the [Panama] Defense 
Forces [PDF] that were created. That absurd mistake cannot be 
committed again. We do not need that; for the protection of the 
Panama Canal areas we need the same type of protection used for 
industrial installations anywhere in the world." 
  Famania then asks whether he would use former officers of 
the 
PDF as advisers, and Perez says that he has said many times 
before that that stage is over and there is no going back. He 
adds: "Those officers -- former officers of the Armed Forces -- 
have every right to participate as civilians in Panama's 
civilian life, but they will never be reintegrated [into the 
armed forces]." 
  Famania asks about the proposal to lower the retirement age 
and Perez says they will study the topic and that he does not 
believe that it is fair that different workers have the same 
retirement age, particularly those whose bodies suffer greater 
physical wear. About political persecution Perez says he is 
already working on what he believes is the clue to good 
administration of justice: a good attorney general. 
  Asked about the possibility of massive layoffs, Perez says 
he 
knows the vast majority of the public workers will vote for him 
and that there will be no layoffs. 
  Finally, with regard to a political amnesty, Perez says that 
topic has passed to a third plane, that those who were unfairly 
in jail for political crimes have already been released, and 
that those who have been sentenced will have to serve their 
sentences. 
  Asked about his alleged renovation in spite of maintaining 
his ties to the same persons involved in the past regime, Perez 
responds that that is a false insinuation and his government 
would use the most capable Panamanians regardless of their 
political affiliation.

  [Text] The main political parties today officially 
registered their respective presidential candidates for the 
elections to be held in May. 
  The first party to do so was the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party], then the Papa Egoro Movement, the 
Arnulfist Party and the Liberal Party, and finally the Morena 
[National Renewal Movement], Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement], and Civic Renewal Party. 
  With the registration of the candidates headed by Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber on the one hand, and Ruben Dario Carles on the 
other, the possibility of an alliance that would group the civic 
[civilistas] forces that struggled against Manuel Antonio 
Noriega's regime has been frustrated. With these four [number 
as heard] slates the political panorama is clarified and the 
uncertainty about the presidential candidacies disappears. 
  Now, only the Solidarity Party and the Democratic Christian 
Party have yet to register their candidates. Last week, Jose 
Salvador Munoz registered as presidential candidate for the 
Doctrinaire Panamenist Party. 
  In accordance with the electoral scheme, there are seven 
candidates for president of the Republic in the first free and 
democratic elections to be held after over 20 years of military 
dictatorships.

  [Text] Businessman Eduardo Vallarino, who on 6 February was 
nominated as the presidential candidate for the Christian 
Democratic Party (PDC), said that today more than ever his party 
is united to "take the bull by the horns" [reference to 
presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Valladares, whose nickname 
is "Toro," which means bull] and to "tie the bell on the cat" 
[reference to presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles, who 
usually wears a bow tie, or "gatito," which also means little 
cat]. 
  Vallarino, who was confirmed during the PDC convention held 
yesterday at the Cosita Buena Ballroom, said that "there is an 
atmosphere that makes PDC members feel stronger than ever. I 
assure you that if we are united, we will take the bull by the 
horns and tie the bell on the cat," Vallarino stressed, 
receiving applause from the large crowd that filled the popular 
dance hall. According to Vallarino, today more than ever "the 
green machinery" is starting to move with all its force. 
  A special PDC National Congress was held yesterday to 
confirm 
Eduardo Vallarino as its presidential candidate, replacing 
Ricardo Arias Calderon, who declined the candidacy for health 
reasons. Raul Ossa and Rene Orillac were confirmed as first and 
second vice presidential candidates, respectively. 
  In a statement for the media, PDC Legislator Raul Ossa said 
that the PDC has now emerged as an alternative for the 
Panamanian people, as there is a large percentage of Panamanians 
who are undecided about the candidate of their preference. PDC 
Legislator Erick Fidel Santamaria said that although Arias 
Calderon is not currently leading the party, the PDC is stronger 
than ever today. 
  Eduardo Vallarino, former president of the National Council 
of Private Enterprise (CONEP) stressed the need to work hard so 
Panamanians "can smile again" and recover their confidence in 
democratic institutions. "I must say, without any doubt, that we 
have the necessary strength to win the May 1994 elections," he 
added. 
  Vallarino noted how important it is at this time for 
Panamanians to change the attitude of hopelessness and look 
forward to a better future. "We have a pact, which is a firm 
commitment with the people..." he stressed. According to 
Vallarino, the Panamanian people cannot go on living amid 
uncertainty and instability. He also urged Panamanians not to 
forget the actions of the past dictatorship.

  [Text] The new ministers of President Guillermo Endara 
Galimany's cabinet took office today. The ceremony took place in 
the Yellow Hall of the Presidential Palace in the presence of 
President of the Republic Guillermo Endara Galimany and Vice 
President Guillermo Ford. 
  The main changes in President Endara's work team affected 
the 
Government and Justice Ministry, the Finance and Treasury 
Ministry, the Labor Ministry, the Health Ministry, and the 
Housing Ministry. This restructuring takes place after the 
members of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement] party decided not to support the Arnulfist Party's 
presidential candidate, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  [Begin recording] [Education Minister Marcos Alarcon, 
identified by caption] You cannot govern with your enemies. I 
think the president's decision was correct. He has surrounded 
himself with those whom he believes due to the commitment they 
have to the history and memory of Dr. [Arnulfo] Arias. They are 
willing to give the best of themselves so that President 
Endara's administration can end with great achievements. 
  [Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas, 
identified by caption] Believe me when I tell you that the 
president's request that I remain in my office as planning 
minister has definitely flattered me. And that request was made 
because at the Ministry we are dealing with affairs of the 
utmost importance for our country. [end recording] 
  Three members of Molirena and two Arnulfists were replaced 
in 
President Endara's government team. 
  Jacobo Salas was appointed to the Government and Justice 
Ministry; Jose Raul Mulino was appointed to the Foreign 
Ministry; Marcos Alarcon to the Education Ministry; Jose Antonio 
Dominguez to the Public Works Ministry; Victor Juliao to the 
Finance and Treasury Ministry; Gregorio Ordonez to the Labor 
Ministry; Jose Remon to the Health Ministry; Ricardo Fabrega to 
the Commerce and Industry Ministry; Rodrigo Sanchez to the 
Housing Ministry; Delia Cardenas to the Planning and Economic 
Policy Ministry; Cesar Pereira Burgos to the Agricultural 
Development Ministry; and Ivonne Young to the Presidency 
Ministry.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, 29 Jan (NOTIMEX)-- Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today concluded a working 
tour in this city where he participated in the World Economic 
Forum and where he met with political and business leaders from 
around the world. 
  On his last day of activities, the Mexican president was the 
main speaker at the forum's morning session. In his speech he 
pointed out the need for greater North-South coordination in 
matters related to technology, industrial production, and 
monetary and fiscal policy. 
  He stressed that since 1990 the world has been changing, 
and, 
in turn, Mexico has decided to be bold in promoting its 
international trade policies. This is why it stepped up the 
negotiations on NAFTA which was implemented on 1 January. 
  Salinas said: "Faithful to its diversification policy, 
Mexico 
has already signed a trade agreement with Chile and has made 
progress in similar projects with Colombia, Venezuela, and the 
Central American nations." He also stressed the reform process 
undertaken by his government in recent years, and he pointed out 
the importance of fitting together economic, political, and 
social reforms. "This means achieving economic efficiency with 
social justice," he noted. 
  At the forum, Salinas de Gortari also made reference to the 
events taking place in the Mexican southern state of Chiapas, 
indicating it is a local problem in a region that suffers 
extreme poverty. He asserted that to resolve this conflict 
"wrong methods used in other parts of the world in the fifties 
and sixties and even in the seventies will not be used." 
  Although it is true that there are economic and social 
inequalities in Chiapas, the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
revolt "is not an Indian revolt but, rather, it is a trained 
revolt, prepared and led by a group that upholds a radical 
ideology." 
  After taking part in the World Economic Forum, the Mexican 
president concluded his working visit, which even included a 
series of interviews with diverse international personalities. 
Salinas de Gortari met with a group of important businessmen at 
an event organized by the Mexican Investment Council, led by its 
president Jaime Alatorre. 
  Salinas de Gortari also met with Pakistan's Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto with whom he took up both nations' bilateral 
relations. They also discussed in a cordial fashion other 
issues of common interest. 
  During his meeting with OECD Director Jean Claude Paye, he 
discussed the world economic outlook, the evolution of the 
Mexican economy, and the process Mexico must go through to join 
that organization, slated for the second half of 1994. 
  President Salinas de Gortari also met with Switzerland's 
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotta, during which the economic and 
political process in Europe was analyzed. He also held a 
meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on the 
Middle East peace process. He also met with Leon Brittan, head 
of the EC Trade Commission, with whom he discussed the process 
of European integration as well as Mexico's economic and trade 
relations with that region. 
  At the conclusion of his activities at Davos, the Mexican 
president traveled to Zurich to board the Mexican Air Force's 
TP-01 "Presidente Juarez" presidential plane to return to the 
Mexican capital where he is expected to arrive tonight.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Foreign 
Secretary Manuel Tello stressed today the points of agreement on 
foreign policy that exist between Mexico and Cuba, on the 
occasion decorating Cuban Ambassador Jose Fernandez de Cossio 
with the Order of the Aztec Eagle. 
  The Mexican foreign secretary said that the struggle in 
defense of international law, respect for the principles of 
self-determination and sovereignty, and juridic equality between 
states are of singular value for Mexico and Cuba. The diplomat 
hosted a farewell dinner and decorated the Cuban ambassador to 
Mexico with the Order of the Aztec Eagle. For Mexicans and 
Cubans, the teachings of poet Jose Marti are equally important 
in stressing that "liberty has a high cost and it is necessary 
to renounce living without it or buying it at its cost," he 
stated. [sentence as received] 
  Speaking to the diplomatic corps accredited to Mexico and in 
the presence of Maria de los Angeles Moreno, president of the 
Great Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, Tello said that the 
two countries have an irrevocable sense of defense and 
preservation of liberty. 
  Recognizing the work of Fernandez de Cossio during his 10 
years at the head of the Cuban mission in Mexico, the foreign 
minister noted that his professionalism contributed to 
strengthening dialogue and cooperation between the two 
countries. Tello noted that in the past years bilateral 
relations grew and were strengthened, while commercial and 
economic ties and cooperation programs in science, culture, 
technology, and education experienced important development. 
The Mexican foreign secretary stressed the diplomat's merits 
that earned him the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which since 1935 
is given to friends of Mexico.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Feb (EFE) -- Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
the official presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), has said the presidential elections 
scheduled for August in Mexico are being threatened by political 
forces aimed at "marring the process." 
  "If we do not work to hold clean elections, there will be 
those ready to mar the process and set the stage for conflicts 
and negotiations outside the law," Colosio has told his party 
members in Colula, a town in Puebla State, central Mexico. 
  The presidential elections assumed a new meaning after the 
Indian uprising that took place on 1 January in Chiapas State, 
southeastern Mexico. 
  The Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) declared war on 
the government to demand solutions to poverty and other matters 
of political concern related to the presidential elections. 
  In the 21 August elections, approximately 42 million 
registered Mexican voters will elect the president, 300 
deputies, and 126 senators among the candidates of nine 
political parties. 
  Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, spokesman of the third 
parliamentary 
bloc, the opposition PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], 
told EFE today the electoral environment "is weak, given an 
outdated legislations was enacted to favor the government party." 
  Ramirez added: "The current legislation approved in 1993 
allows electoral manipulation by the government and its party." 
  The spokesman has reiterated the need to convene the Mexican 
Congress to special sessions to revise the rules on which the 
elections are based and to sign an agreement that will guarantee 
calm elections. 
  According to Ramirez Cuellar, the financial ceiling set for 
the electoral campaign, fixed at $40 million for each candidate, 
"is still too high; besides, there is no strict control" of this. 
  Another aspect that contributes to the weakening of the 
electoral environment, he said, is the media's partiality "to 
the extent that we want the media to be regulated so that equal 
access" is allowed to all political parties. 
  PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo has said the debate on 
political reforms would help the negotiators in Chiapas achieve 
true and lasting peace, based on clear and open elections. 
  Meanwhile, PRI Deputy Juan Ramiro Robledo says his party is 
willing to discuss the possibility of holding special sessions, 
because "we have a responsibility, and we must find points of 
consensus." 
  The deterioration of the electoral environment increased 
after the daily LA JORNADA received anonymous threats from an 
anticommunist front for being considered an EZLN mouthpiece. 
  After the threats, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari expressed his solidarity with the daily. 
  The Mexican presidential candidates are Luis Dolando 
Colosio, 
PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party; 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National 
Opposition Union; and Cecilia Sot, of the Labor Party; Rafael 
Aguilar Talamantes, Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party; Jorge Gonzalez Torres, Mexican Green Ecologist Party; 
Marcela Lombardo Toledado, Popular Socialist Party; and Alvaro 
Perez Trevino, Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections, 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. Today, Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, PRI, visited the Benito Juarez and Ixtapalapa 
neighborhoods in Mexico City as part of his political campaign. 
In both neighborhoods, several people asked him to adopt 
measures to prevent police abuse and to increase security. 
Colosio said he will not let Mexican children, women, and youths 
live with the threat of assault, robbery, abuse, or violence. He 
added that PRI is the party of peace and tranquility. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 29 Jan 94) 
  Upon returning from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Diego Fernandez 
de 
Cevallos, presidential candidate for the National Action Party, 
PAN, was interviewed at the International Airport in Mexico 
City. He referred to the agreements signed on 28 January at the 
Federal Electoral Institute, saying they are the result of a 
serious effort by all political parties and electoral 
authorities. He said Mexico can have honest elections, as 
demanded by the people, and stressed no fraud can overcome the 
will of a people determined to have a certified government. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 29 Jan 
94) 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for 
the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, was in San Luis, Rio 
Colorado, Sonora on 28 January, where he attended a meeting with 
party members. He said agricultural policy for efficient 
production must be based on large investments and credits for 
crops and commercialization. He noted that it is necessary to 
recover the right to demand land from landowners and eliminate 
constitutional reforms that prevent peasants from demanding 
land. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 29 
Jan 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the 
Mexican 
Ecologist Party, PEM, ended a two-day campaign tour in 
Chihuahua. Gonzalez Torres said he is not seeking votes from the 
Indians, as most of them do not have the credentials to vote. He 
rejected any possible participation of foreign observers at the 
Mexican presidential elections. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 29 Jan 94) 
  On 31 January, PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas 
signed a document entitled Twenty Commitments for Democracy. He 
said this document represents progress in the transition to 
democracy and power by peaceful means. He proposed that all 
presidential candidates ratify this document on 5 February, the 
occasion of the 77th anniversary of the promulgation of the 1917 
Constitution. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  PEM Presidential candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres toured 
Mexico State. He said Diego Fernandez de Zevallos' attitude and 
the attitude of the system encourages a sterile bipartisan 
system that gives the impression of an apparent democracy, which 
only contributes to making Mexicans lose faith in political 
parties. He added that the proposal to the rebels by Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace in Chiapas, should have different 
conditions, guaranteeing democracy in Mexico with prior steps 
allowing for their incorporation into the country's political 
life. Finally, he said the government has totally failed to take 
care of social needs, and he added that corruption, dishonesty, 
and bureaucracy do not permit social justice. (Mexico City Canal 
13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  PRI National Leader Fernando Ortiz Arana said PRI 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio is a man desirous of 
making changes, with a solid PRI background, and the clear 
vision to carry out profound social reform. (Mexico City Canal 
13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  PRI Presidential Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio visited the 
House of Emiliano Zapata in Morelos State. He addressed 
thousands of peasants, who asked for his support. He recognized 
the cry for freedom and liberty is still a demand for justice. 
Colosio said if he won the presidency, he would work to 
incorporate the poorest Mexicans into a life of democracy and 
liberty. He added he will not tolerate corrupt government 
officials from poor communities, who arrive poor and leave rich. 
He recognized there have been offenses against the Indians' 
dignity. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 
2 Feb 94) 
  Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate for the Popular 
Socialist Party, visited Veracruz on 1 February. She expressed 
opposition to the presence of foreign observers at the 21 August 
elections. She said Mexicans are prepared to carry out peaceful 
and honest elections. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0435 GMT 2 Feb 94) 
  PEM Presidential candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres signed the 
Twenty Commitments for Democracy document, which was prepared 
based on proposals made by more than 300 citizens and presented 
by PRI member Demetrio Sodi. Gonzalez Torres recommended 
appointing national observers to the upcoming elections. (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 2 Feb 94)

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 5 Feb (EFE) -- 
Today, the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) called 
on Indian groups from the southern Mexican state of Guerrero to 
join their struggle. "Do not abandon us, do not let us die 
alone, do not let our struggle end in a vacuum," the EZLN said 
in a message released today, Saturday, and sent to the executive 
coordinating commission of the Guerrero State Council of Indian 
and Peasants Organization. 
  The communique came in reply to a letter by Guerrero Indian 
organizations, which includes representatives from the Amusgo, 
Mixtecos, Nahuatls, and Tlapenecos ethnic groups, and was 
delivered to the EZLN by its intermediary [Monsignor] Samuel 
Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  The EZLN called on the Guerrero Indian organizations to 
"take 
our blood as nourishment, fill your hearts and the hearts of all 
good men of this Indian and non-Indian land," but does not 
specify the type of support they request. "Brothers, let our 
path be the same for all: liberty, democracy, justice," the 
Zapatistas added. 
  Guerrero, located approximately 300 km south of Mexico City, 
is one of the states most analysts believe will show evidence of 
the EZLN movement. Recently, local police initiated an operation 
to search for guerrilla hideouts in this state's mountainous 
region. 
  The last Mexican guerrilla rebellion occurred in Guerrero in 
1970 with the Party of the Poor, founded by Lucio Cabanas, a 
rebellion subsequently controlled by the Armed Forces.

  [Text] Madrid, 7 Feb (AFP) -- In an interview with a 
private television channel, "Subcommander Marcos," military 
leader of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas, Mexico, has stressed 
that the Zapatist guerrillas have "forced the government to hold 
a dialogue." 
  "As never before, now that the dialogue is going to be held, 
the Zapatist Army needs civilian society," the subcommander said 
in a lengthy interview to be aired tonight, part of which was 
published in advance by the newspaper EL PAIS. 
  Marcos added, "The door to dialogue was finally opened at a 
decisive moment -- the moment when the federal government 
realized that the annihilation of our forces was, in the best of 
all cases, highly unlikely, and, in reality, impossible." 
  He said that despite everything, the Zapatists oppose 
holding 
the dialogue in the jungle, "because if Camacho (Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis) enters the jungle and 
something happens to him -- in other words, if they do something 
to him -- they are going to say it is our fault." Marcos went 
on to lament, "We cannot guarantee security here -- neither 
Camacho's nor Don Samuel's (Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz)." 
  Marcos also explained the majority of the guerrillas come 
from the jungle and the mountains. "For the comrade peasants, 
the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] was created as a 
self-defense force against the white guards of the ranch owners." 
  According to Marcos, the insurgents view the armed struggle 
"as part of a broader and more complex process that could have 
profound consequences." He clarified that at no time "has there 
been any support, not even blessing or approval by anyone from 
the Catholic Church." He also denied there was foreign support: 
"We do not think like the Maoists who believe that a peasant 
army, coming from the mountains, will besiege the cities." He 
added, "Our comrades only speak of autonomy, such as that of the 
Basques or Catalonians (in Spain), which is a relative autonomy." 
  The guerrilla leader also said, "We believe that large-scale 
military intervention against us is very unlikely." He 
concluded: "The federal government is the one that is worried. 
We think it is premature to speak of a U.S. intervention."

  [Text] A few minutes ago, we received a letter addressed 
expressly to Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network, 
signed by insurgent Subcommander Marcos. I will read it quickly 
for our viewers. 
  Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network, News 
Directorate, Federal District of Mexico, from Insurgent 
Subcommander Marcos, Indian Revolutionary Clandestine 
Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist Army 
of National Liberation], mountains of southeastern Chiapas, 
Mexico. 
  Gentlemen, a few minutes ago I was informed that on Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network's [3 February] evening 
newscast, a letter from reporter Francisco Rubio, who works for 
the station, was read. The letter was addressed to the EZLN and 
explained the events that occurred while he was covering the 
area under our forces' control. The letter explained the 
circumstances surrounding the offer to pay members of the EZLN 
in exchange for their statements. 
  With the approval of the CCRI-CG of the EZLN I hereby state 
the following: 
  1. The CCRI of the EZLN is satisfied with the explanation 
given by reporter Francisco Rubio, hails Mr. Rubio's attitude 
and that of Azteca's news directorate for broadcasting it, and 
is pleased that this regrettable misunderstanding has been 
clarified. 
  2. The CCRI of the EZLN is lifting its veto on Azteca 
Television's coverage of the peace and reconciliation talks 
between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN, with the 
mediation of Mr. Samuel Ruiz Garcia. 
  3. The EZLN hereby declares it will grant Azteca Television 
reporters and envoys, including Mr. Francisco Rubio, 
accreditation to coverage the event without any problem 
whatsoever. The EZLN will do all it can to facilitate their 
journalistic work within the territories under our control. 
  4. The EZLN hereby declares that if it is possible, it will 
be glad to meet with reporters from Azteca Television and other 
news media mentioned in its 29 January 1994 communique. 
  [Signed] Insurgent Subcommander Marcos, 3 February 1994.

Clandestine Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] to all nongovernment organizations and 
signed by Subcommander Marcos on 1 February; place not given -- 
read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine 
Committee-General Command of the EZLN respectfully addresses you 
all to make a polite request. As everyone knows, the initiation 
of the peace dialogue between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the 
EZLN is imminent. The fact that the dialogue is being held in a 
conflict area implies provocation risks that could hinder or bog 
the talks down. 
  With the purpose of minimizing unwanted rifts between the 
parties in conflict, it is necessary to form around the talk 
site a security or peace cordon, which can prevent the pressure 
or intimidation of one of the parties in conflict. We know the 
so-called nongovernment organizations have remained neutral in 
the present conflict, and they have always been concerned about 
the need to alleviate the serious conditions of the civilian 
population as well as to promote the peace efforts with dignity 
as sought by our forces and all honest Mexicans. 
  For the reasons mentioned above, we would like to 
respectfully ask you to form a peace cordon that can prevent 
both federal troops as well as those from the EZLN from meddling 
in the region surrounding the negotiation table. Let it be 
understood that this does not represent any commitment or 
support for our struggle's cause, and that we will continue to 
respect and greet your neutrality and humanitarian duty.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Rodriguez and Samuel Prieto in Chiapas State </F>
from the "Good Morning from Mexico" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] The place and date for the peace talks 
have not been confirmed yet as some security and logistics 
problems are still pending. It seems, however, the meeting will 
not take place in Ocosingo or Las Margaritas, bastions of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN. 
  On 6 February, well-informed sources mentioned two possible 
sites: Palenque, located approximately 200 km from San Cristobal 
de las Casas, which has good access roads, or Comitan, located 
approximately 80 km from San Cristobal de las Casas, an area 
with a great degree of EZLN influence. 
  In the early hours of 6 February, EZLN communiques were 
received in San Cristobal de las Casas demanding the 
establishment of security cordons by nongovernmental human 
rights organizations to provide more guarantees. Here is the 
reply given by Gerardo Pacheco, representative of the 
nongovernmental human rights organizations. 
  [Pacheco] We are now in the initial process of reviewing the 
possibilities of establishing security cordons. Right now we are 
trying to adequately interpret the letter addressed to us, after 
which we will decide how we will give the necessary support to 
the proposed security cordons. We are also waiting for reactions 
from nongovernmental human rights organizations in other parts 
of the country, as the letter is addressed to all Mexican 
nongovernmental human rights organizations. In that manner, we 
can organize and coordinate efforts to make possible the 
creation of security cordons providing specific guarantees 
proposed by the EZLN. 
  [Prieto] International Red Cross representative Maria Lude 
explained the Red Cross' role in establishing buffer zones in 
areas where the communities are becoming desperate. The creation 
of the so-called buffer zones in the Chiapas highlands has 
created some confusion among the people regarding the 
International Red Cross' role. 
  [Lude] I will take this opportunity to explain the 
International Red Cross Committee's role. As I said, our main 
concern -- and this is how we operate in all countries -- is 
finding out what the main needs are. Our representatives are now 
in the area, evaluating the people's needs, and if necessary 
they will propose ways to provide assistance. At the same time, 
there is a great solidarity movement in Mexico toward that zone. 
In no way will we prevent Mexicans from helping Mexicans. Our 
role will be limited, as I said, to reopening those areas, after 
which we will let national institutions do the work. I really do 
not think national institutions need our presence to carry out 
their work once the situation returns to normal. 
  In the past, it was confirmed they are efficient 
institutions, and if they really have the necessary assistance, 
we are not the ones to decide if people should or should not 
receive assistance by the Mexican people. What we will do is to 
work based on the people's needs, which is our policy. Once the 
zone is reopened, organizations willing to help can take over. 
  [Prieto] The entry of the International Red Cross Committee 
in the buffer zones does not mean all nutritional and medical 
problems will be resolved. 
  [Rodriguez] Sunday, 6 February was a normal day in San 
Cristobal and nearby communities. Apparently, everything was 
calm in the Chiapas highlands.

  [Text] Policemen and Special Services Unit agents are still 
at the site of the explosion evaluating the situation, trying to 
determine the exact amount of explosives that were used for the 
car bomb and assessing the resultant damage. 
  The bodies of the two newspaper and magazine distributors 
who 
were killed are still at Air Force Headquarters. They were in a 
light blue Datsun which bore license plates SG-6691. 
  I am going to speak with individuals who live across from 
the 
Air Force installations to see the condition of their homes, to 
ask them what they observed and how it was possible for a car 
bomb to explode at the headquarters. Certain residents have 
already informed us the explosion was possible, because at 
exactly 0600 the Air Force opens the street to allow vehicles to 
circulate freely in the area, and the subversives took advantage 
of that opportunity to place the car bomb. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 1314 GMT on 7 February carries a 
150-word report on the incident which adds: "The explosion took 
place on `8 July' Avenue, Santa Beatriz District. Broken glass 
injured an undisclosed number of pedestrians as well as 
individuals who were inside their homes. The explosion also 
damaged a bank, the Peruvian Telephone Company, and several 
homes. The police have made no disclosures regarding the 
possible perpetrators of the attack. The vehicle used for the 
car bomb has been described only as a Datsun."]

  [Text] Lima, 7 Feb (AFP) -- At least six persons were 
injured Monday evening in an escalation of dynamite attacks by 
the Maoist Shining Path against bank offices and public entities 
in the Peruvian capital, police have reported. 
  Attacks took place earlier today when Shining Path commandos 
detonated a car-bomb in front of the Air Force General Command, 
which killed two persons and injured 15 others, in addition to 
causing a large amount of damage. 
  The evening attacks affected four bank offices, two of which 
are the Banco de Credito and Interbanc. The explosions injured 
six pedestrians and partially destroyed the facade of the 
offices. Special police units alerted by telephone traveled 
through different parts of Lima and defused packages containing 
explosives near two state banks. A vehicle was found in the 
populous Yerbateros neighborhood, east of Lima, with a homemade 
rocket launcher inside that was about to go off. At least five 
explosions were registered in the outskirt districts of San Juan 
de Lurigancho and Comas, according to police reports. 
  Police stations increased their security in light of the 
possibility of Shining Path attacks and police patrols in 
strategic areas of the capital have been doubled. 
  The acts of violence reported Monday coincide with leaflet 
advertisements, which were delivered to editorial rooms of 
various Lima dailies, stating that the Shining Path is preparing 
to launch a wave of attacks in February.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] The "Cachique Rivera Clan" is a drug trafficking 
gang that is still free and continues to manufacture cocaine in 
Augaytia and in the Pozuzo Valley under the orders of the Cali 
Cartel. 
  None of its members have ever been arrested although the 
police have conducted several operations against it, both in the 
coca producing areas and in Lima where five stylish houses were 
searched in San Borja and La Molina. 
  The Cachique Rivera brothers, from Huanuco, is another 
family 
involved in large-scale trafficking. The Cachique Rivera family 
is perhaps the only drug gang authorized by the Cali Cartel to 
produce cocaine hydrochloride in Peru. 
  The Cachique Rivera family, originally residents of Rupa 
Rupa, Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department, mainly conduct 
their operations in the Pozuzo Valley, a jungle area in Pasco. 
They work from a big abandoned ranch that has a secret landing 
strip. They also operate in Aguaytia, Padre Abad Province, 
Ucayali Department. 
  Cocaine production is a task carried out exclusively by 
Colombians in their country, but the Cachique Riveras have 
achieved such an important organizational level that the Cali 
Cartel heads have allowed them a biweekly production of between 
400 and 500 kg of cocaine. 
  Chemists from Colombia, trained by their Peruvian employers, 
are in charge of transforming the cocaine paste into cocaine. 
  In November 1991, the Cachique Rivera family received a 
harsh 
blow from the antidrug forces when their laboratory in Boca de 
Santa Ana, Ycayali, was destroyed and 250 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride was seized. 
  About 100 kg of this seizure was "lost" in the offices of 
the 
Executive Agency for Drug Control, Ofecod. This scandal was not 
investigated and remains unpunished. 
  The Cachique Rivera family organization system is highly 
effective because none of its members were arrested during the 
police operation. Two years later they again evaded the 
security forces. 
  On 5 February 1993, the DEA invaded the Cachique Rivera 
hideout in Aguaytia and found a well-equipped laboratory, a 
sophisticated arsenal comprising UZI submachine guns, Remington 
repeater rifles, Star and Browning rifles, AKM rifles, hand 
grenades, and a highly- sophisticated communication system, 
including an Icon transceiver and Yaesu equipment. 
  Moreover, the antidrug force found 25 gallons of 100-LL type 
gasoline for small planes. 
  Three days later, and as a result of the questioning of 
those 
arrested in the operation -- Marina Saavedra Ramirez, Augusto 
Figueroa Garcia and Alicia Egoavil Grandez -- the police broke 
into the Cachique Rivera laboratory in Carachama, Aguaytia, on 
the Yurac River. 
  The antidrug force found 48 large containers of chemicals 
used in the manufacturing of drugs; 16 gallons of ammonia; 50 kg 
of potassium permanganate; 16 hammocks used in the drying of the 
cocaine paste; 10 zinc sheets; high-precision scales; six 
microwave ovens; a dozen generators, and even a beacon [faro]. 
  The quality of the infrastructure, which included electric 
water pumps, 50 primus stoves, metal sieves, and staples to feed 
two dozen people for three months, show the volume of the gang's 
production. 
  The Dinandro [Antidrug Division] again gave another blow to 
the Cachique Rivera family on 28 April 1993, but this time it 
was in Lima. 
  The antidrug police raided five stylish houses owned by the 
Cachique Rivera brothers. Two are located in the La Encantada 
and La Campina urban developments in Chorrillos; two on Breton 
and Tiziano Streets in San Borja; and one on Vina del Mar Street 
in the El Sol de La Molina urbanization development. They were 
valued at $500,000. 
  Other members of the gang were identified during these raids 
but they are still at large. They are: Armando Rivera Tanga, 
Maria Sanchez Rios, Isminia Espinoza Ascencia, Adrian Condor 
Meza and Gladys Escalante Aguilar. 
  Dinandro and the DEA office have reported that the chief of 
the trafficking gang is Abelardo Cachique Rivera, alias 
"Teniente" or "Negro". He was born on 20 September 1959 in 
Bagua Grande, Amazonas. 
  His second in command is Segundo Gaudencio, alias "Capitan" 
or "Guno." He was born on 3 December 1957, in Rupa Rupa, 
Leoncio Prado, Huanuco. 
  The police have also identified Adolfo, alias "Alferez", who 
was born on 20 November 1961; Nicolas, alias "Mayor", born on 30 
November 1953; Margarita, no known alias, born on 7 May 1964; 
all of whom were born in Rupa Rupa. 
  Also identified in the Dinandro files but reported as "at 
large" is the father of the clan, Gaudencio Cachique Rivera, 57 
years old, born in Lamas, San Martin. 
  A high-ranking Dinandro official said: "Cachique Rivera is a 
very well organized family gang that receives a very special 
treatment from the Cali Cartel. They produce cocaine 
hydrochloride in large quantities. They have been identified." 
  A well-informed U.S. Embassy source connected to the 
antidrug 
operation said he is aware of the activities of the Cacique 
Rivera brothers and described them as "an important trafficking 
gang that operates in Peru." 
  With the arrest of [Drug Kingpin] "Vaticano", and the damage 
to his organization with his arrest, the so-called "Cachique 
Rivera gang" has now gained a new level of importance. 
  The U.S. Embassy source said: "This gang moves a great deal 
of drug because they are cocaine manufacturers and hoarders." 
  The Dinandro office reports that in addition to 
"manufacturing" 1,000 kg of cocaine per month, the Cachique 
Rivera gang also "exports" 20 metric tonnes of cocaine paste per 
month to Colombia. 
  The members of the Cachique Rivera gang are being sought by 
the 7th Correctional Court and by the 13th Lima Instruction 
Court on charges of drug trafficking. They will most likely be 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Abelardo Caccique, alias "Teniente" or "Negro" frequently 
travels to Colombia to report on the gang's activities to its 
Cali Cartel chiefs. 
  A Dinandro officer said: "This gang is one of our immediate 
objectives. It is only a matter of time. We are working on it."

  [Text] Lima, 2 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The opposition minority in 
the Peruvian Congress criticized the ruling majority today for 
attempting to impose a dictatorship in Congress and hindering 
the legislature's supervision. 
  Six of the nongovernment parties and political groups 
represented in Congress characterized the approval of new 
commission staffs for the 1994 legislative period as arbitrary 
and antidemocratic. 
  The ruling Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition on 1 
February modified most of the 16 commissions, 13 of which will 
be chaired by the ruling coalition, two by groups allied with 
the government, and one by the opposition. 
  The removal of Roger Caceres, former Human Rights Commission 
chairman, and his replacement by progovernment Congressman 
Carlos Blanco prompted angry protests and a walk-out by 
opposition deputies. 
  According to critics, the ruling majority "will have in its 
hands another mechanism with which to continue covering up" 
violations of human rights in which "the state apparatus is 
presumably involved." 
  They mentioned as an example the disappearance of nine 
students and one professor from "La Cantuta" Teachers School in 
southeastern Lima following a military incursion on 18 July 1992 
by perpetrators who have not yet been punished. 
  "The year has opened with evidence that the ruling coalition 
will impose a dictatorship in Congress and will not listen to 
the opposition's proposals or their demands for participation in 
legislative and supervisory efforts," an opposition statement 
read. 
  The Moralizing Independent Front (Fim), Peasants and Workers 
National Front (FNTC), Democratic Left Movement (MDI), 
Independent Agrarian Movement (MIA), Democratic Coordinating 
Group (Code) and Popular Christian Party (PPC) have said the 
ruling coalition is trying to control the supervisory 
commissions. 
  Coalition Deputy Victor Joy Way, who has coordinated the 
preparation of the commission staffs, maintains the productivity 
and punctuality of its members were considered. 
  The MDI's Julio Castro Gomez said congressional regulations 
do not establish that every year the commission staffs must be 
modified, adding that every change requires two thirds of all 
the votes for approval. 
  The formation of the new commissions was only approved by 39 
of 80 members of the so-called Democratic Constituent Congress 
(CCD). 
  CCD President Jaime Yoshiyama said the staff of the ordinary 
commissions can be modified with the agreement of all the 
members of the working groups. 
  Yoshiyama expressed regret over the withdrawal of the 
opposition congressmen, and he announced the ruling majority is 
seriously working on the preparation of its own draft bills. 
  Joy Way, the CCD's second vice president, established a 
72-hour deadline for the opposition to present, by consensus, 
any changes of its representatives in the congressional 
commissions. 
  The ruling coalition controls the following commissions: 
constitution, supervision, production, justice, environment, 
human rights, decentralization and local governments, foreign 
relations, defense, health, budget, energy and economy. 
  Carlos Torres, who will continue at the head of the 
Constitution Commission, announced the work groups will be 
installed during the week, thereby dismissing the possibility of 
the modifications the opposition is demanding. 
  Torres said the Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition 
has 
every right to renew the chairman of the Human Rights 
Commission, and he acknowledged the work of Caceres, a member of 
the FNTC.

  [Text] One day before the State Council has the last word 
on the controversial presence of U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, 
President Cesar Gaviria admitted that a blunder occurred but 
that he will not back down. 
  The president this afternoon said that the soldiers building 
a school in Juanchaco will leave by the end of the month, when 
they will have completed their work, unless the State Council 
decides otherwise. Gaviria believes that his arguments are 
sound, however, because for over 40 years the presence of 
foreign military members for this or similar type of work have 
been based on international treaties, which the Congress 
approved in due course. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] These are engineers who train by 
assisting in the construction of river outposts. We have been 
of the opinion that this work is useful. Our rivers have been 
neglected in the past for lack of control and operational 
capability. The Defense Ministry has always regarded the work 
of these types of engineers as useful. [end recording] 
  Gaviria admits that the country has been misinformed about 
this work and that the Defense Ministry failed to inform him. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] In the future, this type of 
decision should be made by the president of the Republic, not so 
much from the legal standpoint, on which I think we are 
relatively safe, but for the practical benefit derived thereof. 
[end recording] 
  Gaviria denied the Juanchaco mission conceals a 
counternarcotics operation.

  [Text] Bucaramanga (Colombia), 7 Feb (EFE) -- Three people 
were injured today in one of four bomb attacks against four 
political party offices in cities in Colombia's Santander 
Department (in the northeast part of the country), including the 
department's capital of Bucaramanga, according to authorities. 
  Police report the explosive devices were activated by urban 
commando units of communist guerrillas from the National 
Liberation Army (ELN), which operates in Bucaramanga and the 
nearby towns of Giron, Floridablanca, and Piedecuesta. 
According to one source, three people in Giron were treated at 
a hospital for minor injuries they incurred in one of the blasts. 
  The offices that were attacked belonged to Aquiles Tores 
Breton, candidate for mayor of Bucaramanga; conservative 
candidate Jorge Humberto Mantilla; a civic movement in Giron; 
and Consuelo Duran de Mustafa in Piedecuesta. In December, 
other Santander political party offices belonging to candidates 
running in the 13 March congressional and municipal elections 
were also targets of similar bomb attacks in actions attributed 
to the ELN guerrillas.

  [Excerpt] The new Colombian Environment Ministry began 
operations this morning with the swearing in of its first 
minister, Manuel Rodriguez. From now on all public works, 
industry, and service projects will require an environmental 
license. 
  The new ministry will enjoy super powers to protect the 
environment and the country's renewable natural resources. Law 
No. 99 of 1993, which created the new ministry, gave it police 
duties and the authority to impose fines on violators of 
environmental norms. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The principal drug cartels are said to be financing 
the election campaigns of some candidates for the Congress, 
especially in Cauca Department. 
  The allegation about the influence of hot money [dinero 
caliente] in the political campaigns was made by Juan Jose Chaux 
Mosquera, currently a member of the House of Representatives. 
  The Liberal politician spoke with Fernando Garcia, this 
paper's correspondent in Popayan, and told him that in Cauca 
dirty money is already circulating in politics. 
  He lamented that several candidates for public office are 
accepting money from "friends of drug trafficking, which could 
impede peaceful debate, since it will lead to political 
corruption." 
  Although Chaux Mosquera did not reveal the list of persons 
aspiring to congressional office who are allegedly receiving 
financial backing from drug traffickers, he said it is easy to 
identify them since they are handing out large sums of money in 
northern Cauca. 
  In the halls of Congress there were insistent rumors during 
the last weeks of legislative activity that relatives of persons 
who have been linked to drug trafficking would be running for 
congressional office, especially in the Atlantic Coast region.

  [Text] Cauca representative Edgar Papamija Diago reaffirmed 
yesterday that it is certain that some political campaigns in 
northern Cauca Department are being financed with hot money. 
  He said that "the consciences of many persons from several 
municipalities have been bought off, having in mind the 1994 
election campaign." 
  The legislator supported the statements made by his 
colleague 
Juan Jose Chaux Mosquera who was one of the first to denounce 
the presence of drug money in political circles. 
  Papamija Diago promised to cooperate with Chaux Mosquera to 
investigate and reveal the names of those politicians who are 
buying votes, apparently with money obtained from drug 
trafficking. 
  Meanwhile, Senator Humberto Pelaez Gutierrez, a Liberal 
leader in northern Cauca, said that "one should bear in mind 
whether Congressman Chaux Mosquera made the statements while 
intoxicated or while sober," and Pelaez Gutierrez hopes to begin 
investigations aimed at clearing up such statements.

  [Excerpt] The president of the House of Representatives 
Second Commission, Lucas Lebolo Conde, denounced the use of 
large sums of money in the political campaigns in various 
municipalities of Atlantico and he said the Treasury Inspector 
should conduct an investigation. 
  The situation is so worrisome, judging from what other 
politicians have said, that some of them have decided to unite 
in a common front to defend their political territory because 
the money is coming from persons in other departments or outside 
the country. 
  He also asked Treasury Inspector Jorge Garcia and Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff to investigate the source of financing 
of the different candidates for Congress since "the fortunes 
spent in this department in the months of November and December 
are not in conformity with the stipulated legal standards for 
investing in campaigns." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Senator Claudia Blum de Barbieri said during a trip 
to Leticia that "the report concerning the circulation of drug 
money to support political campaigns is quite true." 
  She noted however that to control these sources of 
financing, 
the Treasury Inspector has been reviewing the candidates' 
financial books. She said however: "I don't know how well they 
will be able to cover up the ill-gotten money." She said further 
that the issue of the so-called hot money is not a new one since 
that money has been around for some time, especially in Valle 
Department.

<F P=106> [EL ESPECTADOR editorial: "Politics Heats Up"] </F>
  [Text] As was the case approximately 10 years ago, when 
drug trafficking money invaded election campaign coffers, the 
issue of the influence of drug money in politics is being 
stirred up again. Not because of a whim of those who valiantly 
denounce an act which is so abominable, but because there are 
indications--which perhaps could not be fully proven--of the 
intimate association, murky and punishable by law, between 
unscrupulous politicians and traffickers who seek support from 
persons in a position to decide the fate of many things. If Juan 
Jose Chaux and Lucas Lebolo Conde stated that certain aspirants 
in their departments have an abundance of money at their 
disposal, it is because--in the absence of tracks which all 
those involved seek to erase--the millions which finance the 
politicians are circulating and thus ensure loyalty to the 
generous donor. 
  It is said there will be filters to prevent what is already 
a 
shameful reality for our parties, and that the controls will 
prevent those Colombians, who more than anyone else should 
preserve their political and moral transparency, from being 
bribed on a continuing basis. But for some time now we've talked 
of these things--of strict vigilance over the financial records 
and resources of these coffers--but the evil of the 
surreptitious and corrupting influence of this illicit traffic 
has not abated. On the contrary, its harmful effects persist and 
we see situations which bring dishonor to a political tradition 
of which we were proud. What occurred with extradition in the 
Constitutional Congress and now, in recent times, with the 
confiscation of property obtained as a result of drug 
trafficking are two dishonorable chapters which are a confusing 
mixture of vanity and cowardice. 
  It is not sufficient to have dismantled the infrastructure 
of 
a powerful cartel, nor to have eliminated its most prominent 
godfathers and capo regimes in order to reverse the unhealthy 
penetration of their harmful practices--from the bribing of 
consciences to indiscriminate or selective terrorist acts. Other 
less bloody, but nonetheless criminal and corrupting 
organizations, seek similar ends. Though they may use greater 
discretion, the attack on morality and on good political and 
administrative practices is of equal or greater magnitude. 
  It is no secret to anyone that there are cartels and 
independent traffickers throughout the breadth and length of 
Colombia. What's more, in every city in Valle Department there 
is a drug "trust" [preceding word in English] with a commander 
and troops. In the coastal region, the same thing. In Medellin, 
there is still a considerable presence. In Bogota, an old 
organization has lowered its profile, but has not ceased to 
defend its power. And even in jungle regions where the growth of 
businesses in many products attracts the voracity of the 
traffickers, very rich and powerful groups have formed which are 
independent of those operating in some of its municipalities and 
which continue to maintain an understanding with politicians in 
order to put themselves out of harm's way with regard to 
official action, whenever they need a favor from someone in 
public office, at whatever level. 
  As is evident, the above statements must be a cause of 
concern to public opinion and to the sectors of the country 
which vigorously reject the deterioration of our political class 
and its permeability to money derived from the deepest depths of 
crime. Criticisms such as those made by Enrique Gomez against 
the council members in Cartagena, and on which he will now 
expand citing new motives, as EL ESPECTADOR anticipated, 
reassure Colombians who view with alarm the increase of immoral 
activity by public officials in Congress, the assemblies, and 
the councils. 
  Together with the majority of our compatriots, we cherish 
the 
hope that those promised filters for the upcoming campaigns 
function effectively, and that the party leaders contribute, 
with a scrupulosity that will benefit the campaigns, so that the 
authorities feel the incentive of some political organizations 
prepared to rescue public life from the mire of concupiscence 
and not to serve as accomplices, out of purely electoral 
interests, to the owners of the putrid fiefs of our departments 
and municipalities. Our democracy will have lost much if its 
congressmen, deputies, council members, governors, and mayors 
are the product of the corrupting influence of crime or the 
intimidation of an insurgency also corrupted by its desire for 
riches.

  [Text] Retired Vice Admiral Juan Carlos Anchezar will be 
installed as State Intelligence Secretariat (SIDE) under 
secretary on 1 February to replace Jose Roberto Scopa. This 
announcement was made by President Carlos Menem during the 27 
January cabinet meeting at Government House. 
  The head of state informed his ministers that Scopa is 
stepping down from his post to become SIDE Secretary Hugo 
Anzorregui's aide as of 1 February. 
  The president reportedly told Scopa: "I am grateful to him 
for continuing to work and cooperate in this government 
department." As Media Secretary then reported, Scopa attended 
the cabinet meeting in lieu of Anzorregui in his absence. 
<H5>  National Security </H5>
  The government on 27 January made clear that governors will 
have to sit on "the National Security Council as permanent 
members as they request joining the council." 
  This information was provided in a decree issued by the 
Executive Branch and published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE on 27 
January. The decree clarifies the invitation made to governors 
in Article 11 of the law on national security (24059). 
  The decree added that in the current National Security 
Council "it is possible to notice that governors have not been 
expressly incorporated in the council as members. It is totally 
incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Constitution that 
provincial governors -- or government ministers, if power is 
delegated to them -- have not been requested to sit on the 
National Security Council while provincial police chiefs are 
already full members of it."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Vietnam Year Zero"] </F>
  [Text] The end of the commercial boycott against Vietnam 
ordered last night by the United States is one of the last 
consequences of the downfall of the Soviet empire. The entire 
huge network of influence, established when the USSR was one of 
the world superpowers, continues to undoubtedly collapse, little 
by little. 
  The 19 years of boycott harmed the postwar atmosphere and 
only nourished the Cold War, contradicting the destiny of the 
countries that, ultimately, live to coexist and not to nourish 
the causes of misunderstandings. Almost two decades after the 
day the United States withdrew from Vietnam, with the misfortune 
of 58,000 deaths (compared to 1.3 million Vietnamese in the 
north) and trauma that still prevails, the united Vietnam still 
continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world, while 
around it noncommunist countries in Southeastern Asia are 
experiencing almost sustained development. 
  The commercial rapprochement between the United States and 
Vietnam represents a major historic step toward their 
reconciliation. Talks the past few years have always been 
filled with passion. War veterans groups were the first to 
repudiate Clinton's initiative due to doubts still surrounding 
the fate of servicemen missing in action (the MIA's). According 
to the war veterans, there are still 2,200 U.S. soldiers missing 
in war whose fate, according to them, the Vietnamese Government 
has done nothing to clarify. The discord will continue to exist 
but efforts for an understanding have been strengthened. 
  Since late 1986, when the Vietnamese government renewed its 
leadership, retiring old war heroes -- favorite disciples of 
Uncle Ho, Secretary General Nguyen Van Linh has made 
self-criticisms: "The leadership's task today has changed. The 
style is also changing," he said as he proposed changes that 
entailed dismantling the centralized bureaucracy, "based on 
state subsidies that only brought suffering to the people." It 
was quite common to find youths in Vietnam, thousands of them -- 
mathematicians, computer experts, engineers or specialized 
workers -- in other brother socialist countries who, having 
returned, could not find a job or were being employed to do 
simple jobs. Moreover, the economic crisis, also aggravated by 
the war against the Khmer Rouge, forced thousands of Vietnamese 
to seek work abroad. The rice planted in the Mekong River is 
not enough to supply the entire south. Vietnam survived thanks 
to the constant aid granted by communist countries, until the 
Soviet empire collapsed. 
  Early last year the government launched a campaign against 
corruption, excessive red tape, the theft of government assets, 
ineptitude, and the lack of democracy. Since then the 
Vietnamese leadership has been seeking to adopt market economy 
principles without giving up its single party system. The U.S. 
embargo gradually was being lifted as envoys have held talks 
with Vietnamese leaders since the Bush administration. It is a 
good thing that President Clinton, who during his youth 
protested against the Vietnamese war and did not enlist to 
participate in it, has taken the decisive step to lift the 
resentment that has existed since 1975.

  [Text] Brasilia -- "I was deceived by the anti-imperialist 
speech of former President Fernando Collor," Cuban President 
Fidel Castro complained to Senator Amir Lando (PMDB-RO 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Roraima]), rapporteur for 
the CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] that led to 
Collor's impeachment. Castro was distressed by the uncomfortable 
situation caused by the Collor couple's visit to Cuba. Sen. 
Lando returned on 31 January from Cuba, where here attended the 
Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity and Peace. 
Pleased with the simplicity and sincerity demonstrated by Fidel, 
Lando comforted Fidel: "Collor has always been a good actor. 
He made that same good impression in Brazil, deceiving 35 
million people." 
  The incident ended by being a long subject during their 
conversation, which was about the two countries' economic 
situation and political and trade relations between Cuba and 
Brazil. Worried about the bad impression Collor's visit might 
have made on the former rapporteur for the CPI on PC [Paulo 
Cesar Farias], Fidel stressed to Lando that the former Brazilian 
president did not come to Cuba as an official guest nor did he 
receive him in an audience. 
  During the conversation, Fidel told the Brazilian senator 
that Collor had expressed his interest in visiting the island 
when he was still president of the Republic. Now, after the 
impeachment, Fidel says his reasoning was simple: Given that he 
is a common citizen, there is no reason to receive him with any 
special honors; this also does not justify any persecution by 
Cuba by prohibiting his visit.

  [Text] Brasilia -- In a final attempt to get its economic 
plan approved, the federal administration reached an agreement 
with the parties that oppose the constitutional reform. This 
action could seriously jeopardize the reform. With the backing 
of President Itamar Franco, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso and leaders of the proadministration PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] and the PMDB [Brazilian Social Movement 
Party] reached an agreement in Congress with the group of 
congressmen who oppose a constitutional reform. Under this 
agreement most of the provisional measures will be approved by 
27 January by suspending the sessions allocated to review the 
Constitution. "The approval of the economic plan is currently 
more important than the Constitutional reform," President Franco 
told his finance minister in the evening of 25 January when he 
authorized the agreement. 
  The government's decision to request that the economic plan 
be voted on first -- although it might endanger the 
constitutional reform -- exploded like a bomb in Congress. 
While the parties that oppose the reform celebrated the success 
of their strategy, the atmosphere in the corridors of Congress 
was one of tension, irritation, and great uncertainty. Bahia 
State Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, the PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] leader at the Chamber of Deputies, protested: "The 
government is showing its inability to negotiate and to ensure 
the approval of its proposals." Magalhaes and the other leaders 
are in favor of the constitutional reform and could not hide 
their pessimism. They believe the constitutional reform is 
definitively at risk. According to one important congressman, 
who is in favor of the constitutional reform: "If the situation 
continues, the debates will not begin until after the Carnival 
holidays. This would mean that the constitutional reform work 
will coincide with the beginning of the presidential elections 
campaign and the announcement of candidacies." 
  Deputy Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, 
PMDB - Rio Grande do Sul), the constitutional reform rapporteur, 
tried his best to look optimistic and calm. Pretending to agree 
with the postponement, he said: "There is an important reason 
for postponing the debates. The provisional measures will not 
be in effect tomorrow." Nonetheless, in private talks with 
party leaders -- particularly those of the ruling parties -- he 
did not hide his irritation against the governmentleaders, 
especially against Humberto Lucena (PMDB - Paraiba), who 
presides the Senate and the constitutional reform work. He 
said: "He (Lucena) is responsible for all this confusion because 
he is making no effort to have the provisional measures voted on 
or to begin the constitutional reform work." 
  Jobim has a trump card that can be used to speed up the 
voting: The reform reducing the quorum required for the approval 
of the constitutional amendment creating the Social Emergency 
Fund is important for the government. Jobim explained that the 
approval of this year's budget depends on this amendment, which 
links the government's revenue to this fund. "If the amendment 
is not approved, there will be no budget resources," he said. 
This trump card will be placed on the negotiation table today. 
Deputy Gustavo Krause (PFL - Pernambuco), the deputy 
rapporteur, said: "If that does not work, there will be no 
constitutional reform." 
  The PFL leader, who is coordinating the conservatist bloc 
for 
the beginning of the constitutional refom debates, did not hide 
his dismay. He said: "I will not say the reform will only be 
voted on after the Carnival holidays because I am in favor of 
the reform and will not say anything to favor those who oppose 
it." In the last two weeks, Magalhaes managed to persuade 340 
deputies to come to Brasilia by promising that the 
constitutional reform debates would start soon. "This has not 
occurred and I wonder if -- when summoned next week -- they will 
respond as promptly as they did now, because that week 
immediately precedes the Carnival holidays."

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Popular Party [PP] yesterday held 
its national convention, and put forward the presidential 
candidacy of former Parana Governor Alvaro Dias. At the 
convention, which was held at the Senate plenary hall, the PP 
leadership sought to overcome the internal disagreements 
provoked within the party by the inclusion of three PP deputies 
and of Brasilia Governor Joaquim Roriz in the report filed by 
the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee]. 
  Dias, who is the PP president, said: "We are not going to 
prejudge anyone." He noted that although the PP would not 
condone corruption, it could not take any action before those 
involved in the scandal are tried. Deputy Roberto Magalhaes, 
the Budget CPI rapporteur, has recommended that the mandates of 
Deputies Flavio Derzi (PP-Mato Grosso do Sul), Paulo Portugal 
(PP-Rio de Janeiro), and Anibal Teixeira (PP-Minas Gerais) be 
canceled. Dias announced that these deputies will be expelled 
from the PP only if the Chamber of Deputies cancels their 
mandates. 
  After having been given a joyous welcome, Roriz delivered an 
emotionally charged speech. He defended the party's unity, 
claimed to be a victim of political harassment, and vowed not 
"to embarrass" his colleagues. "After enduring 90 hours of 
torture at that CPI, I will now seek a not guilty verdict in 
court by proving with sound evidence that the charges pressed 
against me are false," Roriz said. 
  Commenting on Dias' nomination, Roriz said that, as "a party 
man," he would accept the nomination. Dias' candidacy was 
proposed by the presidents of regional branches in a communique 
approved by the convention. Dias stated that his nomination 
would not prevent the PP from entering into alliances. "We are 
open to talks with other parties," Dias added.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlota Araujo, Evanildo da Silveira, Ilimar </F>
Franco, Jose Mitchell, and Roselena Nicolau: "Voters Have 
Already Drawn New President's Profile"] 
  [Text] The honesty of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the 
authority of Paulo Maluf, the confidence of Jarbas Passarinho, 
and the administrative experience of Antonio Britto: with the 
first round of balloting nine months away, the voters are 
beginning to define their electoral preferences by means of 
polls. 
  In immediate response to the accusations made by the CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] on the Budget, 
Brazilians are demanding honesty. To offset Itamar Franco's 
"vacillating" image, the voters want confidence and authority. 
Tired and frustrated by the failure of the economic plans, they 
are dreaming of someone capable of applying immediate solutions 
to the country's crisis. But is there room for surprises? Yes. A 
military candidate might be able to make the voters' fingers 
itch on election day. 
  A profile of the new president of the republic--in the minds 
of voters--was put together last November and defined by 
political analysts for the Center for Research, Analysis, and 
Communication (Cepac) in Sao Paulo on the basis of various 
opinion polls. It has every chance of actually corresponding to 
the expectations that will greet the candidates who begin their 
race for Planalto Palace this coming April. 
  In the files of political scientist Rubens Figueiredo of 
Cepac, who coordinated the project, is an almost prophetic 
makeup of the profile of the winner in the presidential election 
of 1989. It was put together four months before Fernando Collor 
appeared on the scene as a dark horse. 
  At the time--in January 1989--Figueiredo drew the profile of 
a candidate who was young, identified with the future, free of 
any ties with old politicians, spoke the people's language, and 
conveyed an image of honesty and competence. 
  Demanding--In April of that year, the beneficiary of that 
movement was candidate Fernando Collor de Mello, the former 
governor of Alagoas. He was young, spoke the language of 
modernity, was nicknamed "hunter of the high and mighty" by the 
media, was a relentless accuser of the Sarney administration, 
and addressed himself to the least privileged class with the 
expression "my people." He made a qualitative leap in the polls, 
and his popularity rose steadily. 
  "But voters now are more vigilant and demanding," Figueiredo 
says. He believes that the purge now under way in Congress as 
the result of charges of corruption will lead to a high turnover 
in Congress. "In the last election, only one-third of Congress 
was reelected," he recalls. He believes that the same thing will 
happen again. 
  It is also possible that someone unexpected will be 
reelected, seeing that age, color, and political party will not 
be essential for winning the election, in the opinion of Paulo 
Tafner of the Databrasil Research Institute in Rio de Janeiro. 
He also feels that campaigning on such major issues as the fight 
against inflation, the creation of jobs, and a more flexible 
economy will make a bigger impression than minor issues. "If 
inflation remains high, the scapegoats will be the speculators 
and the bankers," says Tafner. 
  Tafner also believes that the voters want their elected 
president to be someone who is balanced, firm, courageous, and 
willing to "pick fights" on important issues, chiefly with the 
firmly entrenched politico-economic structures that are 
preventing real changes in the country. "However, what the 
voters want is not a troublemaker who will pick fights 
unnecessarily--someone controversial--but someone decisive who 
will state the names of those he is accusing." 
  The analysis made by statistician Marco Antonio de Souza 
Aguiar, director of the Methods Consulting firm in Rio de 
Janeiro, reaffirms the conclusions drawn by the professionals in 
the other two firms. He points out that certain qualities may 
become more important, depending on the political situation. 
"Honesty has always been a basic characteristic, but because of 
the scandals, it is being given even more weight today." 
<H5>  Corruption Engenders Wave of Morality </H5>
  Brasilia--The CPI looking into budget 
corruption--established 
following the wave of morality brought on by the CPI on P.C. 
Farias--is going to cause a change in the behavior of voters and 
candidates in the October 1994 elections. That is the opinion of 
experienced politicians in Congress, where it is widely believed 
that the voters, immunized by so many scandals since Collor's 
impeachment, are going to vote with an eye on the candidates' 
biographies and favor those who have a clean record and are 
known to the public. "Moralistic talk alone is not going to 
help; the memory of Collor is still very alive," says Senator 
Jose Fogaca (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Rio 
Grande do Sul). "The candidate will have to convey the certainty 
that he is not a thief and neither are his friends," agrees 
Senator Mario Covas (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], 
Sao Paulo). Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL [Liberal Front Party], 
Espirito Santo) says: "The voters will choose those whose public 
life is almost spotless." 
  Congressmen expect the clamor for morality to result in less 
campaign spending as well. "There will be more caution in 
spending money; the current law does not deter the abuse of 
economic power, but events will prevent excesses," says Deputy 
Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB, Federal District). Deputy Nelson Trad 
(PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], Mato Grosso do Sul) says 
sarcastically: "The CPI will make politicians look for ways to 
propagate ideas rather than bank accounts." 
  The discoveries by the CPI on the Budget have created fear 
that even the innocent will wind up ruined. In the opinion of 
Senator Elcio Alvares, the people will make a collective 
condemnation: "There is a burning desire for justice; the people 
will want to punish, not acquit." Senator Ney Maranhao (PRN 
[National Reconstruction Party], Pernambuco) agrees with that 
assessment: "Anyone who sits in the dock is going to take a 
beating even if he is declared innocent." But there is not 
unanimous agreement on that point. 
  Senator Fogaca feels that the usual "voter roundups" will 
occur in the country's backward interior: "It is very possible 
that Joao Alves' voters are not at all unhappy with the work he 
has done." 
  Congressmen also feel that the voters will be split between 
those voting for new congressmen and those casting protest 
ballots. The vice president of the CPI, Deputy Odacir Klein 
(PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), supports the protest thesis and 
predicts an increase in the number of blank and void ballots. 
Robson Tuma (PL [Liberal Party], Sao Paulo) disagrees, saying: 
"The impetus is in the direction of a general rout of the 
current Congress." Senator Francisco Rolemberg (PFL, Sergipe) 
feels that the percentage of new congressmen will be high, as in 
previous elections, but that this time voters will favor 
candidates who prove their credibility. He adds that the voters 
will also choose candidates who are able to sell hope: "Lindberg 
(former president of the UNE [National Union of Students]) has a 
message of hope." 
<H5>  New Faces May Be Slightly Delayed </H5>
  Belo Horizonte--Historian and political scientist Lucilia de 
Almeida Neves, the niece of former President Tancredo Neves, 
does not think there will be an immediate replacement of 
congressmen in political terms. "The trend is toward morality, 
toward electing more ethical people, but that by itself is not 
enough to result in a new Congress," she says, emphasizing that 
higher moral standards in party politics are what may lead to a 
new profile for Brazilian politicians. 
  Lucilia Neves points out that politics is more than just 
ethics: it is also a matter of intention: "What is taking place 
is a leap in quality: the leap toward transparency," she claims. 
But on the other hand, she says the switching between parties 
that we have seen recently, as the deadline for changing parties 
arrived, shows that there is still plenty of room for 
personalism. "I feel that the election of new congressmen ought 
to be more institutional in form," she adds. 
  The historian explains that what seems to signify major 
chaos 
may actually signify a major advance. "Clearly stating the 
problems is a big step forward in itself," she says. In 
Lucilia's opinion, such things as ethics and honesty will be 
influential factors for some voters, but they will be especially 
important to the middle-class voter, who has been looking for a 
new kind of politician longer than anyone else. 
<H5>  One Cycle Follows Another </H5>
  Sao Paulo--The profile of the new politician who will 
probably emerge from the ballot box in the upcoming elections, 
as drawn by Gaudencio Torquato, professor of political marketing 
at the Sao Paulo University School of Communication and Arts 
(ECA-USP), combines authority, honesty, and other condiments 
such as culture, administrative ability, and modernity. 
  While admitting that that is the profile of the ideal 
politician, not of most of them, the professor is optimistic 
about the new crop that will come out of the upcoming elections. 
"We are reaching the end of one cycle and starting another," he 
explains. "The co-opting cycle, based on patronage and cronyism, 
is fading away because of the wave of morality that is sweeping 
through society." In Torquato's opinion, the phenomenon in 
question will occur not only in the big cities but also in the 
country's interior. "Thanks to television, the moral sweep is 
also reaching the deep hinterland," he says. 
  Torquato, who is also a political consultant, does not put 
much faith in polls indicating that 80 percent of the present 
Congress will be swept out of office. "I feel that it will not 
be that high," he says. "Probably about 60 percent will lose 
their seats." Most of the new faces will fit the profile of the 
politician who is more directly involved in his region's 
problems, free of ties with past political formulas, ethical, 
transparent, clean-living, and experienced in administration. He 
will not be just a man making promises on the stump. 
  While Torquato is somewhat optimistic about the changes in 
the profile of Brazilian politicians that will emerge from the 
upcoming elections, the same cannot be said of another expert in 
political marketing, Carlos Brickmann. The coordinator of Paulo 
Maluf's campaign, Brickmann does not think that Brazilian 
politicians are all that bad. "The pattern among Brazil's 
prominent politicians is good," he says. "Most of those involved 
in corruption are completely insignificant people." 
  Reflections--Brickmann does not think that far-reaching 
changes will result from the elections. "Politicians reflect the 
country," he explains. "They are the result of the country and 
its legislation, which makes unacceptable things such as 
campaign contributions in the millions completely acceptable 
because they are necessary. The politicians will change only 
when the country and its legislation change." 
  More hopeful than Brickmann is advertising man Mauro Salles, 
who coordinated Tancredo Neves' campaign in the Electoral 
College. He believes that the wave of morality sweeping the 
country will bring to the fore many honest politicians who 
already exist. "The increased emphasis on ethical principles is 
going to cast the spotlight on a number of competent politicians 
who at some point became ashamed of being honest," he says. 
<H5>  Honesty and Machismo </H5>
  Porto Alegre--Like all Brazilians, the 56,000 voters in the 
border town of Santana do Livramento in Rio Grande do Sul are 
concerned to elect honest politicians, but they also take into 
account a cultural trait that is still extremely strong when it 
comes to election campaigns: that represented by the macho 
gaucho. For example, lawyer and former Mayor Glenio Lemos (PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party]) will probably be elected state deputy 
because he combines the image of a good and honest administrator 
with a fiery temperament that gets him into violent scrapes with 
rivals and makes him take action with the help of a .765 or 9mm 
pistol that sends his opponents scurrying for cover. 
  Lemos is expected to pull in a big vote in this town, which 
is unique in Brazil because of its geography: it adjoins the 
Uruguayan town of Rivera, and the two of them form a single city 
with a population of 200,000. With about 100,000 residents on 
the Brazilian side and a budget of $9 million, Santana do 
Livramento is currently dominated by the PDT, thanks in 
particular to Glenio Lemos. 
  Hang the municipal councilors--Glenio was elected mayor as 
an 
aftereffect of the shots which, as lawyer for the mayor of 
neighboring Quarai, he had fired in the Municipal Chamber. The 
bullets did not hit anyone, but they earned him the 17,000 votes 
that made him mayor. He used the budget of $13 million--made 
fatter by the Collor Plan, which gave money to the municipal 
governments--for hundreds of public works. He earned the image 
of an effective administrator--he got his successor elected with 
63 percent of the vote--without abandoning his penchant for 
valorous deeds. 
  The public loved it when, during a political squabble with 
the Municipal Chamber, Lemos suggested hanging the municipal 
councilors from the tree on the main square. And when, being 
ecological, he demanded that an individual get down out of a 
tree and, upon being ignored, drew his revolver out of his belt, 
sending the person scurrying for cover. Even after completing 
his term as mayor and returning to his law practice, he has 
continued to attract attention. Once, while representing a woman 
whose small farm had been invaded by landless settlers, he set 
fire to their tents. The settlers continued to hold out, but 
they finally left when Glenio returned to the site on horseback 
with a court order in one hand and his revolver in the other.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Feb (PL) -- Two presidential 
hopefuls from the ruling Liberal Party reiterated today their 
rejection of the U.S. military presence in Colombia, where there 
are 259 U.S. soldiers stationed, according to official figures. 
  Ernesto Samper, former economic development minister under 
President Cesar Gaviria, and favored to win his party's 
nomination for the presidential candidacy, said a fast one was 
pulled on the president and he asked himself if the one who did 
it was the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry. 
  He added that "fast one pulled on the president was 
unfortunately pulled on all Colombians, who feel we have been 
harmed by this undue interference by the United States." 
  As for the reiterated official explanation that the largest 
contingent of troops, made up of 156 men stationed in Juan Chaco 
on the Pacific coast, came to build a school and a health 
center, he said it is "simply outrageous and no Colombian is 
willing to believe that story." 
  Another Liberal Party presidential hopeful, Humberto de la 
Calle, much closer to Gaviria, said that "since before the Juan 
Chaco situation emerged, I asked for the suspension of the 
operation because just as I feared, it created an atmosphere of 
inadvisable suspense and suspicion." 
  He pointed out that work on social projects can perfectly 
well be in the hands of the Colombian Army and he added that 
Gaviria's explanations for the case have created an atmosphere 
of confusion. 
  "What I believe should be condemned are the half truths, the 
quasi clandestine way of handling it, and the absence of clear 
information for Colombians," he added.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Feb (PL) -- The United States uses 
immigration matters as a tool of aggression against Cuba in an 
attempt to create internal problems and harm its image before 
the world, the Cuban parliament has signaled. 
  The 25-page report that the National Assembly intends to 
distribute widely at international levels adds that its powerful 
northern neighbor's hostility is not limited to the economic, 
trade, and financial blockade. It is also manifested in many 
other issues that endanger the nation's peace and security. 
  In this regard, it accuses U.S. leaders of encouraging the 
departure of illegal aliens and of encouraging desertion, within 
the framework of its hostile policy toward the Caribbean island. 
  The core of the immigration matters between both nations lie 
in the fact that the United States has permanently used them in 
the past three decades to discredit Cuba, upholds the statement 
prepared by the parliament's Foreign Relations Commission. 
  During the last fiscal year, 973,977 immigrants arrived to 
the United States; 132,173 were admitted as refugees. Of this 
total, 0.25 percent were legal immigrants from this nation, 
while 2.04 were refugees or illegal immigrants. 
  According to the Assembly, such small percentages do not 
justify the "out of proportion propaganda" surrounding the 
issue, while it accuses Washington of offering privileged 
treatment with clear political nuances to Cubans who arrive 
illegally on their territory. 
  In addition to financial support, after one year they 
automatically have a right to residency. "No other foreign 
immigrant is worthy of so many opportunities to reside, work, 
and live in the United States," the statement indicates. 
  During the past years, the Havana authorities have tried to 
normalize bilateral immigration relations so that these take 
place within the law and in an orderly fashion, the statement 
underlines. 
  Nevertheless, the United States continues making political 
use of the immigration relations and obstructs our nation's 
decisions, it notes. 
  Evidence of this, it adds, is how many of the so-called raft 
people, kidnappers, air pirates, and deserters are received as 
heroes in the United States although a visa had been denied to 
many of them by the U.S. Interests Office in this capital. 
  According to the document, in the past border guards have 
prevented some of these departures; most of the detainees are 
just returned to their homes as they are considered victims of 
the propaganda aired by anti-Cuban stations installed in the 
United States. 
  Cuba is most convinced of the need to end to these 
irregularities and their negative consequences. This is so not 
only for Cuba but also for the United States that with its 
actions encourages the crime of aircraft and boat piracy and 
kidnapping in violation of bilateral and international rules, 
concludes the parliamentary analysis. 
  The paradox of the immigration phenomena in its propaganda 
projection from the United States is that the Cuban policy on 
this matter never appears correct, the study concludes. 
  If Cuba facilitates administrative procedures and speeds up 
the endeavors of any citizens to obtain an exit permit, 
permanent or temporary, the U.S. Administration delays and 
complicates the procedures for the trip to its territory. 
  If, on the contrary, it prevents the departure of illegal 
aliens, Cuba is presented as a virtual jail by propaganda 
machinery, and what is even worse, "if such immigration was 
allowed freely it would also be attacked, but with the threat of 
military action," the document alerts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chairman of the Cuban People's Assembly </F>
Ricardo Alarcon by Andrea Bonanni in Brussels; date not given: 
"`This Is How Clinton Disappoints Cuba'"--first paragraph is 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] The visit by 
Alarcon -- who also went to Germany and France -- does not seem 
to have led to the results for which Castro had hoped. The 
extremely tentative hints of economic liberalization and the 
rigidity of the regime in the political arena are not actually 
enough to justify opening up a dialogue with Europe, or the 
broadening of economic relations. The substance of the message 
from the Europeans is that Cuba must do more, at least as far as 
economic reforms are concerned, if it wants to emerge from its 
isolation. Nevertheless, in this interview with CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA, Alarcon does not appear to be dramatizing the situation. 
  [Bonanni] Mr. Chairman, why Europe? 
  [Alarcon] Because after the collapse of the USSR, Europe 
became even more important for our economic interests. 
Traditionally, i.e., before the revolution, the United States 
was virtually our exclusive market. Afterwards, our partners 
were the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. Now, 
with the disappearance of the USSR, there is no doubt that our 
interest is centered on Europe and Latin America. 
  [Bonanni] Does that mean that, notwithstanding any informal 
contacts, you are not expecting the United States to lift its 
embargo in the short term? 
  [Alarcon] I would like to point out that we do not have 
secret contacts with Washington. Moreover, I do not believe 
that the situation can be unblocked quickly: at least within 
Clinton's term. Logically speaking, now that the Cold War is 
over, and now that the East-West antagonism is over, relations 
between the United States and Cuba would improve. Yet, the 
opposite has happened. The American blockade has been 
reinforced. In Washington there are those who believed that, 
following the disappearance of the USSR, the economic problems 
would lead to the collapse of the Cuban revolution. Yet, we 
have successfully resisted for four years. Obviously the 
situation is difficult and the problems are serious. However, as 
long as we hold out, the American strategy will prove to be 
unsustainable. There are already American companies which are 
looking worriedly at our new economic contacts with Europe and 
Latin America. 
  [Bonanni] Even your relations with Cuban refugees seem to 
have improved. 
  [Alarcon] Yes. Even though we are not expecting an 
improvement in relations with the United States, it must be 
acknowledged that something is changing. After 12 years of very 
tough conservative politics, there is an administration in 
Washington today that has contacts with more moderate sectors of 
the Cuban immigrants. The Cuban far right, which dictated 
Reagan's and Bush's policy, was linked too much to the 
Republicans and it is now starting to lose influence. 
  [Bonanni] America is changing. What about Cuba? To what 
extent are you interested in the Chinese model? 
  [Alarcon] We are studying it with great interest, as well as 
the Vietnamese model. They too are developing countries that 
are following the socialist path. However, there are major 
economic and cultural differences. The Chinese rationalization 
efforts cannot be applied to us: They have a large market, 
great natural resources, an enormous population, and an ancient 
tradition of entrepreneurship. In any case, the time of models 
is over. Everyone must find their own road. 
  [Bonanni] How do you respond to the European pressure for 
political and economic reform? 
  [Alarcon] I would not talk in terms of pressure. Generally 
speaking, the Europeans understand that Cuba is in a tough 
situation. It must adapt to a changing world. However, I 
believe that our pragmatic approach is convincing. We are the 
ones who suffered the most from the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, but today we are also the most stable country of the 
former socialist world. The euphoria of the capitalist world 
following the events in Eastern Europe is now calming down and 
making room for worries about the dangers arising from political 
instability. The economic operators have understood this. They 
know that in Cuba we have an educated and prepared population, 
and that there is no risk of political instability. Thus, 
despite the American pressure, they are beginning to invest. 
After resisting for four years, I hope that our situation can 
change for the better.

  [Editorial Report] As of filing time, Cuban sources 
monitored by Panama Bureau have not been observed to carry 
statements by elite Cuban figures or commentary on the U.S. 
decision to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam. The following is 
a compilation of Cuban-source straight reporting on the lifting 
of the embargo. 
  Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2249 GMT on 3 February 
carries its first report on U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
announcement lifting the trade embargo against the SRV. In the 
175-word Washington-datelined report, the U.S. President is 
quoted as saying: "I am absolutely convinced that this decision 
offers the best way to resolve the fate of missing persons," 
adding that "nothing of what we do today is irreversible if the 
SRV cooperation ends." The report concludes by noting that 
President Clinton's decision authorizes the opening of "liaison 
offices" in Hanoi and Washington, which will serve as the first 
diplomatic representations between the two countries. 
  Havana Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 4 
February, during its regularly scheduled "Evening Information 
Review" program, carries a one-minute report citing U.S. 
Government sources as saying that "President William Clinton 
decided on Thursday to lift the trade embargo imposed 19 years 
ago against the SRV." The report cites an AFP report as saying 
that White House officials said the official announcement will 
be made in the course of the next few days. This report is 
rebroadcast by Havana Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish at 0100 GMT 
on 4 February. 
  At 0216 GMT on 4 February, Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 
carries a 350-word report on reaction within the United States 
to the lifting of the embargo against the SRV. The 
Washington-datelined report states that the business community 
cheered Clinton's announcement, while Vietnam war veterans 
criticized it. The report says that in an effort to stem 
criticism, "the Executive Branch warned that the elimination of 
the reprisal does not entail a normalization of relations 
between the two countries." The report concludes by citing 
Clinton as saying that "this measure was adopted because the SRV 
has cooperated favorably in the recovery of remains of U.S. 
soldiers." 
  Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 1309 on 4 February 
carries 
a 550-word, Washington-datelined report on the economic benefits 
derived from the lifting of the U.S. embargo on the SRV. The 
report notes that "aside from politics, there is a potential 
commercial exchange of some $9 billion, according to a group of 
U.S.-Vietnamese businessmen based in Washington." The report 
concludes that "the measure has a marked business character." 
  Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 1347 GMT on 4 February 
carries a 335-word, Hanoi-datelined item on Vietnamese reaction 
to the lifting of the trade sanctions. "Although Hanoi has not 
yet issued an official statement," the report asserts, the SRV 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman was quoted as saying that "her 
country applauds the end of the restrictions, which will benefit 
both parties and the entire international community." The 
report cites remarks by various U.S. businessmen, as well as the 
PRC Foreign Ministry and Japanese Cabinet chief praising 
President Clinton's decision. 
  At 1515 on 4 February, Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 
carries a 175-word report on Vietnamese Government reaction to 
the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo. The Hanoi-datelined 
report terms as "positive and significant" the decision by 
President Clinton to lift the embargo and "begin a process 
toward normalizing relations." The item cited the Vietnamese 
deputy foreign minister as saying "his country accepts the 
establishment of liaison offices in Washington and Hanoi, but 
warned that the establishment of diplomatic ties could not be 
subject to any precondition." The Vietnamese official 
reiterated his country's desire to continue assisting the United 
States in the search for missing persons, the report concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by Mary Simon] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuba asserted today that the 
United States intends to use hunger to force Cubans to give up 
their 30-year-old commitment to exercise their right to 
self-determination and independence, which is why Cubans are 
enduring a tight economic, trade, and financial blockade. 
  Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa said Washington's 
occupation of part of the Guantanamo territory in the eastern 
part of his country, against the island's will is an example of 
the denial of this right. 
  The head of the Caribbean island's delegation to the 50th 
Human Rights Commission meeting spoke for the second time in one 
day to explain his position on point nine of the agenda: 
self-determination and its application to peoples subjected to 
colonial rule or foreign occupation. 
  Moreover, Cuba views the promotion of intervention disguised 
as humanitarian efforts and concern for human rights as an 
attempt to downplay the importance of the people's right to 
self-determination. 
  There are sufficient arguments to prove that certain 
northern 
countries become concerned about the problems of others only 
when they are moved by political considerations that are 
entirely foreign to the essence of these rights, the Cuban 
diplomat stated. 
  Perez Novoa said a small group of states is trying to force 
the rest of the world to accept certain ideological patterns of 
conduct whether they like it or not. 
  Perez Novoa said that countries that have been colonized and 
exploited for centuries are now being forced to adopt imported 
economic and political models that pose serious limitations to 
their national sovereignty and therefore to the full exercise of 
their self-determination. It is being done under the pretext 
that such models must necessarily be applied throughout the 
entire world. 
  According to the diplomat, he would like to see a 
humanitarian intervention in one of the northern countries at 
the request of a group of underdeveloped nations. 
  The disregard for self-determination has reached such a 
point 
that those who are calling for the so-called humanitarian 
interventions and theories about limited sovereignty would 
rather have this principle disappear from the Human Rights 
Commission agenda altogether, Perez Novoa said. 
  He added that neither preventive diplomacy, limited 
sovereignty, nor humanitarian interference would resolve the 
serious problems of mankind, among which he mentioned the 
inhumane conditions that lead to millions of deaths each year as 
well as poverty, hunger, and illiteracy. 
  Imagine a world where the law of the jungle prevails, in 
which manipulation and political interests prevail over the 
majority of countries, denying them the right to freely decide 
their future.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Feb (PL) -- The implementation of strong 
measures for a more effective control of production and material 
resources to eliminate the black market is one of the demands 
made at the workers assemblies taking place in Cuba. 
  TRABAJADORES, the official newspaper of the Cuban Workers 
Federation, has written in an editorial the subject has gained 
prominence in all of the meetings taking place in factories and 
institutions to gather opinions and proposals aimed at drafting 
regulations that will contribute to the improvement of the 
economy. 
  TRABAJADORES has said during the past four years the breach 
between monetary liquidity in the people's hands and the 
official offering of goods and services have broadened the 
negative consequences of a recessed economy [economia sumergida) 
and the black market to limits that are increasingly unbearable 
economically, socially, and politically. 
  The editorial then explains the recessed economy, with a 
relatively small physical volume of products, is taking away the 
largest part of workers' salaries due to high prices, something 
which reflects an inflationary process that is hardly noticeable 
in the state price policy. 
  TRABAJADORES has said the huge difference in prices is an 
invitation to crime, because many people who handle state funds 
and become sellers can be tempted to take advantage of lack 
administrative controls and actions against the so-called 
"missing funds" ["faltantes"] to steal merchandise and obtain an 
additional income. 
  The labor parliament--the name given to the meetings held by 
workers to discuss the country's economic problems and give 
possible solutions--has expressed its rejection of these 
practices, which are amoral and harmful to the country. 
  The editorial acknowledges, next to private producers, the 
state enterprise today is the main source of income to that 
recessed economy. 
  The editorial later criticizes the irresponsibility and 
neglect displayed in the economic control operations in both the 
flow of goods [flujos materiales] and basic financial elements. 
  TRABAJADORES stresses the accounting, cost, inventories, 
exact measurement of consumption, and discipline of collection 
and payments are the tools to fight corruption and disorder in 
any workplace. 
  The editorial stresses it is the unions' responsibility, 
because they own the means of production, to insure worker's 
control and a proper settlement of accounts for the proper use 
of material and financial resources.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Jan (PL) -- Today in Havana, Cuban 
President Fidel Castro said creditors are collecting Latin 
America's foreign debt twice, and the continent has lost the 
better part of this great battle. 
  Closing the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting, 
which has been in session in Havana since Tuesday, the topmost 
leader of the revolution recalled it was said in a great forum 
held in Havana in 1985 that this debt could not be collected and 
could not be paid off. He said: Our continent has lost the 
better part of this great battle. We are being charged in ever 
increasing amounts. 
  He recalled that when the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959 
Latin America's debt was very small, and now it amounts to $500 
billion. He said our countries' basic products had a certain 
value in the world market at that time. The current great 
technologies have gradually displaced them. To illustrate, he 
said sugar has been substituted by substances like isoglucose 
[isoglucosa], extracted from corn and whose sweetening power is 
greater than that of beet and cane sugar. 
  Castro spoke at the plenum in the presence of more than 
1,000 
delegates from 32 countries.

  [Text] Havana, 28 Jan (PL) -- At the closing session of the 
Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting today, Cuban 
President Fidel Castro said neoliberalism is undermining the 
independence of the countries in which it is applied. 
  The formal independence we still have is being taken away 
and 
even the term is outdated, he said. 
  The president warned that all of this is neoliberalism, a 
conflict of interests among huge economic blocs because it is a 
policy that will be applied worldwide. 
  Any country that wishes to industrialize still has, perhaps, 
the hope of acquiring industries that pollute the environment or 
require lots of cheap labor, he said. 
  The head of state said it is unfair to make an ant compete 
and fight with an elephant, and he noted that developed nations 
have the monopoly on advanced technology, scientific research, 
and production automation. 
  The Cuban president asked: The Third World asked for border 
openings and a lifting of tariffs, but what did it get? They 
want to buy everything in our countries, he warned. They want to 
be the owners of the principal industries, with which they would 
undermine our independence, not only in a real and objective 
manner but also in a formal manner. 
  With the disappearance of the socialist bloc, the balance of 
forces in the world was lost, he said. 
  Unipolar power is invading all fields, he said. They want us 
to see what interests them through the use of advertisements and 
commercials. They control newscasts through the use of 
multinational news programs, he said. 
  They do not advertise Superbarrio (popular Mexican character 
present at the meeting) but Superman, he said. 
  As for the application of neoliberal policies in the former 
USSR and East Europe, Fidel Castro said it has created a real 
disaster and people are starting to realize it was a real 
mistake to brutally apply IMF and World Bank recipes there. 
  Social deterioration and increased unemployment have led to 
the rise of strong nationalist feelings and all kinds of 
reactions of the desperate people of the former USSR, according 
to the Cuban president, who said not everything was deficient in 
that economy. 
  In another part of his speech and in response to a 
participant's proposal to demand the democratization of the 
United Nations and the Security Council, Fidel Castro said this 
UN organization should have at least two Latin American and two 
African members while India deserves its own seat because of its 
size and population. 
  Perhaps it would be unrealistic to ask at this time for the 
disappearance of the veto but, in principle, we oppose the 
Security Council members' veto rights. 
  As for the event ending today after four days of sessions, 
the top Cuban leader said he was impressed with the unity shown, 
especially with regard to neoliberalism, despite the wide range 
of political and social tendencies represented in the more than 
1,000 participants present in the event.

  [Text] Mexico City, 2 Feb (PL) -- The United States has 
justified an uprising that has lasted more than a month in the 
southern Mexican State of Chiapas, because it thinks that this 
uprising reflects "a governmental failure to solve socioeconomic 
problems." 
  An article published today in EL FINANCIERO newspaper states 
that "the Clinton administration today (1 February) accused its 
Mexican counterpart of openly violating election laws and 
committing numerous human rights abuses." 
  Washington's official position surprised local analysts 
because Mexico is an important U.S. trading partner. In fact, 
these two countries, along with Canada, are part of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  This trilateral agreement came into effect on 1 January, and 
it created the world's largest market, with more than 350 
million consumers and $500 billion worth of worldwide 
investments. 
  As for the apparent inconsistency of U.S. foreign policy by 
signing a trade agreement with a country it accuses of violating 
civil rights, State Department adviser Timothy Wirth replied 
that "nobody is perfect." 
  EL FINANCIERO cited the U.S. opinion that "Mexico has indeed 
strived to eradicate the culture of impunity that surrounds its 
security forces through the reorganization of the Attorney 
General's Office and through its permanent support for the 
National Human Rights Commission." 
  The Clinton administration also believes that the groups 
that 
took up arms on 1 January in Chiapas are made up mainly of 
Indians. This contradicts the official Mexican report that they 
are "lawbreakers linked to violent Central American groups." 
  National observers recalled that the United States 
continuously violates the civil rights of Mexican citizens who 
reside there. At least two of them were executed in the last 12 
months. 
  Mexico thinks that its citizens who have been sentenced to 
death in the neighboring country are victims of judicial 
irregularities. It also believes that Washington violates other 
individual rights by encouraging racial discrimination against 
Mexicans. 
  In September and October 1993 the White House staged a 
blockade to prevent Mexicans from entering U.S. territory, 
claiming that their presence promotes crime and theft.

  [Text] Varadero, Cuba, 31 Jan (PL) -- Today, Cuban 
President Fidel Castro highlighted the impressive development of 
the Cuban tourism industry, and he also stressed that from now 
on Cuban efforts will be aimed at becoming more efficient and 
economical in that sector. 
  At the inaugural dinner of the Bella Costa Hotel in 
Varadero, 
approximately 140 km east of Havana, the chief of state said: 
Although we are just beginning (to strengthen that sector of the 
economy), there are encouraging achievements such as the high 
levels of growth and the increasingly good quality of services. 
  The Bella Costa, a 307-room facility which began operations 
six months ago, is owned by Cuban Tourism and International 
Trade Corporation, Cubanacan Incorporated, which handed over its 
management and marketing to LTI [expansion unknown], a German 
hotel company. 
  The German company, a subsidiary of LTU [expansion unknown] 
Airlines, runs three other hotels on the island: the Tuxpan in 
Varadero and Los Corales and Carisol in Santiago de Cuba. 
  In another part of his speech, Castro recalled that Tuxpan 
has the highest occupancy rate in the country, 92 percent. He 
predicted that the other hotels managed by LTI, a firm that has 
shown ability and ambition, will have similar success. 
  Regarding his lengthy conversation with LTU President Hans 
Joachim Driessen, the Cuban revolutionary leader said he 
discussed Cuba's competitiveness in the effort to become an 
important tourist attraction in the Caribbean. 
  He added that they also discussed LTI's experience with 
cruises on the Nile -- experience, he noted, that could be 
applied here. 
  Asked how he sees the island's future in the next two or 
three years, Castro said: Still with many difficulties but 
making progress, no doubt. 
  The other two speakers of the evening, Driessen and 
Cubanacan 
President Abraham Maciques agreed with each other by praising 
the cooperation between the two institutions. 
  Driessen and LTI Director General Wolfgang Hedderich arrived 
in Santiago de Cuba to attend the official transfer of the 
management and marketing of Carisol and Los Corales hotels to 
LTI. 
  The LTU charter company has 28 planes with a 7,863-seat 
capacity. LTI owns eight cruise ships and manages 11 hotels, 
four of them in Cuba.

  [Text] Caracas, 1 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage voiced today here his trust that his country's relations 
with Venezuela will continue to progress under Rafael Caldera's 
government. Caldera assumes the presidency on 2 February. 
  On his way to Brazil, Lage stopped in Caracas for a few 
hours 
where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich 
and Venezuelan businessmen. 
  The Cuban leader told reporters that the ties between both 
nations are at a good level, and he said he had reasons to hope 
that those ties would continue to progress because both nations 
are very close. 
  Lage commented that in general that relations between the 
Latin American governments and the people are progressing and 
strengthening. 
  Lage exchanged points of view with Ochoa Antich on the 
situation in Cuba and Venezuela. Ochoa Antich visited Havana 
four months ago as part of the consulting mechanism that exists 
between the foreign ministries of the two nations. 
  On the approximately $45 million debt that Havana has with 
Caracas, Lage reiterated his government's willingness to find a 
solution to meet this commitment. 
  Lage said: Currently our economic conditions are difficult. 
It is difficult for us to cancel this debt soon; however, 
together we could find -- in a spirit of understanding and 
cooperation -- formulas that will allow Cuba to slowly pay off 
its debt. 
  Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba, and 
Norberto Hernandez Curbelo, Cuban ambassador to Venezuela, also 
participated in the discussions.

  [Text] Brasilia, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage, who has been in Brazil for the past two days, arrived 
today at the international airport of this capital where he will 
meet with Brazilian President Itamar Franco and other government 
figures. 
  Lage traveled by helicopter from Sao Paulo State. He had a 
working breakfast here with a group of congressmen this morning. 
  A Brazilian source has described Lage's stay in Sao Paulo 
yesterday, the first day of his official visit to Brazil, as 
fruitful. 
  In Sao Paulo State, the vice president of the Cuban Council 
of State met with State Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho and 
discussed the possibilities of economic cooperation between the 
Caribbean island and the Brazilian state in areas such as the 
sugar industry, agriculture in general, health, culture, and 
others. 
  Lage and delegation visited Riberao Preto Municipality in 
the company of Roberto Rodriguez, the agriculture secretary of 
Sao Paulo State, the afternoon of 2 February. Municipal Mayor 
Antoni Parocci and prominent businessmen received the Cuban 
leader. 
  The visitors [words indistinct] sugar industry. The Cuban 
vice president showed special interest in that regard. The 
possibilities of signing a cooperation protocol with that 
municipality were discussed. 
  The Cuban guests completed their busy agenda in Riberao 
Preto 
with a meeting with the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
and another meeting with a diverse group of businessmen and 
reporters. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will receive Lage in 
Brasilia today. There are plans for a meeting also with Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
  According to the official schedule, Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco will receive him tomorrow morning. 
  Lage's visit to Brazil will conclude 7 February in Rio de 
Janeiro. O GLOBO, a Rio de Janeiro newspaper, has published an 
interview with Lage. The Cuban official responded in writing 
from Havana to the questions before making the trip to Brazil. 
  In the interview, Lage explains the external factors that 
have produced the tense economic situation in his country, and 
he highlights among these factors the passing of the socialist 
bloc and the Soviet Union, in addition to the blockade Cuba has 
endured for more than three decades. 
  Lage has said abroad Cuba's economic restructuring program 
is 
being misinterpreted. He said: "We already have a model, the 
socialist model." 
  He denied the socialist model has failed in Cuba, saying the 
crisis burdening Cuba came from abroad. 
  He affirmed: "I am not saying our model does not suffer from 
deficiencies and errors. I am saying external factors have 
unleashed the crisis." 
  These factors, he added, were fattened by the U.S. blockade. 
  In spite of all that has happened, he added, we are intent 
on 
showing that the Cuban socialist model not only has not failed 
but is vigorous and trying to consolidate itself. We know it is 
not perfect, but it has many accomplishments. 
  The vice president reported practically all the productive 
sectors of the Cuban economy are open to the possibility of 
associating with foreign investors. 
  Lage said Cuba's most important trade partners are Russia, 
China, Spain, Canada, Italy, and France.

  [Text] Brasilia, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage had meetings with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
and Treasury Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today. 
  During his meeting with Amorim, the prospects of 
strengthening bilateral ties between both nations were discussed. 
  Lage had lunch immediately afterward with Amorim and 
personalities from the Brazilian political and economic arena, 
among which were Inocencio Oliveira, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies and Alexis Stepanenko, planning minister. 
  This was the second day of the Cuban guest's official visit 
to Brazil. After arriving at the capital from Sao Paulo, he met 
with a group of parliamentarians, and friends of Cuba, chaired 
by Deputy Waldir Pires. 
  The conversations with the group were deemed fraternal, and 
during these talks information was given to the parliamentarians 
on Cuba's economic situation "and the efforts of the Cuban 
people and government to resolve the difficulties imposed from 
abroad," according to a source close to the visiting delegation.

ambassadors, businessmen, and political party leaders. 
  Lage is scheduled to meet with Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco on 4 February.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage said today his meeting with Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco and three Brazilian government ministers was very 
positive. 
  Lage, who is on the third day of his official visit to 
Brazil, gave a news conference that was attended by more than 20 
domestic and foreign reporters at the Cuban ambassador's 
residence in that country. 
  The vice president commented on the meeting with Franco at 
the Planalto Presidential Palace, saying they broached many 
issues related to the development of their countries' political 
and economic relations. 
  He stressed that the Brazilian president reiterated his 
criticism of the U.S. blockade against the Caribbean island and 
the so-called Torricelli Law. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim expressed the same criticism yesterday. 
  Although no agreements were signed during his visit, Lage 
said big possibilities had been opened to increase their 
bilateral ties. 
  He explained that Cuba offers facilities to foreign 
investment, especially in the tourism sector. Businessmen who 
invest on the island, he pointed out, will recover their 
investments quickly. 
  Lage and accompanying delegation will travel to Rio de 
Janeiro early tomorrow morning, where they will meet with local 
businessmen and political personalities.

  [Text] Caracas, 27 Jan (PL) -- Venezuelan authorities and 
political leaders warned today that the recent wave of riots in 
the country is part of a conspiracy aimed at tarnishing the new 
government's inaugural ceremony. 
  Interior Minister Carlos Delgado Chapellin told reporters 
the 
street riots are part of a premeditated plan to disrupt public 
order and to tarnish the ceremony to change the government, 
scheduled for 2 February, and the work of the recently-installed 
Parliament. 
  The minister said the situation in the country is normal and 
attributed the outbursts of violence to minorities that incite 
the students to those actions. 
  Violent protests have broken out recently in Caracas and 
other cities, which resulted in the death of one young student 
on Tuesday. These protests, led mainly by students and masked 
protesters, have turned into violent street battles with the 
police. 
  Disturbances broke out again today at the Central University 
of Venezuela [UCV] and other Caracas educational centers as well 
as in the north-central state of Aragua. 
  The riots and the recent Banco Latino intervention, the 
second most important bank in the country; public protests; and 
uncertainty with respect to the financial system's soundness 
were described by National Convergence Leader Julio Cesar Moreno 
as part of a orchestrated plan to have President-elect Rafael 
Caldera receive a country in disastrous conditions. 
  According to the leader of the National Convergence party, 
which was founded by the new Venezuelan president, these 
incidents are not spontaneous, but are intended to prevent the 
successful start of the next administration. 
  Moreno attributed those interests to "an undercurrent that 
has its source entrenched in priviliges that were handed out at 
one time, especially during the past two administrations." 
  Asdrubal Baptista, one of the new president's main advisers, 
pointed out that the new administration expects to place special 
priority on raising the people's standard of living, and that 
requires the support of all sectors of the population. 
  Without going into details, Baptista indicated that next 
Wednesday Caldera will announce a far-reaching economic program, 
prepared by the president himself, which is expected to "split 
the country's history in two." 
  The presidential adviser pointed out that the country's 
future will not rest primarily on its crude oil revenues, which 
has fallen from $20 billion at the beginning of the 1980's when 
the population totalled 13 million, to somewhere between $8 and 
$10 billion in 1994 with the population at 22 million. 
  Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said current President 
Ramon J. Velasquez, as head of the transition government, held 
one of his last meetings today to examine the country's social, 
labor, political, and financial issues.

  [Text] Brussels, 28 Jan (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president 
of the National Assembly of Cuba, stated today that he is 
satisfied with his current visit to Belgium, where he has met 
with numerous political personalities and European Parliament 
members . 
  The Cuban leader asserted that such contacts contribute to a 
better knowledge and understanding of the island's realities, 
which is currently confronting the most complicated situation in 
the history of its revolutionary process. 
  Alarcon's statements were made during a long news conference 
attended by a large and heterogeneous group of media 
representatives from Belgium and other countries. The news 
conference covered issues related to the Caribbean nation. 
  Among the issues recovered were the elections held in Cuba 
in 
February 1993, the island's international relations, the U.S. 
blockade, the possible commercial liberalization, and the 
people's support for those measures. 
  The Cuban Legislative Branch president heads a delegation 
that has been visiting Brussels since last Sunday. They have 
kept a tight program of interviews and meetings with leaders of 
the European Parliament, the Belgian Government, and parties and 
political organizations. 
  At the news conference, the visitor considered that those 
contacts will help promote Cuba's ties with the European Union 
and its political and executive branches and with the Kingdom of 
Belgium. 
  Today, Alarcon met with Leo Tindemans, head of the European 
People's Party faction in the European Parliament. Later, he 
attended a dinner in honor of the Cuban delegation which was 
hosted by the Belgian Coordinator, an organization that furthers 
the lifting of the U.S. blockade. 
  This organization has more than 45 local political 
organizations that support Cuba and tomorrow, there will be an 
event in support of the Caribbean nation at the Free University 
of Brussels. There will also be conferences and Cuban singer 
Silvio Rodriguez will give a concert.

<F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 27 Jan (PL) -- Osvaldo Martinez, who is 
president of the Economic Commission of the Cuban Parliament and 
an expert on Latin American economics, has stated that the 
political and social spectrum mirrored in the Fourth Latin 
American and Caribbean Meeting is giving shape to a new social 
transformation project in the region. 
  On its third day of sessions, the forum will establish 
contact with the peasant, women, and religious sectors; with 
community organizations, associations of friendship and 
solidarity with Cuba; and with intellectuals and artists. 
  Martinez pointed out to PRENSA LATINA the importance of this 
meeting, which, in his opinion, makes evident the vigor and 
maturity of the region's new left. 
  He said: The diversity prism that this meeting displays, is 
giving shape to a new social and revolutionary transformation 
project that has no traditional conceptual framework, although 
Marxism is an important component of it. 
  Martinez said that never before had the left had the broad 
and diversified social setting it has now, with the presence of 
political forces that include movements of towns people, women, 
peasants, religious people, and ecologists, among others. 
  With regard to the criticism that regional organizations 
such 
as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Inter-American Development Bank, have made of neoliberal 
programs, the legislator said that some new economic proposals 
mean economically acknowledging neoliberalism and at the same 
time rejecting the inevitable social results of that policy. 
  He said: It is aberrant to consider only the economic face 
of the neoliberal policy while trying to lessen its negative 
social consequences. It is like trying to mix oil and vinegar, 
he said. 
  When asked about the U.S.-sponsored initiative of holding a 
Pan American summit, Martinez said that in his opinion this is 
an attempt to counter both the Iberian American summits and the 
possibility of a high-level Latin American and Caribbean meeting. 
  The Initiative for the Americas is an integrationist design 
subordinated to U.S. economic plans rather than to Latin 
American integration. 
  The meeting will conclude tomorrow with reports from the 
work 
commission and a probable, and expected, concluding speech by 
Cuban President Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 24 January (PL) -- Students of junior high 
schools, high schools, and universities have begun debating the 
country's urgent economic topics and have joined the Cuban 
parliament, which is meeting to discuss financial and economic 
topics. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino, 
first 
secretary of the Union of Young Communists (UJC), has announced 
that stemming from the grassroots organizations of the 
respective student federations, this segment of the population 
is also expressing its concerns and proposals regarding complex 
aspects of Cuba's economy. 
  He said a large part of the 500,000 members of the UJC 
belong 
to the worker and peasant sector. They are participating in 
this analysis in response to an appeal by the Cuban Workers 
Federation (CTC). 
  Contino said it is incredible to see the diversity of 
opinions that emerge in these forums and how youths between the 
ages of 14 and 25 (approximately pre-university and university 
level) state opinions on ways to reduce money in circulation 
based on experience in their own fields. Their views are then 
submitted to group analysis. 
  Contino said disagreements do occur but do not pose 
antagonizing views, because they stem from an identity of 
principles and actions of historic generations of the revolution 
and the younger generation. 
  With the integration of students into these debates, the 
national consensus is expanded to promote decisions that permit 
balancing the fiscal deficit of some $4.2 billion pesos 
(equivalent to dollars at the official rate of exchange) and 
cutting excessive money in circulation by 10 billion pesos. 
  The youth leader said although the Federation of Midlevel 
School Students (FEEM) and the University Students Federation 
(FEU) are autonomous and independent organizations, youths who 
belong to these organizations are more attracted by UJC 
activities. 
  He said adolescents and youths between the ages of 25 and 30 
require more attention. The former because they are at that age 
between childhood and adolescence, full of complications, and 
the latter because they are not interested in big parties or 
large gatherings, 
  This is reflected in recreation, he explained, where though 
discotheques in the country have increased to 37 and though 
there are 100 recreational facilities in the country, the 
particular demands of the different age groups of a population 
of 5.7 million residents from 0 to 30 years have yet to be met. 
  The 33-year-old economist, together with the person heading 
the UJC in lieu of current Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, has 
the assessment of recreational facilities, given that the last 
congress was positive, despite the fact that resources were 
drained by the country's difficult economic situation. 
  He said, nonetheless, approximately 2 million people have 
enjoyed recreational activities sponsored by the youth 
organization.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 2 
February. 
  Officials of the Cuban National Tourism Institute (Intur) 
and 
the Gaviota and Cubanacan enterprises participating in an 
international tourism fair in Madrid, Spain, gave details of 
their work throughout 1993 to the press. They pointed out that 
the amount of tourists who visited Cuba in 1993 increased by 
over 20 percent compared to 1992. The amount of visitors 
increased from 500,000 in 1992 to 600,000 in 1993. The tourism 
sector has become Cuba's third largest source of income behind 
sugar and the basic industries. (Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 
2344 GMT 29 Jan 94) 
  On 2 February, official sources reported the Banco 
Internacional de Comercio, S.A. began operating with the 
objective of bolstering economic exchange and development, an 
attempt to integrate Cuba into worldwide finances. The source 
added this is the second private bank to receive authorization 
to operate from the Cuban Government. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
2052 GMT 2 Feb 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 20 Jan (PL) -- The levels of juvenile 
delinquency and tourism-related prostitution (jineterismo, in 
popular jargon) increased in Cuba during the past few years but 
on a minor scale, according to [Juan Contino], Cuba's top youth 
leader. 
  Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists 
(UJC), has told PRENSA LATINA that the country's youths prove 
every day their high degree of preparedness in every area, 
including the area of ideology, and he denied assertions by 
ill-intentioned individuals to the effect that Cuba's youths 
"are lost." 
  Although he acknowledged it is no excuse that only a small 
number of youths are on the wrong path, Contino has said 
individuals who -- instigated by the diversionist campaigns led 
by enemies of the revolution -- undermine the merits of the new 
generations know full well they are magnifying a lie. 
  Contino explained there are segments of the youthful 
population of the island (there are approximately 3.1 million 
citizens between the ages of 15 and 30) that have behavioral 
problems that go hand in hand with the crisis Cuba is 
experiencing. 
  That the number of crimes perpetrated by youths is 
increasing 
throughout the world -- and Cuba is no exception -- does not 
justify the appearance or intensification of these phenomena in 
a socialist society, he said. He added that the UJC works on an 
individual basis in an attempt to rescue boys and girls who 
succumb to those weaknesses. 
  We know it is a difficult task that must be worked on 
everyday by everyone -- relatives, schools, teachers, social and 
political institutions, and mass organizations -- but we are 
willing to take strong actions against crime and prostitution, 
in defense of the Cuban people's peace of mind, he said. 
  Contino has disclosed the UJC is extending its actions 
beyond 
its membership -- which is estimated at approximately 500,000 -- 
to the entire youthful population, including youths who have 
committed crimes and have served time in jail, to achieve their 
reincorporation into society. 
  The 33-year-old member of the Communist Party of Cuba's 
Central Committee, an economist by profession, has said if you 
want to talk with Cuban youths, you must look for them on any 
battle field, actively engaged in the struggle to fulfill the 
revolution's leading tasks. 
  Contino has said over 40,000 youths participate in urgent 
sugar harvest tasks (to guarantee the country's leading 
industry). He has also suggested that anyone who wants to 
understand what Cuban youths are really like must go to a 
sugarcane plantation. 
  He cited as an example that over 167,000 students at the 
pre-university level and from technological institutes and 
universities volunteered to spend 15 days of their 1993 vacation 
working on farms, and more than 100,000 youths participated in 
those tasks throughout the recently ended year. 
  Contino has also explained that approximately 60 percent of 
the country's scientists and more than 70 percent of its tourism 
workers are young, authentic proof, he said, of the education 
they received from childhood. 
  The top youth leader, who replaced current Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina a year ago, has denied the existence of a crisis 
of ethical and moral values among Cuba's younger generations, 
let alone a generational struggle between the youths and the 
revolution's traditional leaders. 
  A nation with a young population whose average age is 32.1 
years -- who have brought down continuous allegations that they 
would topple the revolution --cannot have internal struggles, 
because there are no antagonistic contradictions between 
generations that share the same principles and prospects, he 
concluded. 
  The UJC, which emerged shortly after the revolution in 1961, 
is a selective and voluntary organization that is joined by the 
best Cuban students and workers of up to 30 years of age. 
  The UJC maintains relations at present with approximately 
218 
student and youth groups in 61 countries, and at home it works 
in coordination with children, youth, and student associations 
(the Jose Marti Pioneers Organization and High School and 
university student federations).

entertained by Erich Iltgen, president of the Saxon Regional 
Parliament, who offered a dinner in his honor yesterday. 
Alarcon also met with Iltgen this morning. 
  During his visit to Germany, Alarcon visited the city-state 
of Bremen, on the country's northern coast, where he met with 
local authorities and businessmen from various sectors.

meeting with President Rafael Caldera that so far no petroleum 
cooperation agreement has been reached among Russia, Cuba, and 
Venezuela, although the possibility has not been ruled out. 
  The Cuban official said talks are currently under way among 
the three states for a possible petroleum cooperation agreement 
and that each is prepared to establish a commercial operation 
that is favorable to the three countries. The Cuban vice 
president stressed, however, that the issue was not discussed 
with President Caldera because the tour of South American 
countries is focused on strengthening relations with Cuba. 
  [Begin Lage recording] We did not discuss the issue with 
President Caldera. As President Caldera said at the beginning, 
we discussed general issues. We thanked him for his position 
against the U.S. blockade on Cuba. We also expressed our 
satisfaction with his election and stressed our desire for a 
better future for Venezuelans. [end recording] 
  In the short 24-hour visit to Venezuela, the Cuban vice 
president noted his interest in strengthening ties between 
Venezuela and Colombia [sentence as heard]. To that end, he 
held meetings with the ministers of tourism, foreign affairs, 
and communications and transportation and with the president of 
the Venezuelan Investment Fund.

  [Text] Caracas, 5 Feb (EFE) -- Official sources said on 5 
February that the tax reform proposed by the administration of 
President Rafael Caldera will include a 20-percent tax on luxury 
goods. 
  The government is bidding to offset a drop in revenues 
caused 
by the planned elimination of the value-added tax (VAT) that is 
levied on all consumers. President Caldera has called the VAT 
"an unfair burden on the less fortunate classes." 
  The VAT, which went into effect in January and later was 
temporarily suspended until 28 February, will continue to be 
levied on importers and wholesalers. As for consumers, the VAT 
will be replaced by a tax on luxury goods. 
  A tax of 18-20 percent will be levied on a lengthy list of 
items that includes cellular telephones, television sets, 
motorcycles, planes, helicopters, yachts, jewelry, thoroughbreds 
and race horses, fighting bulls, and five-star hotels. 
  The government already approved a 10-percent reduction in 
the 
national budget, which according to the original draft amounts 
to about 1.5 trillion bolivares (about $15.5 billion), to offset 
the impact caused by the partial elimination of the VAT. 
  This $1.5-billion reduction would basically affect funds 
earmarked for nonpriority public works. These works, however, 
would not be completely halted, because a system of concessions 
would be implemented to promote the direct participation of the 
private sector. 
  If these measures do not suffice to balance fiscal accounts, 
which are currently estimated to show a deficit of about 500 
billion bolivares (about $5.1 billion) by year's end, the 
government would consider the possibility of levying a tax on 
banking operations. This tax, which was included in the early 
plans by some Caldera advisers, has been postponed for now, but 
governmental sources pointed out that it could be implemented by 
mid-1994 if the desired results are not achieved by that time 
through the initial measures. 
  At any rate, budget cuts, new taxes, and the partial 
elimination of the VAT must all be approved by Congress, where 
President Caldera lacks sound support and where it is feared 
that he might find strong opposition.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Colombia's International Sugar and Molasses Marketing 
Company 
purchased the Urena Sugar Mill for 320 million bolivares. The 
transaction was conducted at the Venezuelan Investment Fund 
(FIV) offices. FIV President Nelson Rivera stated the 
transaction was beneficial for the country because the 
investment and expenditures incurred throughout the sale process 
were recovered. (Caracas Venezolana de Television in Spanish 
2350 GMT 27 Jan 94) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) has reported that, owing 
to 
a reduction in oil revenues, Venezuela's international reserves 
dropped by $744 million last January and now total $11.912 
billion. According to the BCV, another factor contributing to 
the decline is the climate of mistrust that exists in the 
financial market in the wake of the government's intervention in 
Banco Latino. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2234 GMT 3 Feb 94) 
  Venezuela foreign debt bonds have been hurt by a decrease in 
value of U.S. long-term bonds. The par bond fell one point to 
70.75 due to U.S. 30-year bond sales. In addition, investors 
have adopted a cautious stance as they are waiting to see what 
specific measures President Rafael Caldera will take. (Caracas 
EL NACIONAL in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p E-1)

  [Text] Monday, Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria said he 
was surprised by UN Human Rights Rapporteur Pedro Nikkem's 
report. The Nikkem report was presented at the UN Human Rights 
Commission, which is currently meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, 
to analyze the situation in different countries. 
  The Nikkem report criticizes the lack of respect for human 
rights in El Salvador, and notes that compliance with the peace 
accord has decreased in recent months. 
  According to Oscar Santamaria, the report was prepared 
abroad 
and does not correspond to the country's reality. He also 
rejected claims of a decrease in compliance with the peace 
process. The official expressed regret Pedro Nikkem had not 
visited El Salvador to conclude his report, and he said the UN 
rapporteur's role is to support the government in human rights 
affairs. 
  In his report, Pedro Nikkem criticizes the Salvadoran 
Government's lack of cooperation. He said immigration obstacles 
had been created to prevent his visit, which was scheduled for 
the end of last year.

  [Text] A spokeswoman for the nongovernmental Salvadoran 
Human Rights Commission [CDHES] has said that organization 
shares the views on human rights in El Salvador expressed in the 
report presented by UN human rights expert Pedro Nikkem. [Name 
indistinct], a CDHES board member said the report on human 
rights in El Salvador presented by an international expert this 
week in Geneva was objective. In the report, Nikkem notes a 
notable increase in the number of murders in 1993. 
  [Begin unidentified spokeswoman recording] The report 
discloses the latest information on human rights violations. We 
share Mr. Pedro Nikkem's views and think it is regrettable that 
he was unable to enter the country to confirm or verify human 
rights violations. In spite of that fact, we believe his report 
presents the facts objectively, and we totally agree with him. 
  The CDHES does not believe his report is any less valid 
because he was unable to enter our country. If you examine the 
report you will see that the points Nikkem discussed are based 
on fact. He discussed issues such as the latest illegal 
executions, the [word indistinct] process, and the government's 
failure to fulfill its land distribution agreement. He also 
discussed at length the structural deficiencies of the legal 
system and the new group created to investigate the death squads. 
  Regarding the human rights situation, he said the peace 
process has been weakened and has suffered a reversal. We agree 
with him because of the latest incidents in the country, 
particularly in mid-1993. [end recording] 
  The CDHES board of directors believes it is necessary to 
redouble efforts to end the delays mentioned by Nikkem, 
especially the (?crimes) perpetrated by the death squads, so the 
peace process will not be reversed. 
  Meanwhile, the spokeswoman announced the group investigating 
the death squads will soon hold a meeting with the CDHES to 
apprise it of the group's work.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In another turn of events, 
Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro has termed as 
irresponsible the report presented to the United Nations by 
human rights expert (name indistinct). The human rights expert 
on 24 January presented a report to the United Nations in which 
he stated individual rights are still being violated in El 
Salvador. Here is what Gutierrez Castro has said: 
  [Begin Gutierrez Castro recording, in progress] ...report. 
First, I am not surprised, as many of these individuals hold 
their posts by issuing alarming reports. If you are appointed 
to watch over something and you report that everything is 
alright, then why do they need you? Second, I think it is 
irresponsible on the part of a person who has not even come 
here--he has not visited the courts, has no knowledge of the 
process, has not seen any of this-- to issue reports criticizing 
or labeling the human rights situation here. 
  For example, you are giving an account of what is being said 
here. How can you give an account? You can give an account 
because you are present, you are hearing what is going on, you 
are perceiving it through the [words indistinct]. I do not 
think you could be giving a report on what is being done at the 
Legal Medical Institute if you were in New York; therefore it is 
absurd. I think it is irresponsible to issue such a report.

  [Text] The Legislative Assembly has approved a decree 
stipulating the Intellectual Copyright Law will take effect 15 
June. It also granted a 10-day extension to the political 
parties to present nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils. 
  Last week, the legislative plenary was asked to extend the 
deadline for the implementation of this law, known as the 
"Antipiracy Law" six months. Several sources, who do not know 
the parliamentary procedures for such actions, had said the 
extension had already been granted. It was not until Wednesday 
night, however, when the legislative commission presented a 
report favoring a four- month extension that Congress issued a 
decree stating the law would take effect on 15 June 1994. 
Originally, it was to take effect on 16 February. 
  Board members of the Savings and Loan Cooperative 
Association, Video Supply and Marketing of El Salvador, 
Association of Cassette Distributors and Reproducers of Eastern 
Salvador, and the Committee of Cassette Venders and Reproducers 
requested the deadline be extended. 
  The law to develop and protect intellectual copyrights, 
which 
was approved on 15 July, regulates all issues related to 
intellectual copyright and, at the same time, promotes and 
protects the literary, artistic, scientific, and industrial 
copyrights of Salvadoran nationals. This law stipulates that 
firms that distribute and sell music cassettes or rent video 
cassettes must pay royalties to the creator. With this 
extension, Congress is giving those firms four more months to 
adjust to the situation. 
  The deadline for political parties to present their lists of 
nominations to the Vote Receiving Councils ended yesterday. 
Since most parties had not prepared their lists, however, 
Congress extended the deadline 10 days. 
  Political organizations must present a list of council 
nominations to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Among other 
things, the Vote Receiving Councils count the votes after the 
voting period ends and record the result on the corresponding 
electoral certificate.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 8 
February 1994. 
  The Central Reserve Bank today reported that 42 percent of 
El 
Salvador's overall exports go to Central America, 30 percent to 
the United States, 7 percent to Germany, while the remainder are 
distributed among several other nations. The bank also reported 
that Guatemala is El Salvador's main trading partner. 
Meanwhile, exports to Mexico doubled over the past two years 
from $8 million to $16 million in 1993. The bank also reported 
that the GDP rose 5 percent in 1993, and it is expected to 
increase 6 percent in 1994. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2047 
GMT 1 Feb 94) 
  An economic analysis indicates that exports have doubled 
from 
1989 to 1993, going from $600 million to more than $1.1 billion. 
This translates into a better standard of living and more 
resources for the people and the nation. Overall export growth 
has been driven by an increase in nontraditional exports, 
particularly in the assembly plant sector. Also, while coffee 
prices have fallen, coffee exports have increased. (San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 4 Feb 94) 
  Roberto Orellana, president of the Central Reserve Bank, 
reports the Multisector Investment Bank will open its doors 
within the next few days with capital amounting to 300 million 
cordobas. The bank's goals are to contribute to economic growth 
and to generate jobs by financing capital investments in the 
private sector. Orellana reports that the bank will receive a 
$30 million credit from the International Development Bank to 
implement a program to bolster small businesses. This new 
banking institution will only grant loans to the private sector 
for investment projects. (San Salvador LA PRENSA in Spanish 4 
Feb 94 p 3) 
  The agricultural sector has moved from a severe, decade-long 
recession in the 1980's to growth in the 1990's. Among those 
product groups that have shown signs of growth are basic grains, 
coffee, and sugar cane. An increase in the number of manzanas 
cultivated nationwide helped increase the overall harvest from 
18.4 million quintals in 1989 to more than 21 quintals in 1993. 
In addition, credits to the agricultural sector have increased 
from 1.3 million colones in 1989 to 3.2 million colones in 1993.

  [Excerpts] Bolivia and Paraguay have signed a letter of 
intent that can open prospects for selling gas to that country. 
This important document was signed during the visit Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner is paying to Bolivia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Bolivian foreign minister and his Paraguayan counterpart 
today signed a major document of understanding that determinedly 
supports the construction of a gas pipeline between Puerta 
Grande, Bolivia, and Asuncion, Paraguay, for supplying Bolivian 
natural and liquefied petroleum gas to that nation. 
  [Begin Ramirez Boettner recording] I believe the work we did 
yesterday afternoon and today to prepare for the visit Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will pay to Paraguay on 14 
and 15 March has been very fruitful. 
  Among the issues we addressed -- because we addressed 
several 
issues -- one of the more important is the one dealing with the 
energy problem, that is, the possible sale of Bolivian gas to 
Paraguay. [end recording]. 
  In addition to the Bolivian president's visit to Paraguay, 
other major issues were considered like economic 
supplementation; a tripartite agreement on the Pilcomayo River 
by Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Paraguay-Parana 
waterway; and the Trans-Chaco Highway. 
  Concerning the sale of gas to Paraguay, the price and volume 
will be decided at a meeting of specialists from Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits and a Paraguayan private enterprise. 
  The construction of the gas pipeline will be totally 
financed 
with private capital. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: Detente Reaches Vietnam] </F>
  [Text] As U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently 
put it, economic policy is an increasingly important component 
of the U.S. foreign policy. This is so because President 
Clinton is determined that his country should resume the role of 
the driving force of the world economy. To achieve this, 
Clinton must defend U.S. companies and create new jobs in 
industry and agriculture. Much of the president's effort has 
been geared to the approval of NAFTA; to the holding of the 
Asia-Pacific Conference in Seattle; to the successful conclusion 
of the Uruguay Round of the GATT -- which will enable the United 
States to sell its agricultural surpluses for several years 
while restructuring the sector and being instrumental in 
improving competitiveness all over the world; to pressuring 
Japan, the PRC, the ROK, and other countries to improve the U.S. 
balance of trade position; and so on and so forth. The lifting 
on the embargo on trade with Vietnam is another chapter in this 
long string of events. 
  The initiative is neither surprising nor does it stem from 
Clinton's past convictions about the Vietnam War, even though 
public opinion believes his action is undoubtedly tinged by 
memories and emotions of that cruel war -- without mentioning 
the "missing" U.S. soldiers whose whereabouts have never been 
disclosed by the Hanoi authorities. They have not repatriated 
the mortal remains of all the fallen to their homeland either. 
  And yet, bilateral relations have eased off considerably. 
Back in April 1991, General John Vessey, an envoy of the then 
President George Bush, met with the Vietnamese foreign minister 
to notify him of the opening of an official U.S. office to 
investigate the fate of the U.S. soldiers reported as missing. 
They also discussed the possible resumption of diplomatic 
relations on condition Vietnam withdrew its troops from 
Cambodia, and that the South Vietnamese officers being held in 
"rehabilitation camps" be released and authorized to travel to 
the United States. It goes without saying that the United 
States also made it a condition that Vietnam should actively 
cooperate in the search of the missing. In exchange for that, 
rapprochement would continue (telecommunications, tourism) and 
restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats before the United 
Nation in New York would be lifted. 
  Following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia 
in mid December 1992 and Vietnamese cooperation over the 
missing, Washington authorized U.S. companies to "prepare 
themselves" in Vietnam because the raising of the embargo was 
considered imminent. Washington also gave the "green light" for 
international credits for Vietnam for the reconstruction of the 
country. 
  Following a line of diplomatic continuity at the beginning 
of 
July 1993, President Clinton announced that the United States 
would no longer oppose the granting of loans for Hanoi by 
international organizations (the IMF and the World Bank). By 
that time, the economic reform in Vietnam had attracted 
significant foreign investments, mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Japan, and Europe. 
  Finally, Washington sent three consular affairs experts to 
Hanoi in July 1993 to look after fellow citizens who travelled 
to Vietnam in ever-increasing numbers. By this time the 
Vietnamese had "found" the blue book where the names of all the 
U.S. prisoners of war were recorded and submitted the list to 
Gen. Vessey. This report agreed more with the documents 
obtained from Soviet archives than with the original list 
drafted by Hanoi. 
  Parallel to the progress on the missing was the 
consideration 
that, from a very modest start, Vietnam's economy was growing 
in leaps and bounds. It grew by 7.5 percent in 1992, and in 
1993 things looked even better (industrial production increased 
by 12.3 percent in nine months in 1993). Exports were expanding 
at an average 20 percent a year. Foreign investments for the 
period 1988 to August 1993 totalled $6.300 billion. This 
contrasts sharply with the constraints on U.S. companies that 
could only participate in business transactions with Vietnam 
through contracts with international organizations. 
  Thus U.S. businessmen as well as the Senate enthusiastically 
hailed the lifting of the trade embargo. U.S. companies, ready 
and eager like racehorses at the starting gate, began activities 
without wasting a minute, as has been eloquently recorded by 
newspapers over the last few days. The logic of business 
prevailed over [former President Richard] Nixon-like ideologies 
which were furthered by those who want to continue struggling 
against the last pockets of "the empire of the evil" until it is 
totally routed, or at least until it is smothered. The 
reestablishment of full diplomatic relations will have to wait 
until the issue of the missing is totally cleared up. 
  The United States created 62,000 new jobs in January, 26,000 
of which are in the industrial sector. It thus keeps reducing 
its unemployment rate, which runs at approximately 6.4 percent. 
This is much lower than the average in the European Union (10.9 
percent), but higher than that of Germany, which is currently 6 
percent. This is the reason why Clinton continues his trade 
offensive -- to expand exports and reduce imports -- as the 
basis for the country's productive renewal. He is aware that in 
our modern world, nobody can indulge in the luxury of giving up 
one's domestic market or a highly remunerative job lest one 
should plunge into the maelstrom of decadence.

  [Text] San Jose, [no date as received] (AFP) -- Two days 
after being elected president of Costa Rica, according to 
associates of President-elect Jose Maria Figueres, Figueres has 
nearly finished forming the cabinet with which he will rule this 
Central American nation during the next four years beginning on 
8 May. 
  Although Figueres has not officially announced his cabinet, 
some of his associates who refused to be identified said former 
ministers, ambassadors, and deputies have been asked to be part 
of the next government of this country that has a population of 
3.2 million. 
  According to the sources, former Minister Fernando Naranjo 
will occupy the top post at the Foreign Ministry; Deputy 
Alejandro Soto will head the Information and Communications 
Ministry; Carlos Espinach, who directed Figueres' election 
campaign, will lead the Presidency Ministry; Fernando Herrero 
will head the Planning Ministry; Eduardo Doryan will be in 
charge of the Housing Ministry; and Bernardo Arce will lead the 
Government and Public Security Ministry. Former Deputy Planning 
Minister Leonardo Garnier is being considered as a possible 
candidate for the Finance Ministry position, while hotel owner 
Carlos Roesch is being mentioned for the top post at the Tourism 
Ministry. 
  Also mentioned are Roberto Solorzano, one of Figueres' 
closest associates in the campaign, to lead the Culture 
Ministry; Mario Carvajal to head either the Economy or Foreign 
Trade Ministry; Francisco Nicolas to assume the top post at the 
Transportation Ministry; and former Comptroller General Elias 
Soler to take up the reins of the Labor Ministry. According to 
the sources, Figueres has yet to decide who will occupy the top 
posts in the Agriculture, Justice, Natural Resources, and Health 
Ministries.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Today, Central Bank President Jorge Corrales said the Bank's 
foreign currency increased by more than $90 million in January. 
Corrales added that the Bank's reserves, estimated at $800 
million, are equivalent to the financing of almost five months 
of imports. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1835 GMT 3 Feb 94) 
  Central Bank President Corrales said GNP growth registered 
in 
1992 and 1993 was the highest rate for a two-year period in the 
past nine years. According to the Economic Commission for Latin 
America, in 1993, Costa Rica registered the highest economic 
growth in Latin America, 6.5 percent. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 26 Jan 94 p 12A) 
  During a 21 January meeting of coffee-producers in 
Guatemala, 
Costa Rica set the minimum price for its coffee exports at $80 
per quintal. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p 24A) 
  On 28 January, the Costa Rican Government and the Central 
Bank signed a payment agreement for the fiscal debt of 2.122 
billion colones. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Tellechea] </F>
  [Text] Dresden, 4 Feb (DPA) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president 
of the Cuban National Assembly who is in this city today at the 
end of his official three-day visit to Germany, has said that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton has moderated the policy on Cuba 
that the George Bush administration handed down to Clinton 
through the Torricelli Law. 
  After expressing to his German hosts measured optimism about 
the possibility of the U.S. embargo against Cuba being eased 
during the latter half of Clinton's current term, or his second 
term should he be reelected, Alarcon told DPA that Havana has 
observed Washington becoming more flexible in the practical 
enforcement of the strict embargo. 
  Alarcon, a former foreign minister and deputy foreign 
minister, was until today guest of Rita Sussmuth, president of 
the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). Alarcon met with 
representatives of the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
federal deputies, and members of the regional parliaments of 
Bremen and Saxony in the former East Germany. 
  Alarcon believes an eventual easing of the U.S. embargo 
against Cuba, which has lasted more than three decades, can take 
place in Clinton's second term, because the issue is still too 
heavily loaded, ideologically speaking, and the U.S. 
Administration still does not have enough latitude to make a 
political decision of this nature. 
  Alarcon, who did not conceal from his hosts Cuba's interest 
in the current PRC model of evolution toward political 
liberalization by way of cautious economic reforms, nevertheless 
said that so far there has been no direct official contact 
between the U.S. and Cuban governments. [sentence as received] 
  According to Alarcon, Havana observes "the U.S. Government's 
language is changing." For example, Cuban authorities have 
taken notice of "a reiterated statement by the U.S. State 
Department and Assistant Secretary of State Watson, saying that 
U.S. territory will not be permitted to be used for terrorist 
activities or violence against Cuba." 
  Alarcon said: "This is what the American Neutrality Act 
states, and this is normal in international law. But the United 
States never said this during the past 12 years of Republican 
administrations. This is something we cannot overlook." 
  He added that "the U.S. Government's position during the 
neuritis epidemic in Cuba" must also be considered in this 
regard. Washington "did not object to several U.S. scientists 
from National Institute of Health traveling to Cuba." The U.S. 
scientists "cooperated with Cuban authorities and made very 
unbiased remarks about Cuba when they concluded their work." 
The experts "returned to the United States, but kept in touch 
with Cuban researchers. The reason for this is still being 
discussed and pondered. It is interesting to note this, because 
the neuritis epidemic can occur elsewhere." 
  Alarcon declined to comment on the lifting of the U.S. 
embargo on Vietnam after 20 years. He also elected not to imply 
that he can base his moderate optimism concerning Cuban-U.S. 
relations on this decision. 
  The Clinton era represents for the United States a great 
leap 
ahead, since the generation that served in World War II and 
experienced "McCarthyism" until the time of the young men who 
either fought or refused to enlist in the Vietnam war. [sentence 
as received] 
  The personalities who were active during the administrations 
of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson have disappeared or 
retired, while some who belonged to Jimmy Carter's time are 
still alive. Nevertheless, most members of the Clinton team are 
much younger people, unrelated to active politics since they 
were in the opposition during the quarter century of the 
Republican Party's several terms in the White House -- since 
Richard Nixon in 1968. 
  All this can explain to Cuban authorities the whys and 
wherefores of the transformations under way today in the United 
States, and why the Clinton administration has established a 
policy allowing women and Hispanics to hold positions of 
responsibility.

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage will meet with 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera today in Caracas. Lage 
arrived in Venezuela from Brazil, where he met with President 
Itamar Franco and other government officials, political leaders, 
and local businessmen. 
  Venezuelan media have reported that Caldera has the 
intention 
of maintaining good relations with Cuba. In Caracas, Lage will 
also meet with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, 
who aspires to become secretary general of the Organization of 
American States and who has recently declared that he favors the 
reintegration of Cuba into that Panamerican association. 
  Another important meeting that Lage will hold during his 
brief stay in Venezuela will be with the directorate of the 
Petroleos enterprise to examine the possibilities of resuming 
the triangular oil trade that existed between Caracas, Moscow, 
and Havana. In statements to the press in Rio de Janeiro, prior 
to his departure for Caracas, Lage pointed out that every day 
the United States is more isolated in its policy of blockade 
against Cuba. He added that an example of this is the passage of 
resolutions against Washington's economic retaliations against 
Havana by the UN General Assembly for two consecutive years. 
  Today, Lage will travel to Colombia on an official visit.

  [Text] Cuban vice President Carlos Lage met this afternoon 
with Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, with whom he discussed 
the possibilities of strengthening bilateral ties. Lage is the 
first foreign figure to meet with President Caldera. The main 
topics discussed were oil trade, and prospects for the export of 
Cuban biotechnology products to Venezuela, as well as the need 
to intensify the struggle against the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  Lage also met with several Venezuelan businessmen and will 
travel early tomorrow to Colombia. 
  [In the same cast, Rebelde adds that during his trip to 
Caracas, Lage reiterated Cuba's interest in promoting Latin 
American investments in Cuba, which is taking measures to adapt 
its economy to global conditions. Lage met with Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and other officials. 
Lage added that Cuba is opening to foreign capitals, preferably 
in Latin America, with which it hopes to strengthen political 
ties and move toward integration. Lage stressed that Cuba does 
not want to become capitalist, just to adapt to the global 
situation and perfect the socialist model.]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the </F>
National Assembly of the People's Government, in Paris by Radio 
Rebelde journalist Maria Elena Alonso -- live, monitored in 
progress] 
  [Text] [Alonso]...Cuban official on his tour through 
Europe. A very good afternoon to you, Alarcon. 
  [Alarcon] Good afternoon, Comrade. 
  [Alonso] We have been following your meetings very 
attentively, in both Belgium and Germany -- with 
parliamentarians, government representatives, and businessmen's 
groups. Let us talk a little about the talks you have had in 
France, please. 
  [Alarcon] In France we have talked with Deputy Andre 
Santini, 
who is the chairman of the production and exchange committee of 
the [National] Assembly -- who, as a matter of fact, will be 
arriving in Havana next Sunday [13 February] at the head of a 
delegation from the French National Assembly. He is also the 
president of the French National Assembly's Friendship With Cuba 
group and a leader of one of the parties in the current French 
Government. 
  In fact, we have just come from a very important meeting 
with 
comrade (Robert Hughes), who is the new national secretary of 
the French Communist Party [PCF]. We met with him and a group of 
comrades from that party. It was truly a very friendly meeting 
-- there was a lot of camaraderie -- at which the PCF's very 
clear policy of solidarity with Cuba was reiterated. 
  As you know, the PCF has been at the center of a growing 
movement of solidarity with Cuba that has been expressed through 
the ship of solidarity, and recently the plane that [word 
indistinct] Cuba, with its group of persons of all leanings from 
France, carrying, in addition, important material aid. And there 
is much contact with friendship associations and with the entire 
movement of solidarity with Cuba in this country, in which the 
PCF has been (?at the very center). 
  Comrade (Hughes) reaffirmed to us very clearly the 
continuity 
of that policy on the part of the PCF, following the congress 
during which he was elected national secretary. We brought him a 
message from Comrade Fidel. It was truly a very gratifying, very 
friendly conversation. 
  Tomorrow, we will meet with the president of the French 
National Assembly and with the president of the Senate, and we 
also have another meeting with French parliamentarians. 
  [Alonso] We understand that you and the delegation that you 
are heading will be ending your tour of Europe next Friday [11 
February]. 
  [Alarcon] (?Yes) [Words indistinct] we will be back in Cuba. 
  [Alonso] If you were to make an overall assessment, how 
would 
you describe the talks and meetings in these three countries? 
  [Alarcon] I would say that, in the first place, there is a 
great and growing interest in Cuba's situation. People want to 
know about our problems, about our prospects, from a point of 
view that I would describe as very open, very objective. We 
really have talked to people of every inclination, every 
ideological position, every point of view, and every profession 
-- including important businessmen, especially in Germany. And 
Cuba has encountered that open attitude toward what Cuba means 
today, in the world, and also a growing empathy. I mean, I think 
the stage of astonishment over how Cuba was able to survive the 
tremendous blow of the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the 
socialist bloc, etc., is over; now people are beginning, rather, 
to study our experience. 
  Moreover, to many people in Europe, Cuba means the very 
singular case of a country where material and economic 
difficulties are being confronted while there is, at the same 
time, an attempt to preserve such fundamental human values as 
solidarity, respect for people's rights, etc. 
  Europe leaves one with a very interesting impression: One 
walks the streets here and finds, all over the place, street 
musicians, acrobats, people out there inventing things, to see 
how they can survive -- in one of the planet's most developed 
places but a place where the main theme is unemployment, is what 
they call marginalized people, those on the margins of society. 
  (?I was just) seeing, over French television here, how the 
level of unemployment in the western part of Germany already 
exceeds 4 million. In the former GDR, the figures are even more 
impressive. It goes as high as 20 percent of the work force in 
parts of that country. 
  That is to say, there are very serious problems there. Many 
people have no place to live. They found themselves in the 
streets; and, in the streets, they sing, recite poetry, do 
acrobatics, seek ways to get help from others in order to 
survive. And they see the case of Cuba -- a poor, underdeveloped 
country, but one where, collectively, making use of the wisdom 
of all, we try to find ways to solve our problems while 
preserving the kind of society that many truly find 
inspirational, [repeats] many, going beyond affinities and.... 
[leaves sentence unfinished] 
  [Alonso] Of course. By contrast I wanted Alarcon -- because 
it happens that a delegation of French businessmen is in our 
country from the National Council of French Employers [Consejo 
Nacional del Patronato Frances], a private organization that is 
here to assess possibilities for doing business. I tell you this 
because, I repeat: You are over there, and we have this other 
delegation over here. 
  [Alarcon] [Words indistinct] has talked to me about that 
visit, a very important visit. They are not simply a group of 
businessmen. They represent the employers of France, the owners 
of French businesses. There are some very important firms 
represented there, heavy-weight firms. And, as I was saying to 
you, to this is added the parliamentary delegation that arrives 
Sunday, and a third group of French friends, promoters of Havana 
cigars, which are very popular here. They, too, are going to be 
in Havana these days. So there will soon be representatives of 
the cream of French society over there. 
  As for this businessmen's delegation that is over there now: 
Here in Paris, the people we have spoken with look upon it with 
great interest, and also as evidence of an interest in studying 
the Cuban market and establishing increasingly solid ties. 
  [Alonso] Thank you very much, Alarcon, for your words for 
the 
"Doing Radio" program. Have a good return trip. 
  [Alarcon] Thank you.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" Program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE magazine -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Roque] Today, Osvaldo Rodriguez will discuss the 
suggestions to increase prices as a method of absorbing some of 
the excess currency. This is a topic arising from the process at 
work centers, the workers parliaments, during which workers have 
suggested increasing the prices of regulated products. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe these ideas refer not only to 
products listed in the industrial-consumption or 
food-consumption catalogs, but also to other products such as 
gasoline for personal use. There are those who suggest we return 
to a parallel market. That would be marvelous. 
  But how would we establish a parallel market? Resources are 
needed to import products, resources, or raw materials in order 
to produce things in Cuba, or a combination of these items, 
which is how we carried out a parallel market. The parallel 
market would be a good solution, but we do not have the 
conditions for a parallel market. 
  [Roque] Nevertheless, there are some products today that are 
still being subsidized. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, there are basic products for human 
consumption that are subsidized, and I believe that for now, we 
cannot even think about increasing prices on them. I am talking 
about milk. Milk is sold at 25 cents. Nevertheless, the 
production cost of a liter of milk in Cuba, the cost not only at 
the dairy farm, but at the marketplace as well, is much more. 
That is a subsidized product. Obviously, today we are discussing 
-- and I tend to believe we should subsidize people, not 
products -- whether that is how things should be. I believe they 
should. I believe we should subsidize people with lower incomes 
so they can purchase that milk at 25 cents. 
  [Roque] I am referring to products that are not basic, but 
other products -- we could say industrial products -- that are 
priced very low. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe our pricing policy has been a bit 
generous in that sense. In the world, raw materials have 
increased in value, fuel prices have increased, labor costs have 
increased in Cuba. The general salaries reform increased the 
cost of labor. Yet, we remain static, with the same prices for 
dozens of years. 
  [Roque] What should we do then? 
  [Rodriguez] Well, I believe a policy of prices in harmony 
with the current situation should be considered. That is the 
suggestion many workers have made. The problem is that we lack 
products. Today, when you look at the spectrum of what we are 
receiving through the official market, rum and cigarettes are 
two of those products that we would not call "necessities." 
  [Roque] "Necessities" in quotation marks. 
  [Rodriguez] That is right -- in quotation marks. I believe 
these could be easy targets, explainable and reasonable, for a 
noticeable price increase. Some have even suggested eliminating 
the cigarette from the quota because right now cigarettes are 
being sold at three different prices: 30 cents for those 
regulated by the quota; the other, which they call additional, 
for 1.60 pesos; and when sought on the free market, another at 8 
pesos. 
  [Roque] Could all these be joined together? 
  [Rodriguez] I believe they could. That is the suggestion the 
workers have been making in the parliaments. 
  [Roque] This idea is for cigarettes. People may be able to 
understand that, but there are other ideas, about rum, that 
people have not been able to accept. 
  [Rodriguez] The problem is that we are talking about two 
different products that should not be lacking in that market. 
Yet there is a shortage. Way before cigarettes, I remember there 
began to be a shortage of rum. At the time, they claimed that 
there was a problem with the bottles. 
  [Roque] That was the first problem. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, the first problem. Nevertheless, since 
then, 
we have seen other causes. The recent sugar harvest was a small 
harvest. A harvest of 4.2 million tonnes, a sugar harvest that 
left little molasses. When you have little molasses, you must 
decide whether you are going to produce more alcohol or use it 
for animal feed. Today, we need to recover our livestock, so the 
decision is obvious. Now, when you allot a quantity to the 
production of alcohol, you must maintain a level of supply on 
the world market because it is a way to generate income. It is a 
product that has a market, which we cannot give up. Renato 
[Recio] discussed this not too long ago on a program on this 
subject. 
  With a bottle of rum, we could probably buy three packages 
of aspirin -- with just one bottle on the world market. We need 
that money and the hard currency. At the same time, this goes 
against the very production of the domestic market. The domestic 
market has suffered, even though the international market has 
also suffered because when you distill molasses, you do not 
always obtain alcohol at a level of quality for that 
international market. Then there are two or three grades. When 
one reduces the amount of molasses distilled, one also reduces 
the amount of product to be allocated for the foreign market. 
  [Roque] In view of the fact that there is little production, 
there are provinces such as Havana City that maintain 
distribution of the regulated rum, and it becomes an obligation 
to the consumer having to guarantee that bottle every month. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe this is a mistake. My personal opinion 
is -- and I believe we have come here to speak frankly -- that 
this is a mistake. When you regulate, you are obligated. The 
same thing happens with cigarettes because when you regulate a 
product, you are obliged to maintain a supply per capita. You 
give to the person who drinks as well as to the person who does 
not drink. 
  [Roque] This creates a black market for rum and cigarettes. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [Roque] This is something we discussed a few days ago on 
this 
program. Nevertheless, I believe we must also seek acceptable 
criteria so that the new prices are reasonable, because we 
cannot let some drink rum and smoke while others cannot. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, this thing about being reasonable is a bit 
difficult. This topic on prices is very complex. When you think 
that your salary is around 150 or 200 pesos and you have to face 
a market to satisfy a vice or addiction, as in the case of the 
cigarette, you need to buy it at an exorbitant price. This 
undoubtedly might irritate smokers. As a matter of fact, there 
are many smokers who are so addicted to cigarettes that they 
become anxious. Their nervous systems are affected. There are 
some who cannot even eat. it It is therefore a very delicate 
subject. 
  I want listeners to understand the suggestion: If the price 
of cigarettes would increase -- I am not being specific because 
I have no idea of what the state would be willing to place as a 
cap, or how much the consumer would be willing to pay -- this 
price would effect both sides, the consumer and the seller. In 
the case of cigarettes, if the cigarette quota was eliminated, 
smokers could still get cigarettes. There would be a supply. The 
same could happen with rum. I do not believe there would be an 
abundance since there is not enough of the product for 
abundance. But, if only those people who wish to drink rum were 
to go to the market to buy it, then to some degree we could 
solve the problem of demand. Now, I do not believe that 
regulating these products by price would be legal or ethical, as 
in a market economy, supply and demand. But if prices were to 
increase slightly, we might be able to stabilize supply and 
demand. 
  [Roque] Osvaldo, I am not clear on what you said about the 
mechanisms of the market economy. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, I was referring to one thing -- how the 
market economy operates. Prices are increased until they 
regulate and stabilize the balance between supply and demand. 
That is not what I am talking about. 
  [Roque] That is not the case. 
  [Rodriguez] I am simply saying that if prices were a bit 
higher and regulation of these products was eliminated, we would 
be able to achieve the goal of stabilizing supply and demand and 
could recover some of the excess currency. If today you consider 
the price a person who drinks rum is willing to pay for the 
bottle, and the person who smokes for a box of cigarettes, you 
would realize that there is undoubtedly a high level of buying 
power, or liquidity, as it is commonly called in accounting. 
  [Roque] Yes, but not everybody has the purchasing power or 
the money to buy the rum or cigarettes at the exorbitant prices 
being charged. 
  [Rodriguez] That is why I am saying that they would not be 
sold at those prices. The price should not be the black market 
price. A bottle of rum should not be sold at 120 or 100 pesos. 
That is hyperbole. 
  [Roque] Because then it would be a privilege to drink rum 
and 
smoke in this country, and that cannot be. 
  [Rodriguez] You are right. I agree that it should not be a 
privilege. I believe it should be an option, and that everybody 
should have access to these products, but at an increased price. 
  [Roque] Undoubtedly, we are discussing a complex topic 
because these are suggestions that are being made at the workers 
parliaments. It does not mean that these measures are going to 
be adopted immediately. That requires a great deal of analysis. 
Furthermore, not everything that is suggested in these 
parliaments is going to be implemented. They are suggestions 
that arise and are later carefully analyzed to determine at what 
point it is convenient to adopt measures. 
  [Rodriguez] Soon, there is going to be an extraordinary 
session of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] and that is where policies will be established -- not 
measures. Measures cannot be seen separately from the economy. 
In other words, you cannot adopt a series of measures for this, 
which we call internal finance, and other measures for the other 
part of the economy. That is why the workers parliaments today 
analyze two basic issues: how to increase efficiency at the work 
center, and suggestions for national measures. 
  [Roque] You mentioned efficiency. If we were capable of 
producing some of the products that we give to the population 
today, at a higher quality, we could also charge a lot more. 
This would be another way of collecting the excess currency that 
is circulating on the street. I repeat, these are initiatives 
and ideas that need to be analyzed because they are important. 
Bread is an example. I would rather pay 40 cents for a loaf of 
good bread than 5 cents for a loaf that is not good. 
  [Rodriguez] Not only that, we need to look at the raw 
material that is invested to make that bread. The large 
quantities of materials that are wasted or that spoil. 
  [Roque] Or the materials that are stolen. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, the materials that are stolen. That 
quantity 
is also pretty high. But if they could use all the raw materials 
and resources we have, efficiently, we could undoubtedly have 
more. 
  [Roque] Well, we began talking about rum and cigarettes and 
we ended up talking about bread. In this program we have 
analyzed some suggestions regarding price as a method of 
absorbing excess currency.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Education Minister Luis Gomez </F>
Gutierrez by Ricardo Lopez and Hilda Suarez at the Yuri Gagarin 
Polytechnic School in Caimito -- live] 
  [Text] [Gomez] Well, during this special period we have 
learned to do many things in the education centers, and at the 
Ministry we have learned how to use our resources more 
rationally. We can also say that with fewer resources, we have 
begun classes and are trying hard to enhance the quality of 
education, which we think is possible. We believe that a good 
education does not depend on imports, currency, or raw 
materials, but mostly on political willingness. We have this 
because we have excellent teachers who are opposed to the 
closing of any school, and who are willing to make all possible 
efforts so the quality of education will be continually improved. 
  [Lopez] The schools in the interior involve a more difficult 
process because there we need some resources, and the 
agricultural polytechnic institutes are capable of achieving 
them, the minister said. 
  [Gomez] Right now we have provinces that have attained 
higher 
levels of self-sufficiency in the fields, especially in 
establishing plans to increase production of pork and milk. They 
also managed to find rational solutions to water supply problems 
when there is no electricity. Nevertheless, the schools have 
been kept open because in each place, everything has been done 
with intelligence and rationality. It is the third term here and 
we must now develop our teaching activities under these 
conditions. Experience has already been accrued and of course we 
are willing to develop further. We are sure that the living 
conditions of the students and the workers will be as 
comfortable as possible.

  [Text] Madrid, 7 Feb (AFP) -- A Cuban Democratic Platform 
(PDC) communique, released in Madrid, has criticized the 
"immobile, conservative, and reactionary wing" of the Cuban 
Government for excluding the organization from a dialogue 
between the Havana regime and the opposition abroad. 
  The PDC communique pointed out "one can never choose one's 
adversaries; reality determines them." This organization is 
composed of liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats. 
  This communique was issued in response to the decision by 
the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government to reject PDC participation in this dialogue 
because its members do not number even "three dozen people" and 
because, according to the committee, this group has worked for 
the CIA. 
  The PDC called these accusations "false" and "useless" and 
attributed them to sectors of the Cuban regime. The PDC "has 
enough support and popularity inside and outside Cuba to play an 
essential role (...) to bring about, without bloodshed, a 
definitive end to the crisis facing the country." the communique 
stated.

  [Text] Here is a press release signed by Bernard Sansaricq, 
president of a new office formed in the Senate of the Republic 
on 4 February: Any measures contrary to the formation of the new 
office will be considered null and void. 
  This press release signed by Bernard Sansaricq says: The 
Senate office makes it a point to inform national and 
international institutions and the general public that, 
following the Senate resolution of 4 February dissolving the 
former office headed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, and following 
the new elections that were held, Senator Jean-Louis is no 
longer empowered to represent, or to make commitments on the 
part of, the Senate. 
  This new office is headed by Bernard Sansaricq and made up 
of 
a number of legislators elected in the contested 18 January 
elections. 
  This office was formed the day after the visit to the Senate 
by U.S. Ambassador William Lacy Swing. The U.S. diplomat had 
openly brought his support to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, head of 
the office formed in August, 1993. It was thus in response to 
this step by the U.S. ambassador that the other senators decided 
to form a new office. Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] Thus, hesitation has ended. The 
contested legislators elected in the 18 January elections, 
supported by five regular senators from the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP], on 4 February made good on their 
warning. The resolution to dismiss him -- that sword of Damocles 
that had been hanging over his head -- finally fell upon Firmin 
Jean-Louis, and his position as head of the Senate was put to a 
vote by the antiestablishment senators, who opted for the split. 
  In their complaints, the senators reproached the legally 
elected president of the National Assembly for his lack of 
capability and, mostly, for his unconditional support to the 
Malval government with a view to imposing on Haitian territory 
the consequences, so hastily planned, of the embargo supported 
by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Such an attitude, deemed detrimental to the interests of 
Haiti in general, was interpreted by the contested legislators 
and the ACP senators as an act of high treason. However, it is 
basically the U.S. ambassador's visit to Senate President Firmin 
Jean-Louis that prompted the events. [Senator Thomas Eddy 
Dupiton] Considering that, to crown the infamy, Senator Firmin 
Jean-Louis, president of the Senate of the Republic, met with 
U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing on 3 February to sign with him 
a joint statement on official Senate letterhead, as if Swing 
were a Haitian senator; and considering that the Senate office 
as currently constituted is a cause of tension and exacerbation 
of the political crisis the country is in; and considering that 
it is the duty of the Senate faction that is still sane and 
responsible to shoulder, in this serious circumstance, its 
patriotic responsibilities in conformity with the duly validated 
mandate it received from the voters of the nation's nine 
geographical departments; and considering that for all those 
reasons, it is urgent that those legislators take measures to 
protect the collective interest, which is in danger: 
  Article 1: As of today the Senate office formed by 
acclamation on 10 August 1993 is and remains dismissed. [end 
recording] 
  [Jean] Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who was seen as the 
future replacement for Firmim Jean-Louis -- he had officially 
announced his candidacy -- withdrew that candidacy at the last 
moment in favor of Bernard Sansaricq. Dupiton considered that he 
had already played the role of Saint John the Baptist, having 
been the first to shout in the desert to demand the dismissal of 
the legal Senate office. 
  Dupiton wants to pass the ball to Sansaricq, whom he looks 
upon as Jesus, the messiah who will come to free the Senate and 
the country as a whole. 
  Bernard Sansaricq, then, has been unanimously elected head 
of 
the ACP [Senate] office and the contested legislators elected on 
18 January. 
  Sansaricq is assisted by Ronel Manigat, as vice president, 
one of the contested legislators elected on 18 January. Ebrane 
Cadet, the acting president who just completed his mission, has 
become first secretary. The only woman among the senators was 
elected second secretary; and Osny Eugene, another contested 
legislator elected on 18 January, is the quaestor. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The Senate Office has learned over the radio that a 
pirate Senate office has been formed. The alleged objective of 
this pirate office is to hamper the operations of the existing 
Senate institution. 
  According to a note signed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, 
steps already taken could at last lead to a denouement to the 
crisis ravaging Haiti. 
  The Senate Office invites the country's institutions and the 
entire Haitian people not to let themselves be led into any 
adventurist maneuvers, which can only plunge the country even 
further into the abyss and delay the process of setting up a new 
government, returning to constitutional and democratic order, 
lifting the embargo, and having the country move toward progress 
once and for all. 
  The Senate Office takes this opportunity to announce to the 
nation that a parliamentary delegation has gone abroad. The 
delegation will meet with representatives of the United Nations, 
the OAS, and the governments of the United States, Canada, 
France, and Venezuela to explore ways and means of getting out 
of the crisis quickly. 
  The communique adds: Furthermore, the Senate Office has 
decided, pending the decision of the assembled Senate, to 
suspend Senator Ebrane Cadet, Senate Office first secretary, who 
has destroyed his reputation vis-a-vis the population through 
his undisciplined and dangerous behavior toward the institution. 
  The Office of the Senate of the Republic firmly believes 
that 
the results of the multiple steps being taken abroad by the 
parliamentary delegation should calm apprehensions and fulfill 
everyone's expectations. 
  This note is signed: Firmin Jean-Louis, senator of the 
Republic, president.

  [Text] Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, member of the Haitian 
delegation to the United States, categorically denied the 
information reported on 7 February during the CARENA [Committee 
of Actions for National Reconciliation] conference regarding the 
possible nomination of Senator Julio Larosiliere to the post of 
prime minister. Deputy Monde called those who spread such 
information irresponsible and, according to him, do so for the 
purpose of sabotaging the parliament's current work. 
  Frantz Robert Monde also explains to Radio Metropole that at 
this phase of the negotiations and discussions, it is a question 
of finding a modus operandi for obtaining suspension of the 
sanctions: 
  [Begin recording] Personally, I denounced this irresponsible 
action from the person who stated during the CARENA conference 
that we went to Washington to choose Larosiliere. I think it is 
a low, cowardly, untimely blow, not coming from a responsible 
man. In this vein, I assure that lunatic that it is out of 
question to have Larosiliere or any other person as prime 
minister right now. We never discussed that. It comes only from 
his fertile imagination. 
  "Our first objective is a truce that will allow parliament 
to 
vote for a prime minister without the sword of Damocles, the 
embargo, hanging over our heads. They give us the truce; then we 
take a position regarding the choice of a prime minister. It is 
not during this tour... [changes thought] We came to have our 
points of view heard, to demonstrate how the Haitian people are 
suffering from the embargo. We did not come to attack this 
person or that person, but we are asking that Haitians listen to 
us, understand us, so we may soon find a solution, not the 
solution of this person or that person, or my solution. Rather 
it will be a concerted solution from all the concerned elements, 
the protagonists, the Army -- we told them [not further 
identified] we are very close to the Army, there is nothing to 
hide." 
  So far, it has been very constructive. We have had several 
meetings. First we met with the National Freedom Institute, 
which invited us. We met with Walter Fautroy. We were very 
touched by him. Walter Fautroy wept over the fate of Haiti and 
supported us on the idea of a truce, a temporary lifting of the 
embargo, a suspension of the sanctions to allow the interested 
sectors to formulate a concerted strategy. We met on 7 February 
at the State Department -- Pezzullo, Caputo, and some American 
technicians from the State Department working on the Haitian 
case. Until now, we have tried to emphasize our point of view as 
deputies. Normally, the choice of a prime minister would not be 
of interest to us right now, since he will probably meet the 
same fate as Malval, or even worse. 
  What we are interested in is not to negotiate with a knife 
at 
our throat. It is out of question for me to meet with President 
Aristide or discuss the choice of a prime minister. We are 
adamant on that. I do not know where this information comes 
from. They are people who are showing off, who wish to be 
actors, who are playing roles. I am furious when I hear that 
while we are here making every effort, many sacrifices, to 
propose a solution, those men, in their little heads, vent their 
noxious minds. Those men have extreme reactions. They wish to 
sabotage our efforts. They are not serious. I think that the 
person who made that statement can now take his group, install 
someone in the National Palace, and make the decisions on the 
lifting of the embargo. [end recording]

percent would vote for the former UN secretary general.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Today, the director of the National Statistics and 
Information Technology Institute said inflation for January was 
1.84 percent. This, he notes, indicates that inflation 
"continues to go down." The sectors that showed higher increases 
in January were rent, fuel, electricity, transportation, 
communication, and health care services while those that 
increased but not as much were food, beverages, entertainment, 
and cultural services. (Lima Global de Television Network in 
Spanish 0100 GMT 2 Feb 94) 
  On Thursday, the Peruvian Central Reserve Bank reported that 
as of 25 January, Peru's international reserves increased to 
$2.847 billion. This is $146 million more than the amount 
registered at the end of December. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1627

  [Text] The Office of Attorney General convicted over 1,000 
terrorists in cases it handled this year, Daniel Espichan Tumay 
announced yesterday. The official also appealed to authorities 
not to let down their guard facing the subversive enemy so as to 
prevent such terrorists from once again sowing unrest among the 
people. 
  Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was 
achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and 
military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists 
had cooperated with the courts. 
  While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that 
positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his 
appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest 
on their laurels. 
  "We must understand that terrorism will continue its 
onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be 
achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work 
and while paying respect to human rights," he said.

  He also reported that as a special mission entrusted to him 
by President Alberto Fujimori, he has toured the country 
explaining to civil authorities and officials in the Judicial 
Branch and Attorney General's Office that they must take special 
precautions when apprehending individuals. 
  "The Police have been technically and scientifically trained 
and will find evidence proving whether or not a person is 
responsible for a crime. Otherwise, the rights of any citizen 
could be violated," he explained. 
  He said errors have been made in some cases and that the 
proper authorities have been duly notified, but added that what 
was important was "not to make any more." 
  Espichan Tumay said he is confident that with a titular 
Supreme Court, things will improve. 
  "A great deal remains to be done. We still have many 
prisoners who have been charged and all of Peru's higher courts 
must also be instructed to follow the same procedures applied in 
Lima," he said.

  [Text] Provided with new identities and accompanied by 
their families, five reformed terrorists left the country last 
year to begin new lives and forget the sequels of terror and 
bloodshed in which they participated when they made the mistake 
of joining the ranks of the Shining Path [Sendero Luminoso-SL] 
and MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. 
  They are among the country's 1,500 reformed terrorists, 
1,300 
of whom have already been reintegrated into society and are 
working in different areas. 
  A number of them are now members of the Peasant Patrols 
working in rural areas. Others, numbering about 50, have assumed 
new identities and gone with their families to other parts of 
the country to take up different activities. 
  Concerning the reformed terrorists who left the country, a 
reliable source reports that they are "intermediate-level" 
leaders of the Shining Path and MRTA who provided important 
information leading to the capture of the main cadres of the 
terrorist organizations. 
  The government has lent them its complete support, providing 
them with traveling allowances in dollars enabling them to get 
along until they can get settled. 
  They have traveled to other South American countries (for 
reasons of security we cannot say where), where the Peruvian 
Embassies are discreetly monitoring them. 
  Six or seven other cases of reformed terrorists are now 
under 
study by the Evaluating Committee, which will determine the 
possibility of sending them abroad. 
  Daniel Espichan Tumay, special attorney general for cases of 
terrorism, was summoned by EL COMERCIO yesterday, but refrained 
from providing details on the matter for reasons of security. 
  Nevertheless, he did explain that the change in identity and 
residence, whether inside or outside of the country, is an 
additional benefit extended to the reformed individuals in 
accordance with the law. 
  He noted that as a member of the Evaluating Committee, he 
observed that here in Peru, the entire procedure is fraught with 
delays and that dishonest legal officials are even turning a 
profit. 
  He said that five members of the single board of the High 
Court of Chiclayo had been removed from their posts when it was 
proven that they were charging a reformed terrorist for handling 
his case, which they had deliberately chosen.

  [Text] Indian leaders announced that on 8 and 9 February, 
Ecuadoran Indians will stage peaceful demonstrations on the 
streets to protest the government decreed fuel increase. 
  Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador, said the people are currently asking 
the government to reconsider the law, which also interests the 
Indians. That is why we are going to stage a preventive 
demonstration. Macas pointed out that the Indians will stop 
their activities, set up blockades, and march during the day to 
express their dissatisfaction with the 71-percent fuel increase, 
which has been in effect for more than a week. 
  Macas added that if the government does not heed the 
Ecuadoran people's protests, they will obviously have to 
consider stronger measures.

<F P=106> [Report by Santiago Piedra] </F>
  [Text] Quito, 8 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuadoran Indians today 
occupied roads and blocked traffic while students continued to 
stage major disturbances in Quito to protest a recent 
71.2-percent increase in gasoline prices -- a price increase the 
government has applied to compensate for a budget deficit. 
  With the support of student groups and of the powerful 
United 
Workers Front (FUT), the Confederation of Indian Nationalities 
of Ecuador (Conaie), which comprises the majority of the 
nation's Indian groups, initiated a 48-hour peaceful uprising to 
protest the "unpopular" economic measures adopted by the 
administration of right-wing President Sixto Duran-Ballen. On 
28 January, the president ordered a gasoline price increase that 
hiked the price on a gallon of regular gasoline from 1,460 
sucres to 2,500 sucres (from $0.71 to $1.22). 
  Government spokesmen have explained that the price 
adjustment 
will generate revenue to compensate for a $260 million budget 
deficit prompted by a surprising drop in Ecuadoran oil prices on 
the international market, where Ecuadoran oil traded at less 
than $11 a barrel in December and January. The increased fuel 
prices led to strong protests in Ecuador, where a tense calm has 
been reigning for the past two weeks because of street 
demonstrations carried out by students who have stoned vehicles 
and government buildings, as well as burned tires in the streets. 
  The disturbances have become violent in the port city of 
Guayaquil, southwest of Quito. In Cuenca, in the Andean 
province of Azuay, attempts were made to torch the governor's 
office with "Molotov" cocktails. 
  While the workers showed their opposition to the gasoline 
price increase by calling for a general strike last Thursday, 
the Indians joined the protest today with a peaceful uprising, 
which is blocking the country's overland traffic. According to 
initial reports received in Quito, the Indians -- who comprise 
about 3.5 million of Ecuador's population of 11 million people 
-- blocked the Panamerican Highway in several areas north of the 
capital. These demonstrations have practically paralyzed all 
traffic, which could adversely affect trade with neighboring 
Colombia. 
  Numerous communities in the provinces of Cotopaxi, 
Tungurahua, Chimborazo, Canar, and Azuay, south of the Ecuadoran 
capital, also witnessed the blocking of roads with barricades, 
some of which were removed by police and Armed Forces personnel 
deployed to preserve public order. 
  Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the Indian uprising 
is attempting to destabilize the economy by preventing normal 
business activities. He added this is why the public forces 
will work to guarantee the free flow of vehicles. Santos also 
talked about the need to hold a national dialogue in which, he 
said, "we should attend with tabulae rasae, without conditions" 
in the search for solutions to Ecuador's problems. 
  Defense Minister Jose Gallardo, meanwhile, said he was 
concerned because the Indian protest is paralyzing exports of 
Ecuadoran flowers, which have increased in the past few days 
because of Valentine's Day in the United States. According to 
Gallardo, the Army and the police will do everything possible to 
clear the roads, and he said exact instructions have been given 
to avoid possible confrontations. 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen yesterday spoke about the 
possibility of ordering a state of emergency to prevent public 
disturbances. "We are not going to allow the country to be 
paralyzed," he said in a meeting with journalists. 
  The Indians staged a two-month-long uprising in 1990 against 
Rodrigo Borja's social democratic administration (1988-92). At 
that time, the Indians demands included autonomy for territories 
in the Amazon region, the site of rich oil fields. Borja 
rejected the demand, saying the Indians were trying to create a 
state within the Ecuadoran state itself.

  [Excerpts] Ecuadoran Indian communities have begun a 
peaceful 48-hour mobilization with marches and blockades on the 
country's main roads to reject the economic measures established 
by the conservative government. 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen, who is facing the second 
paralyzation of activities in less than six days, said that 
strikes lead to nothing but loss for the country. 
  In addition, high school and university students have 
resumed 
clashes with Quito police, and the government has responded by 
stating that it has not ruled out the possibility of 
implementing emergency measures to protect public and private 
property. 
  The Indian communities joined the workers' and students' 
general protest that began last week as a means of pressuring 
the government into revoking a fuel price increase of up to 71 
percent. 
  National government spokesmen reiterated that the adjustment 
measures will not be revised and called for a tripartite 
dialogue among businessmen, workers, and the government to reach 
agreements that will not result in losses for the country. 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen told reporters that a consensus 
must be sought and that the parties involved must come to the 
dialogue with open minds and a willingness to accept valid 
arguments from others and to admit that they are wrong. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of 
Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, held a news conference and 
proclaimed the strike a success as all provinces are 
participating. 
  Radio and television reports stated that the Indian stoppage 
has been carried out in a peaceful manner and that activities 
are normal in the central and western regions of the country. 
The Indians' stoppage will end tomorrow with a march during 
which participants will bang on empty pots and pans. 
  A few minutes ago we were able to verify that the Ibarra 
road 
is closed; there is no traffic. Cuenca is also completely 
isolated. The Army is now controlling the interprovincial 
highways, and there is no violence.

  [Excerpt] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has reiterated that 
despite protests by government officials, the economic measures 
will not be changed. Duran-Ballen said he will not change his 
mind about the measures. He said that if the Court of 
Constitutional Guarantees determines the measures are 
unconstitutional, the government will appeal the decision to the 
Supreme Court of Justice, which will have the final word. The 
Court of Constitutional Guarantees will submit a final report on 
the demands presented by three political parties regarding the 
unconstitutionality of the economic measures adopted by the 
government. 
  When questioned about the protests, Duran-Ballen stated the 
government will not allow tantrums, and he said emergency 
measures will be taken if deemed necessary. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Viodelda Barrias] </F>
  [Text] Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez Ramirez, general 
coordinator of the government's Technical Negotiating Unit, 
which is responsible for Panama's incorporation into GATT, has 
said that with the exception of Nicaragua, Panama has the 
highest tariffs in Latin America with an average of 40 percent. 
  The Panamanian negotiator presented an analysis to the 
members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Panama on 
the "Negotiation of Panama's Incorporation into GATT" which 
concludes that the Panamanian service sector receives too much 
protection. 
  The expert emphasized that the service sector receives too 
much protection [sentence as published]. He explained that 
according to the analysis, the service sector is protected in 
two ways: the prohibition of retail sales and the protection of 
various professions, which means that a large portion of trade 
and services are protected from foreign competition. 
  Gonzalez Ramirez added that state monopolies of services 
such 
as electricity, ports, water, and communications are also 
protected. 
  The official said that Panama's incorporation into GATT will 
provide great benefits, but entry requires that the country 
grant some concessions such as the gradual elimination of export 
tariffs [aranceles a la exportacion]. 
  Gonzalez Ramirez explained the main benefits of GATT 
membership: For the first time Panama will have a foreign trade 
strategy; exports will be based on the security of law; and 
market opening negotiations for our products will be held, 
especially for services. He also indicated that the fiscal 
exemptions granted on the basis of laws that promote industry 
and agriculture represent unearned income for the treasury 
estimated at 150 million balboas. 
  Since 1947 Panama has participated as an observer in the 
GATT 
negotiation rounds, but according to Gonzalez Ramirez, there was 
no real interest in joining the organization because "we are not 
an exporting country." Panama currently meets all requirements 
set forth by that organization for membership. 
  Regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations, Gonzalez Ramirez 
stated that tariffs on industrial goods in industrialized 
countries will fall by more than one-third, and more than 40 
percent of imports will have free rates [tasas libres]. 
Meanwhile, trade distortions due to subsidies and import 
barriers must be reduced in six years. Domestic subsidies for 
agriculture will be reduced by 20 percent. Subsidized exports 
will be cut by 36 percent in value and volume. All import 
barriers will be converted into tariffs and must be reduced by 
some 36 percent. 
  In the meantime, the United States has asked Panama to join 
the Multilateral Trade Agreement and pass the bill on 
intellectual property rights, which are key requirements for a 
free trade agreement between the countries.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Ricardo Duran, Panama Chamber of Commerce president, has 
rejected a survey published by THE ECONOMIST last week which 
included Panama among countries in which foreign investors are 
afraid to invest. Duran said he does not know what the 
publication is based on because Panama's annual economic growth 
rate of approximately 9 percent shows investors have confidence 
in the country. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 4 Feb 
94 p 9A) 
  Commerce and Industries Minister Ricardo Fabrega has 
reported 
that the Foreign Ministry sent a note to Mexico and Venezuela 
calling for a meeting to be held as soon as possible to discuss 
a proposal for paying the petroleum debt to those countries. He 
said interest on the petroleum debt has raised the debt to 
approximately $220 million. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 2A) 
  The Cabinet Council has authorized the signing of agreements 
with various foreign banks and financial organizations to 
eliminate the risk of some public enterprises or autonomous 
institutions becoming delinquent in the payment of their 
obligations or credit lines, which could lead to legal 
proceedings against the country and the elimination of credit 
lines. A cabinet decree indicated that the measure is part of 
the policy to normalize the state's credit situation with its 
international creditors. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 6 Feb 
94 p 4A)

  [Text] Yesterday, Noel Rivas, Nicaraguan ambassador to 
Honduras, said he did not have "concrete information" about the 
U.S. State Department's human rights report indicating members 
of the Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary movement are guilty of 
human rights violations in Honduras. 
  The Nicaraguan diplomat said his country is willing to 
cooperate with Honduras in investigating to what extent the 
statements in the U.S. report are true. He said: "There is 
cooperation between the governments and a common goal, 
therefore, this will be resolved between the two governments." 
  He also said the Honduran Government could make inquiries in 
Nicaragua to clear up the contras' participation in human rights 
violations but "those inquiries must be conducted by mail, with 
help on a judicial and diplomatic level." 
  Explaining the Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna [not further 
identified] murder case, Rivas said the Nicaraguan Government 
"does not expect anything more;" however, a sentence must be 
handed down since right now "a trial is under way." Rivas said: 
"This has to end with a sentence; it must be clear who is 
guilty."

  [Text] Monday, the Nicaraguan Government condemned the 
indiscriminate bombing of Sarajevo civilians and at the same 
time reiterated it categorically rejects the use of violence to 
settle differences in that strife-torn nation. In an official 
statement, the government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro called 
on the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to talk so peace can 
return to that strife-torn region. Last Saturday, a 120-mm 
mortar shell killed 58 people and wounded another 142 at a 
Sarajevo market.

  [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 25 
January 1994 on page 4 reports that the Ministry of Economy and 
Development (Mede) has opened a deregulation office to reduce 
red tape based on input from businessmen to facilitate the 
distribution of goods. For example, representatives of the 
Cristal biscuit factory complained that the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Livestock required an export certificate which 
was not required by the country to which their products are 
exported, while fishing industry representatives are seeking to 
abolish permits required for exports to the United States, which 
does not require a similar document, according to the article. 
Mede Vice Minister Enrique Brenes explains that, in addition to 
eliminating trade barriers, the office is sponsoring training 
seminars for entrepreneurs.

De Leon Carpio and his administration's policies. As the 
institution charged with protecting national security and 
sovereignty, we are determined to help consolidate the 
democratic process and guarantee the preservation of 
institutional order, the minister said. In Guatemala, the 
government and the Army are working to dispel the crisis that 
other sectors have provoked. The Army is also committed to 
preserving democracy. It is our duty to support every effort 
toward that end, he said. 
  The Army cannot comment on the results of the popular 
consultation because we are outside political activities, but 
our support for democracy and President De Leon is firm, the 
defense minister added. All sectors, not just the government, 
are responsible for confronting and ending the institutional 
crisis. Nevertheless, the government and the Army have 
mistakenly been blamed for everything wrong in the country, and 
that is unrealistic. 
  The government has again and again been blamed for human 
rights violations, but the fact that the rebels have also 
violated these elementary rights has been overlooked. It is 
very easy to make accusations, particularly as we approach the 
Geneva Summit, which will discuss the human rights situation. 
Some sectors try to aggravate the crisis and have blamed the 
Guatemalan Government. 
  Instead of marring the country's image, those sectors should 
strive for a solution to Guatemala's crisis. The Army is 
determined to support the democratic system, hence our support 
for President De Leon remains firm, Enriquez conclude.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Guatemala and Germany have signed a cooperation agreement 
through which Germany grants Guatemala 28 million German marks. 
After a one-year suspension of German financial cooperation due 
to the political and human rights problems during the Jorge 
Serrano government, the two countries negotiated the new aid, 
which will be used for financial and technical cooperation, 
especially basic education in rural areas. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p 64) 
  Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielmann has announced 
that 
with the objective of regulating the austerity policy in public 
expenditures, the Council of Ministers on 1 February signed an 
agreement that, among other things, prohibits the transfer of 
funds from one appropriation to another and eliminates 
superfluous expenditures such as vehicles assigned to certain 
officials and entertainment allowances. She said transfers will 
only be permitted to deal with emergency situations or cases of 
national interest. She said from 25 million to 30 million 
quetzales a year are expected to be saved with the measure, and 
these funds will be used in the social sectors, mainly for 
preventive health and education. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in 
Spanish 2 Feb 94 p 62) 
  The National Statistics Institute has reported the inflation 
rate in Guatemala reached 2.14 percent in January due to 
increases in the education sector. It said school registration 
fees and tuitions increased more than 45 percent in public and 
private schools. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2225 GMT 4 Feb

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Mexican Foreign Relations Secretariat today 
rejected the new U.S. Government policy of stopping illegal 
immigration at its southern border. 
  The Mexican Government warns police-type measures are not 
appropriate to deal with a socioeconomic phenomenon such as the 
flow of immigration. Mexico expresses regret that these types 
of actions are being taken, because they deteriorate relations 
between the border areas and create a negative atmosphere 
between Mexico and the United States. 
  We are concerned by the fact these types of measures are 
being taken as trade is reaching unprecedented levels and tends 
to rapidly increase following the implementation of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico cannot accept the 
argument that Mexican migrant workers are to blame for the 
creation of economic and social problems, which are not their 
fault, especially because these type of remarks are made to 
satisfy certain short-term electoral objectives. 
  The Mexican Foreign Relations secretariat will be alert to 
any abuse or discriminations that may emerge once these U.S. 
Government measures are adopted against Mexican illegal aliens, 
the communique states.

transmits a service message killing this item] 
  [Text] Paris, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Jupp has told NOTIMEX France wants to develop a privileged 
relationship with Mexico thereby becoming a bridge between this 
nation and the European Union [EU]. 
  The French official also said he was "convinced that once 
Mexico concludes the process of joining" the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), "it will become an 
active member." 
  Shortly before beginning a three-day official visit to 
Mexico, Jupp affirmed that France "is happy" the OCDE decided, 
in June, "to take into consideration Mexico's candidacy given 
Mexico's significant economic progress in past years." 
  The European minister denied the crisis in the southern 
Chiapas state would hinder Mexico's integration into the OCDE. 
Jupp said: "Mexico will know how to resolve the State of 
Chiapas conflict through dialogue; this is not an obstacle to it 
becoming an OCDE member." 
  Alain Jupp denied the Chiapas conflict could adversely 
affect 
investments in Mexico while he expressed assurance that France 
wants these to increase thereby contributing to the nation's 
development. "It is through development that events like those 
that occurred are avoided," he noted. 
  Jupp said his visit, "30 years after General Charles De 
Gaulle's historic visit," is an expression of "the continuation 
of France's policy toward Mexico, and our willingness to develop 
a privileged relationship" with that Latin American nation. "One 
of the main reasons for my trip is to stress France's wish to 
become the bridge between the EU and Mexico," he assured. 
  Jupp indicated that NAFTA will favor international trade and 
will contribute to Mexico's modernization, nevertheless, he 
warned against the increase of discriminatory measures against 
third nations. 
  "France is pleased with the benefits NAFTA may contribute to 
Mexico and with everything else that could stimulate the 
economy's vitality. This strengthens the possibilities between 
both nations as long as the agreement does not adopt 
discriminatory measures against third nations," he noted. 
  Jupp denied that the trilateral agreement, which was 
implemented on 1 January, is "a trade block; rather, it is a 
free trade zone" and "its creation should contribute to the 
development of international trade," he added. 
  "French companies are aware of all the benefits they can 
obtain from an agreement that will continue fostering Mexico's 
modernization in all sectors, including that of environmental 
protection," the foreign minister remarked. 
  "I am certain Mexico will gladly accept France's 
technological capabilities in favor of the ongoing 
liberalization, to which the trade agreement should contribute," 
Jupp indicated. 
  "Mexico's economic vitality, together with its rich cultural 
tradition, justify Mexico to be France's privileged associate in 
Latin America, and we intend to continue developing this 
relationship," assured the high-ranking French official. 
  "We seek to give a new thrust to the relationship between 
both nations through the development of economic ties. The 
reforms adopted by President Salinas de Gortari have allowed 
France's presence to be stepped up in Mexico," Jupp assured. 
  For France, Mexico is "an important political and economic 
associate," the head of French diplomacy indicated. 
  Regarding the possibility of Mexico becoming a UN Security 
Council member, Jupp said that "in France's opinion, the 
evolution of the international situation makes it necessary to 
enlarge the UN Security Council." 
  Other nations besides France and Mexico have expressed 
interest in enlarging the UN Security council. To analyze this 
possibility, a work group at the UN General Assembly was 
appointed, the foreign minister indicated. "We believe that the 
aspirations of the nations willing to assume greater 
responsibilities in the international field should be taken into 
account," the foreign minister noted. "It is necessary to guard 
the Security Council's efficiency and assure the developing 
nations a just representation in this essential body of the UN 
system," Jupp commented. 
  The foreign minister also said his government will initiated 
new policies of rapprochement with Latin America in an effort to 
support social and political development in the region's 
nations. "Latin America has reaffirmed political pluralism and 
its economic vitality has turned it into a region of constant 
development, leaving behind the crisis of the 80's," he assured. 
  Alain Jupp added that "France wants a new type of 
relationship in association with Latin America, adopted to the 
new realities." The governments that respect the state of law 
will be favored "in the strategies taken into consideration to 
strengthen the Franco-Latin American ties." Likewise, he added 
those nations that "combat terrorism and drug trafficking to 
assure their institutions' stability," will be given priority. 
  The French Government will promote "the establishment of 
French companies in Latin America" while scientific and 
technical cooperation will be jointly implemented so the 
economic projects benefit the region and France. 
  Jupp indicated that "France must adapt its cooperation to 
the different nations on the continent and maintain its aid to 
the less developed regions while modernizing its cooperation 
with others." 
  France represents 20 percent of the EU's cooperation in 
Latin 
America. "It is the French Government's duty to motivate its 
associates in this cooperation and to spell out new, concrete, 
and lasting actions," he indicated. 
  The French foreign minister encouraged the Cuban Government 
to democratize. He commented that the economic reforms "are 
interesting but will not serve to replace the political liberty 
the Cuban people expect."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] has issued a communique on its 
sales abroad from January to November of 1993. It noted that it 
sold an average of 261,000 barrels a day of light Isthmian 
crude, worth $1.444 million and an average of 862,500 barrels a 
day of heavy Maya crude worth $3.353 million. In addition, it 
sold an average of 214,600 barrels a day of extra light Olmeca 
crude at $1.248 million. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2314 GMT 4 Feb 
94) 
  A report by the Economic Studies Center for the Private 
Sector, based on a survey taken in the country's five largest 
cities, revealed that 42.7 percent of companies cut the size of 
their personnel in 1993. It added that 40.5 percent maintained 
their labor force and 16.8 percent increased it. (Paris AFP in

<F P=106> [Article by Brasilia Bureau executive director Josias de </F>
Souza, bureau director Gilberto Dimenstein, reporter Emanuel 
Neri, and bureau staff; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] The Workers Party [PT] preliminary proposal for a 
government program claims to be "socialist." This document 
obtained by FOLHA DE SAO PAULO advocates an audit of all 
Brazilian foreign debt contracts, leaves open the possibility of 
declaring a moratorium, and states that under Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva's "popular and democratic" administration the 
privatization program will be discontinued. Furthermore, some 
sales of state-owned companies will be revised. 
  This document was sent to PT executive board members. It is 
being used as the basis for discussing the party's government 
program. The proposal's contents displeased the less radical 
wing of the party, which will try to make changes. PT 
government program coordinator Marco Aurelio Garcia stated that 
the PT Executive Commission will meet next week to discuss the 
program's economic aspects. Garcia said the final draft has not 
been prepared yet. 
  The text the PT is using as the basis for its internal 
debate 
has clearly radical overtones, not in keeping with the image 
Lula is trying to sell: a moderate candidate open to 
compromise. Should Lula win the presidential race, the document 
forecasts a term in office fraught with conflicts. 
  It states: "The process of social, political, economic, and 
cultural changes that socialism implies will be carried out 
through a permanent battle between our plan and the currently 
prevailing capitalism." 
  The program's most controversial part is the economic 
chapter. Beside hardening Brazil's position with foreign 
creditors, it suggests greater control of foreign capital, which 
currently "is totally concentrated on short-term speculative 
applications." 
  As for the privatization program, the document asserts that 
during Lula's mandate only the public companies that can 
definitely no longer be expanded or modernized will be sold, and 
even when sold they will be put on sale for cash. The so-called 
rotten currency [securities for which the government does not 
pay what it promised] will no longer be accepted. 
  The document does not deal with an essential subject: 
curbing inflation. It argues that the strategy to reduce 
inflation may only be definitely prepared after the government 
structure and situation is learned once Lula takes power. 
  Regarding the foreign debt renegotiation, the document 
states 
that the PT government will not yield to IMF pressures. 
  The PT defends the restriction of exports, thus putting an 
end to the era of mega-surpluses in the trade balance. As an 
alternative it advocates the growth of the internal market with 
the creation of what the document calls a "market of masses." 
The document vehemently attacks neoliberal economics and defends 
economic growth with a better distribution of income. The 
document does not specify how the PT plans to accomplish these 
goals. 
  Another controversial proposal included in the preliminary 
PT 
program is the creation of a council, made up of representatives 
from society, to control Central Bank actions, especially the 
management of the exchange and monetary policies. 
<H5>  Document Criticizes Neoliberal Policy </H5>
  The preliminary version of the PT program includes a 
commentary that could further complicate the policy of alliances 
defended by the party's moderate wing: "[Former President] 
Collor was defeated, overthrown by a popular mobilization. 
However, the neoliberal plan continue to be implemented to a 
great extent by the current administration." 
  The objective is to stress an anti-Collor characteristic in 
the program. However, the criticism also hit President Itamar 
Franco and Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]), an ally desired by Lula. 
  With a view toward increasing the purchasing power of 
workers, the program establishes the "gradual and steady" 
increase of the minimum salary as a priority, "with the 
objective of doubling its current value." The text says this 
will happen within "the shortest possible time." 
  The document states: "This increase must be progressive and 
should be clearly announced so that economic agents are able to 
properly implement the transition to the new salary structure." 
  In order to guarantee the real value of salaries, the 
document proposes for implementation of a Collective Bargaining 
Contract "at a national, sectorial, and entrepreneurial level. 
According to the program, the objective is not merely to 
increase salaries, but to "democratically negotiate" new labor 
relations, preserving workers' interest in the making of 
economic policy decisions. The program also proposes the 
unification of databases. Another priority will be to expand 
"control measures" on manpower rotation and the "abuse" of 
overtime. 
  If he is elected president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will 
create the Defense Ministry, implement voluntary military 
service (which is now compulsory), and make significant 
investments in the Armed Forces. Lula's program for the military 
states: "The current status of military equipment, which has 
become junk, and the situation of soldiers, noncommissioned 
officers, and officers cannot be allowed to remain unchanged." 
  The PT does not make a quantitative estimate of military 
investment. Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, whom Lula entrusted with 
the design of the Armed Forces program, proposed that the 
military budget grow from the current 0.5 percent to 2 percent 
of the GDP over the five-year government term -- which amounts 
to an investment of almost $8 billion annually. 
  Cavagnari's proposal awakened controversy inside and outside 
the party. In the program that will be proposed for final 
approval, the PT does not specify how much it will spend on the 
military. But the party promises to make major investments. 
Through the end of the decade the PT will channel funds for 
restructuring the Armed Forces, for equipment, and for personnel 
"upgrading." 
<H5>  Calha Norte </H5>
  The PT attaches special emphasis to military programs. It 
promises to continue the AMX subsonic fighter project and the 
space and Antarctic programs. The nuclear program also will be 
given special importance, but it will be tied to no research for 
nuclear weapons. The Calha Norte project will be revised to make 
it compatible with the policy of respect for indigenous people. 
<H5>  Missiles </H5>
  Lula's military program has many details. In the case of 
restocking the Armed Forces, it includes "tactical and strategic 
(medium-range) missiles, armored vehicles, artillery, electronic 
warfare equipment, and the nuclear submarine" as mechanisms for 
defending national sovereignty. It also proposes the creation of 
a rapid response force with the participation of the Army, Air 
Force, and Navy. 
  The PT proposal states that the judicial branch is 
inefficient, and advocates external control of this branch. One 
of the causes, according to the PT, is "the fact that a vast 
majority of judges disregard the law's social function." 
  The document states: "Infrastructure deficiencies and the 
insufficient rendering of auxiliary services have aggravated the 
situation, hindering the democratic administration of justice in 
Brazil." 
  According to the document, control over the judicial branch 
should not interfere with this branch of government's 
activities. Emphasis will be placed on the implementation of 
managerial and budgetary policies and "the disciplining action 
of its members." 
  The party advocates investment in the training of judges, 
the 
creation and implementation of judicial bodies, the filling of 
advisory and supervisory positions through public processes that 
respect salary equity, and the decentralization of justice 
through the creation of new lower courts and courts dealing with 
minor cases. 
  The PT program brings back to the political stage 
expressions 
of the ideological confrontations of the 1950's and 1960's. In 
defining itself as "socialist," the document states, for 
example: "The 13-year old economic crisis cannot be resolved 
through a bourgeois development project." This expression is 
reminiscent of the debates fueled by the old Brazilian Communist 
Party and other leftist groups. 
  In a paragraph that remembers the good old times of the 
class 
struggle, the document foresees the rise of a "hegemony" system 
led by workers and their allies as a result of the "bourgeois 
elites'" decline. The terminology reveals the theoretical 
influence of Italian Communist leader Antonio Gramsci, who was 
quite fashionable in the 1970's. His ideas served as the 
foundation for the European Communist Movement. 
  The preliminary PT proposal advocates the return of the 
so-called "Third-World" policy to Brazilian diplomacy, which was 
started by the military governments. The document advocates 
"special emphasis" on relations with China, India, Russia, and 
South Africa. Another priority in the document states: "Latin 
America will be the privileged area of Brazilian foreign policy." 
  The document criticizes the U.S. "interventionist position" 
and foresees a new polarization: It will no longer be an 
East-West (cold war) but the North-South (rich and poor) 
conflict. The document adds that the PT government will 
advocate, at all international forums, the end of the economic 
embargo on Cuba. 
  The document states that rich countries today exercise their 
predomination, adding that this influence is reflected within 
the United Nations, "especially within the Security Council and 
in organizations like the IMF and the World Bank." 
  Within this context, the PT government will not limit itself 
to engaging in new discussions on the Brazilian foreign debt, 
but might try to help "peripheral countries" renegotiate their 
debts. A world conference will be proposed -- like 1992's world 
environment conference -- for redesigning development at the 
world level and searching for ways to reduce unemployment. 
  The central point of the preliminary PT proposal for land 
reform is the redistribution of land for 1 million families in 
five years. The document states: "Expropriation on the basis of 
social interest for land reform purposes will be the main 
instrument for land distribution." 
  Each family will have a 30-hectare unit, which will 
consequently add up to 30 million hectares. This is 
approximately 3.5 times as big as Portuguese territory. This 
goal will be attained on the basis of the essential premise of 
"authority and political will." 
  The document makes no reference to settlement costs. 
According to Planning Ministry figures, taking into account the 
need for financing production, each settled family might cost 
the government $10,000. The total cost, therefore, will be $10 
billion over a five- year period. 
  The PT has chosen latifundia as one of its targets: "We 
propose the end of fiscal leniency with latifundia through the 
adoption of taxes based on the real value of unexploited land, 
using rapidly increasing, real-term, taxable percentages for 
abandoned land and decreasing taxable percentages for cultivated 
land." 
  The PT plans interventions in the state and private 
communications system. The program states that the government 
will adopt "measures that can guarantee the democratization of 
information at all levels." The program advocates the 
"classification of crimes linked to manipulation and disregard 
for the right to have access to information and communications." 
From a practical point of view, the program promises to 
implement interdiction in private groups that simultaneously 
control television channels, radio stations, newspapers, and 
magazines, and promises to put an end to tax exemptions for 
communications enterprises. 
<H5>  Main Points of the PT Program </H5>
<H5>  Economy </H5>

  -  End of the Denationalization Program and revision of some 
of the privatizations that already have been made. 
  -  The 
privatization of state-run companies will be authorized in 
return for cash, only if "companies have no possibilities of 
expansion." 
  -  All foreign debt contracts will be renegotiated, 
rejecting "impositions" by the IMF and World Bank. 
  -  The PT 
government reserves for itself "the right to adopt unilateral 
measures, including suspension of payment," that is, a 
moratorium. 
  -  Foreign debt contracts will be subject to 
auditing. 
  -  Definition of the "instruments of an anti-inflationary 
policy" will be postponed until the current situation and the 
inherited problems are clarified. 
  -  The policy of commercial 
mega-surpluses will be terminated, and the internal market will 
receive incentives through the formation of a "market of 
masses." 
  -  Development will be reactivated on the basis of a pact, 
with improved distribution of income. 
  -  A monetary council will be 
created, with representatives of society, to supervise Central 
Bank actions. 
  -  The financial system will be reformed to 
"dismantle the mechanism" of speculation. 
  -  The domestic debt will 
be converted into bonds, eliminating the pact for automatic 
repurchasing of public bonds. 
  -  Improvement of financial health 
and capitalization of federal and state banks. 
  -  Channeling of 
foreign capital toward "productive investment." 
  -  Credits for the 
rural sector will be tied to the variation of farm product 
prices. 
  -  State monopolies in the areas of telecommunications, 
energy, and petroleum will be maintained. 
  -  The number of taxes 
will be reduced and a progressive income tax will be enforced 
(the rich will pay more than the poor). 
  -  Taxes on unproductive 
land, either urban or rural, will be increased. 
  -  Fiscal 
incentives and subsidies will be restricted. 
  -  Proposals for 
privatization of the social security system will be rejected, 
"especially if they follow the Chilean model. 
  -  The Housing

  [Text] By 388 votes, Congress this evening approved the 
general text of the emergency social fund bill. Alexandre 
Garcia now reports live from the Congress plenary session. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] Despite a protest by the minority, 
the majority of lawmakers approved a request for an overall vote 
on all the individual topics on which separate voting had been 
requested. This means that a majority vote will defeat the 
requests for separate voting on individual topics, in order to 
let the original text of the bill -- which has already been 
approved -- remain unchanged. 
  Today's congressional agenda also includes a vote on the 
reduction of the presidential term from five to four years. [end

  We remind you that a second voting is due on the emergency 
social fund before it is published by the official gazette.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- The ministers of foreign affairs, 
Celso Amorim; finance, Fernando Henrique Cardoso; industry, 
commerce, and tourism, Elcio Alvares; and science and 
technology, Israel Vargas, will meet in the next 72 hours to 
discuss alternatives to avoid U.S. trade retaliation by the end 
of the month in the dispute between the two countries over the 
Brazilian system of protection of intellectual property rights. 
  The meeting has become important after the failure of the 
fifth round of negotiations between the two countries, which 
ended at dawn on 5 February in Washington. It will be the last 
chance to prevent a new clash with the United States on a 
subject that has been affecting relations between the two 
countries for a decade and that made the Americans impose trade 
sanctions against Brazil in 1988. Like the first time, the 
latest action was spurred by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, 
which claims it is losing millions of dollars from the illegal 
copying of their formulas by Brazilian laboratories. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de 
Lima, who returned to Brazil last week to attend the marriage of 
his son Joao Pedro, will arrive in Brasilia today to hold 
separate meetings with the ministers involved in the subject and 
he also will attend the meeting they will all hold together, 
scheduled in principle for 9 February. Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim will personally tell Washington the final Brazilian 
answer after Carnival. 
  The road to a negotiated solution is narrow but not closed, 
according to U.S. sources familiar with the negotiations. There 
are nearly two dozen points on which the two parties maintain 
different positions. Four of them are considered critical for 
Washington. Of these, "two must be resolved if the Brazilian 
Government wants to avoid retaliation," a source said. 
  Two of the points refer to the clauses about "local 
exploitation" of patents and "parallel importation" of patented 
products described in Articles 27 and 28, respectively, of the 
text on protection of intellectual property (Tripps) [preceding 
word in English; expansion unknown] approved by the Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks, which Brazil signed last December in Geneva. 
  The Americans allege that the draft bill of the new 
Industrial Property Code, which already has been approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies and has been standing idle for months in the 
Senate, contradicts Tripps [preceding word in English] on those 
two points. The Brazilian draft bill requires that the patent be 
exploited in Brazil in order to be valid in the country. Beside 
that, it authorizes the importation of products patented by 
third parties and that manufacture them under license of the 
patent's owner. 
  Washington estimated that once the Uruguay Round concluded, 
the Brazilian executive branch would immediately act to adapt 
Brazilian law to the international treaty it signed in the 
Uruguay Round. "Brazil never failed to observe through its laws 
the obligations it assumed in international treaties," states an 
American source. 
  But Itamaraty, which commands the negotiations, argued that 
Articles 27 and 28 of Tripps [preceding word in English] "are 
ambiguous" and has decided there is no incompatibility between 
the articles and the draft bill in Congress. There clearly is 
concern over the industrial policy in President Franco's 
position, which is shared by the Ministries of Science and 
Technology and Industry and Commerce but not by the Finance 
Ministry. "The demand to locally exploit patents is important to 
create jobs in the country," a diplomat who participates in the 
negotiations told O ESTADO. 
  "Brazil is totally isolated in its interpretation of 
Tripps," 
American sources say. "If the Brazilian Government does not 
comply with what it signed in the GATT, there will be sanctions."

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from interview with Cesar de Queiroz Benjamin, </F>
chief author of Workers Party's economic program, by Carlos 
Eduardo Alves; place and date not given: "PT Wants To Quadruple 
Military Spending" -- first two paragraphs are FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO introduction] 
  [Text] The government program that Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva of the PT [Workers Party] will advocate in the 1994 
presidential campaign has some surprises. For example, the party 
wants to quadruple military spending: from 0.5 percent to 2.0 
percent of GDP [gross domestic product]. One of the objectives 
is to "guarantee greater strategic autonomy in the country's 
international policy," says editor Cesar de Queiroz Benjamin, 
one of the coordinators of the team drafting the PT's platform. 
The PT is thinking of reviving or revitalizing programs such as 
those concerned with the development of nuclear technology, the 
AMX aircraft, the Antarctic, the All-Brazilian Space Mission, 
the Calha Norte Project, and the electronic warfare center. 
  Benjamin, who is the chief author of the program's economic 
section, says that a moratorium on the foreign debt--until now 
one of the PT's dogmas--cannot be made into a "fetish." Although 
he did not complete his education in economics, he considers 
himself to be "self-taught." "Cesinha," as he is called by his 
friends, has been a leftist militant for 14 years. He was a 
political prisoner between the ages of 17 and 23 years and was 
exiled. Here in Brazil he has worked chiefly as an editor of 
scientific publications. He currently divides his time between 
the PT and the Nova Fronteira Publishing House in Rio de 
Janeiro. On the team responsible for Lula's government program, 
Benjamin represents the PT's orthodox wing. Here are the main 
passages from Benjamin's interview with FOLHA DE SAO PAULO. 
  [Alves] What can the country expect from Lula's program and 
a 
possible PT administration? 
  [Benjamin] Brazil is not experiencing just any crisis. A 
long 
period in national life that began in the 1930's and lasted 
until the 1980's has exhausted itself. It was dominated by three 
structural characteristics: accelerated industrialization to 
replace imports, urbanization, and the establishment of a 
nationally integrated economic system. Those characteristics 
dominated national life for 50 years, and they have lost their 
ability to instill dynamism into society. The crisis is situated 
outside that long period and at the junction between two major 
periods. What people can expect from a Lula administration is 
that it will initiate another long period in Brazil and disclose 
the structural characteristics that will dominate a lengthy new 
development process. It is only with those characteristics that 
we will be able to stabilize the national economy. 
  [Alves] What would be the fundamental changes in the 
economy? 
  [Benjamin] The first is the fact that with the process of 
industrialization to replace imports having been exhausted, we 
must discover a new principle of economic dynamics that will 
keep a long-term frontier of accumulation open in the Brazilian 
economy. And that new principle is the establishment of a 
domestic mass market. That characteristic will have to reach the 
point of dominating Brazilian economic dynamics, not as a 
short-term characteristic linked only to distribution policies 
but as a reorganization of the productive sector for the purpose 
of exploiting Brazil's domestic potential. 
  [Alves] Who would gain and who would lose from such a 
development? 
  [Benjamin] I feel that 95 percent of Brazilian society would 
gain. The workers would be the first to gain, but so would 
business sectors that are capable of adapting to that new model, 
which makes a rather wide scope for private accumulation 
possible. The losers would be the sectors that have grown 
accustomed to living as parasites on the national crisis over 
the past decade--meaning, in this case, financial capital as 
currently organized, the large landowners, and the oligopolies 
in general. 
  [Alves] As regards the banking system, what are the premises 
on which you are working? 
  [Benjamin] We will not have problems in our relations with 
the bankers if they show the government and society that they 
are capable of operating their businesses in a context of low 
inflation and of performing the basic function of any financial 
system, which is to supply credit for production. But if they 
insist on continuing to act as a national debt cartel and 
treating their agents as money stores, the relationship is going 
to be difficult. The current system is dysfunctional from the 
standpoint of the Brazilian economy, and it will have to be 
penalized by an adjustment which, incidentally, will also have 
to affect the state banks. 
  [Alves] Will that adjustment be drastic? 
  [Benjamin] I don't think so, because we are going to make a 
viable, simple, realistic, and legal proposal beforehand for 
extending the profile of the domestic debt--a proposal will 
involve losses but no foolishness. We are going to offer 
adjustment options. Incidentally, we suggest that the banks 
begin making their adjustments now, regardless of the election 
results. The orgy is going to have to stop or the nation will 
explode. 
  [Alves] What approach will the government program take in 
relation to the agrarian question? 
  [Benjamin] I have just received a preliminary document on 
agrarian reform. The basic idea is to establish a new "contract" 
between agriculture and society, its priority objective being 
food security for our people. Just as all the developed 
countries, even those with less agricultural potential than 
ours, have done. Our objective in one term of office would be to 
achieve self-sufficiency in producing the 12 items making up the 
basic food basket. As far as the distribution of land is 
concerned, the preliminary goal is to settle 1 million families 
during the first five years of a reform process that is expected 
to last 15 years. This would require the expropriation of about 
30 million hectares, and considering the size of Brazil's 
territory, that is not much. It is an agrarian reform not 
limited to the agrarian issue. It is rounded out by agricultural 
and agroindustrial policies to ensure supplies and food security. 
  [Alves] Do you intend to pay for expropriating that land? 
  [Benjamin] Yes, in accordance with the legislation in 
effect. 
In fact, implementing the Land Statute would be a big step. The 
money for payment will come primarily from budget funds. As the 
country frees itself of the need to roll over the domestic 
debt--which eats up 60 percent of the budget--it will begin to 
have the money it needs. With the resumption of growth, the tax 
base will tend to rise as a matter of course. With inflation 
under control, the basis for funds at the state's disposal will 
grow larger. This is not a particularly expensive program. But 
we have not yet put a figure on the cost. 
  [Alves] How will foreign capital be treated? 
  [Benjamin] What we have had in Brazil over the past 15 years 
is a lot of rhetoric in favor of international integration and, 
in practice, a lot of international isolation. To achieve that 
integration, our country's elites are destroying Brazil: 
destroying the domestic market and the national state. We are in 
favor of foreign capital, especially the kind linked to 
investments. But what we are getting is the entrance of hot 
money into Brazil--money that is not coming here in the form of 
investments, because our people are being pauperized, our state 
destroyed, and our inflation rate rising. 
  [Alves] Do you intend to revise the privatization process? 
  [Benjamin] Certainly. It is a criminal process unrelated to 
any idea of industrial policy. It is fraudulent. It has led to 
the formation of big private monopolies in key areas such as 
steel and fertilizers. Compared to the privatization process 
decided on by the Collor administration, P.C. Farias is a 
chicken thief. As regards the companies that have been 
privatized, we are going to take a look at appropriate legal 
measures. We will not tolerate the formation of private 
monopolies in basic sectors. 
  [Alves] The PT has historically advocated an audit of the 
foreign debt and the suspension of payments on that debt. Will 
this continue? 
  [Benjamin] It is still being discussed. My personal opinion 
is that we were correct in the early 1980's when we said that 
attempts to pay the foreign debt by accepting the absurd 
conditions imposed by our creditors would disrupt the Brazilian 
economy. But we would be wrong now to turn the moratorium slogan 
into a fetish. We would not recover what we have already lost, 
and we would not be able to exploit a scenario that is more 
favorable to us at the moment than it was in the 1980's. 
International interest rates are low and will probably remain 
that way for the next few years because of the serious 
unemployment problem in the central countries. A moratorium must 
be considered a means, not an end. It is important to see to it 
that the economy is not condemned to operate like a machine for 
producing a megasurplus in our trade with the rest of the world, 
as it is now. In the second place, our country must not be a net 
exporter of capital, which it was in the 1980's. Third, the 
problem must be looked at from the standpoint of an overall 
solution that will not prevent us from taking advantage of new 
opportunities in our relations with other countries. Those are 
the ends, and whether to declare a moratorium or not belongs to 
the discussion of means. And it is no longer such a dramatic 
issue. 
  [Alves] How do you analyze Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's economic plan? 
  [Benjamin] The plan throws all the burden of budget 
adjustment on expenditures and investments, which are already 
very low, and leaves intact the financial component of the 
imbalance in the public sector. Moreover, it does not provide 
clear rules for converting the business world to the URV 
[expansion not given], something that will probably increase the 
conflict over distribution. The acceleration of inflation is 
already clear, and it will continue at least for the next few 
months. This means that a new cycle of concentration is under 
way. We do not believe that path is valid. The crisis will not 
be solved by plans, but by a new and comprehensive national 
project that will point the operators in the public and private 
sectors to new frontiers for the long-term accumulation of 
capital. 
  [Alves] How does the PT approach the issue of the Armed 
Forces? 
  [Benjamin] We are going to have high-level dialogue with the 
Armed Forces with no petty deals. Especially since recovering 
the ability to control and defend the territory and acquiring a 
greater degree of strategic autonomy in the geopolitical space 
of immediate interest to us--South America and the South 
Atlantic--must be fundamental goals of any serious government. 
We have three immediate measures in mind: increased 
professionalization of the military, reequipment of the armed 
services, and a continuation of the main programs aimed at 
technological expertise. With some slight changes in direction, 
that would include support for the program to develop nuclear 
technology, the All-Brazilian Space Mission, the AMX program, 
the Antarctic program, the Calha Norte Project, and the 
electronic warfare center. 
  [Alves] That requires investments. Is it a priority issue? 
  [Benjamin] In the medium term--to be implemented throughout 
the administration's term of office and consolidated at its 
end--we anticipate the setting up of a Ministry of Defense and 
the establishment of a rapid action force to consist of land, 
air, and sea forces in accordance with the principles of modern 
warfare. It would amount to an operational restructuring of the 
Armed Forces. This is a serious issue. Our country lacks defense 
capability. And that is part of the more general process in 
which the state and nation are being destroyed. The objective is 
to guarantee the defense of its territory and greater strategic 
autonomy in its international policy. Military spending 
currently represents 0.5 percent of GDP, and that is not enough. 
In the course of our administration, we want to increase that to 
2 percent, including research and technological development.

  [Text] [Ernesto Samper, Liberal Party] The situation is 
particularly outrageous in areas like Buenaventura where there 
is a 60 percent unemployment and underemployment rate. We do not 
need to bring in labor forces, not even to carry out exercises. 
  [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party] I think this sort of 
operation was mishandled from the very beginning. It should have 
been clearly explained and not with half-truths. 
  [Miguel Maza Marques, Conservative Party] Besides blowing it 
by allowing their presence, the country has been lied to. This 
is, in my opinion, a doubly unfortunate position by the 
president. 
  [Gabriel Melo, Conservative Party] That was a shameful 
agreement. Foreign troops were granted permission to bear arms, 
use all ports and airports, and conduct emergency night flights, 
according to the agreement. All this to build a small school? 
  [Carlos Lemos, Liberal Party] The country has not been told 
the truth. Proof of this is that when the defense minister 
returned to work after a heart ailment, he told the country that 
it was about time to clarify what had happened in Juanchaco and 
other parts of the nation. 
  [Enrique Parejo, Conservative Party] I do not think they 
fooled the president. Who knows what is behind all this. 
Therefore, it is important the president explain.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Feb (AFP) -- The Council of 
State, Colombia's highest administrative litigation court, this 
Tuesday asked the House investigative commission and the 
Attorney General's Office to investigate President Cesar Gaviria 
concerning the presence of U.S. troops in the country. 
  The Court's believes that the head of state could have 
violated the Constitution by authorizing the arrival of foreign 
soldiers in Colombian territory without consulting the Council 
of State or the Senate, so it requested an investigation. 
  The issue refers to the 5 January arrival of 150 U.S. 
military engineers in Juanchaco on Colombia's Pacific coast with 
the declared purpose of building a school and health center and 
renovating some roads. 
  The presence of U.S. soldiers in this area and in Meta 
Department, where radar installations were erected, as well as 
the constant passage of vessels and military aircraft through 
Colombian territory gave rise to a heated debate and heightened 
arguments among candidates during the electoral campaign. 
  In light of the situation, the Council of State asked for an 
explanation from the president, who last week submitted an 
extensive document, based on which the Court issued the 
following pronouncement adopted unanimously following a 
five-hour session: 
  "1. The government has at no point asked for an opinion to 
permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as 
foreign vessels and aircraft in the national territory in 
accordance with the provisions of Articles 189 and 237 of the 
Political Constitution. 
  ``2. In light of the Constitution, it does not find 
convincing the explanations given by the government on the 
decisions it has made concerning this matter, because the 
interpretation of the text of the same and the treaties and 
agreements signed by Colombia is opposed to the letter and the 
spirit of the Political Constitution and violates national 
sovereignty. 
  ``3. From the same explanations, it can be deducted that the 
Senate did not grant the permission established by Article 173 
of the Constitution. 
  ``4. Given the situation that has arisen, it believes that 
U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in Colombian 
territory without fulfilling with the requisites set forth in 
the Constitution. 
  ``5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the 
president of the Republic is responsible for the foreign 
relations of the Colombian State with absolute respect for 
national sovereignty. 
  ``Consequently, it is unusual that the president says that 
the minister of defense gave the authorization without his 
previous knowledge when the memorandum of understanding signed 
by said minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993 
establishes that they are acting with 'due authorization from 
their respective governments'.'' 
  It should be noted that the last Colombian president 
investigated by the House was former General Gustavo Rojas

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Feb (EFE) -- The television 
newscast Q.A.P today revealed documents from the personal files 
of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the slain head of the Medellin Cartel, 
which compromise politicians, judges, officers, and other 
personalities. Included among the documents is a video that 
shows a cartel member asking Escobar not to kill him and 
reminding him of his involvement in terrorist attacks, 
kidnappings, and alleged intercessions in Cuba before someone 
identified as Raul Castro. 
  Although the video does not mention the contact's position, 
it is believed to be Raul Castro, brother of Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and commander of that country's Armed Forces. 
  It also mentions without naming them some people close to 
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, according to 
the television newscast. 
  The documents, which include photographs, videos, and 
letters, reveal the irregularities committed at Envigado's La 
Catedral prison, where Escobar was held for almost a year with 
14 of his most sinister lieutenants, who held loud, bawdy 
parties with hundreds of persons illegally entering the 
facility. Trials were even held against members of the Medellin 
Cartel. Escobar also had secret documents belonging to the DEA 
and various Colombian state entities. He had the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of people who testified against 
him and reports on bribes he paid to judges and politicians. 
  The authorities also found among Escobar's possessions 
documents belonging to the Cali Cartel, but the greatest share 
of the papers consisted of letters from people and institutions 
asking him for money for different purposes, among them a letter 
from a community of nuns requesting his "good offices" for a 
social project. The father of the killer of presidential 
hopeful Bernardo Jaramillo went to La Catedral to ask for money 
to purchase a home and thus reward the "courage" of his son, who 
was barely 15 years old when he was killed in the ensuing 
reaction by bodyguards of the Patriotic Union candidate. 
  With the discovery of Escobar's personal files, the 
authorities have been able to clarify many deaths, kidnappings, 
and attacks perpetrated on the orders of this major drug 
trafficker and terrorist, who was killed in a shoot out with 
police on 2 December in Medellin.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Corabastos (expansion unknown; involves supplies) reports 
that in January the price of 30 basic staples increased by 
between 0.5 and 204 percent. On 1 February, the DANE (National 
Administrative Department of Statistics) released a report on 
the cost of living for January showing a considerable increase 
in food prices, which could raise the cost of living index by as 
much as 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Cesar de Hart Vengoechea, 
president of the Association of Colombian Farmers, said the 
consumer index was low because of the sacrifices of the farming 
sector and low profits. He said the opposite would be true with 
increased prices and farmers would be able to make a little 
profit. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 
2B) 
  During January, food and transportation prices increased the 
most and the consumer index increased 3.15 percent. This 
increase was .09 percent lower than the same period in 1993 when 
a 3.24 increase was recorded, which raises the government's 
hopes of meeting its goal of 19 percent inflation in 1994. DANE 
Director Rodolfo Uribe says the index was affected primarily 
because the price of vehicles, gasoline, parking lots fees, 
tires, etc. increased 9.23 percent. Prices in the health sector 
increased the most in areas like consultation, hospitalization, 
lab tests, and dental services. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO 
SIGLO in Spanish 2 Feb 94 p 1, 1B)

  [Text] Medellin--Smuggling, underbilling, and money 
laundering continue to cut into the profits of the Colombian 
textile industry. 
  Compared with the "good old days" of the leading Antioquian 
textile mills in early 1993, profits reported for the third 
quarter of last year indicate that it was not a good year, nor 
is the situation expected to improve in 1994. 
  Even though factories have not announced the results of 
operations leading into 1993, smuggling, underbilling, and money 
laundering combine to indicate that it is highly unlikely that 
losses built up during the year will be recovered during the 
final four months. 
  Another reflection of the situation appeared in December 
when 
Fabricato, COLTEJER [Colombian Textile Company], and Tejicondor 
shares were among the five companies whose quotes suffered the 
steepest drops. 
  COLTEJER, which in 1992 earned profits of 10 billion pesos, 
ended the third quarter of 1993 with losses totaling 7.336 
billion pesos. Fabricato began 1993 with profits of 9.499 
billion, but by the third quarter, results totaled scarcely 504 
million. 
  In 1992, Tejicondor earned net profits of 3.565 billion 
pesos. However, by the close of the third quarter, it had earned 
only 526 million. 
<H5>  More Smuggling </H5>
  "We did lose money, but we still do not know how much," said 
Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil in summing up 1993, a year 
that saw 3,000 workers laid off by the country's 500 textile 
companies. 
  Perez reported that the company's sales were 18 percent 
lower 
than anticipated at the start of 1993. Last year, only 41 
billion pesos worth of goods were sold, compared with a goal of 
50 billion. 
  The president of Tejicondor believes that smuggling and the 
government's inability to control it, despite its intention of 
imposing port restrictions once again, are the basic causes of 
the crisis we are facing, a crisis that in 1993 was merely 
circumstantial, but that now threatens to become structural. 
  "How can we not need restrictions when we are drowning in 
textiles as a result of underbilling and money laundering?" the 
business executive asked. 
  In early 1993, the lack of minimum reference prices, 
combined 
with subsidized imports and smuggling, resulted in a loss of 30 
percent of the domestic market. 
  According to Perez, "fabrics ranging from $.10 to $5.00 are 
entering the country and, except for Medellin, Customs is not 
going its job. Furthermore, any estimates of what comes in is 
false. In addition, the only country with money laundering is 
Colombia. A laundered dollar is worth only a fourth as much as 
an official dollar." 
  The businessman said that while it is practically impossible 
to ascertain the volume of textiles smuggled in or resulting 
from money from drug trafficking, if Customs seized some 9 
million meters of fabric in 1993 (equivalent to Tejicondor's 
production for three months), much more has come in through 
undetected operations. 
  According to these estimates, imported textiles have 
garnered 
some 30 percent of the market, and 70 percent of all imports 
comprise unfair competition. 
  Textile workers claim that such measures as minimum import 
prices for 31 types of textiles have not been as effective as 
hoped either. 
  They say that, under the circumstances, despite the 
government's encouraging predictions, the sector's problems will 
be reflected in the coming annual balance sheets. 
  For the time being, the textile industry knows that the new 
year has begun, accompanied by adjustments in investment 
programs, possibly more layoffs of workers, and the discussion 
of petitions in a number of companies. 
  All signs indicate that any hope of recovering first 
semester 
losses during the latter half of 1993 has been thwarted or, more 
appropriately, unraveled. Consequently, the nation's textile 
plants are reportedly on the brink of a crisis as serious as the 
one experienced in the early 1980's.

  [Text] Barranquilla--Two of the country's largest mining 
projects could be transferred to the private sector. The 
government has expressed its support for privatizing Colombian 
Coal (CARBOCOL) and selling off its stock in the Cerromatoso 
nickel mine. 
  According to Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule Aming, as 
a 
result of the government reform of a year ago that led to the 
creation of the Colombian Coal Enterprise (ECOCARBON), CARBOCOL 
was left managing no more than Colombia's share of El Cerrejon. 
Furthermore, since it was capitalized, it is now on a sound 
footing. 
  Nonetheless, the minister said that the enterprise is no 
more 
profitable because prices on the international coal market are 
far below initial projections. 
  The government is therefore weighing the possibility of 
reorganizing the enterprise, hoping to bring in the private 
sector. "We have ordered a number of studies that are measuring 
all these possibilities on a national and world level. In my 
opinion, it would be very useful for us to privatize CARBOCOL 
totally. It is essentially a marketing activity in which the 
government has no reason to be involved." 
  Concerning Cerromatoso, in which the Industrial Development 
Institute has an important interest, the minister said there is 
no justification for the involvement of the latter organization 
either. 
  Nule presided over a meeting of the Urra, Inc. board of 
directors in Barranquilla that passed a budget totaling 48 
billion pesos for 1994. The figure does not include any of the 
loans granted, the first of which would go to the Electric 
Corporation of the Atlantic Coast (CORELCA). 
  Urra Manager Jose Camilo Manzur said this year's first goal 
involves social programs, the purchase of nationally owned 
lands, and the relocation of people, without neglecting other 
matters such as the signing of loan contracts and progress on 
civil engineering projects already under way. 
  The government is bent on promoting the program to privatize 
several entities. The list will include such banks as the Bank 
of Colombia, the National Bank, and the People's Bank, and power 
plants such as the Betania Hydroelectric Plant. 
  The Executive Branch believes it should allow the 
participation of the private sector in the activities in which 
it engages.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio today rejected rumors of 
divisions in the Armed Forces and confirmed that the Army plays 
an important role in consolidating and strengthening democracy. 
De Leon thus countered newspaper reports of a split in the Army 
created by peace talks between the government and guerrillas. 
Rumor has it that the Army has split into three factions: the 
first being the military personnel who were removed following 
the self-inflicted coup attempt by the later deposed President 
Jorge Serrano in 1993, the second being the "hard-liners," and 
the third being those who support institutional rule. 
  According to SIGLO VEINTIUNO, the "hard-liners" oppose talks 
with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Alliance [URNG] and 
support the president, but only on certain conditions. The 
newspaper says those military personnel are willing to join the 
removed officers to resume armed field actions against the 
guerrillas if the government gets the United Nations more 
involved in the peace talks. According to an agreement signed 
between the guerrillas and the government in Mexico on 10 
January, the United Nations will moderate the peace talks, which 
are scheduled to resume early in March. 
  The president labeled the reports as false and added: "I am 
not worried about rumors. I am convinced that the officers are 
aware of the role they play in the democratic process. There 
could be differences of opinion, but no division." De Leon said 
the Army feels fully responsible for the country's institutional 
order. 
  The president spoke at the Main Square in front of the 
government building shortly before meeting with Monsignor 
Prospero Penados del Barrio, Archbishop of Guatemala. De Leon 
said the Archbishop's visit was of a personal nature, although 
they would also discuss subjects related to the country's 
political, economic, and social crisis. 
  Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez has also 
reiterated the Army's support for peace talks but opposed the 
creation of a truth commission to investigate human rights 
violations perpetrated since armed conflict began in 1960. 
  De Leon said discussions on human rights with URNG will have 
to include all related aspects, but he declined to give any 
additional details. 
  Finally, Gen. Enriquez said the Armed Forces object to the 
creation of a truth commission because it would disregard the 
Army and would polarize rather than assuage the population.
