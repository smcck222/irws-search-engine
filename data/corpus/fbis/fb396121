  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (EFE) -- Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
Mexican presidential candidate, will be supported during the 
elections to be held on 21 August by seven political parties and 
20 social organizations which today formed the National 
Democratic Alliance (ADN) [Alianza Democratica Nacional]. 
  During the ceremony for the creation of the ADN, held at the 
Monument to the Revolution, Cardenas demanded clean elections on 
21 August 1994 and called for a national mobilization for 
democracy. 
  The ADN is formed by the Party of the Democratic Revolution 
(PRD), which is headed by Cardenas and is the only legally 
registered organization; the Democratic Forum Party (PFD); the 
Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT); the Social Democrat Party 
(PSD); the Socialist Party (PS); and the Socialist Alternative 
(AS). The ADN also includes fractions of the Labor Party (PT), 
the Broad Socialist Left Party (PAIS), Socialist Refoundation 
(RS) [Refundacion Socialista], and the National Patriotic Front 
(FPN), which consists of diverse organizations and personalities. 
  Among the social and urban movement organizations, we have 
the Assembly of Neighborhoods (AB) [Asamblea de Barrios], the 
Independent Union of Agricultural Workers and Peasants (CIOAC) 
[Central Independiente de Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos], the 
Emiliano Zapata People's Union (UPREZ) [Union Popular Emiliano 
Zapata], the New Tenochtitlan People's Union (UPNT) [Union 
Popular Nueva Tenochtitlan], and the Assembly of the Workers 
[Asamblea de los Trabajadores], among others. 
  Among the regional organizations there are regional groups 
from Chihuahua State, Baja California Sur State, Colima State, 
Queretaro State, Mexico State, citizen committees from 29 
Mexican states, and numerous personalities from academic, 
political, artistic, and cultural life. 
  Cardenas, who also aspired to the presidency in 1988, was 
also supported by diverse political groups in that election.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Senator Enrique Gomez Hurtado, of </F>
the National Salvation Movement, by unidentified reporter; place 
not given; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We greet Senator Enrique Gomez Hurtado 
this morning. Mr. Gomez, what is your opinion of the 
explanation given by President Cesar Gaviria yesterday regarding 
the presence of U.S. troops in Junachaco, Valle Department? 
  [Gomez] Undoubtedly, once again we have not been given an 
explanation. What the president said yesterday is that he is 
unwilling to tell us what the hell the Americans are doing in 
Juanchaco. As you know, the Presidency's Legal Secretariat has 
sent me.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] A letter. 
  [Gomez] A very strange letter, in which one paragraph 
explicitly states the members of Congress have no right to 
question the truth of government statements. I believe this 
letter is unique in the democratic world. This totally rules 
out the possibility that the delegates of public opinion have 
knowledge of what the government is doing. 
  In my opinion, those very recent agreements signed by the 
defense minister clearly violate the Constitution, because these 
matters are clearly the responsibility of the congressional 
Second Commission and plenum. Here, we are dealing with 
clandestine treaties. As you well know, international treaties 
are above the Constitution, but for their approval and 
signature, the Constitution establishes certain requirements. 
These treaties were signed in secret; besides, they took 
advantage of the fact that the congressional plenum was not 
assembled to do what they are doing over there; of course, this 
is not a matter of the building of little schools. Not one 
Colombian has believed that story [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] If they are not building little schools, what are 
they doing? 
  [Gomez] This is what we all are asking; besides, we are also 
asking what right do the Presidency of the Republic, the Defense 
Ministry, and the Military High Command have to systematically 
lie to us? They are throwing a smoke screen. Just because we 
are now in preelection times we cannot criticize the government. 
We are then accused of demagoguery. They are using a 
circumstance as an election issue. The problem is the 
circumstance is very serious. 
  [Reporter] If the congressmen and reporters cannot go over 
there and see what they are doing, question, investigate what is 
going on, then who in Colombia can? 
  [Gomez] That is precisely the question we are all asking. I 
believe as soon as the congressional sessions open, this will be 
the first debate that must be broached. They are also telling 
us it was wrong to criticize the use of the presidential plane 
for a party, that we are using this as an election tool. Now, 
what else can we expect? Just because we are in the midst of a 
preelection period, we have no right to criticize anything; 
therefore, the government has the right to do everything it 
pleases. 
  I believe we are completely distorting political actions, 
and 
above all we are seriously trampling Congress' jurisdiction. 
This is a situation of, shall we say, information dictatorship 
similar to Finance Minister Hommes' fiscal dictatorship. The 
situation is very touchy. 
  [Reporter] President Gaviria says he does not understand why 
everyone is surprised by the U.S. forces' presence here, as this 
has been going on for the past 50 years. 
  [Gomez] Look, I am not one to shield myself behind the flag 
to say: Gringo go home! Not at all. The matter is that one 
cannot lie. President Nixon lost the Presidency for a much less 
serious lie than the one they are perpetually telling us. It 
does not bother me that they are there, but we should be told 
what they are doing. 
  One cannot authorize the passing of troops with all the 
elements of the passing of troops based on agreements that grant 
everything described, from a military point of view, as the 
passing of foreign troops [sentence as heard]. All of this was 
done behind Congress' back; furthermore, the goals of those 
passing troops are systematically denied. If they had told us, 
we probably would have approved their presence. I am not saying 
this is good or bad. What is [word indistinct] is clandestine. 
Clandestine matters allow public opinion to imagine whatever it 
wants. Usually, whatever is hidden is bad.

  [Text] Puerto Ayacucho, 8 Feb (AFP) -- Two F-16 planes of 
the Venezuelan Air Force this morning overflew the forest area 
near the Colombian town of Casuarito where 22 police clashed 
with more than 120 guerrillas for more than seven hours, area 
journalists reported. 
  The attack resulted in three dead and nine injured 
policemen. 
Two seriously injured policemen underwent surgery at 1540 GMT 
(1140) at the hospital in Puerto Ayacucho, a regional capital of 
Venezuela located 528 km southeast of Caracas. 
  The dead policemen were identified as Jairo Bolanos, Jose 
Pantoja, and Luis Alberto Biloria. 
  Various reports have agreed the insurgents could have 
sustained up to seven dead and an undetermined number of injured. 
  The source has reported one of the seriously injured 
Colombian policemen could go blind. 
  In Caracas, a report from Radio Rumbos in Puerto Ayacucho 
has 
stated insurgents of the Guerrilla Coordinating Board, which is 
made up of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and 
Army of National Liberation (ELN), used ammunition manufactured 
by Venezuela's Cavim Factory during the attack. 
  According to Venezuelan reports, calm returned at noon today 
to the Colombian town of Casuarito whose inhabitants sustained 
no casualties. Meanwhile, security measures were intensified at 
the border area in Puerto Ayacucho. 
  Colombian military patrols also tried unsuccessfully to find 
the attackers of Casuarito. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1629 GMT on 8 February reports: 
"General Rafael Montero, Venezuelan defense minister, confirmed 
today his country has declared an alert in the area along the 
Colombian town of Casuarito." The report adds the general told 
the media that Venezuelan actions are being coordinated with the 
Colombian Armed Forces. He said "there was no clash between the 
Venezuelan military and guerrillas."]

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila said after 
meeting with President Rafael Caldera that so far no petroleum 
cooperation agreement has been reached among Russia, Cuba, and 
Venezuela, although the possibility has not been ruled out. 
  The Cuban official said talks are currently under way among 
the three states for a possible petroleum cooperation agreement 
and that each is prepared to establish a commercial operation 
that is favorable to the three countries. The Cuban vice 
president stressed, however, that the issue was not discussed 
with President Caldera because the tour of South American 
countries is focused on strengthening relations with Cuba. 
  [Begin Lage recording] We did not discuss the issue with 
President Caldera. As President Caldera said at the beginning, 
we discussed general issues. We thanked him for his position 
against the U.S. blockade on Cuba. We also expressed our 
satisfaction with his election and stressed our desire for a 
better future for Venezuelans. [end recording] 
  In the short 24-hour visit to Venezuela, the Cuban vice 
president noted his interest in strengthening ties between 
Venezuela and Colombia [sentence as heard]. To that end, he 
held meetings with the ministers of tourism, foreign affairs, 
and communications and transportation and with the president of 
the Venezuelan Investment Fund.

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera said the stay of 
proceedings against the military personnel involved in the 4-F 
[4 February 92] and 27-N [27 November 92] events will continue 
on course as it should. 
  The president made these statements in Valencia following 
the 
ceremony for the episcopal ordination of Monsignor Reinaldo Del 
Prette Lissoi, which the president attended as the guest of 
honor. 
  [Caldera] It was a very beautiful, solemn ceremony and a 
fine 
expression of the feeling of the Venezuelan people. It was also 
a recognition of the brilliant figure of Venezuela's 
ecclesiastic youth. I am very satisfied because I think it is a 
sign of vitality, force, and faith in the Venezuela we all want. 
  [EL GLOBO] What can you tell us about the stay of 
proceedings 
against the coupists? 
  [Caldera] That will continue on course as it should. In a 
way, I am committed to the country. My conscience has committed 
me to solving this problem, which must be solved in a way that 
strengthens peace and unity in the Armed Forces and among the 
Venezuelan people. 
  [EL GLOBO] And what about the salary increase you announced? 
  [Caldera] That is being considered to see how it will be 
processed, because there are various options in the Labor Law. 
The Labor Ministry will bring it up at the next cabinet meeting. 
  [EL GLOBO] What has the governor of Carabobo State proposed 
in terms of decentralization? 
  [Caldera] It will continue in a constructive manner, because 
we want harmony between national, regional, and municipal 
authorities. 
<H5>  Support From the Governors </H5>
  Carabobo Governor Enrique Salas Romer, president of the 
Association of Governors [of Venezuela, AVG], said President 
Caldera has "the support of the AVG independent of the positions 
its members may have. We maintain our support for the person 
chosen by the people to guide the destiny of the country." 
  Salas Romer said some of the president's statements make him 
feel optimistic about Caldera's attitude toward the 
decentralization process, which "is not a goal but a reality 
based on the economic, social, educational, and political growth 
of the Venezuela that extends beyond Caracas and which also 
demands the participation of the people of Caracas."

  [Text] Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette, 
minister of defense, said it will be very difficult for the 
military personnel charged with participating in the 4 February 
[1992] and 27 November [1992] coup attempts to reenter the Armed 
Forces, thus the defense minister's office is "trying to 
incorporate them into civilian life without problems." 
  Minister Montero explained that the respective files are 
being studied by the court martial and the court in charge of 
the case in order to make recommendations to President Caldera. 
  [EL NACIONAL] And how long will that take? 
  [Montero] I can't say, but we are studying them all. 
  [EL NACIONAL] What can you tell us about the return of the 
military personnel who sought asylum in Peru? 
  [Montero] So far we haven't had any contact with them, but 
we 
are studying their files to solve the problem. 
  [EL NACIONAL] They must come before the law? 
  [Montero] The president already said that they must come 
before the law. They have been notified of this several times. 
  [EL NACIONAL] How are your investigations proceeding 
regarding the alleged sale of weapons to Colombia by the 
Venezuelan soldiers? 
  [Montero] We have a DIM [Directorate of Military 
Intelligence] officer in Colombia right now coordinating the 
investigation, and we are trying to determine whether their is 
any connection between the two cases. Right now we are in the 
middle of the investigations. 
  [EL NACIONAL] The Zulia State governor said Yucpa Indians 
were massacred in Sierra de Perija. What do you have to say 
about this? 
  [Montero] There was no massacre. What happened was that a 
trooper reacted. He was attacked with sticks and machetes, he 
reacted, and, regrettably, it happened. Vice Admiral Huizi 
Clavier will go to Zulia on 7 February to coordinate with the 
governor for an investigation of the problem at the scene. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Is the possibility of reintegrating the 
coupist 
officers into the Armed Forces being studied? 
  [Montero] Yes, it is being studied, and they know it will be 
difficult for them to be allowed to return to the Armed Forces. 
We are looking for the best way for them to leave the 
organization but through the front door with no problems later 
in civilian life.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast; </F>
passages in quotation marks recorded; speakers identified by 
caption] 
  [Text] The first meeting of the Council of Ministers of 
President Rafael Caldera started at 1030. Two issues focused 
their discussions: the country's fiscal situation and the 
review of the 1994 national budget. Following this meeting of 
nearly the entire cabinet, its members held their first formal 
news conference, which was coordinated by Guillermo Alvarez 
Bajares, minister of the Central Information Office. 
  The finance minister said that the 1994 expenditures budget 
of 1.43 trillion [currency not specified] was estimated in April 
1993 and was based on petroleum revenues of $15 per barrel. The 
price of the crude is currently $12.5 per barrel. As a result, 
they were forced to reestimate revenues. 
  Thus, this Council of Ministers approved a 10-percent 
reduction in spending as part of a tax reform program that will 
soon be presented to the Congress. This should reduce the 
budget deficit by 2 percent of GNP and should reduce inflation. 
  [Finance Minister Julio Sosa] "We tried to study a reduction 
in the operating costs of autonomous services, of funds for 
personnel under contracts, and of planned allotments for, among 
other things, the purchase of vehicles, although this might seem 
unimportant. These things seem unimportant, but they add up to 
rather large amounts. This is obviously part of the fiscal 
austerity program announced by the president of the Republic. 
We also considered -- and this was amply discussed -- the need 
to carry out infrastructure projects included in the current 
budget but that must be reduced through a regime of concessions." 
  Meanwhile, and also on economic issues, the development 
minister announced an upcoming meeting to which all sectors 
involved were invited to reach a voluntary agreement to 
stabilize prices and prevent an escalation in the cost of living. 
  [Development Minister Luis Palacios] "The idea is to urge 
all economic sectors to try to reach a voluntary agreement to 
lower inflation." 
  Another issue that focused the attention of journalists was 
internal security. In this regard, the interior minister 
reaffirmed that the government will guarantee full respect for 
human rights and peaceful protests. He clarified, however, that 
it cannot continue to allow masked men to lead them. To put an 
end to this, he will meet with student leaders. The minister 
added that public order requires a firm, vigorous, and sustained 
attitude, not just repression. 
  The justice minister commented on the overlapping duties of 
the police. He announced a redefinition of the duties of these 
groups to maximize their efficiency. 
  [Justice Minister Ruben Creixems] "Venezuela is a democratic 
country. It has a system that aspires to life in a legal state. 
The country's Constitution and its laws define public order and 
enshrine principles of personal safety. Thus, police 
authorities must be subject to the Constitution and the law. 
We must eliminate once and for all in Venezuela that 
inadmissible principle that one must shoot first and investigate 
later. 
  "I think that the interior minister, the defense minister, 
the governor of Caracas, and I will hold interesting meetings to 
somewhat define the scope of various police forces' duties, 
because at times it appears that all are in charge of 
everything. And when all are in charge of everything, they 
might think that somebody else is handling a particular issue. 
To the extent that jurisdictions and duties are specifically 
defined and to the extent that the issues of organization and 
security pertaining to the police corps are settled, one will 
then be able to assign specific responsibilities in cases of 
violations or able to reward those corps that have performed in 
an outstanding manner." 
  In the opinion of the education minister, the problem is not 
the disturbances that the students could stage but the poor 
quality of the education they receive. Thus his goal is to 
improve quality: 
  [Education Minister Antonio Cardenas] "I am very worried 
that our children and teenagers are spending nine years in basic 
education and are leaving without mastering their mother tongue, 
without knowing how to read and write correctly, and without 
being able to express their ideas correctly. I am even more 
worried that some of them -- unfortunately not a majority -- go 
through secondary, diversified, and professional education; 
reach the university and graduate; and leave the university 
still with serious deficiences in the use of their mother 
tongue." 
  The journalists also asked questions about the orientation 
of 
our foreign policy. The foreign affairs minister said there are 
three key issues: maintaining the excellent level of our 
relations with neighboring countries and with the United States, 
fully articulating integration processes, and improving 
Venezuela's image: 
  [Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Burelli] "It is possible 
that now that the crisis is being resolved it will be recognized 
that Venezuelan institutions were so good that they endured the 
commotion created by those military coups and the trial of the 
president of the Republic. No country on the American continent 
has been able to resist this kind of thing. Thus, instead of 
having that bad image, we should have been recognized as a 
country with formidable political institutions." 
  This cabinet meeting also approved the reorganization of the 
Ministry of the Secretariat. A commission headed by the 
incumbent minister was established for this purpose. It must 
present a report within 15 days. 
  The media was also told that henceforth the Council of 
Ministers will meet on Wednesdays at 1030. The journalists were 
advised about changes in the news reporting procedures and were 
urged to cooperate as much as possible to ensure the best 
coverage of all Palace events.

  [Text] Caracas, 5 Feb (EFE) -- Official sources said on 5 
February that the tax reform proposed by the administration of 
President Rafael Caldera will include a 20-percent tax on luxury 
goods. 
  The government is bidding to offset a drop in revenues 
caused 
by the planned elimination of the value-added tax (VAT) that is 
levied on all consumers. President Caldera has called the VAT 
"an unfair burden on the less fortunate classes." 
  The VAT, which went into effect in January and later was 
temporarily suspended until 28 February, will continue to be 
levied on importers and wholesalers. As for consumers, the VAT 
will be replaced by a tax on luxury goods. 
  A tax of 18-20 percent will be levied on a lengthy list of 
items that includes cellular telephones, television sets, 
motorcycles, planes, helicopters, yachts, jewelry, thoroughbreds 
and race horses, fighting bulls, and five-star hotels. 
  The government already approved a 10-percent reduction in 
the 
national budget, which according to the original draft amounts 
to about 1.5 trillion bolivares (about $15.5 billion), to offset 
the impact caused by the partial elimination of the VAT. 
  This $1.5-billion reduction would basically affect funds 
earmarked for nonpriority public works. These works, however, 
would not be completely halted, because a system of concessions 
would be implemented to promote the direct participation of the 
private sector. 
  If these measures do not suffice to balance fiscal accounts, 
which are currently estimated to show a deficit of about 500 
billion bolivares (about $5.1 billion) by year's end, the 
government would consider the possibility of levying a tax on 
banking operations. This tax, which was included in the early 
plans by some Caldera advisers, has been postponed for now, but 
governmental sources pointed out that it could be implemented by 
mid-1994 if the desired results are not achieved by that time 
through the initial measures. 
  At any rate, budget cuts, new taxes, and the partial 
elimination of the VAT must all be approved by Congress, where 
President Caldera lacks sound support and where it is feared 
that he might find strong opposition.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Colombia's International Sugar and Molasses Marketing 
Company 
purchased the Urena Sugar Mill for 320 million bolivares. The 
transaction was conducted at the Venezuelan Investment Fund 
(FIV) offices. FIV President Nelson Rivera stated the 
transaction was beneficial for the country because the 
investment and expenditures incurred throughout the sale process 
were recovered. (Caracas Venezolana de Television in Spanish 
2350 GMT 27 Jan 94) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) has reported that, owing 
to 
a reduction in oil revenues, Venezuela's international reserves 
dropped by $744 million last January and now total $11.912 
billion. According to the BCV, another factor contributing to 
the decline is the climate of mistrust that exists in the 
financial market in the wake of the government's intervention in 
Banco Latino. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2234 GMT 3 Feb 94) 
  Venezuela foreign debt bonds have been hurt by a decrease in 
value of U.S. long-term bonds. The par bond fell one point to 
70.75 due to U.S. 30-year bond sales. In addition, investors 
have adopted a cautious stance as they are waiting to see what 
specific measures President Rafael Caldera will take. (Caracas

  [Text] Quito, 9 Feb (AFP) -- The police have reported that 
five policemen and 20 civilians were seriously injured today as 
a result of street riots by students and workers in this 
capital. Students and factory workers who were protesting the 
71.2-percent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline 
confronted Army and police units with rocks and Molotov 
cocktails. 
  On Tuesday, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador [Conaie], to which 3.5 million Ecuadorans of the 11 
million who live in this country belong, had initiated an 
ongoing Indian uprising. 
  Last Thursday the powerful United Workers Front, comprised 
of 
the country's most important labor unions, held a national 
strike to demand that the fuel price increase decreed on 28 
January be repealed. 
  Today other popular organizations held an "empty pots and 
pans march" to reject the price increase, arguing that as a 
result of the government's measure food prices have increased. 
  The demonstrators -- including many women carrying posters, 
banners, and kitchen utensils -- gathered near Central 
University and at El Ejido and La Alameda parks in downtown 
Quito and tried to march on the Presidential Palace, shouting 
slogans against President Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  Security forces, with the support of light armored tanks, 
fired tear gas at the crowd to scare away the demonstrators. 
  Conaie has reported that in the Andean province of Azuay, 
310 
km southwest of Quito, the Army fired on a group of Indians, 
wounding eight. 
  A general state of discontent is seizing the provinces of 
Riobamba, Imbabura, and Carchi, on the border with Colombia, 
according to journalists from those regions. 
  Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has cautioned that 
the 
public order will be protected. Official sources have reported 
that approximately 100 people were arrested in Quito for having 
allegedly participated in riots.

  [Excerpt] The National Electoral Service (Tricel) has 
officially proclaimed the senators and deputies who were elected 
in the December 1993 elections. 
  The lawmakers were thus authorized to assumed their posts on 
11 March. 
  Tricel President Enrique Zurita Camps, who is also a Supreme 
Court member, delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies, Gabriel Valdes and Jorge Molina, 
respectively, the official document with the proclamation of the 
citizens who were elected congressmen. 
  Zurita Camps reported that neither of the two appeals filed 
on the election of senators or any of the 42 appeals filed on 
the election of deputies were granted. Consequently, the figures 
released by the Interior Ministry after the elections have not 
been substantially changed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Special Report" on the Armed Forces] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian military are once again in the 
limelight. They are demanding a pay increase and new equipment. 
They have a pessimistic view of the frauds discovered by the 
CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] that delved into the 
budget scandal. This is causing some concern. Now, in this 
presidential election year, the Workers Party [PT] is courting 
the military, promising them a sharp increase in their budget 
and even the possibility of stepping up nuclear research -- 
meaning the atomic bomb. In an appeal to military discipline 
and propriety, President Itamar Franco summoned a retired 
general -- [Federal Secretary] Romildo Canhim -- to manage 
state-owned enterprises. Businessmen and professionals from 
different sectors have been meeting on a monthly basis with 
generals from the Armed Forces' high command. General Benedito 
Leonel, the Army chief of staff noted: "Someone will inevitably 
ask: When will the military return to power?" 
  Nine years have elapsed since Joao Baptista de Oliveira 
Figueiredo [president from 1979 to 1985] left Planalto Palace 
through the back door, and yet the military are still the talk 
of the nation. Whenever a wound is opened within the civilian 
regime, the prospect of a military coup looms large. There has 
not even been the slightest attempt to overthrow the government, 
besides, it is unlikely that such an adventure would be feasible 
in Brazil and in the world in the 1990's, yet the ghost in 
uniform has been invoked time and again. It emerged in the 
recent ravings of Justice Minister Mauricio Correa about a 
possible "self-inflicted coup like that of Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori" in Brazil with the support of the military. 
It reappeared during the Budget CPI, when Deputy Aloizio 
Mercadante [PT-SP] [Sao Paulo] deemed that it necessary to seek 
the advice of Army Minister Zenildo Lucena on the progress of 
investigations. Another example took place in Sao Bernardo do 
Campo last June. 
<H5>  The Horse Was Saddled </H5>
  During a ceremony at which hundreds of well-known local 
figures were present, General Gleuber Vieira, the then Army 
deputy chief of staff, was asked clearly and directly by one 
businessman: "General, the only way for Brazil to recapture its 
former splendor is to send all the politicians packing from 
Brasilia and establish the Armed Forces' Party. Shall we do 
this, with the people?" Another asked: "Why do the Armed Forces 
remain silent over this crisis, general?" Yet another chimed in: 
"In our Congress, only personal interests prevail. Is it not 
high time the Armed Forces intervened?" Considered one of the 
best educated and currently influential officers in the 
Brazilian Army, Gen. Gleuber Vieira made a brief statement 
which, in his view, was moderate. He said: "We are neither 
blind nor deaf, and our dumbness may only be temporary." He 
told one of these businessmen: "Never forget, sir, that we have 
taken the blows for 10 years and you never once stood up for us." 
<H5>  The Question and The Answer </H5>
  As Gen. Vieira told VEJA: "They saddled the horse and wanted 
me to found a new Republic from its saddle." 
  He said: "I react in two ways when I see what is happening: 
As a citizen I would like to hit them for what they are doing, 
but as a general I know that would not solve the problem." He 
added: Latin America got rid of the military regimes in the 
1980's, but what I see now is not the same all over. Civilian 
governments have done well in Chile and Argentina. Brazil had 
two consecutive failures: Jose Sarney struggled to finish his 
five-year term under the protection of Army Minister Leonidas 
Pires Goncalves, and Fernando Collor insulted the military as 
part of his campaign but ended up in the hands of the high 
military command. President Itamar Franco has cultivated 
friends among the military since he was a senator. Now he is in 
Planalto Palace he has showed that he likes to hand complicated 
problems to military men under the belief that they have the 
solutions. He appointed a retired colonel as the Federal Police 
chief and an active duty general to head the Sudene [Northeast 
Development Superintendency]. 
  If all civilians are convinced that military interventions 
are history, why then is the IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and 
Statistics Institute] measuring the popularity of the Armed 
Forces? Is it because part of the population says it trusts the 
military more than it trusts Congress? There is ambiguity among 
civilians and also among the military. But there is also 
clearness in the two sectors. This is why there are civilians 
who want to know if [PT presidential candidate] Lula da Silva 
will be installed if he wins the elections, and if he will be 
allowed to govern afterwards. (The answer from the military is 
yes but the problem is not in the answer but in the question). 
In a speech late last year, General Leonel spoke in a 
threatening way about "the rage of the Roman Legions." The 
general was asked what he meant. He put on a mysterious smile 
and employed a phrase commonly used in military schools to force 
students to think at least twice: "Interpretation is part of the 
question." 
  Military affairs experts believe this sort of behavior is 
no secret. Most current active duty generals were at the rank 
of captain in 1964. They have spent the following 20 years 
saluting their superiors who, in fact, assumed the leadership 
under the military regime. It would be stupid to imagine they 
were against what was happening. During a lecture entitled "The 
Shadow of the Generals" at the Brasilia University, Professor 
Luiz Felipe Miguel examined 1,693 articles written and published 
by officers in military publications between 1964 and 1991. He 
came to the following conclusion: "Contrary to what some authors 
contend, Brazilian military officers still believe in their 
tutelage over Brazilian politics." The fact that this ideology 
still prevails does not mean that one day it may be put into 
practice. 
<H5>  The Dog and the Thief </H5>
  With an annual budget of $2.1 billion, the Brazilian Armed 
Forces are facing their worst crisis ever. Salaries are low and 
the equipment is getting rusty. Civilians rather than military 
men need to determine what is essential. Rather than knowing 
what is spent on the Armed Forces, it should be determined why 
-- and how many -- soldiers, generals, tanks, and corvettes are 
needed. During almost half a century of the Cold War, the 
Brazilian Armed Forces mainly focused activities on the struggle 
against the "internal enemy." The situation now is quite 
different. Military colleges are eliminating specific courses 
on so-called revolutionary movements. The focus of attention has 
shifted. Military men are concerned about the Amazon Region 
because they suspect anthropologists and missionaries may be the 
spearheads of foreign interests thirsty for the region's wealth. 
Another subject are the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro, where 
crime and unrest may lead to what their textbooks call 
"convulsions," which has replaced ideology as the favorite 
doctrine of the textbook of past decades. 
  It is ironical that, following the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall, war has merely changed its status. Minister Zenildo 
Lucena asserts that "what used to be called the new 
international order has become a great disorder." Armed Forces 
commanders are aware that, compared with other world powers, 
Brazilian military inferiority is as great or even greater than 
during the 1950's when Brazilian soldiers trained with mules 
while the United States was studying nuclear war tactics. Navy 
Public Relations Commander Kleber de Assis, describes the 
situation: "The Brazilian Armed Forces should be like a dog in 
the back yard. The dog will do nothing most of the time, but it 
is there, ready to chase away a thief. We do not have anything 
like that now." 
  From the economic viewpoint, the Armed Forces are as badly 
off as Brazil. They are enduring the worse crisis in their 
history. Since Brazil's independence, the portion of the budget 
earmarked for the Armed Forces has never been as small as now -- 
less than 3 percent. Comparing this with the GDP of other 
countries one can see that the Brazilian Army spends, 
relatively, less than Peru or Argentina, let alone the developed 
countries. Although more than 100,000 Brazilians do compulsory 
military service every year, the daily activities of the Armed 
Forces are a mystery to most citizens; but at least one aspect 
is no mystery. 
  The 350,000 military men protest the lack of money, closely 
watch with certain unrest the scandals in the political field, 
discuss the presidential succession and -- wracked by the 5,000 
percent annual inflation like all 150 million Brazilian citizens 
-- can confirm that living conditions are atrocious. The higher 
echelons, which continue to be served decently by their 
subordinates, enjoy their customary comfort although even they 
complain: "In the past I was able to change my car every year, 
now I have something to drive only because my mother-in-law 
helped me buy a second-hand Monza," commented Vice Admiral 
Eugenio Carme Ribeiro, 58, commander of the 6,590-strong Marine 
Corps, one of the most prestigious in the Navy. 
  The situation among the lower ranks is even worse. Of the 
nine FAB [Brazilian Air Force] sergeants at an Air Force base in 
the northern region of the country, six are taking evening 
courses so that they can change their professions. Two are 
studying economics, two are studying accountancy, one is 
studying business management, and the sixth is studying 
medicine. At the end of the afternoon, when he leaves the 
barracks in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, 1,000 km from Manaus, an 
Army corporal goes to his second job. Video camera in hand, he 
covers baptisms, birthdays, and weddings. He works on weekends 
as a DJ at a modest but lively local discotheque. At the Rio de 
Janeiro Military Village, which houses the largest number of 
servicemen in the country -- some 25,000 officers and 
noncommissioned officers from the three Armed Forces branches -- 
many houses have signs offering other services such as private 
tutoring, manicure, car and house appliance repairs, home-made 
sweets, and even fortune-telling. 
  The similarities with life outside the barracks end there. 
The Army, Navy and Air Force are part of the Armed Forces, but 
they are quite different from each other. Two thirds of all 
uniformed personnel are assigned to the Army, the rest are 
divided between the Air Force and the Navy, with the Air Force 
having a slight advantage. More numerous, and with troops 
scattered throughout large urban centers, the Army has always 
had greater political importance. The Army proclaimed the 
Republic, supplied the cadres for the 1930 Revolution, organized 
the FEB [Brazilian Expeditionary Force] in World War II, 
supported and ousted Getulio Vargas, and imposed all the 
presidents during the 1964 regime. Today people look to the 
Army to learn the political mood of the military. 
  The military live in a closed and conservative world. They 
agree with the CUT [Sole Workers Center] and the PT in 
criticizing the privatization process, but they do not share the 
same ideology. According to a current military view, the PT's 
acceptance among the military is similar to that which it enjoys 
outside the barracks. The following is a good yardstick: Two 
tickets are disputing the elections at the Military Club which 
groups 22,000 active duty and reserve members; both tickets have 
adopted an anti-Lula stand. Another sign: Nilton Cerqueira, a 
general who headed the Military Club for two consecutive terms 
and who had the backing of the CUT to promote debates on 
state-run companies, is campaigning for PP [Popular Party] 
Deputy Alvaro Dias. The military world tends to safeguard its 
values just as it replaces its servicemen. The large majority 
of those who today follow a military career have a father who 
served in the barracks -- the ratio is six out of every 10 among 
some in the Agulhas Negras Military Academy where the Army 
trains its lieutenants. But because salaries are low, it is not 
the sons of high-ranking officers who follow the military 
career. The majority are sons of sergeants and noncommissioned 
officers who will assume the Armed Forces command in the future. 
  It is true that a military career never enjoyed much 
prestige 
among families with a strong patrimony. During the 19th 
century, the aristocracy looked on military men with disdain. 
Historians allege Emperor Pedro II used a cruel definition when 
referring to the troops parading through Rio de Janeiro on their 
return from the war with Paraguay: "Legal Assassins." But there 
have always been young recruits from well-to-do families, with a 
vast educational background and access to a wider world. This 
situation is disappearing because a military career is less 
appealing. If this trend grows, it will have a fatal effect on 
how the military view themselves, and society. They are already 
living in a very enclosed world of their own without being 
further isolated. 
<H5>  Captain and Confectioner </H5>
  It is a fact that military life is defined by hierarchy. 
Soldiers, corporals, and sergeants do not mix with officers. 
They do not eat the same food, they do not visit the same 
places, or swim in the same pool. Those who enter as recruits 
can only be promoted two ranks, reaching sergeant. They remain 
in that rank for the rest of their service life. Officers 
graduate from military academies, which offer university level 
courses. The first two promotions, to the level of major, are a 
cinch. From there on, the chances narrow. Less than half of a 
group of 100 lieutenants will be promoted to colonel, and only 
five will be promoted to general. Of this number and after 40 
years in the military career, on average, only one will receive 
the four stars that signify the top-ranking post, that of Army 
general. 
  After that tiring race, the great winner, his excellency 
the Army general, will earn less than 1 million real cruzeiros 
per month. His earnings are one quarter of what a Supreme Court 
justice earns and less than half the 2.5 million real cruzeiros 
that senators and deputies earn. As you go down the echelon of 
command the cases become more dramatic: Air Force Captain Mauro 
Pimentel, 35, who took special computer courses in the United 
States, makes extra money by selling candies in a small shop in 
partnership with his brother near the Rio de Janeiro Military 
Village. He said: "If I did not have that business I would be 
living in a shantytown." In the Air Force that captain gets 
500,000 real cruzeiros per month, selling candies he makes twice 
as much. 
  Sergeant Josue Carvalho of the Marine Corps is at the 
garrison from 0800 until 1600. From 1700 until 0100 he repairs 
television sets in the neighborhood. He said: "In the garrison 
I have work for two days per week," adding: "The remaining days 
I just kill time." What is happening with the military is like 
what is happening to public service doctors who, forced to take 
other jobs, see patients waiting in line, and even see patients 
die waiting in line. The same occurs with teachers who are so 
badly paid that state schools are only able to recruit the worst 
of each group. 
  The Armed Forces have the daily routine of bureaucracy like 
any other job. Most wait for a promotion to improve their 
standards of living, make an effort to educate their children, 
and protect their retirement. Then there are talented ones, 
brown-nosers, idiots, and ones with a refined intellect. 
Between these extremes is a majority where mediocrity prevails 
just like in any community. But military men have some traits. 
"Those who chose a military career want job security," said 
Luiz Fernando Peixoto, cabinet chief under Navy Minister Ivan 
Serpa. He added: "They know the country might be burning but 
their salary is guaranteed at the end of the month." Like 
priests enjoy security, echelons of command, and decisions 
within rigid lines, no one joins the Armed Forces with a desire 
for adventure. No one gets rich or famous in the Army. Life 
was always modest and in some cases even hard. Life can even be 
unbearable for many civilians called for mandatory military 
service. 
  Last year the Army called 1,013 students trained in 
medicine, 
133 pharmacists, and 82 veterinarians for temporary service as 
lieutenants in the Training Center for Reserve Officers, CPOR. 
One of them was student Ricardo Migueis who was raised in 
Leblon. He was sent to Querari with an Amazon platoon on the 
border with Colombia. He lived in a wooden barracks with Indian 
huts as neighbors and a reservoir where the soldiers could swim. 
Contact with the outside world was by a plane that came once a 
month. Lieutenant Ricardo Migueis took care of sick soldiers and 
Indians. This is his story: 
  The worse part was the initial phase of the training that 
lasted 45 days. We ate monkey and alligator meat. One 
colleague could not stand the burden. He suffered a crisis, 
burst into tears, and went out of control for 24 hours. He was 
discharged. Another one broke his leg during the hardest 
exercise. He was hospitalized for treatment but escaped from 
the hospital. He was later found in Minas Gerais but was able 
to get his discharge. A border platoon is in the middle of the 
jungle, far from everything. There is no place for fun. He who 
is not married has no way of finding a girlfriend. Soldiers 
suffer a lot. Care should always be taken in the hospital ward. 
They break in at night to steal alcohol. There is also a lot 
of red tape, you must get authorization for everything. If 
there is a patient in serious condition and an urgent trip must 
be made, it cannot be done without authorization. 
<H5>  Colonial Vietnam </H5>
  Researchers believe the Brazilian Army was created in the 
17th Century, during the war to expell the Dutch. These were 
not movie-type attractive battles. The Portuguese Crown troops 
were joined by blacks headed by Henrique Dias and Indians with 
bow and arrows headed by Felipe Camarao, and this is how, like 
in a colonial Vietnam, the main world power of that time was 
defeated. Without money and unequipped, the Brazilian troops 
sustained a harsh blow from [Paraguayan President Marshal 
Francisco] Solano Lopez' soldiers at the beginning of the war 
with Paraguay. They represented the country in World War I, 
with tragic consequences. The lack of medical assistance was 
such that soldiers sent to the battle fields did not die from 
being shot in the trenches but rather on their way there due to 
the Spanish flu epidemic. The Brazilian Armed Forces have made 
a lot of progress but are still far from what the leadership 
aspires. Money is their biggest problem. 
  Defense rather than combat strategies are currently 
discussed 
at the Brazilian military academies where the great ally of the 
past is regarded as the possible enemy for the future. Many 
military men believe the wealth of the Amazon attracts the greed 
of great powers such as the United States. Under an extreme 
situation, those countries may promote an intervention under the 
pretext of fighting drug trafficking and defending the 
indigenous reservations. This is why Brazilian military men 
regard with suspicion the U.S. military maneuvers on the border. 
The truth is that if one of those attacks which foreigners like 
to plan were to materialize -- attacks which are in reality only 
imaginary -- the frail Brazilian defense system would be unable 
to even leave its post. Modestly speaking, Brazil is just one 
of several countries in a similar, or even worse, situation. 
Mexico, for example, whose Armed Forces only have strategies to 
confront the ragged Zapatists or an unlikely conflict with its 
southern neighbor, the minute Guatemala. As for its? northern 
neighbor, it has come to a hard but realistic conclusion. The 
difference is so great that, in the case of a more and more 
unlikely U.S. invasion following NAFTA, the Mexican Army would 
just wait and see what it can do. Military men, naturally aware 
of a Third, or even Fourth World apparatus, use this negative 
aspect as the great excuse to demand a bit more from the Federal 
Treasury, at least to keep up appearances. 
<H5>  Lead Pellets </H5>
  The problem in Brazil today is that, if everything continues 
unchanged, the country must be told that the Armed Forces have 
become the Disarmed Forces. The state of the equipment is 
pitiful, although nobody expects to find Tomahawk missiles -- 
the great attraction of the Persian Gulf War -- on a Brazilian 
ship. Not just because they are not available locally but also 
because each missile costs $15 million. Neither can one expect 
the rifles to be fitted overnight with infra-red equipment that 
enables enemy targets to be hit in complete darkness. British 
soldiers had these during the Malvinas War, which helped them 
hit Argentine soldiers who did not even know where the shots 
came from. 
  Brazilian military men believe, however, that some urgent 
improvements must be made. The Army would be much better off if 
it had a group of well-trained and equipped troops capable of 
immediate action anywhere in the country that has a 7,400 km 
borderline and 10 neighboring countries. Of the 235,000 Army 
troops, only some 20,000 to 25,000 are capable of this. Not 
much more is necessary. Some 50,000 men would be better but 
40,000 would do. Minister Zenildo Lucena explains: "Nobody 
considers having an expensive Army under the present situation 
in the country." There could be more resources for training 
purposes: The artillery for its cannon training uses the same 
lead pellets used for the compressed-air rifles at fun fairs. 
This is not so bad because they are excellent for training the 
soldiers to improve their aim. They are also cheap. A single 
real cannon shot costs some $5,000. One must pretend that it is 
the genuine thing. 
  The other Armed Forces branches are no better off because 
they are paying the price of a common heritage. They were 
prepared for the Cold War years when it was thought the 
Brazilian Armed Forces would mainly be used to assist the United 
States in an eventual conflict with the USSR. This theory has 
disappeared and we are facing a situation of men and equipment 
trained to fight a nonexistent enemy. But now they are not even 
equipped to fight any adversaries that may (eventually) 
materialize. 
<H5>  Solo Flights </H5>
  The Navy's problems start with its main ship, the aircraft 
carrier Minas Gerais. A relic of the British Navy, this 
aircraft carrier was refurbished upon its arrival at the 
Brazilian shipyards to fulfill a specific mission: To defend the 
Brazilian coast from an eventual attack by the Soviet submarine 
fleet. In view of this, the Minas Gerais only carries slow and 
heavy planes, those used to search and hit underwater targets. 
The Minas Gerais is equipped with missiles to attack 
approaching planes, but it is unable to transport light planes 
capable of confronting an enemy squadron at a safe distance so 
that the ship may not be damaged. 
  Former Navy Minister Admiral Maximiano da Fonseca said: "The 
Minas Gerais is in no condition to enter war, because it would 
have to be defended." The other ships are in a similar 
situation. Six frigates acquired 20 years ago from England were 
also outfitted to combat Russian submarines in the Cold War navy 
battle, but today they would be unable to defend themselves from 
bombs dropped from a small plane. They were already old when 
they were bought in 1973. The majority are 50 years old. The 
useful life of a vessel of this kind does not surpass two or 
three decades. 
  The Air Force is facing similar problems, but more centered 
on volume. The Navy is at least able to place its entire fleet 
at sea to conduct exercises. Like the Army it has sufficient 
resources to feed its troops. Although far from being a 
five-star meal, a military meal consisting of rice, black beans, 
salad and either beef, fish, or chicken: It would not fair too 
badly in a food tasting contest with factory restaurants. The 
Air Force business hours start at 1300 so as to save money on 
meals. For lack of money for fuel, half of its pilots will not 
fly this year. Those who do will fly museum pieces. The 
Mirages are so old the manufacturer has ceased to produce the 
spare parts essential for their maintenance. The AMX is a good 
plane, but it was also conceived for the Cold War. 
<H5>  Stigmatized </H5>
  The combination of low salaries and outdated equipment 
worthy 
of a scrap yard is a pothole among intense dissatisfactions. 
The most noteworthy fact on the condition of the military today 
is the feeling of loss of prestige, both socially and 
materially. Until recently, military men were entitled to a 
bonus for the number of flight hours they flew, no matter the 
nature of the mission or its priority. They only had to buckle 
their safety belts and wait for the bonus to pay their bills at 
the end of the month. This privilege has been cut. They were 
also able to transform state-run companies into beautiful job 
sources. A colonel went into the reserves, and in addition to 
his retirement pension, received a second salary running in the 
millions. When a general did not receive his fourth star, he 
was appointed vice chairman of an industry as a consolation 
prize. These times are over. 
  Military men view the constitutional revision with 
reservation because they fear the situation will deteriorate 
even further. They fear their pensions will be placed under the 
jurisdiction of the miserable INSS [National Social Security 
Institute]. Although a military man's salary is bad, pensions 
are optimum. They receive their full salaries and a retirement 
bonus. When he goes into the reserves, a military man is 
entitled to the benefits of the next highest rank when he was on 
active duty. A captain becomes a major, a colonel becomes a 
general, and so on. Thus, the average pension of military men 
is about 14 minimum salaries, 10 times more than the pensions a 
common mortal receives from the INSS. 
  Military men feel stigmatized by the press, disdained by a 
good majority of cultured people, and mistreated by the 
administration they serve. The majority feels that if pros and 
cons were placed on the scale, their 20-year period in power was 
positive. They believe the term "military dictatorship" is 
offensive. They think those who use the term "military regime" 
are committing an indiscretion; and when they talk to civilians 
they tolerate as bearable the definition "authoritarian period." 
They detest being reminded of what they did wrong -- the 
suppression of individual freedoms, censorship, and the missing 
-- but love to remember what they did well. In fact, it was an 
Army School, the Engineering Military Institute, that drafted 
the project to establish a more modern telecommunications 
infrastructure in the country, better than that of our 
neighbors. They are proud of the growth rates during the 
miracle period, the low inflation rate that prevailed at the 
time, and job expansion. (Never mention the foreign debt hike, 
please) 
<H5>  Cheaper labor </H5>
  The military men of the 1964 regime may be accused of having 
turned a blind eye to the underworld of civilian deals made 
under their noses. They fought the corruption of their 
political enemies but remained impassive to the dirty money of 
their friends. However, when they retired it was obvious that 
none of them had amassed great amounts of money. Some sectors 
of the Armed Forces reveal an unusual competence in the state 
apparatus. They are capable of establishing and fulfilling 
long-term projects. Compared to the public enterprises that do 
not even inform the president of the Republic about their 
workers's salaries, they are disciplined and have a great 
working capacity. People can say what they like about the 
Brazilian war industry -- it is expensive, subsidized, 
anachronistic -- but the fact is, that when they built this 
industry, the military made it the fifth largest of its kind in 
the world. Some may feel that the research carried out by the 
Navy is a waste of time and money but its laboratories, which 
even produce artificial sweeteners for the admirals' coffee, has 
managed to master the uranium enrichment technology and is now 
working on a nuclear-propelled submarine. 
  The Armed Forces, as if they felt they must justify their 
existence at any cost, currently engage in activities that have 
nothing to do with the military world. In Parana the Army is 
involved in an old railway project, the Ferroeste, to transport 
soybean through the state. A consortium of private enterprises 
wanted $300 million to build a portion of the railway line. It 
was established that two engineering battalions could do the job 
for $200 million and the deal was closed. The project is doing 
well. The price quoted by the construction companies was 
undoubtedly abusive but the project in Parana begs the question: 
Does the country needs the Armed Forces just because there are 
not enough trains to transport soybean. Rio de Janeiro is 
another example. 
  The city loved the tanks and rifles that guaranteed the 
normal development of ECO-92 [UN sponsored environmental 
conference]. The 7,000 inhabitants of the Roquette Pinto 
shantytown now celebrate the presence of 20-men patrols from a 
nearby battalion that several times a day visit the town. The 
shantytown dwellers were registered and those who did not have 
an identity card were given one. A mother care unit that was 
not operating was reformed and a health unit with three military 
physicians and three dentists will be established. Roquette 
Pinto, which in the past was a drug traffickers and consumption 
center, has now become a peaceful area. 
  There was probably no alternative. Last October, shots from 
Roquette Pinto hit the barracks. It is obvious this is not a 
solution because Army soldiers are not trained to deal with the 
civilian population, their idea of discipline cannot be applied 
to the daily activities of a common citizen and experience has 
proven that they can end up involved with local delinquency or 
cause tragedies among well intentioned people. This was the 
case in Volta Redonda when Army troops called to intervene a 
workers' strike ended in the death of three workers of the 
plant. Or, under the 1964 regime, when officers assumed the 
work of Interior Ministry agents and ended up stained by the 
habit of beating up students who were handcuffed. 
  Last week in Rio de Janeiro, members of the Army Police [PE] 
occupied the Rio de Janeiro-Niteroi bridge which had been 
blocked by a demonstration against the constitutional revision. 
Fearing a demonstration that could upset the city, Governor 
Leonel Brizola requested the PE's intervention. Brizola 
withdrew his request when he realized that the PM [Military 
Police] could control a few demonstrators but it was too late. 
General Bayma Denis, the Military Command of the East 
commander, did not withdraw the soldiers. The traffic began to 
circulate a few minutes later but a true political uncertainty 
was experienced: Knowing who is the real boss in the portion of 
the Guanabara Bay between Rio de Janeiro and Niteroi. 
<H5>  Funds and Mentality </H5>
  If the military are not supposed to replace contractors, 
play 
the role of police, or much less, control transit, what should 
they do? That is the question. If they exist to fulfill the 
functions defined by the Constitution, like preserving internal 
and external security -- always "at the request" of one of the 
branches of government -- it is true that the Armed Forces are 
not only poorly paid, they also improperly spend the scarce 
funds that they receive. There is an excessive number of 
personnel at higher levels. In several garrisons, there are 
generals doing the work of colonels. There is an excessive 
number of intermediate officers whose duties are almost 
decorative and who repeat to their subordinates the instructions 
they received from their superiors. A fax machine would be 
cheaper and without the risk of making a mistake. It is a 
closed system in which even a citizen without any devotion or 
capacity for the job can stay, earn some promotions, and after a 
career with job stability, can retire without any shock. If the 
Army needs only 50,000 well-trained men to cope with any 
emergency, why does it keep 235,000 soldiers in the barracks? 
And why are the majority of the troops of the three forces in 
large urban centers, when all three have defined the Amazonas 
region as their main priority? 
  There is a problem involving funds, but there is also a 
problem of mentality. This is a debate that has not been held 
in Brazil for a long time, a debate on a project for Brazil. 
The Armed Forces are not surviving in an empty environment, as 
if they lived alone. They are an instrument of a country that 
has specific objectives and priorities, and established values 
imposed at the various levels of the state. Despite wrongdoings 
in the economy, democracy became mature through the dismissal of 
a corrupt president and the self- purge of the Budget CPI. Now 
is a good moment for a needed debate on what the country expects 
from its Armed Forces. Even they would like very much to see 
the matter clarified.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent William Waack in Berlin] </F>
  [Text] Germany is prepared to renounce its nuclear 
agreement with Brazil, suspend any transfer of high technology 
(including that for submarines and space exploration), and 
withdraw its support for the Brazilian candidacy to a permanent 
seat in the future UN Security Council unless the Brazilian 
Senate ratifies those treaties whereby Brazilian nuclear 
activities are subjected to international inspections and 
controls. The governments of Brazil and Germany are concerned 
about the Senate's position, which could markedly undermine the 
visit Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will make to Bonn 
late this month. 
  The main items on the agenda of Brazilian-German relations 
-- 
including technological cooperation to be implemented by the 
private sector -- now depends on the position of the Brazilian 
Government on the subject of nonproliferation of nuclear 
technology. In Bonn, the seat of the German Government, there 
exists the conviction that the overall credibility of the German 
foreign policy -- especially in the eyes of its western 
counterparts -- would be jeopardized if it does not discontinue 
every form of cooperation on advanced technology with Brazil 
should the Brazilian Senate fail to ratify two treaties: One 
containing amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty (which bans 
nuclear weapons in Latin America and establishes controls) and a 
quadripartite agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the 
(Vienna-based) International Atomic Energy Agency, and by the 
recently created joint Brazilian-Argentine agency (which 
establishes comprehensive inspections and controls on nuclear 
activities by the two countries, which are described as "full 
scope safeguards." [given in English]) 
  German laws require that the Brazilian-German nuclear 
agreement signed in June 1976 be renounced, regardless of which 
party is in the government at the end of this year (general 
elections are scheduled for 16 October). Through this 
agreement, Brazil gained access to various stages of the nuclear 
fuel cycle, in addition to obtaining technological transfer and 
to reaching a commitment to build two large nuclear reactors 
(Angra-2 and Angra-3). The German Government cannot cooperate 
with a country which is not a signatory of the Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) -- which is the case of Brazil -- or which has not 
agreed to another international control regime. Unless it is 
rescinded by either of the two parties, the agreement will be 
automatically renewed at the end of 1994 for another five years. 
  To maintain its credibility, the German Government is 
prepared to go as far as shouldering the financial consequences 
of reneging the contracts to build the Angra-2 plant, which is 
guaranteed by the Hermes insurance company (that is, German 
taxpayers may lose hundreds of millions of marks). 
  There is adequate parliamentary support for the government 
to take such a decisive course of action. An influential group 
of Social Democratic deputies has been campaigning since last 
year to get the nuclear agreement renounced on the grounds that 
Brazil has failed to join the NPT and that it refuses to submit 
its activities to international inspection. Most conservative 
deputies of the ruling German party (the Christian Democratic 
Union) firmly believe that "if the price to pay to secure a 
permanent seat for Germany on the UN Security Council is to 
support irresponsible countries like Brazil or Nigeria, it would 
be a very high price to pay," as a leading spokesman for the 
Christian Democratic bloc recently put it to a ranking Brazilian 
counterpart in Bonn. 
  The German reaction to the Brazilian Senate's behavior has 
been unanimously conveyed by several German circles, the private 
sector included. "Brazil will not receive a single screw from 
Germany if the Senate fails to ratify these treaties," is a 
widely repeated phrase. The campaign on the nuclear issue has 
already had an impact on other sectors: A visit to Germany 
scheduled for February by a Brazilian delegation has been 
canceled without clear explanations. This delegation was to have 
studied the impact of Brazil's proclaimed decision to join the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (its English acronym is MTCR) 
on Brazilian-German space exploration projects, which is being 
partially implemented by a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. 
According to a high-placed source in Bonn, Siemens executives 
have also voiced concern about the fact that the Brazilian 
Senate is provoking a situation which in practice will preclude 
any advanced technology transfer to Brazil. 
  Brazil is on the "H list" (from which Argentina has just 
been 
excluded), which forces any German exporter or supplier of 
sensitive technology item to Brazil to obtain special 
authorizations before concluding any deal. It has been stated 
in Bonn that if the Senate fails to accept international 
controls on Brazilian nuclear programs, the above requirement 
would also be applied to projects such as the transfer of 
technology for building conventional submarines. Yet, if the 
Senate ratifies these agreements, the German Government would be 
willing to consider building a nuclear powered submarine -- a 
major project of the Brazilian Navy -- as "a borderline case" 
not explicitly banned by the Tlatelolco Treaty or by the 
quadripartite treaty. This project may thus be continued. 
  There has been wide speculation and conjectures in Bonn 
about 
the existence of "skeletons in the closets" of the military; 
that is, about whether international inspection teams may yet 
find undisclosed atomic projects in Brazil. The German 
Government speculates as to whether the reasons behind 
nonratification is prompted by the Brazilian Senate's failure to 
understand that this is a far-reaching subject that it has many 
implications, or whether there are "other motives" for its 
reluctance to agree to the international inspections. In 
official and unofficial remarks, German officials have noted, 
however, that they have no indication to conclude that Brazil is 
running undisclosed parallel atomic programs. 
  The German Government is both perplexed and scared by 
Brazil. It has been openly contended here that a few powerful 
people are hurting the interests of the Brazilian nation in the 
name of "things of the past and of outdated positions," an 
argument that is often used to refer to the Brazilian Senate. 
Officially, the German Government is not supporting any country 
in the reorganization and (expansion) process of the UN Security 
Council. Informally, however, it is known that Bonn would 
support Brazil at the United Nations. Yet, this will 
fundamentally depend now on the nuclear issue. 
  German perplexity does not stem from the behavior of the 
legislature -- which is marred by corruption scandals -- alone 
but also from that of the executive branch. In Bonn, no one 
knows for sure whether the construction of Angra-2 will be 
completed. Wishing to conclude the project, the Germans have 
expressed desire to supply additional credit and even to finance 
Brazilian counterpart funds (nearly $750 million), arguing that 
it would be cheaper to complete the 1,300 megawatt plant now 
than to cancel the entire project. It is not known, however, 
what President Itamar Franco will decide. In 1978, Franco 
presided in the Senate a congressional investigating committee 
on the Brazilian-German nuclear agreement. 
  Another problem that scares many people in Germany is the 
fact that Brazil is having difficulties in obtaining agreement 
with the IMF, a condition for reaching an agreement with the 
Paris Club, which encompasses all of Brazilian governmental 
creditors. Germany is the main trade partner of Brazil within 
the European Union and it is the second leading investor of risk 
capital in Brazil, second only to the United States. The German 
Government is thus concerned about the constitutional revision 
because it believes foreign investors in Brazil are treated 
differently from or worse than domestic investors. 
  It has been noted in Bonn that German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel touched on all these topics during his visit to Brasilia 
in October. The Brazilian foreign minister's visit, which seeks 
to strengthen German-Brazilian relations, which was described as 
strategic for both countries (during the Geisel administration) 
could be seriously undermined if the Senate does not change its 
position. It is feared that Amorim may come to Bonn only to 
hear complaints, without being able to give any kind of 
explanation.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Foreign Minister Celso Amorim may 
postpone his trip to Germany, which was scheduled for the end of 
the month, following the delay by the Senate in ratifying 
international agreements on nuclear safeguard. O ESTADO has 
learned that the minister is not willing to be questioned by the 
German Government, which conditions participation in programs 
including the transfer of high technology to Brazilian 
guarantees that it will use nuclear energy only for peaceful 
purposes. 
  The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee must ratify amendments 
to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to the quadripartite agreement 
signed between Brazil, Argentina, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for 
Accounting and Control (ABACC). After months of negotiations, 
Senator Dirceu Carneiro (Brazilian Social Democracy Party - 
Santa Catarina), who coordinates the Committee's project for 
nuclear safeguard, endorsed on 3 February amendments to the text 
of the quadripartite agreement for the supervision of nuclear 
research in Brazil. The text, however, was not voted on for 
lack of quorum. There will probably be no quorum in the next 
meeting of the Committee, which will take place on 10 February, 
one day before the Carnival weekend begins. 
  Foreign Minister Amorim has not officially confirmed if he 
will postpone his trip. He admitted on 4 February, however, 
that he would like to continue negotiations with the German 
Government. He said: "It would be much better if I could take 
with me two ratified accords. Instead of being questioned about 
them, we would be free to begin talks about scientific 
cooperation and access to technology," adding: "I believe 
Congress is fulfilling its duty and analyzing the texts." The 
minister admitted that Germany may be "concerned" about possible 
consequences of a delay in ratifying these agreements. 
"Nonetheless, Germany is aware that the delay is not caused by 
lack of interest," he said.

  [Text] Brasilia, 9 Feb (AFP-NA) -- After introducing a 
controversial amendment, the Brazilian Senate today gave final 
approval to a quadripartite agreement with Argentina, the IAEA 
(International Atomic Energy Agency), and the ABAC 
(Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Material). 
  The document was approved after inclusion of the 
supplemental 
adjustments [ajustes subsidiarios] that already had been 
negotiated by Itamaraty and IAEA, which were imposed by senators 
who even threatened to reject the project. 
  The adjustments will preserve Brazilian technological 
secrets, but will permit special ABAC and IAEA inspections of 
any nuclear materials produced by Brazil. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who was fully satisfied with 
the agreement, will be able to travel to Bonn -- he will leave 
on 21 February on an official visit to Germany -- without 
fearing that his interlocutors may threaten to adopt retaliatory 
measures, which would have been likely had Brazil failed to 
ratify the agreement. 
  A report indicated that ABAC is making an inventory of 
Argentine and Brazilian nuclear facilities and materials, and 
the IAEA will make an inspection in the two countries within the 
next 60 days. 
  For Brazil, the ratification was something totally new 
because the country had never ratified a nuclear safeguard 
agreement. 
  The quadripartite agreement is broader than the Tlatelolco 
Treaty, which includes all Latin American countries. The voting 
on the ratification of this treaty had been postponed (perhaps 
for today or a date after Carnival). 
  Today's debate, which lasted more than two hours, developed 
after a Senate request for an amendment, which was finally 
approved and establishes that "all changes to supplemental 
adjustments will be approved by Congress."

  [Text] Managua, 9 Feb (AFP) -- On Wednesday the Nicaraguan 
Army ordered an end to military operations in the northern part 
of the country, as requested Tuesday by leaders of the so-called 
recontras, thus paving the way for the culmination of the 
national peace process, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has 
announced. 
  The truce will be effective only in the northern region of 
the country where the recontras operate, Mendieta said minutes 
after opening a meeting attended by ranking chiefs of the Army, 
the Government Ministry, and the Catholic Church, as well as 
representatives of the OAS International Support and 
Vertification Commission (CIAV). The meeting will study a 
disarmament proposal submitted last Thursday by the Catholic 
Church and writer Pablo Antonio Cuadra, director of LA PRENSA, 
which is owned by President Violeta de Chamorro. 
  Last evening the so-called recontras announced a unilateral 
cease-fire and requested assistance in evacuating their wounded, 
one week after the Church announced its peace plan.

  [Text] Managua, 9 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- General Humberto 
Ortega, chief of the Nicaraguan Army, announced today the 
cessation of military operations against the so-called 3-80 
Northern Front of the Nicaraguan "recontras" to allow the rebels 
a "short period" to disarm. The announcement was made at the 
end of a meeting attended by Gen. Ortega; Government Minister 
Alfredo Mendieta; Sergio Caramagna, coordinator of the 
International Support and Vertification Commission of the OAS 
(CIAV-OAS); and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, representative of the 
Nicaraguan Catholic Church. 
  The decision to temporarily suspend the military offensive 
is 
designed to allow the peace commission, comprised of 
representatives of the Catholic Church and the CIAV-OAS, to 
contact the rebel leaders so that disarmament can begin quickly, 
Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta explained. 
  The truce "only covers the operational area" of the 3-80 
Northern Front led by former contra Jose Angel Talavera, alias 
"Chacal," Ortega said, after noting that the order took effect 
at 0001 (0501 GMT) Wednesday [9 February]. He added that in the 
rest of the country, where some rearmed groups and common 
criminals are active, military operations will continue to 
preserve the "security" of the citizens. "If the negotiations 
(for disarmament) fail, the offensive will continue," Ortega 
said. 
  The "recontras" had announced a unilateral cease-fire 
effective tomorrow, Thursday, as a "goodwill gesture" to seek 
peace and a negotiated solution to the armed conflict in 
northern Nicaragua. 
  Gen. Ortega, who did not indicate exactly what territory 
will 
be covered by the military truce, said this will allow the 
evacuation of "recontras" wounded in the recent fighting who 
have not yet received medical attention and have been caught in 
the crossfire. 
  The armed group led by "Chacal" operates principally in the 
mountains of Quilali Municipality in Nueva Segovia Department on 
the Honduran border. 
  "This truce sets a reasonable term in which the date for 
disarmament (of the `recontras') can be established, which we 
hope will be done as quickly as possible," Mendieta added, after 
noting that the government will guarantee the lives and security 
of rebels who lay down their weapons and rejoin civilian life. 
Mendieta insisted "there will be no political-type 
negotiations" with leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front for the 
disarmament and demobilization of the recontras and that the 
government "is ready to start responding to their social 
demands." "I believe this is the best chance we have of solving 
the armed conflict and of peacefully resolving problems," 
Minister Mendieta said. 
  For his part, Sergio Caramagna, the CIAV-OAS coordinator in 
Nicaragua, said that in the coming hours they will attempt to 
contact "recontra" leaders to convey the government's proposal 
in an effort to end the armed conflict in the north. Caramanga 
also announced that he is taking a letter from Gen. Ortega to 
the "recontras" in which the military chief explains the 
facilities that will be extended for their disarmament in order 
that the "tragedy" being experienced by people in that part of 
the country may end soon. 
  According to the Army, the 3-80 Northern Front led by 
"Chacal," one of the most belligerent armed groups, is made up 
of 400 recontras, although a similar number of armed groups and 
common criminals operate within the country. 
  The phenomenon of the "recontras" began in 1991, after the 
government failed to provide several thousands of the 22,000 
demobilized "contras" with the means for rejoining civilian life.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Last night the 3-80 Northern Front decreed a 
unilateral cease-fire in an attempt to stop the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] military offensive and seek what could be the 
last chance for a negotiated solution to the conflict. 
  The notification arrived at the CIAV-OAS [OAS International 
Commission of Support and Verification], while Esteli Bishop 
Abelardo Mata and writer Pablo Antonio Cuadra finalized the 
details of the meeting to be held this morning with General 
Ortega and Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta. 
  The handwritten communique, signed by "Esteban, Piloto, 
Martin Negro, and Chacalin," is addressed to CIAV coordinator 
Sergio Caramagna and Bishop Mata. 
  "We hereby officially report that as of 10 February 94 the 
3-80 Northern Front halts or suspends its military operations 
and (decrees) a cease-fire as a goodwill gesture for attaining 
peace and seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict," says 
the main part of the communique. 
  Bishop Mata said that this goodwill gesture from "the boys" 
of the 3-80 should be answered with a similar gesture by 
government authorities, who will meet this morning with the 
bishop and Pablo Antonio Cuadra. 
<H5>  EPS Reacts Favorably </H5>
  EPS spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock reacted 
positively to the announcement of the cease-fire by the 
irregulars. 
  "We applaud any initiative that implies an immediate 
disarming without political conditions," said the military 
spokesman. Wheelock agreed in that mechanisms must be 
implemented to protect those who surrender their weapons. 
  "This is the result of the EPS activity; two weeks ago the 
members of the 3-80 spoke differently and their demands were 
purely political. Now we see a radical change in their 
positions," added Wheelock. 
  One of the most urgent demands from the members of the 
Northern Front is the evacuation of an undetermined number of 
wounded who, according to the bishop of Esteli, "could die or be 
left disabled." 
<H5>  Important Meeting Today </H5>
  The military spokesman said the Army could collaborate in 
the 
evacuation, as he has been informed that there are many 
irregulars wounded. 
  Today at 1100, the Commission of the Cardinal and the 
CIAV-OAS will meet with Gen. Humberto Ortega and Government 
Minister Alfredo Mendieta. 
  A high-ranking government source told BARRICADA that "at 
that 
meeting, important decisions will be made to attain peace in 
that region." 
  On the other hand, the National Assembly ordered the Human 
Rights Commission to implement the necessary initiatives in 
order to make possible a conclusion of the conflict in the short 
term. 
  Carlos Gallo, president of the Human Rights Commission, and 
Deputy Anibal Martinez held a quick meeting with Bishop Mata and 
the coordinator of the CIAV-OAS to learn of the positions of the 
rearmed irregulars. 
  Gallo said it is possible that during the meeting with 
Minister Mendieta the parliamentary commission may ask the 
government to cease the Armed Forces' military operations. 
  "It would be a cease-fire that would become a lasting 
disarmament, not an unending exchange of opinions as has 
happened in previous months," added Gallo. 
  In the morning hours of 8 February, Bishop Mata had leveled 
serious charges against the EPS, which he accused of human 
rights violations against the peasant population during its 
operations in persecution of the "recontras."

  [Excerpt] President Violeta de Chamorro brought a message 
of peace and reconciliation to the municipalities of San 
Francisco, Santo Tomas, and San Pedro de Lovago in Chontales 
Department, where she inaugurated various projects. Mrs. 
Chamorro issued an appeal to the irregulars, urging them to lay 
down their weapons and work in peace and tranquillity. 
  During the ceremony at Santo Tomas inaugurating six blocks 
which had been newly paved, President Chamorro said her 
government is currently studying the proposal presented by poet 
Pablo Antonio Cuadra and Cardinal Obando y Bravo in connection 
with the situation prevailing in the northern part of the 
country. She said similar proposals were presented in due time 
by the government and, in fact, it has offered various 
amnesties. Nevertheless, she said, certain groups are still up 
in arms. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] I ask them to lay put down their 
weapons and seek a way to work in peace and tranquillity. [end 
recording] 
  Referring to the Army's presence in the northern part of the 
country, Mrs. Chamorro said that farmers have requested this. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] I know many of the farmers -- for 
example, local farmers -- have asked me to send the Army, to 
send people to control the situation so they may work, produce, 
ship their coffee harvest, and ship everything. That is why the 
Army is there and that is why the police and everyone else are 
there -- so that farmers may ship their harvests. [end

  [Text] Former President Daniel Ortega recognized the 
decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton to suspend the trade 
embargo on Vietnam that had been in effect since 1975 and called 
on the U.S. President to follow suit with the people of Cuba. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] What has happened? Despite the 
embargo and the blockade, Vietnam continued to grow and develop. 
Finally, in an intelligent and courageous measure -- we must 
recognize this -- U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to lift 
the trade embargo on Vietnam. We are now sending a message to 
President Clinton telling him that we recognize his courageous 
action of bringing justice to the Vietnam case because U.S. 
policy was unfair as long as the embargo and blockade were 
maintained. 
  We recognize President Clinton's courageous act because 
there 
are extremists in the United States who are already criticizing 
him for lifting the embargo against Vietnam. We also tell 
President Clinton that just as he was brave enough to lift the 
embargo on Vietnam, he must have the courage to lift the embargo 
on Cuba, because that is a real disgrace to the policy of U.S. 
leaders. [applause] [end recording] 
  The United States imposed the trade embargo on Vietnam in 
1975, when U.S. troops were defeated by the Vietnamese people.

  [Report by Cristobal Sauceda for "The Morning Paper" 
newscast] 
  [Text] Supreme Court Chief Justice Miguel Angel Rivera 
Portillo has broken his silence, in the wake of the strong 
criticism of the Judicial Branch made by the U.S. State 
Department in a special report that alleges the Honduran justice 
is weak, politicized, and corrupt. The chief justice indicated 
efforts are being made to improve implementation of the law. If 
necessary, changes will be made, even if it means removing 
judges who do not adhere to the letter of the law. Let us 
listen to Rivera. 
  [Begin recording] [Rivera] We would have to analyze the 
whole 
document to see to what they are referring when they make those 
statements. 
  [Sauceda] Why isn't an analysis of the real situation of 
Honduran justice made in that document? 
  [Rivera] We are coping with the real situation of justice 
with the seriousness the case warrants, regardless of what the 
document says. The current government's goal is to implement 
the moral revolution announced by President Carlos Roberto 
Reina. As I said, regardless of what the government may say, we 
are prepared to improve justice so that it is a true justice 
meted out by just, honest, and competent judges. 
  [Sauceda] Are you saying you will fire all judges involved 
in 
corruption? 
  [Rivera] Of course. If it is confirmed they are corrupt, 
they will be arraigned in criminal court. 
  [Sauceda] This report claims that the law does not apply to 
the rich with political power but only to those without money or 
influence. 
  [Rivera] I must clarify that this report does not say that. 
It refers to the previous Supreme Court. When this report came 
out, we had not yet been elected to the Court. 
  [Sauceda] But you intend to clean the dirty face of justice? 
  [Rivera] As I said before, that is our intention. 
  [Sauceda] Will you answer the State Department document? Is 
it worth it or are they lying? 
  [Rivera] As I said before, this report does not refer to the 
Court over which I preside over but a previous Court. 
  [Sauceda] But what are you doing? 
  [Rivera] We are trying to change and improve the whole 
system. When the report said civilian justice is weak, we do not 
know whether it refers to civilian justice or justice 
administered by civilian authorities. In this case, there is 
the criminal justice, which is the one that interests the State 
Department most. 
  [Sauceda] Will you reply to this document? 
  [Rivera] I cannot give you an answer at this point. We are 
going to study it first and if necessary we will reply. 
  [Sauceda] Why does the United States, not those responsible 
for Hondruan justice, prepare this kind of report? 
  [Rivera] [Words indistinct] used to preparing that kind of 
report and investigate. 
  [Sauceda] What do you think of U.S. interference in Honduran 
affairs? 
  [Rivera] No, they cannot intervene... [pauses] That is a 
report they issue to all the people. 
  [Sauceda] Is it possible to change the bad image [words 
indistinct] Honduran people? 
  [Rivera] That is the intention all fellow justices have. 
  [Sauceda] How will this be done? 
  [Rivera] By choosing the most capable and honest judges who 
are ready to implement the law. 
  [Sauceda] Do we have honest judges here? 
  [Rivera] Of course, yes. There must be honest people here. 
  [Sauceda] Will you respect the judiciary? 
  [Rivera] We will respect it in the measure that judges 
fulfill their duties. 
  [Sauceda] Did all justices close their lawyer's offices? 
  [Rivera] I suppose so. My office has been closed since last 
June. 
  [Sauceda] The population is expectant over the offers made 
during the campaign by the politicians who are now in office. 
What do you say? Is law going to be applied now? 
  [Rivera] Of course. That is our intention. Otherwise, we 
would have not accepted this post. [end recording]

  [Text] Two witnesses in the U.S. Embassy bodyguard's case 
will reportedly testify on Wednesday at the 1st Court in 
Sensuntepeque. According to judicial sources, the witnesses had 
already testified but their version of the incident is 
confusing. It was added that Israel Vasquez, a driver, had said 
the Salvadoran bodyguard's death occurred as a result of an 
attack by robbers. 
  National Civilian Police sources indicated U.S. Major Ismael 
Lopez shot his bodyguard and killed him, later abandoning him 
inside the vehicle. The case has caused a controversy among the 
various government agencies because the U.S. military officer 
was illegally taken out of the country to Panama.

  [Text] Montevideo, 8 Feb (EFE) -- It was reported today 
that the foreign ministers of the 11 countries that make up the 
Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) will define in 
Montevideo on 11 February the steps to be taken to intensify the 
process toward a common market in the zone. 
  The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, 
Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela 
will also have to solve the problem created by the presence of 
Mexico in the ALADI after it joined the NAFTA with the United 
States and Canada. 
  Article 44 of the Montevideo Treaty which created the ALADI 
obliges a member country to extend to all ALADI members the 
advantages it grants to third nations. 
  Mexico asked that this article not be implemented and that 
it 
prefers bilateral negotiations with the other partners. 
  In a news conference ALADI Secretary General Brazilian 
Antonio Antunes said today that the Eighth Council of Foreign 
Ministers will study the ways to strengthen the role of the 
association in "the house of regional integration." 
  Antunes especially referred to the agreements reached in the 
current subregional and bilateral integration process taking 
place in Latin America, and on how to implement them. 
  He also talked about establishing regulations to strengthen 
the current trends of intraregional trade. 
  Antunes noted the "outstanding growth" of regional trade 
which according to figures of the ALADI Statistics Department 
reached $22 billion, some 18 percent higher than last year. 
  In 1992 trade grew 29 percent in relation to 1991. 
  Antunes said regional trade has become a "great choice for 
the region" and that world trade grew 3.3 percent in 1993. 
  Regarding Mexico, the NAFTA, and its compatibilization with 
the ALADI, Antunes said a special group established after months 
of discussions an interpretative protocol of Article 44 to allow 
temporary exceptions to this article. 
  He added that Mexico must carry out bilateral negotiations 
on 
ways to compensate for the losses caused by the agreement with 
third countries.

  [Text] The possible decision by President Bill Clinton to 
eliminate some restrictions for American travel to Cuba far from 
implies a change in the blockade policy against Cuba. Saul 
Landau, specialist at the Political Studies Center in 
Washington, said it would be a mistake to interpret this 
decision as a U.S. Government change in policy toward Cuba. 
  Washington authorizes trips to Cuba for only certain 
categories of travelers: reporters, researchers, scholars, 
government officials, and U.S. citizens of Cuban origin with 
relatives in Cuba, or guests whose expenses are paid by the 
Cuban authorities. 
  News dispatches last week indicated that the White House is 
studying a Department of State proposal to broaden the scope of 
travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens. 
  Saul Landau today stated that the proposal to expand the 
categories of American visitors to Cuba must not be viewed as a 
positive indicator regarding the United States' general policies 
toward Cuba. The measure might be a sign of flexibility 
regarding restriction of the rights of Americans. However, this 
is not indicative of a lowering of the guard against Cuba. 
  The Department of State proposal is based on an amendment 
bill drafted last year by California Democratic Representative 
Howard Berman, opposing the travel ban. State Department 
specialists drafted the new proposal, which is now being studied 
by the National Security Council for government approval.

  [Text] Normalizing relations with the United States 
regarding migration has always been one of the Cuban 
Government's objectives. For example, in 1993, Cuba authorized 
100,000 people to temporarily leave the country, but only 30,000 
were able to travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied a visa by 
the U.S. Interests Section, located in our capital. Journalist 
Zenaida Costales has a report for us on what goes on there, day 
after day. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified speaker] Everyone has an 
objective. [indistinct comments by numerous unidentified 
speakers, speaking simultaneously] 
  [Unidentified speaker] They stand guard here, in the line. 
There is one who keeps the list of the people in line. Then... 
[rephrases] but one must be here at 0630. To sacrifice all those 
days! So, well, we do not have a set time for leaving here. We 
are just as likely to leave at noon as at 1400 hours. It 
depends. The U.S. Interests Section should consider that. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Well, here I am again today, for the 
16th day. 
  [Unidentified speaker] And you have been... [rephrases] I 
myself have been here a week, night and day. The other day, last 
Monday, we were drenched by a rainstorm at 0500. This area was 
so muddy that it looked like a pigsty around here. It was such a 
mess that it was criminal to have to be here. And to have to 
spend the whole day and the whole night that way.... [leaves 
sentence unfinished] 
  [Two unidentified speakers, speaking simultaneously] But 
that 
is [words indistinct]. That kind of disregard! 
  [Costales] That kind of thing happens everyday at the park 
at 
Calzada and K Streets, called the Park of Lamentation because of 
the thousands of people who gather there in front of the offices 
of the U.S. Interests Section to await an interview, during 
which they find out whether or not they will be allowed to 
travel to the United States. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I have not been able to get in yet -- 
and without knowing, (without their) telling me yes or no. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Heck, it does people in, in the 
heart! 
People come out of there in tears -- all emotionally upset 
because after all those things, to have them say to you: You 
cannot go! [You think:] Let's see if I get lucky tomorrow and 
will be able to go. And the luck (?involved in) having them say 
yes to me! If they say no to me, then I will have spent all 
those months in vain. That is not easy, [repeats] not easy. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I plan to go in there tomorrow, to 
see 
what they tell me. (?I have no idea what will happen.) 
  [Unidentified reporter] What if they say no? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Huh? What am I going to do, resign 
myself? The thing is, he is going to die and I am not going to 
get to see him before he dies, because he is in bed, in serious 
condition. 
  [Costales] The U.S. Government turns the matter of 
emigration 
into one more stumbling block in the already difficult bilateral 
relations between Cuba and the United States. But let us let the 
protagonists themselves express their opinions. 
  [Unidentified speaker] (?We must) clear up one little thing: 
The Cuban Government gives anyone who wants to go permission to 
go. The whole blockage problem is here at the embassy because 
the Cuban Government really does not prevent anyone from going. 
Anybody who asks to go there and has complied with the 
formalities gets permission. But it is here that one is blocked. 
  [Unidentified reporter] And what were you told at the U.S. 
Interests Section? 
  [Unidentified speaker] That I could not go (?right now,) 
because I was too young a person. 
  [Unidentified reporter] And what do you think of that? 
  [Speaker] His words of hope were for me to come back next 
year, but I told him no, that next year I would be only one year 
older, that it would be the same thing, that I would still be 
young. 
  [Unidentified speaker] One cannot afford to lose the hope of 
living, in this life! 
  [Unidentified reporter] And what if they say no to you? 
  [Speaker] Well, they will be forcing me to do something I 
would rather not do. I would like to see my grandparents and 
come back, but they are obliging me to do something else. 
  [Costales] There are still many things left to resolve 
regarding emigration. These testimonies show that the doors in 
that wall are still closed. [end recording]

  [Text] Today, people opposing the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba are in Washington supporting a bill calling for the 
reestablishment of ties between the two countries. The support 
was organized by religious groups, scholars, and politicians to 
mark the beginning of a campaign against the aggressive U.S. 
policy toward Cuba. 
  The bill is entitled, Act for Free Trade With Cuba, and is 
sponsored by Democratic Representative Charles Rangel, who 
describes Washington's policy as hypocrital, given the current 
international conditions. However, in political circles in the 
United States, the climate is that of prudence in forecasting a 
victory in Congress because a change in policy toward Cuba 
depends to a degree on the Cuban-American community and Wall 
Street businesses.

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage Davila [title as 
heard] is in Colombia, as part of a tour that included Brazil 
and Venezuela. This visit will contribute to strengthening the 
bilateral ties between Colombia and Cuba following the 
resumption, just over three months ago, of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries. 
  Today Lage will meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
and, during his official visit to Colombia, will meet with the 
ministers of foreign trade, agriculture, economic development, 
and health. 
  Before returning to our country, Lage, who is also secretary 
of the executive committee of the Council of Ministers, will 
meet with the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic, 
which sets and regulates the nation's financial and fiscal 
policy. 
  Tomorrow, invited by the powerful National Association of 
Industrialists, Lage Davila will attend a working breakfast with 
representatives of that association, of exporters associations, 
of financial institutions, and of small and medium-sized

  [Text] Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], called for the necessary measures to 
guarantee the current sugar harvest, during a meeting with the

enlisting all organizations and entities, along with the workers 
of the sugar industry, in the solution of the problems that 
could arise from the resource deficit during the campaign. 
  Another one of the topics analyzed was the assemblies of 
production and services, which should evaluate economic 
efficiency based on the suggestions made at the workers 
parliaments.

representatives of Cuban firms. A few minutes ago, journalist 
Jose Luis Rumbaud talked to Jean Pierre Desgeorges, who is 
heading this delegation. 
  [Begin recording] [Desgeorges, in French, with superimposed 
Spanish translation] We set ourselves as an objective carrying 
out this mission in Cuba so that our firms would become fully 
aware of the changes in the economy and of the great 
opportunities for trade and industrial relations for investors 
in all spheres that could arise. 
  Cuba is indeed favorable ground for French firms to come 
here 
and invest, or at least for them to come here and establish some 
kind of business. 
  [Unidentified man, in Spanish with superimposed French 
translation] Despite the pressures to which Cuba is today being 
subjected, the crisis, all the structural changes being made in 
the country? 
  [Desgeorges, in French with superimposed Spanish 
translation] 
Yes, but we think this crisis that you have suffered as a result 
of the collapse of the countries of eastern Europe is a crisis 
that the Cuban economy has been able to bear, if I may put it 
that way, and this very brutal phenomenon has been able 
to...[translator rephrases] the Cuban economy has been able to 
confront it despite many sacrifices, and has been able to resist 
these events, which has shown us that Cuba constitutes a solid 
foundation for the future. [end recording]

  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage this afternoon in 
Caracas reiterated Cuba's interest in promoting investment with 
Latin American capital. During his short visit to Caracas 
following an official six-day visit to Brazil and en route to 
Colombia, Lage met with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Burelli Rivas and other authorities. 
  In statements to the media in Caracas, Carlos Lage said the 
accusations of human rights abuse in Cuba are unjustified and 
just a part of Washington's harassment policy against Cuba. 
  Upon commenting on the changes taking place on the island, 
the Cuban vice president said that his country does not intend 
to become capitalist but to adapt itself to world conditions and 
perfect its socialist model. 
  On 9 February Vice President Lage will begin an official 
two-day visit to Colombia on the invitation of President Cesar 
Gaviria, with whom he will meet in Santa Fe de Bogota, as well 
as with several ministers of Gaviria's administration and with 
representatives of the National Industrialists Association of 
Colombia.

  [Excerpts] The Committee of Actions for National 
Reconciliation [CARENA] national conference at the Holiday Inn 
Hotel finally reached an end at 2256 on 8 February. After 
debates that were to say the least thorny, the national 
conference decided to form an exceptional government in charge 
of managing the state while awaiting a court decision on the 
accusations brought against President Aristide. Despite the 
warnings of Osner Fevry, despite the warnings of Rodaille [not 
further identified], the assembly castigated President Aristide. 
The cards will have to be shuffled again and it is supposedly 
all over regarding the president-in-exile. 
  An exceptional government is in sight. The campaign began in 
the Toussaint Louverture Room itself. The Revolutionary Front 
for Haitian Advancement and Progress [FRAPH] vainly attempted to 
impose the five members of this team. [FRAPH leader] Emmanuel 
Constant asserted that if a referendum had to be made he would 
be elected president of the Republic by plebiscite given that he 
is the most popular. Disregarding pressure, which included 
bargaining, intimidation, hemming, and hawing, the assembly 
refrained from designating the members of this government. But 
Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the 
Nerette-Honorat government] was campaigning for the man whose 
clear-sightedness he never stopped vaunting, the man for whom he 
showed his profound admiration: General Raoul Cedras. [passage 
omitted] 
  But during the debates, Rodaille nevertheless warned against 
such solutions. His was a solitary voice talking to a brick 
wall. At least, gentlemen, to console those who are waiting 
rightly or wrongly for the return of the president, take this 
possibility into account, said Rodaille during these debates 
that were taking place at the Toussaint Louverture Room of the 
Holiday Inn. [passage omitted] Be aware that jurist Osner 
Fevry warned that on the juridical plane only one scenario was 
possible: Return to constitutional order in accordance with the 
principle of precedence. Let us listen to Attorney Fevry. 
  [Begin Fevry recording] "The first political matter is that 
the president of the country should designate his prime 
minister, that President Aristide should immediately designate 
his prime minister who will form his government. The second 
political matter is to straightforwardly form an exceptional 
government. This exceptional government can have several names. 
We can call it a military government. It can be a 
civilian-military government, it can be a civilian government, 
it can be a government of public security, and it can be a 
government of national reconciliation. No matter what name is 
given to it, it can be a political matter to form this new 
government, this exceptional government, this military 
government, this civilian government, this government of public 
security, this government of national reconciliation." These 
are the political matters. "The juridical and legal means to 
form this new government include first....[pauses] We said it 
is only one big method through a kind of general synthesis, we 
call it" return to constitutional order and -- if you wish -- 
return to constitutional and legal order. This means supremacy 
of the law, that is the acknowledgement of the law as the 
supreme force and in accordance with the principle of 
precedence. "This means it is either the law or not. Either you 
are courageous enough to play the game of the law or you 
(?imprison) the law and do not [words indistinct] to play the 
political game." [end recording] 
  The CARENA officials will meet with the press for the 
official and solemn signing of the final resolution of this 
conference. This will take place very soon with the formation 
-- in prospect -- of the exceptional government. Between now 
and then the parliament will have to be won over to the cause of 
the conference. But it will also be necessary to convince the 
international community so that the sanctions can be lifted.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 9 Feb (DPA) -- The Haitian business 
sector ended today a protest against the world oil embargo and 
asked the Army and deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
reach an agreement to end the political crisis prevailing in the 
country since September 1991. 
  For 12 days, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
kept the biggest enterprises in Port-au-Prince closed and will 
enact new protests if the Armed Forces and Aristide do not 
restart negotiations, warned business sector spokesman Bernard 
Craan. "We attained our objective. We have caused a 
psychological shock, and now everyone understands that we must 
find a solution quickly," said Craan. 
  In a joint resolution signed by the leaders of several 
powerful business associations, Haiti's big businessmen asked 
that everyone sacrifice. The businessmen urged Aristide, 
overthrown by a military coup on 30 September 91, to appoint as 
soon as possible a new prime minister to replace Robert Malval, 
who resigned on 15 December. They also demanded the lifting of 
economic sanctions imposed by the international community, as 
well as the resignation of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, 
leader of the coup. If these demands are met, the Caribbean 
country will be close to a solution of the crisis, said the 
businessmen. 
  Democracy in Haiti was almost reestablished last October, in 
accordance with an agreement sponsored by the United Nations, 
but the military prevented Aristide's return, which had been 
scheduled for 30 October. Until January, when the petroleum 
embargo began forcing several industries and other enterprises 
to close their doors, the business sector had been reticent 
about participating in the political debate on the country's 
situation. 
  Several business leaders said many businessmen who were 
doing 
very well before the 1991 military coup are now in danger of 
going bankrupt, whereas the new businessmen with ties to the 
Army are getting rich through preferential treatment from the 
Customs Department, among other advantages.

  [Text] The Haitian employers' associations, which on 9 
February will end their shutdown of the country's stores, 
designed to force a lifting of the embargo and a solution to the 
political crisis, have made political recommendations to 
untangle the crisis. The 14 associations, including the Haitian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry [CCIH], asked General Raoul 
Cedras to go into retirement and President Aristide to appoint a 
prime minister and lift the embargo. They also asked the UN 
Security Council and the OAS to immediately lift the embargo 
that they refer to as genocide, and to recognize the damages 
that this embargo has caused the country. The employers' 
associations have further asked the Armed Forces to guarantee 
the security of all legislators and to work on the formation of 
a new police force and the law separating the Army from the 
police, as provided for by the Constitution. In their statement, 
the Haitian employers had a special message for Gen. Cedras and 
President Aristide: 
  [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] The employers' 
associations which, with an open mind, brought their support to 
the president of the Republic in July 1993 are today requesting 
from President Aristide, in compliance with Article 136 of the 
Constitution, the appointment of a new prime minister as soon as 
possible, in view of assuring the regular running of the state; 
the withdrawal of his request to impose an embargo, in order to 
put an immediate end to the resultant disastrous consequences; 
and to initiate a policy of social appeasement. 
  To the legislative chambers, given that the role of the 
legislative chambers is to study and vote on the necessary laws 
and provisions for the efficient running of the state; given 
that they have the duty to defend the superior interests of the 
nation, the employers' associations request from the legislative 
chambers, first: the immediate cessation of the empty-seat 
policy and utilization of all indispensible measures for the 
running of the parliament and application of the Constitution; 
second, that the law of general amnesty be voted within six 
working days; third, that they immediately begin the procedure 
for ratification of a prime minister as soon as he is appointed, 
as provided for by the Constitution; fourth, that they formally 
make a commitment to study and vote the law on the creation of a 
police force, as provided for by the Constitution. 
  Of the Haitian Armed Forces, in order to create confidence 
among the legislators and the entire nation, and to allow for a 
definitive release of the dramatic situation that is gripping 
the country, the employers' associations are asking the Armed 
Forces command, first, to formally reassert their commitment to 
guaranteeing the safety of the legislators in the fulfillment of 
their duties; second, to work with all concerned parties on the 
creation of the police force provided for by the Constituion; 
third, in collaboration with national interests and the 
international community, to work on the formation of a police 
force and on modernization of the Haitian Armed Forces. Of Gen. 
Raoul Cedras, they ask for reassertion of his request for 
retirement, effective immediately following passage of the law 
on amnesty. 
  Of the UN Secruity Council and the OAS, considering that the 
embargo imposed by the international community constitutes 
genocide against a poor, defenseless, voiceless population; 
considering that the imposed embargo is contrary to human 
rights, as written in the UN charter, unfeasible to life, work, 
health and social service; considering the inestimable damage 
caused by this embargo to the environment; considering that it 
is necessary to compensate for the harm done by this unjustified 
embargo; considering the necessity of stopping the increasing 
distrust of the Third World countries toward the superpowers and 
powerful internatonal organizations, the employers associations 
urge the UN Security Council and the OAS; first, to lift the 
genocidal embargo; second, to recognize the damages caused the 
Haitian nation through the economic sanctions and to make a 
commitment to compensating them as soon as possible through some 
means that will guarantee boosting the national economy; third, 
to formally acknowledge to the private sector its commitment to 
see democracy implemented in Haiti through means other than the 
genocidal embargo that is odiously and unjustly punitive, not 
only to the innocent national majority, but also to the entire 
nation. 
  In conclusion, the employers' associations are convinced 
that 
the application of these provisions should without a doubt 
immediately disentangle the political crisis. The unquestionable 
good faith of all Haitians is indispensable to a definitive 
solution to the crisis. The involvement of all social sectors is 
also indispensable to a long-term resolution of the structural 
crisis of the country, all of which are essential conditions for 
a definitive state of law, adaptable to a newborn democracy.

and Industry; National Association of Importers and Distributors 
of Pharmaceutical Products, National Association of Distributors 
of Oil Products, National College of Haitian Engineers and 
Architects, Association of Agricultural Producers, Association 
of Coffee Exporters, Association of Haitian Insurance Agents, 
Association of National Producers, Haitian Association of 
Construction Firms, Haitian Association of Travel Agents, 
Inter-American Businessmen's Association, Hotel and Tourist

  [Text] Over 80 persons were killed for political reasons in 
one month in Port-au-Prince alone, notably in the populous 
neighborhoods of Cite Soleil and Carrefour-Feuilles, a human 
rights activist told the Haitian Press Agency. This personality, 
who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, emphasized 
the Cite Soleil slaughter that caused the deaths of about 50 
persons on 27 December, and the murder of about 15 youths on the 
night of 2 February. Of these 15, 12 bodies were discovered in 
Sarthe, on the northern road out of the capital. About 10 more 
youths were shot down in Cite Soleil or its surrounding areas 
because of their presumed affiliation with the lavalas movement 
during the same period by armed civilians or men in military 
uniforms. The human rights activist also cited the cases of 
several persons killed under questionable circumstances, whose 
bodies were later discovered at the general hospital's morgue in 
Port-au-Prince. 
  According to this human rights spokesman, political 
assassinations are considered casual facts in Haiti. He holds 
the international community responsible for the impunity with 
which crimes are committed daily in Haiti. He also pointed an 
accusing finger at a huge segment of the business community, 
which denounces the ravages of the embargo caused by the 
military coup d'etat, but considers the violent killings normal. 
Citing the murder of Manette Jean-Louis, a young girl in the 
Mahotiere area, who was shot down on 31 December by 
Nationalistic and Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti 
Deputy Saurel Jacinthe, the human rights defender also denounces 
the blocs within parliament whose members are accomplices in 
crimes against life.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister </F>
Sergio Abreu by correspondent Carlos Banales Marino in 
Washington -- date not given] 
  [Text] [Banales] A recent comment made public by 
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella suggested that his 
country will unilaterally ask to join the TLC [Free Trade 
Agreement -- NAFTA]. This comment overlooked the public 
statement by President Carlos Menem that Argentina would join 
the TLC together with the entire Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South]. Let us go part by part. What does Uruguay think about 
this commercial agreement? 
  [Abreu] Our first assessment is positive. The TLC 
represents an additional effort by the region's countries with 
the purpose of forming commercial blocs, following the world 
trend in this field. Therefore, the signing of an agreement that 
involves Latin American countries such as Mexico with Canada and 
the United States is a positive fact. 
  [Banales] Does the TLC clash with Mercosur? 
  [Abreu] They complement each other. These schemes begin to 
overlap each other to the extent that the regional integration 
blocs all lead to a greater liberation of trade. In other 
words, we are making the integration project and the commercial 
opening compatible, but for this the integration systems must be 
flexible. It is not a matter of imposing a model to substitute 
imports that will entail the isolation and autarchy of the 
member countries of those blocs. For example, we believe that 
the TLC, the Group of Three, the Andean Pact, Mercosur, and the 
bilateral agreements reached within Aladi [Latin American 
Integration Association] complement each other and head for a 
commercial opening in keeping with the objectives also sought by 
the Uruguay Round that ended last 15 December. 
  [Banales] Let us talk about Di Tella's comment. Can 
Argentina -- in its capacity as a Mercosur member country -- 
unilaterally ask to join the TLC? Does that not affect the 
Asuncion Treaty? 
  [Abreu] The Asuncion Treaty is the legal framework by which 
Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, or Paraguay must abide. This treaty 
clearly establishes the terms and condition for their 
relationship with third countries. The four countries have been 
jointly negotiating within the GATT, coordinating their stances. 
We have legal duties established in the treaty that compel us 
to design common commercial policies, and also the four 
countries have an agreement with the United States known as 
"Four Plus One" proposed by President (George) Bush that, to 
some degree, has materialized following the congressional 
approval of the four Mercosur member countries. It is a 
negotiation and consultation forum that does not have the power 
of a commercial agreement but allows for an institutional and 
political rapprochement that, in our viewpoint, is the 
appropriate mechanism for this relationship. 
  [Banales] Right. But what happens if one of the four 
countries that signed the Asuncion Treaty decides to split away 
and unilaterally ask to join another treaty, such as the TLC? 
  [Abreu] If Argentina, or any of the other three countries, 
wants to leave Mercosur to join the TLC, it must apply the 
appropriate mechanism established in the treaty. In this case, 
the commercial concessions granted remain in force for another 
two years. But if it wants to join the TLC, it also must follow 
the same procedures Mexico is following. That is, it must 
negotiate the concessions granted to third countries by virtue 
of the agreements reached through the Montevideo Treaty signed 
within the framework of Aladi. And this goes for Argentina as 
well as for the remaining three other countries. It is not just 
a matter of expressing a desire; there are obstacles that must 
be overcome. The TLC is an integration mechanism that is just 
starting; it establishes a free trade zone and is far from the 
achievements already made by the four Mercosur member countries. 
  [Banales] In what sense? 
  [Abreu] Look, we already have reduced 82 percent of our 
tariffs and as of next year -- with some exceptions for Paraguay 
and Uruguay -- we will enjoy free trade, which is the TLC's 
objective. This is why I maintain that Mercosur is not a mere 
political expression or desire. We all want to join the TLC not 
because it is a matter of standing in line to join another 
treaty, preference zone, or free trade zone, but rather to seek 
the mechanisms to join or become compatible with the different 
integration schemes. 
  [Banales] Is Mercosur one of Uruguay's priority issues? 
  [Abreu] For us Mercosur is a top priority for the four 
member countries. This was politically ratified by the four 
countries, and currently we are defining the Common Foreign 
Tariff, a field in which we have made great technical and 
political progress. Therefore, going back to your question, we 
believe that any desire to join the TLC is naturally subject to 
the legal and political situation. We support any initiative 
within this framework because we believe that joining the TLC 
merely complements the integration systems. Argentina, as well 
as Brazil, have ratified their decision to remain within 
Mercosur and then negotiate with the rest of the regional 
projects. 
  [Banales] Has Mercosur already yielded any concrete results 
for Uruguay? 
  [Abreu] Well, if you analyze it, yes. Uruguay's intra-zone 
trade during the past few years has gone from $3 billion to $8 
billion. This difference may be conditioned, among other 
things, by monetary or exchange policies that sometime distort 
trade in -- should we say -- a non-genuine manner. But we also 
must admit that our intra-zone trade has increased 
substantially. To Uruguay, its Mercosur partners represent a 
record percentage of its trade history. Currently our Mercosur 
partners account for 45 percent of our foreign trade, and we 
notice that the treaty has an important impact in the commercial 
field. Uruguay's concentric circles policy favors our 
commercial partners such as Argentina and Brazil, in addition to 
complementing this subregional strategy with a more global 
commercial opening. 
  The Mercosur path is undoubtedly full of obstacles and 
difficulties but Uruguay continues to unwaveringly support the 
treaty's ratification.

  [Text] Mexico City, 7 Feb (EFE) -- The Cardenist Front for 
National Reconstruction Party (PFCRN) has symbolically joined 
the armed revolt in Chiapas and begun a tough fight to discredit 
its opponents in the presidential campaign. 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, PFCRN candidate to the Mexican 
presidency, announced that its "vote-sponsoring brigades" will 
mobilize this week wearing a "uniform" -- a ski cap and 
sweatshirt -- like members of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) who rebelled on 1 January. 
  Fernando Pineda, national propaganda secretary, today 
explained to EFE that the ski cap will be "a symbol of peace, 
not of war." He added that it will be worn as a symbol of the 
Zapatist struggle for democracy and to demand a "no to weapons, 
yes to the ballot box." 
  The ski cap is the main garment worn by Zapatist leaders. 
Rebel leader "Subcommander Marcos" says he wears it to honor 
the Mexican culture of "keeping things under wraps" in which the 
name of the ruling party's presidential candidate is withheld. 
  "The PFCRN fully agrees with the Zapatists' demands. We have 
adopted their ten points for democracy and offered ourselves as 
the Zapatists' peaceful branch because we believe their demands 
are just," Pineda said. 
  The opposition party spokesman said its members hope 
violence 
will stop and that just solutions will be given to the people of 
Chiapas and Mexico, where, according to him, there are more than 
40 million poor people, meaning half the country's population. 
The way to prevent permanent instability in the country is to 
promote new, in-depth economic policies and to help the poorest 
people overcome their backwardness. 
  "We are going to emphasize this platform unity with the EZLN 
in our political campaign and guarantee that a political rather 
than military solution prevails on 21 August (presidential 
election day)". 
  Aguilar Talamantes was applauded by dozens of supporters 
wearing black and white ski caps on 6 February when he began his 
campaign in the capital. 
  During his electoral campaign, which began in January, 
Aguilar Talamantes harshly criticized another opposition 
presidential candidate, Cuahtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD), whom he describes as "lacking 
seriousness and ideological commitment." 
  Aguilar Talamantes has also criticized Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) for his 
"elitist" character because he wants politics for "groups of 
decent people without taking the poor into consideration." 
  The PFCRN, known as the Worker's Socialist party until 1986, 
proposes to end agricultural backwardness; to sponsor progress, 
democracy, and development; and to promote an in-depth 
reconstruction of the country's political and social life as 
guidelines for winning the presidency. 
  Nine parties will participate in the 21 August general 
elections, but only the ruling PRI (Institutional Revolutionary 
Party), PAN, and PRD are considered strong.

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Feb (EFE) -- Dozens of peasant and 
Indian organizations in several Mexican states are backing the 
rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) movement and 
threatening to join the armed struggle in a demand for economic 
and political reforms. 
  Since the EZLN revolted in Chiapas on 1 January, dozens of 
human rights, political, religious, Indian, and peasant 
organizations have expressed their "moral support" for the 
rebels' demands, especially the fight against poverty. In past 
weeks, however, many of those organizations have taken more 
radical positions by demanding immediate solutions to their 
economic problems and threatening to join the EZLN ranks. 
  Approximately 400 peasants who grow sugar cane in the 
eastern 
state of Michoacan threatened today to take up arms and join the 
EZLN if the government does not reopen its sugar mill, which was 
closed one year ago. The peasants are former workers of the 
Puruaran sugar mill, which is located 120 km from the Morelia, 
the capital of Michoacan. The peasants asserted that they will 
muster hundreds of Purepecha Indians in the area to join an 
armed revolt to continue the neo-Zapatist movement. 
  Confronted with this situation, the 21st Military Zone 
troops 
are currently guarding the region to forestall any rebel 
movement. The Michoacan rebel leaders have agreed to meet on 
Wednesday with Jaime Serra Puche, commerce and industrial 
development secretary, to negotiate the reopening of the sugar 
mill. Meanwhile, five rebel leaders have gone to Chiapas to 
deliver a letter to the EZLN asking to be allowed to join its 
ranks. 
  Furthermore, 1,000 members of the Democratic Peasant Union 
(UCD) [Union Campesina Democratica] in Torreon city in the 
northern state of Coahuila expressed their support for the 
EZLN's demands and demanded that the local government provide 
immediate solutions to the agrarian problems in the area. "The 
Torreon peasants will initiate an offensive in defense of the 
ejido (community land). We demand the suspension of Banco 
Rural's land seizures and the cancellation of the expired 
portfolio," which amounts to approximately $233.3 million, their 
communique stated. 
  In the southern state of Guerrero, authorities have warned 
that several people are distributing leaflets to the Indians 
calling them to an armed revolt against the government. 
Authorities are currently investigating those reports. 
  One week ago approximately 300,000 members of the "Guerrero 
500 Years of Indian Resistance Council" [Consejo Guerrerense 500 
Anos de Resistencia Indigena] asked to be accepted in the EZLN 
ranks and requested that they be allowed to support the armed 
movement from the mountains of the southern state of Guerrero. 
The Zapatists accepted the request. The Guerrero Indians have 
started collecting food, clothing, and medicine to support their 
"war brothers" in Chiapas and will send the provisions to 
Chiapas in the next weeks. 
  A dozen religious and human rights organizations in the 
northern state of Chihuahua, which borders the United States, 
have formed the "Peace and Justice in Chiapas Coordinator" 
[Coordinadora por la Paz y la Justicia en Chiapas] that demands 
that the EZLN be accepted as a belligerent force. The 
coordinator demands a halt to the repression against the Indians 
in Chiapas and to the "manipulation of information" by the 
television media. It has warned that it will support the rebels 
in all their demands to the government. 
  In the southern state of Oaxaca, neighboring with Chiapas, 
many residents in the mountain areas have warned authorities of 
the alleged presence of armed groups that are preparing to rise 
up against the local government. The authorities, however, have 
repeatedly denied those reports. 
  At least 108 people were killed and approximately 500 
injured 
in the armed clashes between the EZLN and the Armed Forces 
during the first 10 days of the conflict.

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Feb (DPA) -- "Subcommander Marcos" 
has stated that unless their is a democratic revolution in the 
Mexican electoral system, the whole country will rise up. 
Marcos is the main military strategist and spokesperson for the 
Zapatists, who took up arms in the southern state of Chiapas on 
1 January. 
  "If the electoral system is not revolutionized, regardless 
of 
whether the Zapatists exist or whether they annihilate us, the 
country will rise up," the mysterious rebel leader said in an 
interview published today by the newspaper LA JORNADA. 
  During the interview held somewhere in the Lacandona Jungle, 
the EZLN spokesperson, whose identity is concealed by the 
classic ski cap worn by the Chiapas rebels, insisted on the need 
for guaranteeing democratic elections in Mexico. 
  "They can negotiate peace in Chiapas in February, but by 
June 
the country will have another revolt," Marcos said, stressing 
the need for political reforms that will prevent the Mexican 
Government from controlling the presidential elections scheduled 
for 21 August. 
  The rebel subcommander described the current moment on the 
eve of the first direct meeting between Manuel Camacho Solis, 
the government's peace commissioner, and the EZLN as being 
between a "monologue disguised as a dialogue" and a "potential 
war conflict." 
  "The war is not actual but latent. It could break out at any 
moment," the EZLN leader said, explaining that this is why the 
EZLN cannot give up its arms. 
  Marcos said the Mexican Government is handling the dialogue 
process as an ultimatum to the guerrillas because it "is 
preparing the political conditions for a large-scale military 
operation." 
  In spite of this, Subcommander Marcos expressed his 
confidence that the guerrillas can achieve important political 
results in their negotiations with the government. 
  He said that some 15 rebels of the EZLN and of the so-called 
Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command, the 
main organization of the EZLN, will attend the dialogue with 
Camacho Solis. The site of the meeting is not yet known, but 
the meeting is supposed to begin this week. 
  The guerrilla leader said the role of the media was decisive 
in making the quick transition from the 12-day war to the 
dialogue, for which he admitted the EZLN was unprepared. 
  "We were prepared for a long war of attrition, of military 
clashes, of political disputes over towns, of ideological 
struggle, and for a possible dialogue later, once the government 
agreed," Marcos stated.

State, for the "Vector 21" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] One hundred PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
members from Teopisca Municipality this morning closed down the 
road to Comitan and demanded Mayor Hector Alvarez Gordillo's 
dismissal. The blockage impeded the transit of shipments of 
medicine and food destined for communities negatively affected 
by conflicts, because the protesters denied passage to all kinds 
of vehicles. A commission of deputies this afternoon traveled 
to the area to talk with the protesters. 
  Meanwhile, the Chiapas State government and the Banrural 
[Rural Bank] General Directorate agreed to increase the support 
recently authorized for the coastal zone to prevent a 
decapitalization to include all Chiapas State producers. 
Ricardo Lecumberri Lopez, Banrural delegate for Chiapas and 
Oaxaca States, said the measure will benefit all the agrarian 
and livestock producers accredited to the organization. He 
explained the agreements foresee the pardon of accrued 
interests, provisional suspension of all sequestration trials, 
creation of a fund to renegotiate past due debts, and channeling 
of new credit resources. Lecumberri Lopez said the support will 
be granted through Banrural's 12 branches in the state.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero for the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told Indians 
from Los Altos de Chiapas he will fulfill all his pledges and 
continue to work to achieve harmony. Approximately 100 members 
of the Indian Council of Chiapas came to the official residence 
in Los Pinos this afternoon to discuss with the president their 
needs for potable water, high schools, health centers, and 
better administration of justice. They came to Mexico City in 
an Air Force plane, arriving at the presidential house in tour 
buses. The group was led by Governor Javier Lopez Moreno. 
  The meeting was private. It extended beyond the allotted 
time. Later President Salinas personally explained the reason 
for his delay to the workers, electricians who waited in another 
room at Los Pinos. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] I come from a meeting where I 
heard, talked, and adopted decisions with Indian municipal 
presidents from 13 municipalites in Chiapas State. I heard 
their proposals with due attention and respect. I learned about 
their decision to work for peace, harmony, and justice. They 
want two things above all: they want harmony to prevail in their 
communities, region, and their great and beloved Chiapas State, 
and they want pledges fulfilled. This was my reply: For Chiapas 
and for Mexico, we will work for harmony, and we will fulfill 
pledges. [applause] [end recording] 
  The Indians were from nine ethnic groups -- Chamulas, 
Tzotziles, Choles, Lacandones, and others -- in Los Altos de 
Chiapas. They said they were happy about their meeting with 
President Salinas but they warned that if authorities fail to 
fulfill all their pledges they will come back and report this to 
the president of the republic. They also said that they share 
the reasons for the Zapatists' struggle but not the way in which 
they have done it, meaning with weapons. 
  Asked if they will continue to vote for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI] in future elections, Pascual Gustavo 
Rodriguez, municipal president of Mitontic, said they have yet 
to decide for whom they vote in the next general elections. It 
is appropriate to mention the question was asked because voting 
in this region has always favored the PRI.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta in San Cristobal de las Casas, </F>
Chiapas State for the "Vector 21" newscast -- live relay] 
  [Text] On Tuesday Indians from the zone of Sononusco, 
Chiapas State, seized five municipal offices to protest the 
alleged embezzlement of public funds, corruption, and lack of 
social plans. Approximately 40 people, initially identified as 
members of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], blocked the 
road between Teopisca Municipality and San Cristobal de las 
Casas. Alleged PRD members also seized municipal offices in 
Cacahuatal. 
  The two mobilizations followed the seizure of municipal 
offices in Mapastepec, Huehuetan, and Tuxantan by civilians. 
Their demands are the same -- more credits for rural areas, 
more public projects, and distribution of land, among others. 
It is also stated municipal presidents have abused their 
authority and are acting through political bossism. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Municipal presidents 
have been accomplices to murder. One of our comrades was 
killed, reportedly while trying to escape. Relatives said the 
municipal president told him he could leave, but it was later 
claimed the prisoner was shot while trying to escape. We came 
to Teopisca in case the people need protection because we... 
[pauses] if things are not solved now in Teopisca, tomorrow or 
the day after we will bring in 1,000 people for further support. 
The governor wants us to work throughout the municipalities, but 
no solutions are proposed. We have put up with this problem for 
quite a long time, and no solution has been found. To the 
contrary, the municipal president now gives us the finger, 
mostly to our women, and that is not right. We have stopped the 
people even though they wanted to drag him out and tie him up. 
We know that is a crime and things might get out of hand so we 
opted not to do that, but we will not put up with this 
situation. We have an audience with the governor in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez scheduled for 15 February and, if no solution is 
proposed on the 15th, we will adopt other decisions or measures 
on the 20th to solve the problem as best we can. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement by Mexican Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho </F>
Solis at the Diego de Mazariegos Hotel in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, Chiapas -- live relay] 
  [Text] Messrs. representatives of the media: I have 
received a confidential message from the EZLN [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] command. They had certain doubts and worries 
which I have proceeded to answer and clarify. Seeking to 
maintain an atmosphere of seriousness and responsibility in 
connection with the dialogue for peace and reconciliation, allow 
me to state the following: 
  1. Today, with the authorization of the president of the 
republic, I met with the region's military commanders to request 
their support and establish the specific conditions of safety 
required by the meeting in previously agreed upon terms. The 
Mexican Army has notified me it is prepared to provide all the 
guarantees required for the meeting's safety and success. 
  2. We all know that the problem we face is extremely 
complex, that in-depth political decisions are at stake in the 
dialogue. The truly important thing is not the spectacular 
character of the event; it is the political meeting and its 
substantial points. Its political essence is what matters and 
that viewpoint should drive the process. 
  3. I am worried that I still cannot tell you the dates for 
the dialogue for peace and reconciliation. I know the level of 
public expectation which prevails because I have shared with you 
the anguish of waiting. I understand the media you represent 
and you have professional and personal schedules and plans. I 
can assure you that the dialogue will not occur within the next 
48 hours. If someone has to travel he can do it at will. 
  To conclude, as far as I am concerned, I will remain in 
Chiapas State for the next few days as an expression of my 
determination in favor of a dialogue and political solution to 
this conflict. Thank you.

  [Text] Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said the crisis at 
the Copper Corporation, Codelco, has not stained the country's 
image abroad as Senate President Gabriel Valdes claimed in 
Valparaiso on 8 February. 
  "I do not believe the country's positive image abroad has 
been harmed. Undoubtedly the Codelco affair is significant and 
serious, but it is hardly fair to see it as some sort of 
collapse. It would be a gross exaggeration to do so. As I see 
it, Codelco is not broke and the country is operating normally." 
  Krauss categorically stated that no human rights have been 
violated in Chile, contrary to what a U.S. Department of State 
report has claimed. 
  "Human rights are most definitely respected in Chile. I do 
not believe that any Chilean or foreigner who truly knows how 
things are here could say that human rights are violated in 
Chile. Any resident of this country who may feel that his or 
somebody else's human rights have been violated is free to go to 
court." 
  Krauss explained that in any democratic state violations 
must 
be reported to the courts, not to the government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fallen Walls"] </F>
  [Text] Another taboo of the modern world has collapsed with 
the end of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on 
Vietnam. After 19 years the embargo was maintained mainly for 
historical reasons. 
  Little remains of the differences that led the two countries 
to war in the 1960's and 1970's. Vietnam has withdrawn its 
troops from Cambodia. With a single party system, and without 
worrying about subjects like human rights, Vietnam has gradually 
opened its market to the rest of the world. 
  The truth is that Vietnam allowed itself to be contaminated 
by the winds of trade and prosperity that turned the Far East 
into the greatest laboratory of economic experiences at the turn 
of the century. To a certain extent the embargo created more 
distress for American companies than for the Vietnamese 
themselves. 
  In a country where everything literally had to be 
constructed 
or reconstructed, capital from Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South 
Korea, and from the former colonial world power, France, among 
other European investors, poured in. 
  Melting the ice with the United States was more difficult, 
but it began in the mid-1980's when the Americans were still 
grieving over the humiliation of the military defeat. 
Curiously, there were not as many difficulties on the 
Vietnamese side. The economic reforms thus gained momentum in 
1986. Given the events in the USSR, the failure of Communism 
contrasted with the bewildering acceleration of the market 
economies in the neighboring countries. 
  U.S. goodwill, which Vietnam needed to gain access to 
international capital, was generated through a cooperative 
attitude over a subject that touched the heart of the Americans: 
The location of the prisoners of war whose whereabouts were 
unknown. Last year President Clinton withdrew the veto the 
United States imposed on help from international financial 
institutions. From then on, the embargo was psychological and 
political rather than economic. 
  We wonder when and how the same thing will happen with Cuba. 
The main objective of that embargo was to combat Communist 
infiltration in the continent and in the direct area of 
influence of the United States. 
  That motive no longer exists. The Cuban Government is in 
tatters and whenever they can, Cubans move from a government job 
to small private businesses. 
  Paradoxically the embargo is the only way Fidel Castro can 
still touch the nationalist feelings of the increasingly 
disillusioned Cubans. It is his last chance to carry the Cuban 
flag. 
  If the embargo were lifted it would be doubtful if the Cuban 
regime would survive the avalanche of opportunities that would 
be created by the arrival of capitalist agents, that is, 
development.

<F P=106> [Letter from Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and </F>
LA PRENSA Director Pablo Antonio Cuadra to President Violeta 
Chamorro issued in Managua on 3 February 1994] 
  [Text] As a result of a dialogue with General Humberto 
Ortega and his recommendations, and after discussing and 
reflecting on the current situation in Nicaragua with prominent 
professionals, intellectuals, and Nicaraguan citizens aware of 
and at times victims of the violence in the Nicaraguan north, 
we, Managua's Archbishop Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, and 
Pablo Antonio Cuadra, the dean of Nicaragua's Catholic 
University and director of LA PRENSA, address the government, 
the Army -- one of the key organizations involved in the problem 
-- and through the government, the people in general, in the 
following manner: 
  We believe that the said violent situation, the constant 
bloodshed, and the citizens' insecurity that stems from the 
conflict as well as the impoverishment of the entire area make 
urgent the search of a comprehensive solution to the conflict, 
with the constructive participation of all the parties involved. 
  Therefore, we ask that those parties, the government, the 
Army, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80], accept the following 
commitments as a peace mechanism: 
<H5>  Commitments by the Army </H5>
  1. Immediate suspension of offensive military actions in the 
country's northern area. 
  2. Withdrawal of soldiers currently deployed in the northern 
area to the area headquarters. 
  3. Appointment of a team of high-ranking officers comprised 
of at a maximum three who are not on duty in the region to form 
a special committee to investigate and clear up publicly any 
complaints regarding human rights violations in the north. 
  4. Establishment pari passu of a plan for the gradual 
withdrawal of the soldiers assigned to the northern area, to 
include the disarmament of FN 3-80 personnel. 
  5. Public commitment to guarantee the lives of those who 
have laid down their arms and the personal safety of FN 3-80 
personnel. 
<H5>  Commitments by the FN 3-80 </H5>
  1. Immediate suspension of offensive military actions in the 
country's northern area. 
  2. Transfer of personnel to secure areas agreed upon in 
negotiations with the Army and the Government Ministry, under 
the supervision and protection of the CIAV-OAS 
[OAS-International Commission for Support and Verification], and 
human rights organizations. 
  3. Establishment pari passu of a plan for gradual 
disarmament of personnel, along with the withdrawal of soldiers 
of the Sandinist Popular Army. 
  4. Public commitment to permanent reintegration into 
civilian life. 
<H5>  Commitments by the Government and Social Action Ministries </H5>
  1. Increase the number of National Police personnel in the 
northern area, and prepare them technically, civically, and 
morally to improve security guarantees and public order in the 
area. 
  2. Integration of FN 3-80 personnel in the process of 
increasing and training National Police personnel as disarmament 
proceeds. 
  3. Creation of a core development area in the north with 
clearly established fiscal resources to alleviate poverty and 
reactivate productive activities. 
  4. Appointment of a team of high-ranking officials to form 
the special committee mentioned above designed to investigate 
and elucidate publicly complaints regarding human rights 
violations in the north. 
  Commitments by the CIAV-OAS, Cardinal Obando y Bravo's 
Verification Commission, the Permanent Committee for the Defense 
of Human Rights, and the 
<H5>  Nicaraguan Human Rights Association </H5>
  1. Active participation in negotiating and supervising full 
compliance with the agreements. 
  2. Participation in the peace activities promoted by the 
special committee, which will be comprised of civilians chosen 
by His Eminence Cardinal Miguel Obando in addition to all other 
personnel mentioned above. 
  3. The Special Pro-Peace Committee will act as a mediator 
with other armed groups so that they sign similar agreements, 
thus attaining complete understanding among residents of the 
northern area. 
  If all parties endorse said commitments and accept 
implementation of this peace plan, we will solemnly celebrate 
this event, which we hope will make history, in the presence of 
those people who have contributed their reflections and 
experiences, as well as representatives of countries and 
international organizations that have expressed their intention 
to contribute to this peace plan. 
  [Signed] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Pablo Antonio 
Cuadra

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Two U.S. Embassy drivers appeared in Sensuntepeque 
courts this morning to testify as the main eyewitnesses to the 
death of bodyguard Crescencio Diaz Atencio, allegedly 
assassinated by U.S. Major Mike Lopez. The prosecutor handling 
the case thinks the two drivers' testimonies conclusively prove 
that Lopez shot and killed Diaz inside the car. 
  The drivers testified behind closed doors in Sensuntepeque 
preliminary judge Lucila de Paz's office. Legal proceedings 
lasted nearly eight hours. A representative of the Prosecutor 
General's Office was present at all times. 
  The key witness, Lopez's driver, refused to speak to the 
press after making his statements for the judge. The other 
driver said he did not know the motives for the crime, although 
he received in his Soyapango residence the U.S. Embassy vehicle 
with Diaz's body still inside. 
  [Begin recording] [Second driver] Yes, they arrived at my 
home. 
  [Reporter] What happened? What did the other driver tell 
you? 
  [Driver] He only told me they were racing. Only that. [end 
recording] 
  The drivers' statements confirm their earlier statements 
made 
to the Soyapango court. The prosecutor general's office has 
reported that Diaz was indeed killed by a .38 caliber bullet 
while taking Maj. Lopez from Cabanas to San Salvador. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It is clear that 
although the witness did not say he saw who fired, the three men 
were in the car. The shot came from behind. The only person in 
the back seat was the major. There is an extremely strong 
presumption of guilt. Unfortunately, presumption tends to 
disappear from penal codes. At present, however, the 
presumption that the major did fire on Diaz is strong. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Latin American banana producers so far have been 
unable to form a bloc to make a specific proposal to the EC 
regarding negotiations for a new agreement on banana exports to 
Europe. 
  Enrique Bethancour, executive director of the Union of 
Banana-Exporting Countries (Upeb), said yesterday 
representatives of Upeb countries have decided to undertake the 
negotiations with the Europeans collectively and within the 
framework of GATT rules. 
  Not all representatives of the countries that are members of 
this organization have agreed with this proposal, however. 
  During the 5 February meeting in Panama City, it was decided 
to invite Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, which 
to date have not accepted the proposal by the majority of Upeb 
members. 
  Panama, Guatemala, and other producers, including Ecuador, 
the world's largest producer and not a Upeb member, maintain the 
negotiations must be held within the free trade framework 
established by GATT. 
  Ricardo Fabrega, Panamanian commerce and industries 
minister, 
said on 4 February the proposal that would be analyzed in this 
meeting consisted of a specific quota, which he refused to 
disclose, and two tariff levels. He said the first tariff level 
would be established at 7 percent. There would be a second 
tariff level after the requested quota is filled, and this level 
would be reduced in the next seven years. 
  Fabrega added the quota to be requested from the European 
Union would include the quantities sold to the Nordic countries 
and Austria, which will become EC members in 1995.

  [Text] Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo granted an 
interview during which he spoke about an agreement for peace, 
democracy, and justice signed by eight political parties. He 
said the agreement signed by eight of the nine registered 
political parties to contribute to the peace process and honest 
elections in 1994 is well on its way to fulfillment. 
  [Begin Carpizo recording] No party will issue reports on its 
own. News and reports will be issued jointly. [end recording] 
  He said that the gentlemen's agreement between leaders and 
presidential candidates is intended to protect and consolidate 
the peace agreement. Carpizo added that special congressional 
sessions can be held to reform the Federal Code of Electoral 
Institutions and Procedures if there is a consensus among the 
parties to do so. 
  Carpizo was interviewed after a meeting at the government 
secretariat with leaders of the National Teachers' Union headed 
by Elba Esther Gordillo.

  [Text] Congressman Victor Joy Way, first vice president of 
the Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD], termed as correct the 
CCD's decision in the dispute over jurisdiction and the 
elimination of the decisive vote measure presented by 
Congressman Julio Chu Meriz. Joy Way justified this decision as 
protecting the lives of judges who are entrusted with special 
cases like La Cantuta and will apply to other future cases. 
Here is what Congressman Victor Joy Way said: 
  [Begin recording] [Joy Way ] There are obvious factors such 
as threatening situations. This is not a matter of 
jurisdiction. You know perfectly well that we as congressmen 
have the obligation to somehow solve this problem. Definitely, 
any ruling, any sentence by a justice is definitely influenced 
by a threatening situation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think this decision will 
prolong the outcome of the case? 
  [Joy Way] I believe, as far as I understand, that the 
investigations being conducted under military jurisdiction have 
made substantial progress. We hope that we will have a sentence 
as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  Congressman Victor Joy Way also said President Alberto 
Fujimori has the power to assess the law. Nevertheless, he said 
that in this case the legislative branch acted within its rights 
to perfect certain procedures that are under scrutiny. 
  In another turn of events, Joy Way referred to the hike in 
passport prices, said that this was [word indistinct] taking 
into consideration market prices for their manufacture, as 
apparently these had been previously subsidized.

survey taken by the company Apoyo have revealed the following 
trends: 
  Here are the results on economic issues. When those surveyed 
were asked, What is your opinion of the government's economic 
policy, 41 percent replied they supported it, whereas 42 percent 
were unhappy with it. The question, How do you feel your 
family's economic situation was last year, attained the 
following results: 43 percent felt it was better; 18 percent 
said it was better, and 35 percent said it was worse. 
  How do Peruvians regard their prospects for 1994? The poll 
reflects people are optimistic about the coming months, as 45 
percent believe the situation will improve. Here are the 
results on political issues. How do people regard the 
presidential hopefuls? If elections were held tomorrow, and the 
candidates were President Alberto Fujimori and Lima Mayor 
Ricardo Belmont, 57 percent would pick the president, and 20 
percent would vote for Belmont. If the candidates were Alberto 
Fujimori and Javier Perez de Cuellar, the gap would draw 
narrower, because 46 percent would vote for Fujimori, and 40 
percent would vote for the former UN secretary general.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  Today, the director of the National Statistics and 
Information Technology Institute said inflation for January was 
1.84 percent. This, he notes, indicates that inflation 
"continues to go down." The sectors that showed higher increases 
in January were rent, fuel, electricity, transportation, 
communication, and health care services while those that 
increased but not as much were food, beverages, entertainment, 
and cultural services. (Lima Global de Television Network in 
Spanish 0100 GMT 2 Feb 94) 
  On Thursday, the Peruvian Central Reserve Bank reported that 
as of 25 January, Peru's international reserves increased to 
$2.847 billion. This is $146 million more than the amount 
registered at the end of December. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1627

  [Text] The Office of Attorney General convicted over 1,000 
terrorists in cases it handled this year, Daniel Espichan Tumay 
announced yesterday. The official also appealed to authorities 
not to let down their guard facing the subversive enemy so as to 
prevent such terrorists from once again sowing unrest among the 
people. 
  Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was 
achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and 
military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists 
had cooperated with the courts. 
  While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that 
positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his 
appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest 
on their laurels. 
  "We must understand that terrorism will continue its 
onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be 
achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work 
and while paying respect to human rights," he said. 
<H5>  Presidential Instructions on Human Rights </H5>
  He also reported that as a special mission entrusted to him 
by President Alberto Fujimori, he has toured the country 
explaining to civil authorities and officials in the Judicial 
Branch and Attorney General's Office that they must take special 
precautions when apprehending individuals. 
  "The Police have been technically and scientifically trained 
and will find evidence proving whether or not a person is 
responsible for a crime. Otherwise, the rights of any citizen 
could be violated," he explained. 
  He said errors have been made in some cases and that the 
proper authorities have been duly notified, but added that what 
was important was "not to make any more." 
  Espichan Tumay said he is confident that with a titular 
Supreme Court, things will improve. 
  "A great deal remains to be done. We still have many 
prisoners who have been charged and all of Peru's higher courts 
must also be instructed to follow the same procedures applied in 
Lima," he said.

  [Text] Provided with new identities and accompanied by 
their families, five reformed terrorists left the country last 
year to begin new lives and forget the sequels of terror and 
bloodshed in which they participated when they made the mistake 
of joining the ranks of the Shining Path [Sendero Luminoso-SL] 
and MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. 
  They are among the country's 1,500 reformed terrorists, 
1,300 
of whom have already been reintegrated into society and are 
working in different areas. 
  A number of them are now members of the Peasant Patrols 
working in rural areas. Others, numbering about 50, have assumed 
new identities and gone with their families to other parts of 
the country to take up different activities. 
  Concerning the reformed terrorists who left the country, a 
reliable source reports that they are "intermediate-level" 
leaders of the Shining Path and MRTA who provided important 
information leading to the capture of the main cadres of the 
terrorist organizations. 
  The government has lent them its complete support, providing 
them with traveling allowances in dollars enabling them to get 
along until they can get settled. 
  They have traveled to other South American countries (for 
reasons of security we cannot say where), where the Peruvian 
Embassies are discreetly monitoring them. 
  Six or seven other cases of reformed terrorists are now 
under 
study by the Evaluating Committee, which will determine the 
possibility of sending them abroad. 
  Daniel Espichan Tumay, special attorney general for cases of 
terrorism, was summoned by EL COMERCIO yesterday, but refrained 
from providing details on the matter for reasons of security. 
  Nevertheless, he did explain that the change in identity and 
residence, whether inside or outside of the country, is an 
additional benefit extended to the reformed individuals in 
accordance with the law. 
  He noted that as a member of the Evaluating Committee, he 
observed that here in Peru, the entire procedure is fraught with 
delays and that dishonest legal officials are even turning a 
profit. 
  He said that five members of the single board of the High 
Court of Chiclayo had been removed from their posts when it was 
proven that they were charging a reformed terrorist for handling 
his case, which they had deliberately chosen.

  [Text] There are good prospects that Uruguay will increase 
its exports to Iran. This statement was made by Economy 
Minister Ignacio de Posadas yesterday upon his return from Iran 
where he headed a commercial mission. 
  De Posadas, who refrained from discussing domestic economic 
policy, told television Channel 10 that Iranian authorities and 
businessmen welcomed the initiative to resume the exchange of 
products, such as meat, where Uruguay has lost its privileged 
position in the Iranian market. 
  De Posadas explained: "There is interest in establishing a 
payment mechanism to safeguard the two parties, which was one of 
the important subjects discussed." 
  Regarding the products that may be of greater interest in 
the 
Iranian market, he mentioned rice, beef, milk by-products, and 
textiles.

  [Excerpt] Assuming his new post on 1 February, Lieutenant 
General (Air Force) Raul Sampedro, the new commander in chief of 
the Air Force, urged his subordinates to "strictly obey, without 
exception, the constitutional precept that bans them from any 
public or private act of a political nature -- with the 
exception of the act of voting." 
  The Armed Forces, and thus the Air Force, are traditionally 
one of the basic guarantors of the electoral process, giving the 
citizens the necessary security to vote freely," he said. He 
added: "This is the way it is and this is the way it will be." 
  He stated: "An essential condition for this is the fact that 
all military personnel on active service in the Air Force, from 
the commander in chief to the lowliest soldier, must strictly 
obey without exception this constitutional concept." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] According to military sources, Army Commander Daniel 
Garcia has ordered Army Intelligence Chief Colonel Leonardo 
Garcia to redouble efforts in the investigation to identify the 
members of the "Artigas Guard." 
  Garcia's decision responds to the issuance this week of a 
communique -- the third in less than two years -- questioning 
the attitude of several military chiefs. Military sources have 
reported that Army officers received copies of the communique. 
The text of the communique, which is unsigned and is not 
identified in any way, was also sent to several members of the 
media, including BUSQUEDA. 
  The first public appearance of the so-called "Artigas Guard" 
goes back to April 1992 when it claimed responsibility for the 
explosion of a bomb outside former President Julio Sanguinetti's 
office. 
  Sources close to the Army commander's office have reported 
that Garcia will not comment on the new communique, "in which 
its leaders are not identified." 
  However, other military sources have said that Garcia "is 
not 
amused" over the continued discussions on the "Artigas Guard." 
The sources added that although he is aware that "it is not 
easy" to detect these "anonymous plotters," he is "restless" 
because the investigation did not yield any results. 
  This third communique issued by the "Artigas Guard" 
addresses 
messages to Garcia; General Raul Mermot, the Third Army Division 
chief; and Lieutenant General Hugo Medina, retired, the former 
Army commander. 
  Alluding to the changes Garcia intends to make in the Army, 
the communique states that "the fastest path may be the most 
dangerous." The four-page communique entitled "Preliminary 
Report of Communique No. 3 of the Artigas Guard", states that 
"Trying to straighten in a few months a piece of the most noble 
steel that has been bent for years, will surely break him." 
  It adds that if we do not recover "our self-confidence and 
loyalty (...) all of us will fail" and "we will be defeated 
soldiers forever, you and your subordinates." 
  Later, the communique severely questions Gen. Hugo Mermot 
and 
former Army Commander Medina who in the last few weeks protested 
and expressed their opposition to the reforms promoted by 
Garcia. Mermot was held for 10 days because of a letter he 
addressed to Garcia demanding participation in the planned 
reforms. 
  The communique states that during the time he was director 
of 
the Armed Forces sanitary services, Mermot did not show the same 
concern over the difficulties that the families of those 
soldiers who were hospitalized in the Military Hospital had to 
face. 
  It adds: "You (...) are now suffering in flesh and blood 
what your subordinates have suffered for a long time." 
  The Artigas Guard tells Medina: "There is a time to speak 
and 
a time to be silent (...) and we believe you did not act 
accordingly at one time or the other." 
  Medina is also pointed out as "spokesman" of "a group of 
military men who condition the future of the institution to the 
holding of their posts." 
  Paraphrasing General Jose Artigas, the communique ends by 
stating: "We will never allow our common enemy to take the 
slightest advantage of our disagreements."

<F P=106> [Interview with Amado Gutierre, Colombian Council of State </F>
president, by reporter Rodrigo Barrera; place not given; from 
the "CMI Newscast"--live] 
  [Text] Attention: For the first time in Colombia's 
history, the Council of State is advocating a political trial 
against the president of the Republic on charges of contempt of 
the Constitution. The Principal Court of Administrative 
Disputes was not satisfied with President Gaviria's explanations 
on the presence of U.S. military soldiers in Colombia. Rodrigo 
Barrera is with the Council of State president now. Good 
evening, Rodrigo. 
  [Barrera] Good evening. Council of State President Amado 
Gutierre, what steps will the council take now that it presented 
this charge against the president of the Republic? 
  [Gutierrez] We have nothing further to do. Our actions are 
limited to sending our declaration to the Congressional 
Investigation and Charges Commission [comision de investigacion 
y acusacion de la honorable camara] and to the Attorney General. 
It is for them to decide on this institution and on the 
official [not further identified]. We cannot take any further 
steps, because we do not know if the congressional commission 
will decide to initiate a political process or if the attorney 
general will open a disciplinary investigation. This refers to 
the charges against the institution and the official. 
  [Barrera] According to the Council of State, there are 
enough 
merits to initiate a political trial, however. On what basis 
was this decision made? 
  [Gutierrez] We simply stated the presence of foreign 
military 
troops, as well as foreign war aircraft and ships, in our 
national territory does not conform to the Constitution and 
violates our national sovereignty. 
  [Barrera] Thus, Congress has to take it from there? 
  [Gutierrez] The congressional commission has to decide now 
whether it will open a political trial. 
  [Barrera] In his letter, the president has told the Council 
of State the Defense Ministry had the autonomy to approve those 
actions. Why was his argument unacceptable? 
  [Gutierrez] Because the end of that document states the 
agreement was signed with the authorization of the respective 
governments. It is understood that a government is the 
president of the Republic and his ministers. 
  [Barrera] Stated differently, either the president has lied 
to the Council of State or the minister has lied to the 
president. 
  [Gutierrez] I cannot determine this; the commission will do 
so once it studies our declaration, as well as the attorney 
general if he decides to do so.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Colombian Council of State in </F>
Santa Fe de Bogota on 8 February; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" 
newscast] 
  [Text] The Council of State, meeting in full chamber while 
evaluating the report sent by the president of the Republic on 
the presence of foreign troops, military vessels, and aircraft 
in national territory, unanimously states: 
  1. The government has at no point asked for an opinion to 
permit the transit and permanence of foreign troops as well as 
foreign military vessels and aircraft in the national territory 
in accordance with the provisions of Articles 189, No. 7, and 
237, No. 3, of the Constitution. 
  2. In light of the Constitution, the council does not find 
convincing the government's explanations on the decisions it has 
made concerning this matter, because the interpretation of the 
text of the same and the treaties and agreements signed by 
Colombia goes against the letter and spirit of the Constitution 
and violates national sovereignty. 
  3. From the same explanations, it can be deduced the Senate 
did not grant the permission established by Article 173, No. 4, 
of the Constitution. 
  4. Given the de facto situation that was created, it 
believes U.S. military troops, vessels, and aircraft are in 
Colombian territory without fulfilling the requisites 
established in the Constitution. 
  5. According to Article 9 of the Constitution, the president 
of the Republic is responsible for the Colombian state's foreign 
relations with absolute respect for national sovereignty; 
consequently, it is unusual for the president to state the 
defense minister gave the authorization without his previous 
knowledge even though the memorandum of understanding signed by 
that minister with the U.S. ambassador on 29 October 1993 
establishes that they are acting with due authorization from 
their respective governments. 
  A copy of this statement shall be sent, along with the 
letters exchanged between the Council of State and the president 
of the Republic, to the Honorable Chamber of Representatives 
Commission To Investigate Charges and to the nation's attorney 
general so (?they can do their job). 
  Copy to the president of the Republic. 
  [Issued] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 February.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria's government has reaffirmed 
it has violated neither the letter nor spirit of the 
Constitution by authorizing the presence of foreign troops and 
aircraft in national territory. Following the decision by the 
Council of State--which is unconvinced by the president's 
explanations on the issue--a copy of which was sent to the 
Chamber of Representatives Commission to Investigate Charges and 
to the Attorney General's Office, the Presidential Palace issued 
the following declaration: 
  1. The Council of State, by saying the government's 
explanations government are unconvincing, has adopted an 
interpretation contrary to the traditional interpretation that 
has prevailed in the nation for the past 45 years. 
  2. Therefore, points 1,2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Council of 
State 
statement on the absence of permission from the Senate or a 
decision from the very council are the consequence of this new 
interpretation. Neither Senate permission nor a Council of 
State decision was requested, because it is considered we are 
dealing with international treaties that do not so require. 
  3. The government does not believe the president of the 
Republic has violated the letter or spirit of the Constitution. 
  4. The government has delivered to the media a copy of the 
letter the president of the Republic has sent to the Council of 
State in which the government cites what it considers a correct 
interpretation of the Constitution on the issue. 
  5. What the Constitution seeks to establish is a procedure 
for granting permits for the transit of foreign troops that have 
intentions of war against third nations. It does not seek 
whatsoever to regulate joint training operations, high-tech 
operations, equipment maintenance, or technical assistance that 
are part of international treaties in force. 
  6. The acceptance of the legal interpretation of the Council 
of State would end military-technical cooperation between 
Colombia and other nations, particularly cooperation on which 
Colombia has insisted so much in its struggle against 
drug-trafficking cartels. 
  7. Despite the Council of State's statement, this does not 
have a bearing on the validity of international treaties signed 
by Colombia, nor does it constitute a ruling or a sentence 
regarding the government's conduct on the issue. 
  The Narino Presidential Palace declaration concludes by 
stating President Cesar Gaviria is planning a news conference 
during which he will once again broach the touchy issue.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- The national government stated 
moments ago the Council of State's opinion on the presence of 
foreign troops in our country does not obligate it to suspend or 
repeal the agreements signed by the Colombian Government in this 
regard. 
  Government Minister Fabio Villegas, the minister in charge 
of 
political issues, said the position voiced by the high-ranking 
tribunal [as heard] does not obligate the government to 
immediately withdraw the troops, which are in Juanchaco and 
which have created a serious controversy among various sectors 
of the country. 
  He insisted the Council of State did not issue a ruling, 
rather, an opinion that will now be debated at the Charges 
[Acusacion] Committee of the Chamber of Representatives and will 
be studied by the Attorney General's Office. 
  The Executive Branch stated in a communique the president of 
the Republic violated neither the letter nor spirit of the 
Constitution. The executive branch will not avoid the political 
debate at the Congress of the Republic. It is not our goal to 
deceive anyone, because the documents which contain these 
agreements have been at the Colombians' disposal, and thus, 
there is nothing secret, the government minister added.

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National Newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister [Rafael Pardo] has joined 
President Cesar Gaviria at the center of the scandal over the 
presence of U.S. troops in Colombia because Pardo signed an 
agreement without first advising the president. The minister is 
currently in Juanchaco inspecting the controversial projects 
with some congressmen. 
  [Begin recording] [Vergara] How do you feel about the 
upcoming political trial against you and the president? 
  [Pardo] I have absolutely no doubts; no legal or political 
doubts. There is nothing dishonorable about this, nothing I 
would term as a mistake. Our actions have always been based on 
a legal interpretation that we consider correct, and also on 
factors of convenience that we consider important. 
  [Vergara] Did the president know about this agreement? It 
has been said that he did not know about it; that his signature 
appears on the document but that he knew nothing about it. 
  [Pardo] The president is aware of how these agreements are 
established. He is aware of how military cooperation procedures 
are handled. The president was not consulted about the content 
of this memorandum of understanding because that would have been 
a deviation from normal procedures. This is directly under the 
jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. [end recording] 
  [Vergara] Minister Pardo and the congressional Foreign 
Relations Committee are inspecting Juanchaco to determine what 
projects are actually taking place in that region.

<F P=106> [News conference by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria with </F>
unidentified moderator and domestic reporters at Narino 
Presidential Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota; broadcast in progress 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Gaviria] ...that allow military members of other 
countries to undertake joint exercises with the Colombian 
military in the implementation of old practices that are backed 
by international agreements. Unfortunately, in response to a 
well-founded legal document that I sent to that judicial body 
some days ago with the utmost respect, a press communique was 
released that lacked legal arguments. I learned of the 
communique through the media, not through proper channels, as if 
it were more important to generate a particular climate of 
public opinion than to strictly carry out a legal procedure. 
  This attitude contrasts with the one I assumed with the 
State 
Council, to which I gave detailed and confidential explanations, 
aware of the implications that this debate has for our country 
in the national and international arenas. I received the news 
with the peace of mind of knowing that these types of operations 
are necessary, useful, and opportune for Colombia, as well as 
with the confidence that the legal arguments that the State 
Council rejected are solid and that the decisions that were made 
do not violate the Constitution, which, under the leadership of 
this administration, embodies the great changes that Colombian 
society had demanded for years for its political organization. 
  I continue to believe that we had to strengthen the 
institutions that exert control and give Congress the means to 
exercise its oversight function of the actions of the executive 
branch. That is why we will be ready to provide Congress, the 
body to which the State Council decided to remit the issue, with 
the explanations that it considers relevant with the assurance 
that they will not be rejected with the stroke of a pen but 
analyzed strictly and calmly. 
  From what is inferred from the brief statement of the 
judicial institution, it seems that the State Council has given 
a constitutional provision a scope that it obviously does not 
have. They are trying to claim that the duty of requesting 
Senate or State Council permission for foreign troops to 
temporarily enter our country means that it is necessary to 
request such permission for any foreign military man to enter 
Colombia, regardless of the purpose of his visit. Such an 
interpretation has led to the absurdity of asserting that to 
allow the entry of the military attaches, which dozens of 
countries have in Colombia, just as we have in as many 
countries, would require that permission, or that a joint 
intelligence operation to pursue a criminal would require the 
prior meeting and pronouncement of the Senate. It would also 
mean that valid international agreements with long-standing 
traditions, such as the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal 
Assistance and the 1952 Military Assistance Agreement, have 
somehow magically lost their effectiveness and that Colombia 
should therefore fail to fulfill all their clauses. It is clear 
that this is not the spirit of this Constitution nor of the 
constitutions that have governed us since 1821, which have 
invariably established a similar policy. 
  What the political Constitution seeks is to establish a 
procedure for granting permission for the transit or stationing 
of foreign troops that have warlike objectives against a third 
country. It does not in any way seek to regulate joint training 
operations, the operation of advanced technological equipment, 
the maintenance of equipment, or technical assistance, all of 
which are part of valid international treaties. If this issue of 
such importance had been studied very carefully, it would not 
have been difficult to conclude that this norm was established 
for situations in which foreign armies are confronting other 
nations, a situation in which the nation's neutrality would be 
compromised and which would obviously demand a pronouncement 
from the Senate, which is also empowered to declare war. 
  The State Council should remember that the drafters of the 
Constitution of 1886 had in mind the Isthmus of Panama, which we 
then held, which explains the reference to the docking of 
foreign war vessels. Since 1926, the State Council has very 
clearly identified the cases in which prior authorization by 
that body was unnecessary. These statements should still be 
completely valid. The State Council has said that acts 
befitting brotherhood and international courtesy and all those 
the Constitution endows on the president as the supreme 
administrative authority do not compel the government to consult 
the State Council. 
  Can a judicial body say that we are responsible for certain 
things because we abided by previous rulings? 
  About 17 months ago, days after the escape of Escobar, in 
response to a concern publicly voiced by the then State Council 
president, I forwarded to that body a statement where I made the 
same arguments I am reiterating now. At that time, the State 
Council, the same State Council that today is changing 
Colombia's traditional legal interpretation of this matter, did 
not refute the arguments in my letter but seemed instead to 
agree with and accept them. We are facing an unusual 
cirucumstance, where the president is being held responsible, 
not for making a decision but for sharing and supporting the 
legal reasons on which it was based and that the State Council 
had traditionally accepted. 
  The State Council's statement is not a legal decision. It 
simply apprises Congress of its action, and, I must point out, 
the government has provided all the documents, and the Judicial 
Branch has only said it does not find the State Council 
statement convincing. 
  The consequence of this decision is no other than the 
acknowledgment by the selfsame State Council that it lacks the 
authority to review the alleged violation of the Constitution 
and order the appropriate sanctions, all of which falls within 
the purview of the Congress. The State Council's statement is 
not legal but political. The vagueness of the statements of 
that body, and even the fact that its president is arguing over 
the radio that Colombian artisans can build a little school, do 
not constitue a legal argument worthy of response. Until a 
competent organization makes a decision, we will continue to 
pursue international cooperation and any joint exercises the 
government may consider essential to improve the training of our 
military forces. This cooperation, which is most advisable for 
the country, is based on international treaties ratified by the 
Congress. These exercises merely constitute the implementation 
of these treaties and not a de facto situation. Cooperation in 
intelligence, advisory services, and maintenance is vital in the 
struggle against criminal drug trafficking organizations. 
  The radical interpretation expressed in the State Council's 
press statement may benefit drug traffickers and will, 
undoubtedly, weaken our capability to deal with crime. 
  Colombians, I understand there may be those who disagree 
with 
the joint exercises conducted along Colombia's Pacific coast. I 
cannot ignore a shallow legal interpretation that may make us 
renounce operations that are indispensable to defend ourselves 
from crime and drug trafficking. As a matter of fact, the 
government has admitted there have been flaws in keeping the 
public informed. Perhaps this has prompted different people 
from speaking out against military cooperation with the United 
States. I am certain that once people hear my explanations 
today that many will change their opinions. We have conducted 
different joint actions with the U.S. Government to improve and 
increase the efficiency of our police operations. 
  We have received technology in the form of radar equipment 
that is directed and operated by Colombians and for which U.S. 
personnel provide us with advice and maintenance. We have 
conducted joint engineering exercises for the construction of 
various projects. Almost 100 Colombian soldiers are currently 
in the United States participating in operations similar to 
those that have come under fire in Colombia, and it has never 
even crossed anyone's mind that those soldiers might pose a 
threat to the sovereignty of the United States. 
  In all this debate there are at least two contradictions. 
The first is the belief that these efforts to improve the 
Colombian public force's training and efficiency constitutes a 
violation of our sovereignty when, in reality, these efforts are 
aimed at guaranteeing our sovereignty. 
  Sovereignty is much more at risk with a nation in the hands 
of criminals and drug traffickers, with a nation lacking the 
capacity to react to criminal activity, with a state baffled in 
the face of thousands of clandestine flights by foreign and 
local aircraft that are trafficking drugs, than with a state 
apparatus that appeals to international cooperation to guarantee 
the rule of law and the legitimate exercise of the rights of its 
citizens. 
  It is also surprising that we demanded the international 
community's support for the Colombian people's brave struggle 
against the major drug trafficking organizations, and now we are 
saying that this support is a threat to our sovereignty. As 
someone said some time ago, international cooperation is not a 
few pats on the back. It is, among other things, training and 
logistic support. 
  Sovereignty is not a rhetorical concept that is defended 
with 
speeches on the public square, during electoral campaigns, or by 
simply ranting anti-American chauvinist statements based on 
opportunistic nationalism or populism. Our independence in the 
sphere of international relations is open to everyone's 
scrutiny. Let everyone see how we have conducted ourselves at 
the various international forums; how our representatives have 
voted at the United Nations, OAS, and other multilateral 
organizations; how we have played an active role in the 
Nonaligned Movement and the Group of 77; how we have resumed 
relations with Cuba. In short, let everyone see the daily, 
permanent dynamism that has placed Colombia in a position of 
leadership in Latin America. 
  Citizens, sovereignty is defended when one bravely confronts 
the fatherland's enemies; when one confronts those who threaten 
the people's security and take advantage of and violate our 
territory, rivers, seas, and airspace to conduct criminal 
activities. Sovereignty is not an abstract value, a simple dead 
letter in the law or Constitution. We are more sovereign when 
we are able to exercise greater control. We are more sovereign 
when we strengthen the Colombian Armed Forces' capability to do 
their duty of defending the country's security and integrity. 
We are more sovereign when we acquire allies that support us in 
our battle against stateless individuals who murder our women 
and children [words indistinct]. This constitutes the defense of 
our sovereignty. 
  Those who wrap themselves in the Colombian flag and tear 
their hair over the alleged violation of our sovereignty because 
we allowed technicians and military engineers from other 
countries into Colombia are mistaken. Our enemies are powerful. 
To defeat them it is not enough for us to employ technology, 
ability, or sacrifices. We need solidarity and support. 
  What would have happened to Europe if its leaders had not 
had 
the vision to form an alliance to combat the specter of Hitler? 
What would have happened to Colombia if we had relinquished 
international cooperation in our battle against the then 
self-styled Medellin Cartel? 
  Would we perhaps be freer, more sovereign, or more 
independent living under the tyranny of Escobar's 
narcoterrorism? Would we be freer, more sovereign, or more 
independent by letting criminals from all countries and of all 
ilk violate our airspace? Would we be freer and more 
independent by letting drug traffickers have every technological 
advance at their disposal while we take shelter in our modest 
technical capabilities, renouncing international aid? 
  Until 7 August, when my mandate ends, I will continue my 
efforts to expand our democracy, modernize our country, diminish 
poverty and injustice, and face without hesitation those who sow 
destabilization and fear until we prevail over them. Fear of 
debate will not make me hesitate to make or support decisions 
such as the one being discussed -- within the framework of the 
Constitution, which this government knows well -- whenever I 
feel it is for the good of the Republic or to fight crime, 
purposes which the majority of Colombians share who prefer to 
open themselves to the future and not cling to the past. Thank 
you. 
  [First unidentified reporter, in progress] ... the exercises 
of U.S. servicemen with Colombian servicemen. The opinion 
issued by the State Council talked of troops. What legal 
arguments are you defending and why? 
  [Gaviria] I will try to summarize those legal arguments that 
are contained in the letter I sent to the State Council, with 
which I believe all of you are familiar and which unfortunately 
the State Council answered with a brief statement. 
Fundamentally, those arguments are the following: 
  Colombia has several international treaties that are 
currently in effect. They include agreements stemming from the 
[word indistinct] international treaty, as well as other 
international agreements, such as the 1958 Geneva Convention, 
the Chicago convention that regulates air traffic, and a number 
of agreements derived from those treaties. 
  The Juanchaco operations personnel, as well as the 
personnel in other operations being held in the national 
territory -- the naval, army, and police missions in the 
country; the exchange of military personnel and military 
students; and the support personnel for maintenance and 
assistance of our radar operations -- are not military troops. 
Why do I say this? In the message I sent to the State Council, 
I clearly established the legal antecedents for the 
constitutional norm. 
  The antecedents always refer to the time when military 
troops 
passed through Colombia and when Panama was part of Colombia. 
They mention belligerent troops that are participating in a 
war against another country or going to another country. This 
has nothing to do with military cooperation activities. All 
countries accept and want such cooperation. We have been 
developing this military cooperation for the past 50 years. We 
have had military personnel from the United States and other 
countries come to our country for the past 50 years. This 
exchange began around 1952. Thus, for almost 50 years we have 
had foreign military personnel and missions here, we have signed 
agreements and memorandums, and we have carried out military 
exercises. Based on this tradition, which has never been 
questioned over the past 40 years, the Defense Ministry has 
continued to make those decisions in accordance with this 
interpretation. 
  Now the State Council says it does not agree with that 
interpretation and has submitted this matter to the Congress of 
the Republic, which we agree is the competent body for rendering 
interpretations. 
  Unfortunately, as a result of the State Council's ambiguous 
and short statement, or opinion, it may be inferred -- this is 
not specifically stated -- that all military personnel must 
leave Colombia. I imagine they are referring to military 
personnel of Colombia and other countries. Under this absurd 
interpretation, one could even go so far as to expel all 
military attaches from Colombia, which would be followed with 
the expulsion of our military attaches from other countries. 
Therefore, this is what has placed the government in this 
situation, because [words indistinct] judicial but the opinion 
of State Council members. There is no ruling, no cause, no 
resolution. The State Council is not settling anything. It is 
only expressing a doubt that the government does not share about 
a juridical interpretation . 
  What has the president of the Republic done in this case? I 
have defended the legal arguments with which the country has 
worked for nearly 40 years and which had never before been 
called into question. 
  [Moderator] Diana Mateos, representing radio newscasts. 
  [Mateos] Good afternoon, Mr. President. All Colombians are 
wondering why these U.S. soldiers arrived in the country amid so 
much secrecy and why they arrived armed. The people wonder why 
the country didn't hire the unemployed to undertake these 
projects. This endangers national sovereignty, given that there 
are so many unemployed in Colombia. 
  [Gaviria] Look, these people arrived to implement a 
cooperation treaty or agreement we had with the United States. 
That was the decision the defense minister made. That has been 
done in the past in Colombia on many occasions. Joint exercises 
are conducted every year. As the military engineers' exercises 
continued, they decided to give the community where they were 
operating something that helped that community. That is 
obviously being done at the expense of the foreign government, 
the U.S. Government. It does not take away job oportunities 
from Colombians, and it does not affect the resources of 
Colombians. 
  In some of these operations, these people -- this is also a 
long tradition to which Colombian soldiers are also entitled -- 
are authorized to carry personal weapons, not weapons of war. 
There is a long tradition in all countries and within 
international law that permits this. 
  I obviously respect those who think that this is not 
convenient or who oppose these exercises, which is not the same 
as the exercises being unconstitutional or us not acting in 
accordance with the Constitution, treaties, and agreements. 
This can also be argued. I am not saying it cannot be 
discussed, but we must bear in mind the government has acted in 
keeping with a long juridical tradition for which there are many 
antecedents. 
  [Moderator] Francisco Solis of EL TIEMPO representing the 
print media is next. Astid Legarda will follow. 
  [Solis] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Do you believe that 
all Colombians who fear this presence of U.S. soldiers in civil 
cooperation activities, as you said, are perhaps remembering the 
incidents that led to Panama's separation? Do you think all 
these people are mistaken? 
  [Gaviria] No, I understand there may be fears. In Latin 
America there are always fears about this type of presence. 
However, with a small, limited presence to conduct exercises, 
when dozens of similar exercises have been carried out in the 
last 40 years, I frankly do not think these fears are justified. 
I might acknowledge that there may be some opposing views or 
some people opposed to these exercises, but to go from that to 
saying that we have acted unconstitutionally or outside of 
strict compliance with treaties or implementation of said 
treaties is a big difference. 
  Another thing I would like to point out is that some of 
these 
operations are very much needed, almost indispensable, while 
others are not. The operation in Juanchaco is not 
indispensable. We could have done without it in the long run. 
It was an operation, an exercise of engineers that we could 
have done without. 
  Unfortunately, the opinion or judgment of the State Council 
would involve not just that exercise but all kinds of military 
cooperation, radar assistance, intelligence cooperation. All 
international cooperation that helps us in the drug struggle 
would end, according to the State Council's opinion. We would 
have to violate international treaties and agreements to satisfy 
that opinion. That is what the president of the Republic cannot 
do under these circumstances, without failing to comply with his 
duties or the very constitution, which establishes international 
commitments with which we must comply. For instance, the Geneva 
Convention establishes the safe passage of warships; we are 
signatories to that Convention. We can neither violate nor 
ignore it because of a judgment issued by a Colombian judicial 
body. We cannot do that. 
  We have a commitment in airspace matters and a decree 
regulating such commitments. We cannot abandon those 
commitments overnight. I go back to the point I made in my 
statement: How is Colombia's sovereignty defended? By trying to 
prevent planes working for drug trafficking groups and without 
flight plans from endangering our air security, and by seeking 
international cooperation to prevent this. Are there Colombians 
who think that we must tolerate these risks to air security and 
this violation of our sovereignty instead of resorting to 
certain international cooperation? No, I don't think so. I 
don't think many Colombians feel that way. 
  [Moderator] Astid Legarda representing regional media; next 
Fabio Calleja. 
  [Legarda] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Your first comments 
seem to indicate that you admit these U.S. troops are in the 
country to help combat drug trafficking and, more specifically... 
  [Radio Caracol announcer, interrupting, from the studio] 
Excuse me for interrupting you, dear reporter. We will ask the 
president a question, considering that we are broadcasting this 
national newscast live. Mr. President, 10 days ago you said 
that if the State Council's statement proved adverse, you would 
see to it that the U.S. troops would leave our country. Will 
you do this? 
  [Gaviria] Look, I have with me a copy of all the questions I 
answered during that news conference. I did not say what you 
mentioned. I did not know what the State Council statement 
would be. The State Council said it would study the matter. 
Nevertheless, we did not know whether the Council would make a 
statement. We did not even know what subject it would consider. 
In addition, the State Council's statement does not have legal 
import. The Council has expressed an opinion, which it has 
forwarded to the Congress. I have already explained why I 
cannot accept this opinion -- among other reasons, because the 
State Council's opinion, apparently very brief and laconical, 
does not deal exclusively with this military engineers' 
exercise, but with any and all military presence in the country. 
Such a position could become absurd, to the point of causing 
the expulsion from Colombia of military attaches from all 
countries. This is why it is so difficult for the government to 
accept this opinion, concept, or statement. 
  [Legarda] Thanks, Mr. President. 
  [Radio Caracol announcer, from the studio] Excuse me, Mr. 
President, for having interrupted the previous question. Betsy 
Legarda, will you please repeat your question? 
  [Legarda] Mr. President, I was saying your first remarks 
seem 
to indicate that you admit U.S. soldiers came to Colombia to 
help fight drug trafficking, not just to build a small school. 
  [Gaviria] No, my friend. Pardon me, but you seem to be 
misinformed. U.S. soldiers participate in several activities in 
Colombia. Some are conducting engineering exercises in 
Juanchaco. Others are training in engineering by building river 
outposts so our Marines can fight drug trafficking. This is 
true. In addition, we are being advised in the operation of 
radar sites, which have been set up so our airspace cannot be 
violated and so drug traffickers' planes cannot fly over our 
territory with impunity. Still other activities deal with our 
Armed Forces' training programs. All this is part of the 
military cooperation maintained since 1958, when a military 
agreement was signed. There are many other activities, not 
necessarily linked to drug trafficking. 
  The problem with the Council's statement is that it 
questions 
not only the Juanchaco operation but every other form of 
military cooperation. Here I have a statement by President 
Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, which brings up precedents, even from 
the recent past. His statement shows why this interpretation 
cannot be stretched so far as to become absurd. Historically, 
the interpretation in Colombia has applied to troops with 
warlike intentions, not troops that are part of a cooperation 
agreement. The troops now in Colombia are not troops for war 
but troops participating in a military cooperation program. 
Troops like this have been here for more than 40 years, yet no 
one ever questioned their presence, and virtually no statements 
on this matter have been made in all these years. 
  This is what I meant in this particular instance. 
President Lopez says that when he was president the king of 
Spain visited the country aboard a Spanish Navy frigate. The 
Senate was not asked permission because the ship was not here 
for war-related purposes. Everyone here knows that when we were 
looking for Escobar we accepted cooperation from many countries, 
including surveillance aircraft that flew over Colombian 
territory. There was even disagreement with the president of 
the State Council on this issue. I do not regret having done 
this. I accepted international cooperation because I thought -- 
and still think -- it was legal to go after Escobar and 
dismantle the Medellin Cartel. And I also believe that our 
sovereignty is better served through this cooperation than by 
saying no, we cannot accept any international cooperation 
because it would harm Colombia's sovereignty, even though 
criminal organizations may take over the country and we run the 
risk of having to live in a country run by narcoterrorism. 
  [Moderator] Fabio Callejas, Caracol Radio, on behalf of the 
radio stations. 
  [Callejas] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Since you say the 
State Council's statement is political rather than legal, you do 
not think the ruling is valid or significant [words indistinct]. 
How much longer will the U.S. personnel remain here? When will 
they leave? 
  [Gaviria] [Words indistinct] First, there must be... 
[pauses] 
There is an operation under way [words indistinct] and it will 
conclude in February. They will finish it and leave in 
February. There is another group of people who participate in 
training, preparation, and qualification in various areas -- the 
radar, for example. The government has not considered doing 
without this, not for a single minute, except in case of an 
incontrovertible judicial decision. I cannot give up all 
international cooperation in the struggle against drug 
trafficking simply because the State Council has issued its 
opinion, which has no legal authority. This is an 
interpretation I do not share, and I hope to prove my point in 
the Congress of the Republic. 
  [Moderator] Margarita Gil, Colprensa, on behalf of the 
press, 
and then Ignacio Santiago. 
  [Gil] Mr. President, what would happen if the foreign troops 
in Juanchaco are attacked by the Colombian guerrilla forces? 
  [Gaviria] Well, there are no guerrilla forces there right 
now. I understand there are some questions about what would 
happen if they have to defend themselves. Well, what happens if 
they are attacked? I imagine they will defend themselves if 
they are attacked. There is no legislation or constitution in 
the world which says that if a foreign citizen is attacked he 
can do nothing to prevent it. If someone does it [words 
indistinct]. If someone attacks them they will defend 
themselves -- it is that simple. If someone attacks any 
military personnel, or non-military personnel, or even 
civilians, they will defend themselves as long as they can 
defend themselves. This is called legitimate defense. This is 
what would happen. I do not think this will happen because... 
[pauses] but if it does happen, that's what will occur. This 
does not apply only to foreigners; it also applies to Colombians 
-- either civilians or military. Everyone who is attacked and 
can defend himself will do so. 
  [Moderator] Ignacio Santiago, on behalf of the regional 
media, and then Antonio Jose Cabrera. 
  [Santiago] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Certain political 
analysts assert this phenomenon, meaning the decision adopted by 
the State Council last night, is trying to undermine your 
popularity. How will you resolve this situation with the public? 
  [Gaviria] Just like I am doing here -- explaining, answering 
questions, participating in open discussion instead of avoiding 
it. I have never avoided discussion; I have always faced all the 
problems. This is not the worst problem I've had. I am not 
surprised by this, and I am not the first president who has had 
problems over legal rulings and decisions which question his 
decisions. I will handle the situation this way -- explaining 
what I believe in, explaining to Congress why I made this 
decision, defending our legal position. That is what I shall do. 
  Furthermore, the State Council forwarded this case to 
Congress, but it was not over a decision, because the State 
Council knows I did not make the decision. What I did was 
defend a legal position. It is a sin of opinion. The president 
will be summoned by Congress because he defends a legal thesis 
-- the same one endorsed by all our courts and which they have 
now challenged. No! I will continue to defend my beliefs. I 
obviously have to abide by any judiciary and congressional 
decisions -- and I will defend them! In fact, if I have to tour 
the country defending them I will do so, because I do not feel I 
have undermined national sovereignty! 
  I feel I have defended national sovereignty, first of all 
before international organizations, where I constantly say: 
Watch how Colombia votes, and you will realize it is an 
autonomous country -- and here in Colombia, by recovering the 
state's control, fighting guerrilla groups and drug traffickers, 
strengthening the enforcement of justice, supporting the public 
forces, endorsing judicial cooperation processes, and 
encouraging military cooperation processes -- that is how you 
defend sovereignty! Sovereignty is not defended by letting 
criminals seize control of the country! That is not the way to 
defend sovereignty! And that is how I understand it! As long as 
I can I shall work to defend our sovereignty as I understand it, 
meaning assuming control, making sure the laws and legal 
organizations and public forces exercise control! I have not 
stopped doing that, and this is not the first controversial 
decision I have had to adopt! I have adopted many others in the 
past and I do not regret them -- and neither will I regret them! 
  [Moderator] Antonio Jose Caballero, on behalf of the radio 
services, and then Cesar Mauricio Velasquez. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, good afternoon. You say you will 
defend, regardless of the consequences, your decision to defend 
sovereignty as you see it. Do you think someone is manipulating 
the situation and trying to stir up troubled waters -- for 
example, the guerrilla groups and the drug traffickers? Who is 
taking advantage of this decision, electorally speaking? 
  [Gaviria] Oh, I would not say everyone who has expressed his 
views on the issue did it thinking that it was appropriate to do 
so or with that goal in mind. A lot of information has been 
circulated to misconstrue what has been done and to misrepresent 
it to the public. Yes, it has certainly been done. All of us 
who are here know one of the great fears which has prevailed 
about men engaged in an engineering operation is that they are 
really engaged in an operation against Valle del Cauca 
Department drug traffickers. They are not and they will not, 
but we all know the Valle del Cauca drug traffickers have pulled 
all available strings and resources to convey their terrible 
indignation. That is not the case; that is not what is really 
happening. I am sure that's not what's happening, but there is 
no doubt about the Valle del Cauca drug traffickers' actions. 
  I also know drug traffickers in the new departments, the 
former eastern flatlands, are quite uncomfortable because we 
have built some posts [words indistinct]. What for? So the 
Navy's infantry forces may operate. What for? So the Navy's 
infantry forces may control the rivers and counter the drug 
traffickers' activities. These are the facts, and you all know 
about them. You know I am not reporting this for the first 
time; you know this is true. 
  [Caballero] What about the possibility that the issue is 
being manipulated for electoral purposes? 
  [Gaviria] Of course. The guerrillas still live amid the 
rhetoric of a bipolar world and of the Cold War that is now 
over, in the days when Marxism was a doctrine, in the days of 
the now extinct Soviet Union. They cling to that doctrine, and 
they view anything that is anti-United States as wonderful. 
  No! Colombia must have a policy of sovereignty and autonomy, 
and this must be reflected in its international relations. This 
policy means Colombia will tolerate pressure, Colombia will vote 
as it sees fit in international forums, Colombia will establish 
relations with Cuba when it pleases. It means Colombia will 
make its own decisions. Sovereignty is not defended simply by 
delivering anti- gringo speeches. This is obsolete. 
  Cooperation is the in thing. We are working for a free trade 
zone. We are working for a modern country. Countries are 
increasingly relinquishing their sovereignty in some areas. 
Does the Andean Group's agreement on integration with Venezuela 
and Ecuador mean they are relinquishing sovereignty? We have 
relinquished our court's authority in favor of the Andean Court 
of Justice. We have renounced to our right to make certain 
decisions, in favor of adopting them in conjunction with other 
countries. Every time we come to an agreement in judicial 
cooperation we relinquish some of our sovereignty, if we 
continue to think of sovereignty the way we once did. 
  No! The concept of sovereignty has changed a lot. I insist 
on what I said here earlier: From the public order perspective, 
sovereignty means exerting control, being in command, knowing 
what is happening in one's territory, fighting criminal 
organizations. This is what exercising sovereignty means. It 
does not mean digging into the Constitution to see if according 
to some old prejudice there is something that can be contested. 
This does not mean exercising sovereignty. Exercising 
sovereignty means fighting drug traffickers with whatever 
international cooperation we can -- not with foreign troops, 
that would do no good -- but with foreign intelligence, all they 
can give us, all the equipment, all the information. We have 
accepted this, and we will continue to accept it. I don't 
believe Congress or any judicial organization will tell us that 
we are wrong because we are doing this! 
  [Moderator] Cesar Mauricio Velasquez, representing 
television newscasts, is next. He is followed by Indira Vega. 
  [Velasquez] President, what's aggravating you? Is it the 
form or the essence of the concept? 
  [Gaviria] This does not aggravate me, but I was taken by 
surprise. I was amazed because we had gone through a legal 
process, and we had asked that the defense minister and the 
military commanders be received in audience. Logically, we were 
expecting some specific response, some memorandum from a 
strictly legal point of view. Instead, the response has been 
some sort of opinion or statement. I don't know how important 
the press communique is, but it has questioned all the 
cooperation Colombia receives in this field. This is obviously 
not keeping us from making decisions. If the communique were a 
judicial ruling I would abide by it, but it is not a judicial 
ruling. The communique simply has questioned all the 
cooperation we receive. No one can expect me to react to this 
by throwing out all that cooperation, giving the country away, 
weakening our ability to fight crime, and weakening our military 
forces, simply because some citizens, eminent members of the 
State Council, believe this is not the way. No way! 
  Whenever there is a ruling, I will abide by it. I have to, 
even if I don't agree, but I am not now facing a ruling. I am 
facing an opinion. Since this opinion is that of the State 
Council or of its advisers, it has some weight and has created 
some commotion, and there is the impression that the government 
could be paralyzed. No! The government is not going to be 
paralyzed! The government has the constitutional mission to 
safeguard public order and fight crime, and the government will 
safeguard this. It will not fail in its mission. 
  [Moderator] Indira Vega, representing the print media. 
  [Vega] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Why so much 
misinformation? Why so many different versions being presented 
to the public? This gives the impression that lies have been 
told. 
  [Gaviria] No. The Armed Forces and the Defense Ministry 
have participated in this exercise many times. There have been 
many such exercises here. Every year there are military and 
naval exercises in Colombia. Every year! They simply saw the 
arguments as one more political debate and since political 
debates are not their affair, they chose not to participate in 
the debate. This is what happened. Information began trickling 
out as people became aware of the debate. There has been no 
attempt to hide anything. The Armed Forces and the acting 
defense minister simply believed that if they joined the debate, 
they would end up in a political debate, taking sides with 
presidential candidates. They decided that this was not 
suitable. Perhaps the acting defense minister and I did not 
realize that this was going to be an ongoing controversy and 
that it was going to become a political campaign issue. 
  [Moderator] Next is Clemens Torres of Radio Colmundo. Manuel 
Teodori will follow him. 
  [Torres] Good afternoon, Mr. President. You have an 
outstanding political record. Some of your critics say that you 
could resolve this problem by inviting some people over to the 
Presidential Palace. 
  [Gaviria, chuckling, while audience laughs out loud] No. 
Look, though, you can be sure that I will do whatever I can 
within the law and my principles to make my legal and political 
convictions prevail. This is who I am. Some say: The president 
is pragmatic. No. That's not it. Some say I have no 
principles, that I'm pragmatic. No, but when I believe in 
something I do all I can to get it through. You have seen how I 
function in Congress. That's because standing on my record is 
not enough for me; I want to get things done! I have tried to 
strengthen this country's public forces; I have tried to 
strengthen international cooperation and the struggle against 
drug trafficking, the military struggle, and the judiciary 
branch. I have fought hard to succeed! Hard! I have also 
worked hard to get the EC to give us preferential status, and it 
did! The U.S. Congress gave us trade preferences because of our 
struggle against drug trafficking. You can be certain that I 
will continue to struggle. I am going to fight, and I am going 
to win. 
  [Moderator] Manuel Teodori of Telemundo, representing the 
international media. He will be followed by Dario Hoyo. 
  [Teodori] Good afternoon Mr. President. Understandably, 
during an electoral period, there are people who [words 
indistinct]. The accusation about the presence of the U.S. 
soldiers could be used as a political banner to attract votes 
and to obtain the votes of members of your party. Unitl what 
point might this be true in this particular case? 
  [Gaviria] People get very passionate during electoral 
campaigns in Colombia and in all countries. The campaigns 
increasingly assume a populist tinge. You see people [words 
indistinct] who suddenly start endorsing a populist position. 
People tend to get too passionate, and sometimes they lose 
their objectivity somewhat. 
  But I would not like to base this debate on politics. Why? 
Among other reasons, the State Council is not involved in 
politics and has no part in politics. I believe the State 
Council's opinion is its own. I frankly do not believe the 
State Council took the time to carefully study all our arguments 
in detail and to examine all the consequences of its opinion. I 
don't think the State Council did this. I regret that it did 
not, and I also regret to say this -- but I firmly believe it is 
true. 
  Of course, this issue could be used by the people in the 
political campaigns. I have tried to avoid being a counterpart 
to the presidential candidates or to those who are campaigning. 
  [Moderator] Dario Hoyos of EL NUEVO SIGLO will ask the last 
question. 
  [Hoyos] I won't keep you long. I see that you are very angry 
with the State Council. Don't you think it is inconvenient for 
the country to be facing a possible confrontation between the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches in the midst of a 
political campaign? Also, is it possible that you are being 
driven by your desire to get to the OAS? 
  [Gaviria] [Words indistinct] I was not referring to this. I 
know the State Council is not motivated by such intentions. No. 
We presented this issue. I am concerned because the State 
Council has said that there is a lack of legal precedent and 
there are irregularities with the way in which the decision was 
made. If [words indistinct] it would have been easier to decide 
and see what would happen. But we are confronted with an 
opinion or a simple declaration. 
  I am not quarrelsome, but I do defend what I believe. I am 
not intimidated by any decision or argument. I fight for the 
things in which I firmly believe. I am not angry. I don't 
usually get mad, but I do have firm convictions and what you are 
hearing from me right here is just that: my firm convictions. 
  I believe the legal arguments we forwarded to the State 
Council are valid. I continue to believe they are valid. The 
State Council's communique did not deny those arguments. I will 
continue to fight for our legal arguments and for the national 
interest. Many things are at risk here: all international 
cooperation received by Colombia designed to strengthen its 
public forces and to help in its struggle against drug 
trafficking. All this is in jeopardy. I believe this is 
serious and dangerous for the country, and I am not willing -- 
simply so that I can look fresh and at ease -- not to fight for 
this. I will fight. I will struggle. I will defend my 
arguments. I will contest this, and I will leave no question 
unanswered. I will continue this legal and political struggle 
until the end. I will do so peacefully and convinced that our 
position will prevail.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in Santa Fe de </F>
Bogota -- live relay] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens, at noon today I addressed the 
nation via a radio network to outline the national government's 
position in connection with a declaration that the State Council 
issued last night regarding the presence of foreign troops in 
the national territory. I do not want to take up a lot of your 
time, but I want to summarize the positions I outlined, with the 
certainty that you will share your president's position on this 
issue, which has awakened the whole country's interest. 
  Yesterday I learned, calmly but with some surprise, about 
the 
communique issued by the State Council, in which the Council 
members state they are not satisfied with the arguments that I 
outlined in connection with the legal basis which allows 
military personnel from other countries to conduct joint 
exercises with Colombian military forces, in compliance with old 
practices and based on international agreements. 
  It is deplorable that the sound legal document I 
respectuflly 
forwarded to that judicial organization a few days ago resulted 
in the issuance of a press communique which lacks legal grounds, 
and about which I had to learn through the media instead of 
through the proper channels -- as if it were more important to 
create an atmosphere of public opinion than to stictly carry out 
a legal procedure. This attitude contrasts with the one I 
assumed toward the State Council, to which I submitted all 
explanations in a detailed and reserved manner, aware of the 
implications that this debate has for our country -- both at 
national and international levels. 
  I received the news with the tranquility of knowing that 
this 
type of operation is necessary, useful, and timely for Colombia. 
I also felt confident that the juridical arguments, which the 
State Council rejected, are solid; that the decisions adopted do 
not violate the Constitution that now includes, through this 
government's leadership, the great changes that Colombian 
society demanded for many years for its political organization. 
  I believed, and still believe, it was necessary to 
strengthen 
control mechanisms and give congress the tools to fulfill its 
function of supervising the executive branch's actions. Hence, 
we will be ready to provide the explanations that Congress, the 
organization to which the State Council decided to forward this 
issue, considers pertinent -- with the assurance they will not 
be disregarded with the stroke of a pen. Instead, they will be 
carefully and calmly analyzed. 
  Judging from the laconic statement issued by the judicial 
organization, it seems the State Council has given this 
constitutional disposition a significance it evidently does not 
have. The idea is to claim that there is an obligation to 
request that the Senate or State Council authorize the transit 
of foreign troops in our country; this means that this 
authorization must be obtained to allow the arrival of any 
foreign military personnel in Colombia -- regardless of their 
purpose. 
  An interpretation like this leads to the absurdity of 
demanding permission for the arrival of military attaches that 
dozens of other countries have in Colombia, just as we have 
attaches in dozens of other countries. Similarly, a joint 
intelligence operation for capturing a criminal would require a 
prior Senate meeting and statement. Also, old and existing 
international agreements, such as the Inter-American Reciprocal 
Assistance Agreement and the 1952 Military Assistance Agreement, 
would cease to exist as if by magic and Colombia would feel free 
to violate them. 
  The State Council's statement is not judicial in nature. It 
simply reports a fact to Congress. It is worth mentioning that 
all documents have been provided by the government. The 
judicial body has said only that it finds them unconvincing. As 
a consequence of this decision, the State Council admits it 
lacks authority to assess the alleged violation of the 
Constitution and take the proper action, all of which is up to 
the Congress. 
  The State Council's statement is not legal in nature. It is 
rather political. The baseness of the Council's assertions and 
the Council president's argument that a little school can be 
built by Colombian artisans do not deserve an answer. 
  As long as an authoritative organization does not announce a 
ruling, we will continue to endorse international cooperation 
and the joint exercises that the government regards as essential 
to improve our military forces. In addition, this cooperation 
and exercises are based on international agreements that the 
Congress has ratified. These exercises are but part of these 
agreements. 
  The State Council's opinion also casts doubts on the 
cooperation, intelligence, and advisors vital in the fight 
against criminal drug trafficking organizations. For this 
reason, the radical interpretation contained in the State 
Council's press communique only benefits drug traffickers and 
weakens our capability for confronting crime. 
  Colombians: I admit other people's right to disagree with 
the 
joint exercises on Colombia's Pacific coast. Nevertheless, I 
cannot overlook a minor legal interpretation that would force us 
to cancel other operations indispensable to defending the 
country from crime and drug trafficking. 
  The government has admitted that there are gaps in reports 
released to the public. This perhaps has led a number of people 
to criticize the military cooperation under way with the United 
States. In the specific instance of Juanchaco, I regard as 
necessary the emphasis that the foreigners therein are military 
engineers who, paid by the U.S. Government, are conducting a 
military engineering exercise in conjunction with the Colombian 
Armed Forces. It is just a matter of teaching and practicing, 
sharing technical construction techniques in tropical areas, and 
solving logistics and communications problems which our men 
would eventually have to cope with in various situations. 
  But instead, if wasting that energy building things that 
are useful, they devote it to civic and solidarity objectives. 
The school, the health center, the road are only byproducts of 
that joint military engineering training, which will by the way 
benefit the region and community. 
  U.S. military engineers are in an area totally controlled by 
the Colombian National Navy and are working under the 
supervision of military forces. We have conducted diverse joint 
actions with the U.S. Government to improve and make more 
efficient the operations of our public forces. We have obtained 
various technologies, embodied in the radar guided and operated 
by Colombians, and for which U.S. personnel offer advice and 
maintenance. 
  We have carried out joint engineering exercises for the 
construction of different projects. Today in the United States 
there are close to 100 Colombian soldiers participating in 
operations similar to those now being questioned in Colombia, 
and no one even thinks that the presence of those personnel 
there endangers the sovereignty of that country. 
  In all this debate there are at least two contradictions. 
The first is to think that the search for better training and 
greater efficiency of the Colombian public force violates our 
sovereignty, when in reality it is aimed at guaranteeing our 
sovereignty. Sovereignty would be in greater danger in a country 
in the hands of criminals and drug traffickers, in a state 
without the capacity to respond to criminal activity, or in a 
state confused by hundreds of clandestine flights of foreign and 
national aircraft involved in drug trafficking, than in a state 
that relies on international cooperation to guarantee law and 
the legitimate exercise of its citizens' rights. 
  We have requested support from the international community 
in 
the courageous struggle that we Colombians have waged against 
the large drug trafficking organizations, and it is surprising 
that we now say that this jeopardizes our sovereignty. As 
someone once said, international cooperation is not represented 
by pats on the back but by training and logistical support, 
among other things. 
  Sovereignty is not a rhetorical concept defended in speeches 
in public squares at a campaign rally or by making a small fuss 
over anti-U.S. chauvinism, opportunistic nationalism, or 
populism. Our independence in international relations is open 
to the scrutiny of all. It is measured by the way in which we 
have acted in different international forums, the way in which 
our representatives have voted at the UN, the OAS, and other 
multilateral organizations. It is measured by our active 
participation in groups such as the Nonaligned Movement or the 
Group of 77. It is measured by the establishment of relations 
with Cuba. In sum, it is measured by the real and permanent 
dynamics that have placed Colombia in a position of leadership 
in Latin America. 
  Citizens: Sovereignty is defended by facing with courage the 
enemies of the fatherland, those who affect the security of 
citizens, those who abuse and violate our territory, our rivers, 
our sea, our airspace to further their criminal activities. 
Sovereignty is not an hypothetical concept. It is not a simple 
dead letter in our laws or the Constitution. We are more 
sovereign when we are able to exercise more control. We are 
more sovereign when we strengthen the capacity of the Armed 
Forces of Colombia to fulfill their duty to defend the security 
and safety of the country. We are more sovereign when we obtain 
the support of allies who support us in our struggle against 
those who do not have a fatherland, who kill our women and 
children, our decent people. That is defending sovereignty. 
  Those who claim to be nationalistic and cry out loud about 
the alleged violation of our sovereignty by permitting the 
presence of technicians and military engineers from other 
countries are dead wrong. Our enemies are powerful. In order 
that we might defeat them, it is not enough to rely on our own 
technology, abilities, and calls for sacrifices. We need 
solidarity and support. 
  What would have come of Europe if its leaders had not formed 
an alliance to fight the threat of Hitler? Also, what would 
have come of Colombia if we had rejected international aid in 
our struggle against the then-called Medellin Cartel? 
  Would we be more free, more sovereign, more independent, 
living under the tyranny of Escobar's narcoterrorism? Would we 
be more free, more sovereign, more independent, allowing our 
airspace to be violated by criminals from all countries and all 
ilks? Would we be more independent, more free, more sovereign, 
allowing drug traffickers to have all the technological advances 
at their disposal while we seek refuge under our modest 
technical means and renounce international help? 
  The president does not think so. Therefore, until 7 August, 
when my mandate ends, I will continue with my efforts to broaden 
our democracy, modernize our country, suppress poverty and 
injustice, and untiringly confront those who generate 
destabilization and fear until they are brought to their knees. 
I will not hesitate -- out of fear of a debate -- in making or 
supporting decisions, such as the one being debated, within the 
framework of the Constitution, which this government knows well, 
as long as I believe that it serves said purposes which are 
shared by the majority of Colombians who prefer to open up to 
the future rather than hold on to the past. 
  Good night, and many thanks.

<F P=106> [Report by Liliana Gutierrez, Alvaro Ayala, Azucena Lievano, </F>
and Raul Gutierrez for the "24 Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] While President Cesar Gaviria used strong terms -- 
offensive, according to some people -- when referring to the 
State Council, Magistrate Amado Gutierrez said the problem is 
not the fight; it is a matter of discussing a juridical issue. 
  [Begin Gutierrez recording] Our Constitution is called the 
political constitution of Colombia and, given that we are 
dealing with a constitutional problem, it is obviously a 
political problem. However, we are not talking about politicking 
or lowly actions that are sometimes given prominence. [end 
recording] 
  He added that members of the State Council do not work for 
drug traffickers, adding the important thing is that the country 
should be told the truth about what the U.S. troops came to do 
with their weapons in Colombia. 
  [Begin Gutierrez recording] They are not military advisers 
who came to teach us how to operate the radar or sophisticated 
modern airplanes. No, they are armed personnel who came to stay 
in the country. [end recording] 
  The State Council president insisted this is not simple 
patriotism. What happens is that there is a Constitution, and 
we must advocate adherence to this Constitution. Hence, it is 
necessary to state and discuss the issue. They have issued the 
report and the Chamber of Representatives' Investigation and 
Accusation Committee must now continue the process. 
  Moreover, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta today 
asked 
the State Council and President Gaviria to handle carefully the 
debate surrounding the U.S. troops' presence in Colombia. 
  [Begin Arrieta recording] This is unfortunate, and I hereby 
issue an appeal. I urge them to please stop referring to each 
other in the terms in which they have been doing, and I ask them 
to treat each other with due respect. I believe they are 
engaged in a pointless argument; I think this debate has not 
been given the appropriate level required by juridical 
controversies between two institutions that are so important. 
[end recording] 
  The conflict has arisen after various months of 
misinformation about the U.S. troops' presence in the country. 
This was confirmed by a high-ranking government source. 
President Gaviria personally admitted today the information on 
Juanchaco was poorly handled. Narino Palace sources said the 
government refrained from assigning importance to the issue 
since its inception, when the media learned about the U.S. 
troops' presence on the Pacific coast. The military forces 
thought it was a political issue which they did not have to 
handle. The same source said the Defense Ministry answered the 
media's questions by reflex. 
  [Begin Admiral Hernando Garcia recording] The only murky 
thing here is the climate because it rains every day. [laughter 
in background] The rest is absolutely clear. You may wonder 
why there are so many machines. It is simple: The Americans are 
very cautious and they bring... [pauses] If a bulldozer breaks 
down they have another one to use because they have the means to 
do so. [end recording] 
  On that occasion, the government claims, things were not 
clearly explained, but it was not a matter of withholding 
information -- it only involved a small school, a health center, 
and the construction of a highway. The same source said the 
government had no intention of misconstruing things -- it simply 
grabbed the first thing at hand. The president initially tried 
to present it as a humanitarian action. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] There are U.S. troops in Colombia. 
They are engaged in civilian actions and are fulfilling advisory 
duties. [end recording] 
  The president personally revealed the truth barely three 
days 
ago. It actually involved a joint military engineering corps 
exercise. The important thing was not the school; it was 
training for the Colombian public forces. The president thought 
the issue would quickly be forgotten. However, the topic has 
been in the news for a month; the truth has been withheld from 
the country for five months. 
  The controversy caused by the U.S. troops' presence, 
following the State Council's decision, has provoked a veritable 
flood of fax messages. Some of the opinions are thus summarized: 
  Liberal Party Senator Rafael Amador said the government 
cannot argue now that the foreign troops' presence is a result 
of technical cooperation plans, when the treaties and agreements 
on which it is based are strictly military. 
  Liberal Party Senator Humberto Pelaez deplored the fact that 
the government ignored the Senate's second committee, which is 
in charge of procedures for authorizing the arrival of foreign 
troops in the country based on international treaties like the 
TIAR [Inter- American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty]. 
  Colombian communists demand the defense minister's 
resignation, the replacement of high-ranking military officers 
with men of patriotic spirit, and the U.S. troops' immediate 
departure from the national territory. 
  Congressman Heverth Bustamante of the 19 April Movement said 
these violations of the political charter and sovereignty should 
be carefully investigated. 
  Ramiro Velasquez, a conservative and vice chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee, said Gaviria 
betrayed the homeland and failed in his duty -- with the Liberal 
Party's support. 
  Former President Alfonso Lopez, member of the International 
Relations Advisory Board, said the State Council's statement 
failed to take into consideration certain aspects of 
international law, like the multilateral treaties which bind 
Colombia regarding the interpretation of what constitutes 
foreign troops and warships.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government today decided to open the doors of 
Juanchaco to show just what the U.S. soldiers are doing there. 
Miriam Ortiz confirmed that military exercises are being 
conducted and they are running two weeks behind schedule. 
  [Ortiz] Today, as the State Council is posing serious 
questions about the president's having permitted the entry of 
foreign troops without permission, the doors of Juanchaco opened 
up and a new perspective appeared on the presence of U.S. 
soldiers here. The minister of defense said these troops did 
not come to the country to build a school and a health center. 
He said they came to conduct military engineering exercises. 
  [Defense minister] Pardo also said that there has been 
disinformation regarding this case. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Was the president of the Republic 
also misinformed? 
  [Pardo] Why? 
  [Ortiz] Because he did not know that the presence of the 
U.S. 
soldiers here... 
  [Pardo, interrupting] No, no. What happens is that they have 
tried to build up a case here. Things have been blown out of 
proportion. The president appoints some officials. He appoints 
a minister of defense or any other portfolio so that the 
minister exercises the duties. [end recording] 
  [Ortiz] The minister also said he does not agree with the 
opinion of the State Council, adding that if this judgement is 
allowed to advance, it will pose a danger to international 
cooperation. He explained that as part of this practice, 163 
U.S. military engineers are building this health center with 
four rooms and a school with four classrooms, all for $100,000. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] What we are all wondering is why 
has the work been delayed? 
  [Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo] First, because of the winter. 
Even though January is a summer month, it rained a great deal. 
[end recording] 
  All climatic and topographic difficulties in which the 
Americans wanted to carry out this type of engineering exercise 
have been found in this part of the country. It rains every day 
in Juanchaco. But paradoxically thanks to the rains the work is 
running two weeks behind schedule. 
  [end recording] [U.S. Army Captain Clark] We've had some 
problems with the weather. 
  [Ortiz] When will you leave? 
  [Capt. Clark] When the work has been completed. [end 
recording] 
  [Ortiz] For their personal security, these soldiers are 
carrying 132 MA-16 rifles and 10 9mm pistols. In addition, they 
are being guarded by 60 Colombian soldiers. 
  During this visit, it was also learned that there is a 
second 
part of these exercises scheduled for 1995, which has been 
postponed for the time being.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Liberals have brought back the color red of times 
past in their publicity. Modern billboards with a cardinal 
bird, an attractive young woman, and seductive lips will 
persuade the electorate of the importance of voting for the 
Liberal Party candidates. Pedro Gomez was tasked with changing 
the party's image. 
  [Begin Gomez recording] The goal is to motivate those who 
are 
liberal to participate, as well as to make them remember the 
party's achievements. [end recording] 
  Beyond the red billboards, the Liberals have changed their 
old hymn and put modern music to their messages on voting, 
social welfare, and divorce. Things at the Conservative Party 
are different. The day after tomorrow, Andres Pastrana will 
make his presidential candidacy official, and the Conservative 
National Directorate [DCN] is working full steam ahead on the 
preparations for the 18 February convention, which will seek to 
draft a platform for the candidate, who undoubtedly will be 
Pastrana. 
  [Begin DCN member Cornelio Reyes recording] The name of 
Andres Pastrana is gaining more supporters as the party, its 
masses, and leaders are aware that he is the only viable, 
possible, and winning option. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by EL TIEMPO Economic Editorial Staff: "Economy, </F>
Better Than Businesses"] 
  [Text] For most businessmen, 1993 was definitely not the 
best of years. Although the growth of the economy as a whole was 
good, the manufacturing sector's profits were impaired, and low 
demand hurt the productive sector's performance significantly. 
  At the beginning of the year, the expectations were 
optimistic. After all, the country had emerged from one of the 
most severe electric power rationings of recent history. 
  Nevertheless, the businessmen's forecasts were not 
completely 
fulfilled; and this was demonstrated by the results of EL 
TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll (EOE) that, during the four 
quarters of 1993, sought the opinion of 300 businessmen from the 
economy's principal categories. 
  The latest poll, which assessed business performance between 
October and December of last year, indicates that the year's end 
maintained the tendency of the previous quarters. 
  Although the manufacturing industry's production and the 
services sector's sales increased more than during the third 
quarter, this was not reflected in earnings: According to 57 
percent of the 300 businessmen queried, profits after taxes 
declined or remained stable. 
  The traditional increase in demand during the Christmas 
season did not salvage the year, as many businessmen in the 
industrial sector were expecting. The apparent explanation for 
this is the competition generated by the "apertura" [economic 
liberalization] process. 
  In fact, apertura has been increasingly indicated as a 
problem of the economy and of business firms in the EOE results. 
During the first quarter, manufacturers and merchants were not 
expressing very marked concern over the deregulation of imports. 
  Nevertheless, in the second quarter fear began to be sensed; 
and, in the latest EOE poll, it became obvious that the 
competition generated by foreign products has become the main 
problem hurting businesses. 
<H5>  Growth and Predictions </H5>
  If the results for industry, agriculture, and commerce were 
not as satisfactory as had been expected, how does one explain 
the fact that the economy grew 5.16 percent last year, according 
to the latest estimates from the National Department of Planning 
(DNP)? 
  Much of the performance of the gross domestic product (GDP) 
is explained by construction, which grew 9.3 percent in 1993; 
the machinery and equipment industry, which dynamized the 
manufacturing sector's results; and public spending which, 
according to the Finance Ministry, contributed nearly 25 percent 
of the final results. 
  This means that the prosperity of other sectors managed to 
offset the problems of demand and reduced profits faced by 
businessmen in the agricultural sector and certain branches of 
industry. 
  Moreover, the poll for the last quarter showed that no one 
would have wagered on a 5.16 percent growth in the product. They 
began the year predicting a 3.21 variation; and, in the final 
quarter, not one of the 300 businessmen queried dared to mention 
over 4.32 percent. 
  On the other hand, they were correct in the prediction of 
cost of living, because, on the average, the businessmen queried 
by the EOE mentioned 22.6 percent inflation for last year. In 
1994, they expect the price index to be reduced to 21.6 percent. 
  And what about rating the management of the economy? 
Apparently, manufacturers and merchants have not changed their 
views in this regard, and believe that the direction of the 
economy is not the best. The government's economic team received 
a rating of 3.2 out of five during the first quarter, and that 
figure rose to only 3.49 in December of last year. 
<H5>  Eighth Economic Opinion Poll </H5>
  The eighth Economic Opinion Poll sought the opinions of 300 
businessmen regarding the performance of production, sales, and 
employment in seven major industrial and services activities 
during the final quarter of last year. 
  The EOE, which has been taken since March 1992, also gauges 
businessmen' expectations for the performance of the cost of 
living and the growth of the gross domestic product. On this 
occasion, factors such as workers' productivity and their wage 
level were evaluated as well.

<H5>  Industry, a Mediocre Year </H5>
  The improvement in production that the Holy Child left for 
manufacturers last year did not suffice for their recovery to 
the levels registered during the final quarter of 1992. 
  Although, during the Christmas season, production rose for 
44.9 percent of businessmen, this rate is far removed from the 
one attained between October and December 1992, when 68 percent 
of businessmen posted gains. 
  Despite this decline, the outlook for businessmen improved 
substantially, considering the fact that, in the second quarter 
of last year, only 29.2 percent of those interviewed in the 
Economic Opinion Poll claimed that their production had risen. 
  Another indicator that there are winds of recovery (albeit 
mild) relates to the performance of profits, which declined in 
that period for 55 percent of businessmen; whereas, during the 
Christmas season, they were lower for only 32 percent. However, 
it is still disturbing that profits should be declining for that 
percentage of manufacturers. 
  One of the sectors hardest hit by the drop in profits is the 
textile industry. According to calculations made by the 
Colombian Textile Producers Association (Ascoltex), 80 percent 
of the companies had a negative balance last year. 
  The textile firms, like other industries, have been hurt by 
contraband, underbilling, and the importing of products at 
prices below cost. 
  Moreover, apertura has helped to foster the most intense 
specter hovering over the industry last year: low demand. 
  The complaint from businessmen all year long was over the 
decline in the volume of orders, and the substitution of 
national products with imports. 
<H5>  Painful Apertura </H5>
  Although the apertura program has enabled businessmen to 
reduce their modernization costs, owing to the lower taxes on 
machinery imports, it has been a headache for income and profits. 
  The competition from imports has forced businessmen to 
moderate the increases in prices of their products, so as to be 
able to remain on the market. 
  Since this belt-tightening is done by force on many 
occasions, and not because of a drop in production costs, 
earnings and income are being impaired. 
  According to 54.4 percent of businessmen, apertura has had 
an 
unfavorable effect on their profits; and only 20.5 percent claim 
that it has had a beneficial effect on their earnings. 
  As for income levels, 44.1 percent of those interviewed 
think 
that it has had a negative effect on them, whereas only 20 
percent consider its effect positive. 
  Where the opinions are divided is on the effect of apertura 
on employment. Half of the businessmen think that it has had no 
effect, whereas 31.5 percent attribute an unfavorable effect to 
it.

<H5>  Stable Employment Except for Farming Areas </H5>
  With the exception of the agricultural sector, Colombian 
businesses did not have any traumatic experiences on the 
employment level during the final quarter of last year. 
  Based on the responses from half the businessmen queried by 
EL TIEMPO, between October and December the numbers of jobs 
remained stable, as had occurred during the previous quarters. 
  The situation is explained by the absorption of new workers 
on the part of sectors such as construction and services, which 
compensated for the predicament in the farming areas. 
  In fact, during the quarter that has just ended, the boom in 
building activity continued, generating an increased demand for 
labor. 
  Medium-sized business had a particularly dynamic performance 
with respect to the generation of jobs, as did exporters. 
  Nevertheless, the fact that 44 percent of the farmers 
questioned claimed that their personnel rosters were cut 
corroborates, once again, the evidence of a crisis in the sector. 
  The decline in production in the farming areas, combined 
with 
the elimination of certain crops, the insecurity, and the low 
investment by businessmen, sustained the recession. 
  Despite this, the government's data and that of the farmers 
themselves warrant the prediction of a recovery beginning this 
year. 
<H5>  Transportation Boom </H5>
  Nevertheless, and contrary to what might be expected, the 
farmers joined with the majority of economic sectors in agreeing 
on the slight effect of the apertura program on employment. 
  A total of 57 percent of the businessmen polled claimed that 
the process undertaken by the government has not generated a 
crisis in their personnel rosters. 
  The results appear to confirm the latest figure from the 
National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), showing 
that the unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 percent in 1993. 
Therefore, the fear of a massive layoff generated by the 
internationalization of the economy has been precluded. 
  In cases such as that of the transportation firms, the 
effect 
of apertura on employment was particularly favorable. This 
performance may be explained if one considers the boom in 
imports and, hence, the greater movement of freight from port 
terminals. 
  On the other hand, some manufacturers claimed that the 
process had a negative effect on their companies' payroll. The 
sector hardest hit was medium-sized industry, while the effect 
on large industry was slighter. 
  This is explained by the desire to cut production costs, so 
that an exaggerated price increase will not occur.

<H5>  Construction Climbed Another Floor </H5>
  Despite the aggravating formalities, construction became one 
of the sectors that contributed most to the growth of the gross 
domestic product (GDP) during 1993. 
  Nevertheless, during the final quarter of last year, the 
sector slowed down, owing to the problems of raw material 
shortages. 
  According to the builders, the sector's main problem is the 
formalities required with the planning authorities, which are 
making it increasingly difficult to obtain a permit. 
  Moreover, insecurity has become the second factor upsetting 
the construction industry. Based on the results of EL TIEMPO's 
Economic Opinion Poll, 26 percent of those polled consider the 
sector's main problem to be insecurity. 
<H5>  Sales Stagnant </H5>
  The slowdown in the construction industry is reflected by 
the 
stagnation in sales recorded during the past three months. 
  A total of 66 percent of the builders polled claimed that 
the 
final quarter sales remained stable in comparison with the 
previous period; while 26 percent reported growth, and 6.7 
percent noted that sales had declined. 
  Similarly, 53 percent of the construction firms froze their 
personnel rosters; while 33 percent expanded them, and only 6.7 
percent reduced their employee payroll. 
  The construction companies are relatively optimistic 
regarding Colombia's economic growth in 1994: 53 percent think 
that the GDP will rise between 4 and 5 percent; while a quarter 
of those polled expect the economy to grow between 5 and 6 
percent. 
  According to the construction businessmen, the apertura 
process has been favorable, or has had no effect on the sector. 
Only 6.7 percent think that the internationalization of the 
economy has been detrimental to the construction industry. 
  With regard to inflation, two-thirds of the businessmen 
queried believe that the 19 percent goal will not be met this 
year; on the other hand, they think that the CPI [Consumer Price 
Index] will be more or less the same as that of last year.

<H5>  Insecurity Less Disturbing </H5>
  Although insecurity is still the chief problem of the 
Colombian economy, its effect has begun to wane, according to 
many businessmen. 
  This is inferred from the Economic Opinion Poll taken by EL 
TIEMPO, in which 26 percent of those interviewed considered it 
the most disturbing factor during 1993. 
  Nevertheless, it is less so when that figure is compared 
with 
the 46 percent of persons polled who cited it as the main 
problem during the third quarter of 1993, and the 59 percent of 
businessmen who regarded it as the most disturbing factor during 
the period October-December 1992. 
  The insecurity reflected in the guerrilla attacks, terrorist 
assaults, kidnappings, ticket selling, and common crime has been 
an obstacle in recent years to the strengthening of the economy 
and to increased foreign investment. 
  For a long time, Colombia has been considered abroad as a 
nation in which investment is not advisable, owing to the risks 
that businessmen and foreign capital might run. 
  Nevertheless, during the past few months the public order 
atmosphere has improved. With the death of the Medellin Cartel 
chief, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, and the possible surrender of the 
Cali Cartel chiefs, hopes of a new climate of peace in the 
national territory have been reinforced. 
  The transportation sector appears to be one of those most 
damaged by insecurity. This was the view of 50 percent of those 
interviewed. 
<H5>  Revaluation a Worry </H5>
  Another problem that is still besetting the improved 
performance of the Colombian economy is the apertura process, 
which has been translated into greater competition for national 
products. 
  The economy's nationalization, in effect for four years, has 
proven unfavorable for the agricultural-livestock sector, which 
has complained of unfair competition from the subsidies applied 
by other nations to their products. 
  Yet another very disturbing factor is the policy of 
revaluation, or strengthening of the peso with respect to the 
dollar. It was promoted last year for the purpose of preventing 
a greater rise in the cost of living. 
  The uncertainty surrounding the economic management, which 
had been a highly disturbing factor, moved to a secondary level. 
Only 10 percent of those polled claimed it to be the principal 
economic problem. Apparently, there is greater confidence 
regarding the goals proposed by the government and the direction 
of the monetary, exchange, and credit policies. 
  Oddly enough, contraband appears to be a lesser problem, 
despite the constant complaints from businessmen of its damaging 
repercussions on the economy. 
  When the problems of Colombian business firms are analyzed, 
the fears become reversed. Insecurity is not so important, while 
apertura and revaluation definitely are. 
  The effects of revaluation are especially disturbing to the 
agricultural and industrial sectors. This is understandable when 
one considers the fact that they are receiving less income from 
the exports of their products. 
  On repeated occasions, producers, and especially exporters, 
have insisted that the devaluation rate should be higher. In 
1993, the devaluation was 13 percent, and a similar trend is 
anticipated for this year. 
  Their argument is that, despite the efforts that they are 
making to compete, their profitability will not improve unless 
there is a shift in the exchange policy.

<H5>  Insecurity Killing Transportation </H5>
  Insecurity has the transportation companies stalled. 
Although 
there have been no terrorist attacks on buses and trucks during 
recent months, kidnapping and ticket selling are still a 
disturbing factor for transportation businessmen. Proof of this 
is the fact that a high proportion of company owners queried 
refused to answer the question about the performance of their 
profits. 
  According to EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll, although 
apertura increased the supply of freight, it also facilitated 
the entry of imported vehicles, which have flooded the market 
and caused a decline in the sector's profitability. 
  Of the total number polled, 40 percent claimed that sales 
had 
risen during the final quarter of last year, while 25 percent 
maintained that the demand for their services had been reduced 
considerably. A small proportion reported stability in their 
sales. 
  A similar situation occurred in the case of profits. Whereas 
40 percent of the businessmen indicated that they remained 
stable between October and December of last year, a quarter of 
those queried claimed to have had losses in their operations. 
Nevertheless, 20 percent noted that their profits had risen 
during the quarter. 
<H5>  Personnel Rosters Frozen </H5>
  Despite the difficulties confronting the sector, during the 
final quarter of 1993 there were no massive layoffs of workers. 
Half of the companies questioned froze the personnel payroll, 
while 25 percent expanded it, and only 15 percent reduced the 
employee roster. 
  In the opinion of most transportation businessmen, the 
government's economic management deserves a rating of 3.5; while 
30 percent of the businessmen polled even gave it a grade of 4.0 
on a scale of one to five. 
  Based on the inquiries made in the EOE, the transportation 
sector approves of the government's target for economic growth 
this year: 40 percent of them believe that the GDP will grow 5 
percent during 1994. However, a quarter of the businessmen 
indicated that this year's GDP would fluctuate between 3 and 4 
percent. 
  The same thing holds true of inflation: 35 percent of the 
transportation businessmen polled believe that this year's CPI 
will stand between 19 and 20 percent. 
  Nevertheless, a quarter of the businessmen queried claim 
that 
the government's inflation target will not be met, because it 
will exceed 22 percent. Others think that the CPI will exceed 
its bounds in 1994, reaching levels of over 25 percent.

<H5>  Exporters Improve Profits </H5>
  Despite the peso revaluation, the economic stagnation in the 
developed countries, and the decline in certain international 
prices, exporters ended the year better off than expected. 
  During the last quarter of 1993, sales increased for half of 
the businessmen, and remained stable for 22.9 percent. This was 
converted into the year's best performance, with the exception 
of the first quarter. 
  During the 1992 Christmas season, the sector registered a 
slight recovery, because on that occasion sales increased for 
only 46 percent of businessmen, according to the results of EL 
TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll. 
  Although profits improved, they are still the main source of 
concern to a third of the businessmen polled. 
  During the Christmas season, according to 30.5 percent of 
those interviewed, their profits increased; whereas 33.9 percent 
thought that they had declined. 
  This performance shows a substantial improvement over the 
results for the July-September quarter, when 55.3 percent of the 
businessmen posted reductions in their profits. 
  The revaluation that coexisted with exporters throughout the 
year became one of the main factors depressing the sector's 
profits. 
  The slower rate of currency devaluation caused businessmen 
to 
receive fewer pesos for their sales abroad, while this proved to 
be a good deal for importers. 
  Last year, the devaluation was 13 percent, whereas in 1992 
it 
stood at 14.84 percent. 
  The other two problems hurting the exporting sector were 
insecurity and apertura. 
  The most negative effect of apertura was concentrated on 
profits: 47.5 percent of those polled thought that it had an 
unfavorable influence on their earnings. 
  This is due to the fact that most business firms combine 
their export labor with internal sales. Hence, the competition 
from imported products and unfair commercial practices that 
caused anxiety for industry also harmed this sector. 
  The effort expended by exporters to improve their 
productivity is noteworthy. By the year's end, 60 percent had 
achieved gains in this respect, and only 6.8 percent registered 
declines. 
  The government estimates that the increase in foreign sales 
will be 5.6 percent at the end of 1993. 
  However, judging from the performance of exports between 
January and September, this goal does not appear readily 
attainable. 
  The latest report from the National Administrative 
Department 
of Statistics showed a 13.5 percent rise in nontraditional 
exports as of September. 
  This increase managed to offset the decline in sales of 
coffee, oil, fuels, and other banner products, and prevented the 
occurrence of a drop in total sales, which rose 2.0 percent.

<H5>  Skepticism Regarding 1994 Inflation </H5>
  Colombian businessmen remain skeptical concerning the 19 
percent inflation target set for 1994, but are optimistic about 
the growth of the Colombian economy. 
  Although the government and the Bank of the Republic's board 
of directors have claimed that they will do everything in their 
power to meet that goal, only 17 percent of those polled expect 
inflation to stand between 19 and 20 percent. The remaining 50 
percent, on the other hand, claim that it will be higher. 
  The uncertainty regarding the performance of the cost of 
living continues, because many sectors expect food prices to 
start rebounding. 
  Nevertheless, with the latest measures adopted, the 
government took the first steps toward meeting its goal. It 
readjusted prices of fuel and public services, with the 
exception of electric power, based on the anticipated inflation. 
And, for the first time, it raised the salaries of public 
workers and the legal minimum wage below the inflation rate of 
the immediately previous year. 
  As for the rise of inflation in 1993, precisely, half of 
those polled agreed on a figure, indicating that it would stand 
between 22 and 23 percent. Another 30 percent predicted that it 
would be higher. 
  At the end of 1993, the cost of living stood at 22.6 
percent, 
according to data furnished by the National Administrative 
Department of Statistics. 
<H5>  Economy Will Grow </H5>
  Regarding the growth in the gross domestic product, 31 
percent of the businessmen claim that, by the end of this year, 
the increase in goods and services produced in the country will 
range between 4.0 and 5.0 percent. The government maintains that 
it will be 5.0 percent. 
  This index is similar to that for the growth registered in 
1993 that, according to the preliminary figures submitted by the 
National Department of Planning, was 5.16 percent. 
  A remaining 22 percent are more optimistic, expecting the 
growth in the economy to exceed 5.0 percent. 
  The uncertainty over a greater increase is associated with 
the change that might occur in public spending, which was one of 
the main driving forces of the economy last year. 
  However, sectors such as construction and transportation, 
which contributed much to the increase, could begin to show a 
decline. 
  Nevertheless, the government claims that it will compensate 
for these possible reductions with an impetus to infrastructure, 
primarily to road construction and rehabilitation. 
  With respect to the growth in the GDP for 1993, 48 percent 
of 
the businessmen interviewed were more cautious, indicating that 
it would stand between 3.0 and 4.0 percent. On the other hand, 
26 percent thought that it could reach 4.0 or 5.0 percent; and 
only 11 percent estimated that the figure might prove higher. 
  In general, manufacturers believe that the economic picture 
in 1994 will be quite similar to that during the immediately 
previous year. 
<H5>  Workers: Fair in Productivity </H5>
  If it were finally decided to adjust the minimum wage based 
on the workers' productivity, Colombians would not come out so 
badly. However, they would not have excellent results either. 
  According to the rating given by 300 businessmen queried in 
the Economic Opinion Poll, white collar workers would receive 
7.3 points out of 10 on the productivity scale. 
  Although it is a medium grade, the businessmen claimed it to 
be higher than the rating that the workers would have received 
before apertura. 
  In fact, 54 percent of those polled reported that the 
efficiency of their labor increased throughout the year; whereas 
only seven percent cited any decline. 
  And there is every indication that the rating rose as a 
result of the competition generated by apertura. Both 
businessmen and workers had to adjust to the standards of their 
international competitors, so as not be excluded from the market. 
  The progress was especially significant in agroindustrial, 
manufacturing, and commercial firms. 
<H5>  Without Purchasing Power </H5>
  Nevertheless, the improvement was not reflected in the 
monthly salaries of operative workers in companies: 52.3 percent 
are earning between the minimum wage and 200,000 pesos. 
  This means that the majority of white-collar workers cannot 
purchase the basic family shopping basket which, according to 
October data from the National Administrative Department of 
Statistics, costs 195,418 pesos. 
  Only 31 percent of the workers have the necessary purchasing 
power to buy the items included in the basket for one month. 
  They will be even less able to purchase the products in 
1994. 
If the 19 percent inflation target is met, the price of the 
basket for laborers and the lower stratum will reach 232,547 
pesos by the year's end. 
  The sector in which wages are most depressed is agriculture: 
something explained by the decline in that industry's 
profitability. The majority of workers in the farming areas, on 
the medium and low levels, earn even less than 150,000 pesos. 
  The income level for most of the laborers working in 
construction also fails to suffice for the purchase of the DANE 
shopping basket. In fact, 66 percent of the operative white 
collar workers in that sector earn between 150,000 and 200,000 
pesos. 
  The average salaries among administrative workers are 
better: 
39 percent are earning between 350,000 and 450,000 pesos per 
month. This means that they can only purchase the items in the 
basic shopping basket twice.

<H5>  Commerce: Christmas Did Not Meet Expectations </H5>
  Although half of the merchants had increased sales between 
October and December 1993, the results were very poor compared 
with those of the same period in 1992, when they rose to 86 
percent. 
  But, low blow and all, the last quarter was the best of the 
year, as is traditional. 
  Commerce is one of the sectors benefiting most from the 
reactivation prompted by the Christmas celebrations, even more 
than industry, because it distributes both national and imported 
products. 
  It is not without reason that EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion 
Poll shows only 10.8 percent of those interviewed reporting 
declines in their sales. 
  Furthermore, the earnings of merchants rebounded during the 
final quarter: 40.5 percent showed increases in their profits, 
while 27.0 percent claimed that they remained stable compared 
with the previous quarter. 
  Although apertura has been beneficial for the sector, 
facilitating imports of goods, it has also allowed contraband to 
remain protected by legal imports. 
  A total of 43.2 percent of those interviewed think that 
apertura has had a favorable influence on their imports; and 
40.5 percent say that it has been beneficial to their income. 
  As for the effect on profits, the opinions are divided: 32.4 
percent indicate that it was positive, and 29.7 percent, that it 
was negative. 
  The dismantling of customs' controls, which occurred after 
the merger of the Tax Directorate and the National Customs, was 
also decisive in converting contraband into one of the sector's 
principal problems. 
  The other major bottleneck for commerce was insecurity, 
which 
surrounded all economic activities. 
  Merchants, who began 1993 rating the government very harshly 
(they gave it a passing grade with three "reprimands"), granted 
it a 3.5 rating at the year's end. 
  According to the EOE, the services sector (excluding the 
financial system) showed a good performance during the final 
quarter of 1993. 
  A total of 54.8 percent of those interviewed reported 
increases in their sales, while 21 percent cited stability. 
  Included in this sector are restaurants, travel agencies, 
and 
consulting firms, among others.

<H5>  Agroindustry Did Not Fare So Badly in 1993 </H5>
  Amid the skepticism that has surrounded rural production, a 
considerable portion of agroindustry achieved gains in its 
principal indicators. 
  According to the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion 
Poll, 32.7 percent of those polled estimated that there was an 
increase in agroindustrial production. In the view of 23 
percent, it remained stable, while another 11.3 percent claimed 
that it had declined. 
  The sector has no confidence in the 19 percent inflation 
target for 1994. Nearly 80 percent of the businessmen queried 
assert that this year's consumer price index will exceed 20 
percent. 
  Contrary to the farmers' opinions, the processors of 
agricultural raw materials claim that apertura has been 
beneficial. 
  Of the businessmen polled, 31 percent did not think that the 
apertura process hurt their profits; and 23 percent stated that 
the economy's internationalization had proven favorable. 
  Similarly, 36 percent claimed that apertura did not hurt 
their sales during the last quarter of 1993; whereas 25 percent 
blamed it for the reduction in their income.

<H5>  Methodology of Public Opinion Poll </H5>
  The Public Opinion Poll sought the opinions of 300 
businessmen from the seven principal sectors comprising the 
gross domestic product. 
  To collect the information, the firm Yankelovich Innova de 
Colombia used the list of 370,000 business firms throughout the 
country produced by the Confederation of Chambers of Commerce 
(Confecamaras). 
  The surveys were answered directly by representatives on the 
management level of the organizations selected. 
  The analysis of the data and writing of the texts were 
performed by the journalists Luis Alberto Lopera (economic 
editor), Jaime Mejia Mazuera, Marcela Escobar Ramirez, 
Jacqueline Guevara, Clara Ines Rueda, Edmer Tovar, Jaime 
Cristancho, and Carlos Fernando Gaitan.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The new discipline and ethics code that has been 
approved empowers the National Police to enforce the most severe 
penalties for violations of the law and the guiding principles 
of the institution. 
  The new statute provides stiff penalties for those who 
engage 
in service-related wrongdoing or who violate police regulations; 
they range from a 30-day suspension without pay to immediate 
dismissal in severe cases. 
  The director general of the police will order dismissals 
after a disciplinary proceeding in which charges will be lodged 
against the defendants, who will then respond to them by 
submitting evidence during the first three days after they are 
formulated. 
  The investigations, which are subject to motions of 
reconsideration and appeal by defendants, may not last longer 
than 30 days, at which time a penalty must be decided on. 
  "This is the toughest statute in the history of the National 
Police. What we are seeking is to preserve discipline and ethics 
in our institution," said the director of police, General 
Octavio Vargas Silva. 
  The statute also provides for fines of up to 15 days' pay 
for 
police personnel who commit service-related infractions or 
violate the disciplinary code. 
  The statute describes what constitute orders from superiors 
and how they are to be carried out and leaves open the 
possibility that subordinates need not comply with such orders 
if they should lead to a punishable act. 
  The new regulations establish procedures for obtaining 
leaves, indicating that they may not exceed five days for police 
personnel. 
<H5>  Anticorruption Measures </H5>
<H3>  Punitive Measures and Incentives 
The following penalties will apply: </H3>

  -  Written reprimand, that is to say, disapproval of the 
implicated party's conduct, entered into the service record. 
  -  A 
fine of up to 15 days basic pay 
  -  Suspension for up to 30 days 
without pay 
  -  Dismissal or termination of employment contract 

    The following incentives will apply: 

  -  Private commendations 
  -  Public commendations 
  -  Monetary 
rewards 
  -  Prizes for the best student 
  -  Honorable 
mentions 
  -  Medals 
  -  Decorations 

<H5>    Violations of the Statute </H5>
  The following are the chief violations of regulations: 

  -  The wearing of improper or nonregulation clothing, 
decorations, medals, or uniforms 
  -  Failure to report on time for 
duty without a valid excuse or reporting for duty under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs. 
  -  Once an incident involving a 
severe breach of the peace has become known, failure to report 
there within the allotted travel time 
  -  Absence without permission 
or just cause from the scene of an incident or from a duty 
post 
  -  Avoidance of service without just cause 
  -  Driving police 
vehicles, piloting police water- or aircraft, or operating 
official equipment or machinery without the proper license or 
authorization 
  -  Violating provisions of the criminal code or the 
Statute for the Control and Sale of Arms, Ammunition, and 
Explosives. 
  -  Giving rise to justified complaints by citizens 
owing to negligent or arbitrary conduct on and off duty. 
  -  Causing 
harm to individuals or property through the excessive use of 
firearms or force 
  -  Impeding or denying assistance to 
investigations by the Attorney General's Office, the National 
Police Commissioner, or any other authority 
  -  Demanding gifts to 
perform a duty 

<H5>    Disciplinary Action </H5>

  -  Disciplinary action is obligatory, formal, and 
indivisible. Once an investigation has begun, it must conclude 
with a declaration of guilt, a writ of prohibition, acquittal, 
or a cessation of proceedings. 
  -  If at the close of the 
proceedings the accused is sacked, this information will be 
entered into his service record. 
  -  All investigations must be 
reported to the Attorney General's Office for the National 
Police, to the Commissioner, and to the Assistant Director 
General. 
  -  Proceedings will be declared closed only when the act 
never took place, the accused did not commit it, the act does 
not qualify as a violation, or disciplinary action cannot begin 
or continue. 
  -  The statement of charges must contain legal 
particulars, a list of the acts under investigation, evidence, 
legal provisions violated, the time period for defense evidence, 
and information for the accused concerning his right to see the 
report and the evidence gathered. 

<H5>    Suspension and Dismissal </H5>

  -  A temporary disciplinary suspension without pay may last 
up to 60 days when the violation being investigated tarnishes 
the prestige of the police. 
  -  No appeal may be made against the 
suspension, and the assistant director of human resources must 
be notified immediately so that the proper formalities can be 
performed. 
  -  The individual under investigation will be reinstated 
automatically in his post and will be entitled to pay if the 
proceedings are closed or if he is acquitted. 
  -  He may also 
request his pay if the 60-day suspension runs out before the 
investigation has been completed. In this case the amount of pay 
will be determined in the final judgment. 
  -  In the event that the 
penalty is a fine, the full amount will be deducted from the 
appropriate amount of pay to be disbursed at the close of the 
suspension. 
  -  The suspended individual will be dismissed if he is 
guilty of the violation. The penalty of dismissal will be 
effective as of the date of the disciplinary suspension ordered 
as a precautionary measure. 
  -  Investigations must be completed 
within a period not to exceed 30 days.

  [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (AFP) -- Friday night, violent 
incidents occurred near the U.S. Interests Section in Havana 
when an undetermined number of persons tried to enter the office 
but Cuban policemen prevented them from doing so. Apparently 
nobody was injured, according to eyewitnesses. 
  The incidents involved several hundred people and some 10 
people were arrested. Shortly before midnight, the situation in 
the area was calm. 
  A large number of people, dressed in civilian clothes and 
wielding nightsticks, presumably members of the so-called "rapid 
response brigades," a semi-official action group, could be seen 
in the area. 
  At the time, there were no diplomatic officials at the U.S. 
Interests Section and the "Marines" were making regular patrols 
of the place. 
  The incidents that arose at the end of the afternoon had 
been 
preceded by minor episodes of violence early Friday morning when 
the Cuban police closed a street adjacent to the U.S. diplomatic 
office to traffic because of the unusually large number of 
people present there. 
  The situation around the building throughout Friday, 
however, 
appeared to be normal. Apparently the incidents were started by 
a false rumor that quickly spread throughout Havana that the 
U.S. Interests Section, acting out of character, would give an 
immigrant visa to all Cuban citizens who requested it. 
  A spokesman for the U.S. diplomatic office told AFP that the 
rumor was "absolutely false," and assumed this was part of a 
"provocation" resulting from a "hostile offensive." The 
spokesman said that no Cuban citizen had been able to enter the 
diplomatic building.

  [Excerpt] Washington, D.C., 12 Feb (EFE) -- The U.S. 
Government today confirmed that on 11 February there was a 
confrontation between the Cuban police and a group of citizens 
who wanted to reach the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to 
request visas. 
  A U.S. State Department spokesperson, who spoke with EFE on 
the condition that he remain anonymous, said that between 50 and 
75 Cubans tried to reach the U.S. Interests Section, but were 
turned back by Cuban policemen who cordoned off the area. "In 
the past few days a false rumor has been spread in Havana. The 
people have been told that the United States will issue visas to 
anyone who requests it without checking on the person's 
qualifications," the spokesperson said to explain the sudden 
rush. 
  The spokesperson did not wish to comment on the way the 
Cuban 
security forces kept back the group that wanted to reach the 
U.S. Interests Section. "The office will resume its normal 
operations on Monday, but the United States wishes to make it 
clear that it has not changed its policy regarding the issuance 
of visas to Cubans who wish to leave the island," the 
spokesperson stressed. 
  The Cuban-U.S. National Foundation, the largest organization 
of Cuban exiles in the United States, has told EFE that the 
security forces "immediately" detained the Cubans who went to 
the U.S. Interests Section. The organization added that 
according to reports received from Havana, following the 
incident, as well as throughout the night, several shots were 
heard in the Vedado neighborhood and that the Cuban police have 
been arresting people throughout the city. 
  The organization added that "people in Miami who are 
listening to the radio confirm that Cuban State Security has 
been placed on alert while confrontations are being reported in 
at least three areas of the city." The areas where 
confrontations are being reported are: seashore drive [Malecon] 
and L Street, between 17 and L Streets, and between El Cerro 
Road and Primelles. "Likewise, our sources have confirmed that 
the special forces have been ordered to stop and check all 
vehicles in the city in search of weapons and explosives, as 
well as to protect tourists." 
  The foundation condemned "the brutal acts of violence and 
arbitrary arrests by Castro's security forces against the Cuban 
people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Havana, 12 Feb (DPA) -- For the second consecutive 
day, the Cuban police today maintained surveillance around the 
U.S. Interests Section in Havana. On 11 February a group of 
people tried to enter the U.S. offices and incidents developed. 
  According to eyewitnesses, an unknown number of Cubans tried 
to enter the U.S. Interests Section offices in Havana and this 
resulted in the arrest of approximately 10 persons. The 
eyewitnesses reported that no one entered the U.S. offices and 
added that some people were injured in the attempt. 
  DPA reporters visited the site of the incident located on 
Havana's Caribbean seashore drive [Malecon], and saw that police 
surveillance had been heightened in the area. However, the 
situation is one of complete calm. 
  Members of the Cuban National Police are asking the people 
who have to pass through the area to do so quickly. They are 
also asking drivers not to park their vehicles in the area. 
Traffic is normal. 
  Persistent rumors spread in Havana on 10 February. The 
people were told that the U.S. Interests Section would approve 
visas for all Cuban citizens who requested them. A U.S. 
Interests Section spokesperson told DPA that these rumors are 
"totally and absolutely false" and that no Cuban citizen had 
entered the U.S. offices.

  [Text] It has been reported that the Cuban Government 
could, next Tuesday, officially convene a conference of Cubans 
living abroad and in Cuba. These sources indicate that the 
meeting is planned for the end of April -- a meeting between 
members of the Cuban community living abroad and common citizens 
-- to discuss topics that are of interest to both sides in an 
effort to broaden current exchanges. 
  Representatives from the powerful Cuban-North American 
community will attend the meeting between Cubans, in addition to 
representatives from other Cuban communities living in Latin 
America, Europe, and other areas. 
  Meanwhile, ultraconservative sectors excluded from this 
meeting are doing everything in their power to stop it. To this 
end, they are using everything from threats against the 
participants to a intensive defamation propaganda campaign 
against the meeting. 
  In fact for the past 48 hours, radio stations broadcasting 
to 
Cuba from U.S. territory as well as television stations 
broadcasting from the United States which are received in 
Havana, have transmitted false reports, like the alleged closure 
of the U.S. Interests Office in Havana, to cause unrest among 
the people who go there everyday to wait for visas, which the 
U.S. State Department hands out sparingly as a way to encourage 
illegal departures. 
  This week, Radio Rebede reported from outside the U.S. 
Interests Office on the irritation of the people who wait in 
long lines for a visa they very seldom receive.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel De la Guardia from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Cuba has already denounced the myth that Cubans 
cannot voluntarily leave their country before the United Nations 
and all other public forums it has access to. It is a myth 
created by reactionary propaganda media, both in and outside of 
the United States, which dissolves in its own steam while 
maneuvers are made to discover ways to present a twisted image 
of Cuba to the world. 
  The great majority of Cubans, more than 95 percent, who have 
migrated to the United States and other countries, have done so 
by legal means, or at least with the approval of the Cuban 
Government. The basic reasons for these migrations has to do 
with the economy, given that these people did not want to 
resist, together with their people, the difficulties that a 
small country has to go through if it wants to be free and 
sovereign in the face of opposition by an imperial power like 
the United States, which is also a very close neighbor. 
  For 35 years, the Cuban people have resisted the hostility 
of 
successive U.S. Governments, which have launched all sorts of 
aggressions, both overt as well as covert, against Cuba for the 
declared purpose of overthrowing the revolutionary government, 
wiping out its will for independence, and inflicting 
Washington's political will on this small country. 
  The evidence behind this statement has repeatedly been given 
by the U.S. Government itself when it has publicly stated it 
will only lift the economic blockade and begin normal relations 
once Cuba makes the political changes the United States wants 
and replaces the revolutionary government, headed by Fidel 
Castro, with another, supposedly democratic, which will have no 
qualms in subordinating itself to U.S. political and economic 
interests. 
  To this end, the U.S. Government has developed an 
immigration 
policy that scandalously favors Cubans who abandon their country 
on improvised rafts, defy the dangers of the open sea in the 
hope of being rescued by a Coast Guard vessel and taken to 
Florida where they are forced to make politically hostile 
statements against the Cuban revolutionary government. Only then 
do these Cubans earn preferential treatment by the U.S. 
authorities. 
  With regards to the thousands of Cubans who wish to travel 
to 
the United States to visit their relatives and then return to 
Cuba, they are treated very differently. Last year, of 100,000 
Cuban citizens who tried to obtain a U.S. Government visa to 
legally travel to the United States, 70,000 were turned down. 
Day after day thousands of Cubans form long lines outside the 
U.S. Interests Section's doors in Havana with the hope of 
receiving the required visa. Only 30 percent have accomplished 
this; the rest, after putting up with being humiliated and 
mistreated by diplomatic officials, leave disappointed and their 
only hope is that one day this will change. Quite a few, after 
being turned down by capricious arguments, have undergone the 
raft adventure and been received as heroes in the same country 
that rejected them because they may have chosen to stay in U.S. 
territory and perhaps become a public burden. 
  It is for this reason that Cuba insists on stating that this 
policy is criminal and violates all humanitarian principles. It 
is a policy that stubbornly disregards human rights.

  [Text] A poll conducted by the Social, Political, and 
Opinions Study Center of Cuba [Centro de Estudios Sociopoliticos 
y de Opinion de Cuba] has revealed, in the framework of ongoing 
analyses to introduce economic reforms in the island, that 38 
percent of Cubans favor a change in the currency to clean up the 
country's finances. 
  The poll indicated that 33 percent of Cubans favor 
implementing these measures quickly and that 59 percent favor 
doing it slowly or gradually. [figures as heard] 
  Right now, workers are meeting to discuss measures that 
might 
be discussed by the National Assembly. These measures include a 
change of currency, the creation of taxes, payroll reductions, 
and the elimination of some subsidies, although not those 
related to education or public health. 
  The poll also revealed that only 0.2 percent of the people 
favor changing Cuba's economic system.

  [Text] In the past few days as not very often in the past, 
we been able to see the difference in the way U.S. immigration 
policy treats refugees from Haiti and from Cuba. 
  A few days ago, the bodies of six Haitians -- including 
those 
of two children -- who arrived in Florida on rickety boats were 
cast into the sea; meanwhile, a group of Cubans obtained asylum 
easily. [sentence as heard] 
  Is this a typical aspect of U.S. immigration policy? At the 
end of the 1960's, the U.S. Congress passed a law providing for 
preferential treatment for Cubans. Despite the intensive 
pressuring by Cuban-Americans, more than a few in Washington 
question that law. 
  What is happening and what people are not realizing, 
however, 
is that many of those who have obtained residency under this 
law, claiming that they could not return to Cuba for fear of 
Fidel Castro, are now visiting Cuba. 
  There are many examples of this biased immigration policy. A 
few months ago television stations throughout the world were 
showing images of Haitians and denouncing their deportation from 
the naval base at Guantanamo. Meanwhile, Cubans arriving at that 
same place by swimming or crossing minefields are automatically 
granted asylum. 
  In the light of these examples, Cuba seems to be more 
dangerous to Washington than is Haiti. Are there reasons a Cuban 
deserves U.S. residency more than a Haitian? The United States' 
refusal to grant a number of visas to Cuban citizens annually is 
what encourages the illegal departures from Cuba. So far, the 
U.S. Government has maintained that the policy of repatriating 
the Haitians is necessary to prevent many of them from dying on 
the high seas. 
  The other side of the coin is quite different, however. As 
you can see, internationally, there are attempts to present 
Haiti solely as a land of emigrants who flee in rickety boats. 
Less publicized are the struggles for economic power. The 
wealthy are apparently linked to the military who destroyed 
Haiti's institutions; but the truth is that they see their 
future as being in jeopardy. 
  Many businessmen have gone bankrupt because of the 
international sanctions, the black market, and drug trafficking, 
which is in the hands of the military chiefs, in collusion with 
the CIA and the Pentagon. 
  The rich, made up mainly of mulattos and whites and with a 
mentality similar to that of the Afrikaners in South Africa, are 
worried about the resurgence of the Tonton Macoutes, a 
paramilitary group made up mostly of blacks. However, the 
Haitian elite fears a popular uprising more than anything else, 
because such an uprising could ruin everything. For this reason, 
the members of this elite reject the return to democracy that 
would curtail their privileges, and for this reason they close 
their eyes to the murder of fellow citizens or to the 
progressive disintegration of Haiti.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1255 GMT on 10 February carries several news reports relating 
to emigration and the activities of the U.S. Interests Section, 
as well as to the perception of these activities by the general 
population in Cuba. 
  In a preview of upcoming stories, the announcer says: "Cuban 
emigration to the United States will continue to be the focus of 
analysis in this half-hour of Rebelde's `Doing Radio' program. 
Expect new details on this topic of great national prominence 
from Zenaida Costales, who is still at the so-called Park of 
Lamentations on the corner of Calzada and K Street, in the 
vicinity of the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana." The announcer says, further: "You too can participate 
in the topic. Call us at 32-82-97." 
  This preview is followed by the announcement: "The `Doing 
Radio' program's automatic answering machine is your friend. 
Leave your message right now. After hearing the tone, you have 
30 seconds to say hello or to express your opinions." 
  A tone is heard, and then a woman says: "Hello from Comrade 
Lucy Estela, a listener of this program. Concerning my opinion 
on emigration: There has always been emigration, but there are 
many ways of emigrating. There is the emigration of the patriot 
and there is the emigration of the traitor. At the present time, 
to emigrate is to flee the difficulties. Any Cuban who really 
feels Cuban at the present time stays here in Cuba, and all 
together, we struggle -- for this is not the time to emigrate. 
This is a time to stay inside the fatherland and struggle. And 
the Americans are waging a policy, precisely, against all those 
people who are today abandoning the country because of a few 
difficulties that we are having. Because if we look at other 
countries, they are worse off than we are. We may be hungry, and 
there may be shortages, and we may have difficulties, but we 
have a fatherland. Others have no fatherland. And to emigrate at 
the present time is an act of cowardice. And the Americans take 
advantage of those cowards to wage political propaganda against 
us, trying to make it look like Cuba does not let people leave. 
And it has been said here that Cubans may leave the country 
whenever they like. But what do the Americans do? They try to 
get people to leave clandestinely and to have them (?drown) en 
route, so that they can later blame us, the Cubans; blame Fidel, 
who has given this people so much! And that is why we say: Yes, 
let he who wishes to emigrate right now go ahead and emigrate. 
The holes in the ranks do not matter if we who remain are firm, 
as Raul said. The Fatherland or death! We will win. 
  "Lucy Estela, of San Lazaro, #464." 
  This, in turn, is followed by what is said to be a live 
mobile unit report. An announcer says: "We are now in contact 
with the `Doing Radio' program's mobile unit and Zenaida 
Costales, who I understand is still at the Park of Lamentations, 
right?" A second announcer adds: "At the park on Calzada and K 
Streets, near the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana. I am listening, Zenaida. Good morning." 
  Costales says: "Yes, thank you. Here we are again, 
broadcasting from very near the offices of the U.S. Interests 
Section, where hundreds of people remain, standing vigil in an 
interminable line that will permit them to find out once and for 
all whether or not they will be able to travel to the United 
States. I should tell you that in 1993, Cuba authorized the 
temporary exit of 100,000 people, but only 30,000 were able to 
travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied visas by the U.S. 
Government. Why? These testimonies contain some of the answers." 
  Approximately 1.5 minutes of excerpts of conversations with 
unidentified speakers follow. 
  One man says: "Hope is the only thing one cannot afford to 
lose in this life." 
  "What if they say no?" -- asks the reporter. 
  The man answers: "They are obliging me to do something I 
would rather not do. I would like to go see my grandparents and 
come back. But they are obliging me to do something else." 
  Costales says: "Perhaps what he does not want to do is leave 
illegally, but for him, that appears to be his only alternative. 
  "This is Zenaida Costales for the `Doing Radio' program. 
Good 
day." 
  An announcer thanks Costales for her report and asks her to 
return to the studio to discuss this matter further. 
  Next, Roberto (Geli) [not further identified] notes that 
the last speaker, "who appears to be a young person," seems to 
be a candidate for illegal emigration/immigration, asking: "And 
I wonder: Who is at fault or as a consequence of what?" 
  (Geli) notes that this kind of illegal 
emigration/immigration 
takes place in many parts of the world, adding that in the case 
of Cuba, "the total number of rafters rescued, or who arrived in 
U.S. territory in 1993 from our territory was 3,656." "The 1992 
figure was 2,556, which, in turn, was approximately 400 people 
more than the 1991 figure of 2,203 -- which cannot be compared 
with the 1990 figure, which was only 467." 
  (Geli) notes that the number of emigrants coincides with the 
beginning of increasing economic difficulties in Cuba because of 
the collapse of the socialist bloc, plus an intensification of 
the U.S. blockade against Cuba. He says, further: "At the same 
time, another element that cannot be forgotten is that also as 
of 1991, the quote calls unquote to emigrate illegally made from 
U.S. territory have increased -- with calls not to stay on the 
island; to show, through this, a rejection of the Cuban 
political process, or the Cuban political project." 
  Citing official U.S. sources, (Geli) notes that 582 Cuban 
rafters disappeared in the Florida straits in 1993 while 
attempting to emigrate illegally,"and 28 are known to have 
died," including children. 
  (Geli) asks himself: "And I wonder, [Rebelde journalist 
Roberto] Cavada, and dear listeners, how these people who 
emigrate this way deal with their feelings? I wonder what one 
feels when one can no longer see the place where one spent one's 
childhood anytime one wishes, when one cannot visit one's 
long-time friends and life-long relatives, when one turns one's 
back on the national identity and on what we Cubans call `things 
Cuban'? 
  "What does one feel when one knows that those here are going 
through a difficult phase, a phase full of shortages, problems, 
and diverse difficult circumstances -- but nevertheless do not 
turn their backs, and instead stay close to the family, close to 
their dreams, close to their ideas? It is no doubt a very 
complex problem, of course -- and having to confront such a 
problem daily must cause true chaos in more than a few of the 
people who emigrate anywhere in the world. 
  "I am of course talking about those who think and feel. And 
I 
say this because we all know that there are some among those who 
leave who exhibit all to the contrary -- when they leave even 
sick family members, old people, and children in order to go off 
seeking that which every emigrant terms paradise. That is what 
I have to say, for the moment, Cavada." 
  The journalists agree to discuss this matter further in the 
future.

  [Text] As we reported in the beginning, Army General Raul 
Castro Ruz, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], 
has paid a visit to the province of Holguin. 
  Army Gen. Raul Castro Ruz, secretary of the Cuban Communist 
Party [PCC], has visited a large FAR unit which belongs to the 
Western Army and which is headed by Division Gen. Ulises Rosales 
del Toro. The minister was accompanied by Division Gen. Ramon 
Espinoza Martin, chief of the General Staff and chief of the 
Western Army; Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first PCC secretary in 
Holguin; other members of the PCC Central Committee, generals, 
and high-ranking officers. 
  The unit chief, Colonel Carlos (Negrin) Rodriguez, briefed 
the minister about the results attained during the past year, 
and the prospects for this year, stressing the seven main tasks 
of the Western Army. He verified the progress achieved in the 
training of personnel, maintenance of armaments and of the 
theater of military operations, morale and discipline, and the 
fighting capacity of the troops. 
  The work carried out in livestock production can be clearly 
seen in the 30-percent higher growth than last year. An example 
of the creativity in this area is the production of milk: larger 
cattle farms in larger units; minicattle farms in smaller units; 
and goat milk production in the more distant, smallest units. 
The agricultural and livestock plan for 1994 seeks steps beyond 
those of the previous year, making the troops almost 
self-sufficient, to the point of providing a modest food 
provision to the families of the officers' corps. 
  The minister and his retinue visited the combat operations 
center directed by Brigadier Gen. Ruben Martinez Puentes, chief 
of the DAAFAR [Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air 
Force], and Col. (Negrin) Rodriguez. Raul here greeted the 
soldiers and the many female personnel who work at the National 
Airspace Defense screens. 
  At the flight ramp, the FAR minister was shown various types 
of equipment for air safety built by the rationalizers 
[racionalizadores] and innovators who replace the numerous forms 
of equipment that used to be imported, but which today would 
demand a considerable amount of currency. 
  Raul also held a lively conversation with Comrade (Raciel 
Bovines), a civilian worker who has been in the unit for 18 
years, a National Vanguard member for the past three years, and 
whose contributions are decisive solutions for the Air Force 
operation. 
  At the technical research unit, master engineer, (Raul 
Trinchet), graduate of the Technical Military Institute, showed 
the Army general other achievements in fighter plane repair, and 
the creation of basic materials for study. Proof of the quality 
of work is the fact that no aircraft from this unit has 
experienced an accident due to technical failure over the past 
three years. During the chat with Raul, Master Engineer 
(Trinchet) said that his efforts are inspired by the 
metaphorical words of the minister when he said that inventions 
during the special period could reach the point of flying an 
aircraft by a gasoline-operated generator. 
  [Begin recording] [Raul] [passage indistinct] ... from 
generals to the last soldier, to civilian workers, technicians, 
and engineers, you are a good example. So, allow me to 
congratulate you on behalf of the commander in chief, on behalf 
of my fellow comrades who are accompanying me, and for myself, 
wishing you greater success because now, as I told (Trinchet) a 
few minutes ago, that our technicians, engineers, experts, 
having reached an accomplished level, life is forcing us to 
develop even further. We must admire this, especially since you 
are responsible for such a fate. [sentence indistinct] 
  But that is not the essential point. The essential thing is 
that with what we have, we are capable of solving problems such 
as those you have solved. Is that correct, Comander? 
  [Unidentified colonel] Yes, General. 
  [Raul] Then, I ask my comrades who are accompanying me, that 
as a humble homage to you, and through you to everyone 
throughout the country, to recognize that our air force, our 
DAAFAR, and our Armed Forces have achieved and have greatly 
contributed to maintaining the fighting capacity of our FAR, and 
in an increasingly less expensive manner, as we said recently. 
  We are going to have, or are continuing to have the most 
powerful Armed Forces in Latin America, and besides, the least 
costly Armed Forces. And you here play an essential role, 
repairing an engine, or carrying out some of those activities 
that Engineer (Trinchet) just explained. 
  (Negrin), we are talking here about millions of dollars. 
[passage indistinct] I ask for applause for these officers, our 
comrades. [applause] [end recording]

  [Text] Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, member of 
the Politburo and first vice minister of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces [FAR], conducted a tour of Holguin Province where he was 
briefed on economic and military endeavors. 
  The chief of the General Staff was accompanied by comrade 
Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] in Holguin, as well as other members of the 
Central Committee of the PCC. The microjet banana plantations at 
Limoncito in Baguano Municipality, were the first stop. Here 33 
caballerias are being planted. Of these, from August to date, 
almost seven have been planted. There are plans to plant 11 by 
the end of February and all 33 by 26 July. Once the planting is 
completed, harvesting will begin in the areas planted first. The 
yield is estimated at 350,000 quintals of bananas over the next 
12 months. This yield is expected given the quality of the soil, 
irrigation, fertilization, and careful tending efforts. The work 
force consists of a contingent of youths mobilized by the Union 
of Young Communists [UJC] in the municipalities of Baguano and 
Holguin. An interesting detail is that irrigation is done 
entirely by gravity. The water comes from the Limoncito Dam -- 
five kilometers away -- which yields 6 million cubic meters a 
year and was built in record time. The dam, which covers 60 
hectares according to the visual estimate made by Fishing Vice 
Minister Oltuski, allows for fish farming at diverse rates 
according to the level of feed provided. 
  Ulises praised this provincial effort to significantly 
increase in the near future the supply of vegetables to the 
population of the provincial capital and other towns. The 
general stressed the need to stabilize the labor force because 
the outstanding physical conditions observed will yield the most 
only if the workers, through work and technological discipline, 
high morale, and willingness to win, guarantee the results by 
doing every day what is required. 
  The next stop was the joint Sugar Industry Ministry 
[Minaz]-FAR experimental plant to produce bagasse briquettes, 
which are then turned into charcoal briquettes and other liquid 
or gas charcoal by-products. The plant is located in the 
processing center of the Fernando de Dios Mill. This guarantees 
a supply of 50 tons of bagasse a day for 100 days during this 
abnormally short harvest. The plant can produce briquettes at a 
rate of 1 ton an hour. Likewise, the charcoal producing area is 
able to produce 3 tons a day by consuming approximately 10 tons 
of bagasse briquettes. The importance of the experiment is clear 
to everyone because sugarcane bagasse is a renewable energy 
resource which yields hundreds of thousands of tons a year. The 
trick lies in how to turn its immense energy potential into an 
alternative practical and economic energy source. 
  Rosales del Toro praised the stage of assembly of the 
experimental plant and added that similar ones are being 
installed at the Luis Arcos Bergnes Mill, in central Cuba, and 
the Pablo Noriega Mill in western Cuba. 
  All this is part of an investigation carried out by the 
FAR, in cooperation with Minaz, as part of the scientific and 
technical tasks programmed by the national forums. Rosales went 
on to say that an extraordinary military council would be held 
in April during which the first secretaries of the provincial 
committees will participate to analyze, among other issues, this 
experiment of the Eastern Army. 
  Here, Garcia Ferrer [not further identified] mentioned that 
the Minister of the FAR had recently pointed out that the most 
advanced experiment was that of the Eastern Army. 
  The tour through several organic plots in Holguin City was 
praised by the visiting delegation, which pointed out that this 
idea has been stressed by Raul Castro, who is also in that 
province, but busy with other tasks together with Ramon 
Espinosa, head of the Eastern Army. 
  The first secretary in the Municipality, Jorge Luis Sierra, 
informed them that the city has 13 organic plots, which have 
either been completed or are now under construction, in 11 urban 
councils. These small agricultural production centers have a 
total of 1900 seed beds [calderos] and 54,000 square meters of 
cultivatable soil. So far, nine varieties of vegetables are 
being cultivated, most of which is lettuce because it is in high 
demand. The products harvested are sold everyday. The population 
can purchase the lettuce directly from the organic plot for 1 
peso a head. Different methods have been established to pay the 
wages of the workers at the plots, paying each worker according 
to his effort and productivity. 
  The water used for irrigation at the organic plots is 
generally extracted from wells built for that purpose. In some 
cases, the water is pumped with the use of windmills in other 
cases the old fashioned method is used: rope and buckets. Only 
two organic plots use water from the aqueducts because water has 
not been found in the subsoil. 
  Brief conversations were held with the administrators of the 
two organic plots visited. These administrators do manual labor 
when necessary. Their salaries are also linked to the 
productivity of their organic plots. Teresa Saldivar, an 
agronomy technician, manages one of those plots. The volume of 
sales in January was of 13,000 pesos. The cost per peso is less 
than 50 cents. Felix Perez is another one of the administrators 
with whom they spoke. He is not a professional but is in fact a 
technician that studied in life's university; from being a 
leader of the Federation of Secondary School Students, to his 
internationalist mission in Angola, and his peasant origin. 
  Francisco Ferrer, the first secretary of the party in 
Holguin, stated that their accomplishments were small when 
compared to their goal: 300,000 square meters of plots in the 
provincial capital. By when? As soon as possible.

  [Text] Delegates to Havana City's Provincial Assembly of 
the People's Government have analyzed and approved measures 
aimed at reducing the province's current budget deficit of 193 
million pesos. Delegates at the forum discussed the actions 
aimed at increasing income and reducing expenses that the 
provincial administrative directorate will be taking. 
  Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the State 
Committee for Finance, explained that any measure adopted by the 
country on the issue will be aimed at stimulating labor, 
increasing production of goods, and eliminating excess currency. 
He added that sanctions will be applied to organizations that 
are not up to date on payments or collection of accounts, which 
could hide embezzlement of resources and misappropriation of 
funds. Rodriguez went on to criticize those organizations which 
are profitable in hard currency but not in the national currency. 
  The concluding remarks at the assembly were made by Jorge 
Lezcano Perez, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] and PCC first secretary in Havana City Province. 
Lezcano underscored the importance of making the workers 
understand that they can make a difference in the reduction of 
costs and subsidies and in the profitability of their work 
centers.

  [Text] During a meeting at which the Villa Clara Province 
CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] presented its progress report to 
the CTC national secretariat, Pedro Ross stated that the 
performance of Villa Clara Province workers was satisfactory in 
1993, but that more emphasis must be placed on the development 
of programs essential to the nation, such as the sugarcane/sugar 
program, the tobacco program, and others that affect the 
population's nutrition. Here is journalist Benito Cuadrado with 
more information. 
  [Cuadrado -- live by phone or recorded] The CTC's secretary 
general pointed out that Villa Clara's union activities are 
exemplary, but that decreases in production such as those 
exhibited on the tobacco plantations in (Manicaragua) and in the 
fishing sector must be avoided because the nation needs those 
resources to increase its economic potential. 
  The CTC national secretariat expressed interest in the 
sugarcane harvest strategy in Villa Clara; the cane planting, 
which will exceed 170 caballerias this month; and the progress 
of the potato campaign. The goal is to obtain over 6,000 
quintals of yield. 
  Ross Leal, who is a member of the Politburo, said that those 
who accomplish their respective missions must be acknowledged 
and encouraged because these times call for labor feats, and the 
people of Villa Clara always walk that path.

  [Text] Montevideo, 11 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- In Montevideo, 
Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias has said that 
Mexico is willing to meet the obligations imposed by NAFTA, but 
it also wants to remain a member of the Latin American 
Integration Association [Aladi]. "Mexico is, and desires to 
remain, an Aladi member country. Nevertheless, the commercial 
agreement with the United States and Canada is a new reality. We 
want to find a political solution to this situation," Tello told 
NOTIMEX. 
  Interviewed during the 8th Aladi Ministers Summit held in 
the 
Paraguayan capital, Tello Macias said Mexico's request to 
postpone its commercial obligations with its Latin American 
partners "will open new possibilities for other countries in the 
region." 
  This afternoon, the ministers to the 8th Aladi Summit will 
vote on Mexico's request to waive Article 44 of the Montevideo 
Treaty establishing commercially privileged obligations toward 
treaty country members. According to Article 44, countries that 
give special treatment to another country's products "shall 
extend such treatment, immediately and unconditionally, to the 
rest of Aladi member countries." 
  According to the agreement reached during the 10 February 
technical meeting, Mexico, in bilateral negotiations, must 
compensate its partners for the eventual damage NAFTA might 
cause as the result of either commercial misrepresentations or 
investment losses. "When we speak of seeking a solution to this 
apparent problem, we are not thinking about Mexico alone, but 
other countries' eventual merger with NAFTA. We are seeking the 
best possible mechanism to facilitate this merger, which should 
not be hampered," Tello said. 
  Tello said he trusts the summit will result in a decision 
"that will permit Mexico to participate in NAFTA and remain an 
Aladi member country, and make it possible for other countries 
to join NAFTA. We are demonstrating Mexico's interest in 
contributing to the integration of regional countries' economies 
to a greater extent. We did it with Chile, with whom we have an 
complementary economic agreement. We are about to conclude one 
such treaty with the Group of Three (Colombia, Venezuela, and 
Mexico), and negotiations with Bolivia and Central America are 
well under way. We are showing that we want to expand the field 
so the economies of other countries in the continent can join. 
This is reasonable if those instruments' final objective is to 
increase the volume of trade." Tello said. 
  He ruled out the possibility that the conflict, which broke 
out in the southeastern state of Chiapas on 1 January, will have 
any effect on the country's commercial or political relations. 
"The situation in four Chiapas towns is on its way to a 
political solution. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
taken measures to make sure the conflict will be resolved 
peacefully through dialogue and negotiation," he said. The 
foreign secretary finally said, "We are about to initiate a 
dialogue to restore social peace in Chiapas and meet the Indian 
communities' just demands, which were harmed by the self-styled 
Zapatist National Liberation Army."

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Gutierrez from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche has said 
businessmen's efforts to check the country's commercial deficit 
is a sign of responsibility on their part because now there is a 
framework, provided by NAFTA, to increase Mexican exports. The 
behavior of the country's trade balance will depend on whether 
or not Mexico's businessmen are capable of taking advantage of 
free trade with the United States and Canada. 
  Serra Puche noted the U.S. economy is on a firm path to 
recovery and U.S. consumers will demand Mexican products more 
and more. The secretary explained NAFTA's first month in 
operation. 
  [Begin Serra Puche recording] There are no definite trade 
figures for this first month of January because it takes more 
than one month to prepare reports, but I do have day-by-day 
reports indicating operations are under control and the problems 
that arose at the start were of a customs nature, and they are 
being resolved. [end recording] 
  Serra Puche was interviewed following his private meeting 
with Mexican Telephones System [Telmex] officials and U.S., 
Canadian, and European investors. During the meeting, it became 
evident that in the past few years, Telmex invested 20 billion 
new pesos and this allowed telephone services to be installed in 
8,000 rural towns. 
  [Begin recording of Telmex Director Juan Antonio Perez] This 
coming year we will maintain the investment rhythm of the past 
few years: approximately $2.2 billion. [end recording]

  [Text] Representatives from seven Portuguese-speaking 
countries are discussing in Brasilia the formation of an 
international community. They met this morning in Itamaraty. 
  These representatives came from Africa and Europe. They have 
something in common with Brazil, their language -- Portuguese. 
Based on this common feature, the foreign ministers from seven 
countries are discussing the formation of a community of 
Portuguese- speaking countries to exchange technology and 
cooperation in the cultural, social, and economic areas and 
reach political agreements. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim emphasized the 
efforts made by these countries to end racism and the 
significance of the new community: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] We are living in a world of 
variable associations in which it is important to channel common 
elements for more resolute actions in the international arena. 
[end recording] 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira, 
one of the architects of the community of Portuguese-speaking 
countries, said it already was time for the idea to materialize 
and used the occasion to ask for the foreigners' support for 
proposing sociologist Herbert de Souza, nicknamed Betinho, as a 
candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  [Begin Aparecido recording] I believe he is the candidate of 
the nations that speak our language. In this regard, he 
represents the moral and human conscience of 210 million people 
scattered throughout the continents. [end recording] 
  The presidents of these seven Portuguese-speaking countries 
will meet this year in Lisbon to formalize all the documents 
signed at today's meeting. 
  The foreign ministers will visit the Federal Supreme Court 
and Congress this afternoon. They will have dinner with 
President Itamar Franco at the JK Memorial tonight.

  [Text] The Portuguese-speaking countries community probably 
will be created before July. The foreign ministers of the seven 
Portuguese-speaking countries -- Brazil, Portugal, Angola, 
Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cape Verde 
-- today signed a joint communique as the basis for the 
establishment of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries. 
The document has 13 points that are fundamental for the group's 
implementation. The main items are: social, cultural, and 
economic cooperation among the countries' inhabitants; the 
implementation in the short term of the Portuguese Language 
International Institute; and support for an immediate cease-fire 
in Angola, where a civil war is under way. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said the community 
will be a great opportunity to intensify relations among the 
member countries. He added that it will not prevent them from 
participating in other groups: 
  [Begin recording] Brazil, for example, which is currently a 
UN Security Council member, has been acting in coordination with 
other countries. It is necessary, however, to make this 
coordination and common agreement more permanent then it is in 
other forums. In Latin America, for example, we participate in 
the Rio Group. Portugal is a EC member. The African 
Portuguese-speaking countries are OAU members. Therefore, this 
association will allow us to make better use of our common 
efforts. [end recording] 
  The community of Portuguese-speaking countries will be 
comprised of more than 200 million people spread over three 
continents. In addition to the language, these peoples share 
historic and ethnic traits. The community will become official 
during a meeting of the member countries' chiefs of state, which 
probably will be held in Lisbon before July.

  [Excerpt] In reference to a comment made by a Honduran 
military official, Armed Forces Commander General Fernando 
Sanjinez Yanez said on 3 February that the U.S. attempt to have 
the armed forces of the Latin American countries disappear to 
impose its predominance does create concern. 
  For Gen. Sanjinez it is not possible that the U.S. 
Government 
would have that intention when its Armed Forces were also born, 
like those of other nations, "inspired by independence and 
freedom for the Republic." 
  Sanjinez said the U.S. Government should understand that 
"respect for someone else's rights means peace," and that for 
this reason a dominance of this nature -- which according to the 
Honduran military official is already in process -- should not 
occur. 
  He added: "Our armed forces did not come to life as 
instruments of a long process of conquest. They are the product 
of the historic need for freedom our people had and still have." 
  According to the contents of the "Bush Plan," the United 
States has the main objective of abolishing the armed forces in 
Latin America to impose its dominance and will in detriment to 
the sovereignty and independence of the region's countries. 
  Sanjinez Yanez pointed out that an attitude of aggression by 
the United States "would be like ignoring the influence of the 
culture of peace in the evolution of history." 
  He believes the position of the Bolivian military is shared 
by its Latin American colleagues whose representatives have 
reacted several times to this delicate issue. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The United States has always played a dominant 
role in the search for a solution to the Haitian crisis. One 
cannot speak of interference, according to former Chamber of 
Deputies President Antoine Joseph, who considers it normal for 
the United States to request President Aristide to choose a new 
prime minister to fill the vacuum created by the departure of 
Prime Minister Robert Malval. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] What you call giving orders is 
what I see as the fact that the United States is now considered 
the world cop. Second, the United States is very strong in the 
United Nations and has played an important role in the Haitian 
crisis. If they can call that giving orders.... 
  Furthermore, the United States has given pretty substantial 
support to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is true that 
there are difficulties preventing his physical return. 
Personally, I do not consider it a big deal that the United 
States, seeing that there is now an executive vacuum and that 
this vacuum is tempting, that this vacuum is a kind of bait, 
believes that the vacuum entails the sort of resolutions 
resulting from these national conferences. The United States may 
deem it necessary for the vacuum to be filled as soon as 
possible. It therefore asks President Aristide to name a prime 
minister so as to begin filling the executive vacuum. [end 
recording] 
  Furthermore, Antoine Joseph considers the resolution 
recently 
adopted by the employers' associations realistic. This 
resolution supports the main themes of the Governors Island 
agreement and of the New York pact. Joseph thinks the military 
considers the UN Mission in Haiti [MINUHA] a real slap. The 
MINUHA agreements can be revised by the Haitian parliament, 
according to Dr. Joseph, former president of the Chamber of 
Deputies. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The split in the Senate of the Republic has been 
confirmed. The members of the new office, presided over by 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq, took possession of the administration 
of the Senate. The operation was possible with the help of a 
justice of the peace. Upon his return from Washington, Firmin 
Jean-Louis, who had obtained U.S. support, will find his office 
taken over by Bernard Sansaricq. Edner Jean, who followed the 
case, filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] The operation took place on the afternoon 
of 9 February, a few minutes after the news conference by Sen. 
Sansaricq. This time, unlike the earlier, unsuccessful attempt 
on 7 February, journalists were not invited to cover the event, 
the second takeover of the office of the Senate of the Republic. 
The only witness to the operation remains the justice of the 
peace from the Department of the North who was executing an 
order from the deputy public prosecutor. 
  To enforce their power in the Senate, the members of the 
Action Group for the Recovery and Defense of National 
Sovereignty [GARD] [vernacular not currently available] were not 
moderate in their methodology. They simply broke down the doors 
to the offices of the president of the National Assembly and the 
quaestor. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, 9 February, they 
installed a second president in the Senate of the Republic. 
  Today, 10 February, it is with a huge smile that Sen. 
Dupiton 
relates the facts. [passage omitted] 
  Now that the contested 18 January elected took effective or 
fictitious control of the administration of the Senate of the 
Republic, the solution to the crisis is only days away, if one 
would believe Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who could care less 
about the position of the international community or of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, spokesman 
for GARD, told Radio Metropole that their decision will be 
imposed on the nation. [passage omitted] 
  While serious questions are being raised on the legality of 
the actions taken by the office of Sen. Sansaricq, a deputy from 
the Constitutionalist bloc, Samuel Madistin, revealed that Sen. 
Ebrane Cadet told him that the Army was behind this movement. 
[passage omitted] 
  All things considered, with this new split within the Senate 
of the Republic, it is the very survival of the parliament 
itself that is being questioned. [end recording]

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jan [date as received] (AFP) -- 
Last night in Port-au-Prince a powerful explosion destroyed 
several clandestine fuel warehouses. An AFP correspondent 
reported on Sunday that the explosion claimed no victims. 
  The explosions and resulting fire were caused by an 
irresponsible smoker. Dozens of buildings were damaged, 
including a small 20-room hotel. 
  The fire had not yet been controlled this morning, six hours 
after the initial blast, which occurred when a tanker truck 
exploded. At the site, it was confirmed that firefighters have 
limited resources with which to work. 
  The petroleum products stored at the warehouses on Cesar 
Street, near the cathedral in the Haitian capital, had been 
brought in from the Dominican Republic. Gasoline sells for 22 
Haitian dollars ($7.5) [unit not given] on the black market. 
  The UN ordered an oil embargo against Haiti last October to 
pressure the military government which seized power in 1991 by 
overthrowing Jean Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected 
president of Haiti.

  [Excerpt] In principle, Port-au-Prince is resuming its 
normal activities today, 10 February, following a 10-day 
shutdown of the Haitian business sector at the initiative of the 
Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry [CCIH] and 13 other 
employers' associations that used it as a point of protest 
against the embargo on Haiti. CCIH and the Haitian employers' 
associations intended to compel the Haitian protagonists to 
quickly find a solution to the political crisis. 
  Regarding the resumption of activities today, the spokesman 
for the Haitian private sector, Bernard Craan, stated to Radio 
Metropole that the Haitian employers' sector emerged stronger 
and felt satisfied with their initiative. Rothschild [Francois] 
filed a report: [Begin recording] Reactivating the 
commercial-industrial machine today does not mean that the 
Haitian employers intend to put aside their demands. The private 
sector asserts that it will maintain the pressure on the various 
protagonists. The crisis committee of the employers' sector will 
therefore remain mobilized, reinforced by the presence of the 
presidents of the associations. The private sector intends to 
talk with the other vital forces of the country, with the 
objective of finding elements for a solution to the structural 
crisis that Haiti has been facing for what seems like decades. 
  Questioned on an assessment of their initiative, one of the 
spokesmen of the employers' sector states that their movement 
has not been without effect. Bernard Craan explains that the 
private sector demonstrated unity by rationally managing the 
movement, but he believes that it is still too early to speak of 
overall satisfaction. [passage omitted] [end recording]

we in the PRH call for mobilization of the entire Haitian people 
of the nine geographic departments to denounce these people who 
know very well that they are only aggravating the situation. The 
essential solution to the crisis resides in the agreement signed 
on Governors Island between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and 
General Raoul Cedras. [end recording]

  [Text] The new scenarios encouraged by some sectors of 
national life are simply exacerbating the crisis. This statement 
was made by Christian Democratic Assembly [RDC] leader Eddy 
Volel. The RDC leader takes this opportunity to denounce the 
behavior of Ambassador William Lacy Swing who is pressuring 
Aristide to choose a new prime minister. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] Given the way the nation is 
going and acting, the reactionaries are trying to cause trouble 
for Aristide so he cannot appoint... [pauses] so he cannot have 
a third prime minister ratified. Thus, these criminals are 
trying either to dismiss Aristide as president or stall long 
enough for Aristide's mandate to expire. 
  This crisis has caused the Haitian people to lose confidence 
in numerous entities: politicians, friendly countries, the 
United Nations, the OAS, the international community, deputies 
and senators, and businessmen. What is the U.S. ambassador to 
Haiti doing? Why is William Lacy Swing so interested in the 
matter of appointing a Haitian prime minister in violation of 
Article 1 of our Constitution? [end recording]

Colombia. 
  Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said that his

wake of the diplomat's murder. This incident "reflects the 
dramatic situation facing the Colombian nation, but we are sure 
they will move forward," he added. 
  Garcia de Montoya, 60, accompanied Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo to the inaugural of new Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina on 27 January in Tegucigalpa. 
  The foreign minister said that the Honduran president had 
already contacted his Colombian counterpart to condemn the

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 10 Feb (DPA) -- The Honduran Government 
and the military sector this afternoon agreed to suspend the 
practice of forcibly enlisting youths. The agreement was 
reached by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez and 
General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander of the Armed Forces. 
  Gen. Discua Elvir explained that the practice of deploying 
hundreds of soldiers to the country's urban centers to capture 
youths and forcibly take them to military units will be 
suspended. This practice has been constantly criticized by the 
media, parents, and human rights defenders, who term it 
kidnapping. The youths were taken to the military units and not 
given the opportunity to contact their parents about their 
situation. Military service in Honduras is for a period of two 
years. 
  Today's agreement states that the practice will be stopped, 
while a commission of civilians and military personnel will draw 
up a new plan. 
  Gen. Discua Elvir told a news conference at the Government 
House that the establishment of the Educational Voluntary 
Military Service [Servico Military Voluntario Educativo] and the 
Constitutional Military Service [Servicio Militar 
Constitucional] has been proposed to President Reina Idiaquez. 
  Neither Discua Elvir nor President Reina told the media what 
each proposal entails. They said the proposals will be 
developed by the governmental commission that they appointed. 
The Honduran president told the news conference that the 
military sector realized that the forcible enlistment of youths 
was "negative and harmful to the Armed Forces."

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The fifth floor of the Presidential 
House is reserved for the president of the Republic. "If that is 
going to be a marketplace, we are going to remove the money 
changers from the temple," President Carlos Roberto Reina has 
said. 
  Visibly cross, the president has reacted to questions from 
reporters who asked him about the behavior of certain Government 
House officials and the limitations that have been imposed on 
normal journalistic activities. He asked for respect for the 
dignity of the presidential office, saying he will guarantee 
freedom of speech and the conditions necessary for journalists 
to obtain news. "If there is some regulation someone does not 
like, we will explain and discuss it," he has said. 
  Reina defended Lucio Izaguirre, his private secretary. He 
resented the way Izaguirre has been criticized, saying it was 
denigrating and rude. It has been reported that Izaguirre is 
the official who has clashed with the press as a result of 
unfortunate statements. He has also not established any type of 
direct relationship with the reporters who cover the 
Presidential House. 
  Reina said the moral revolution has many enemies. They are 
the corrupt individuals "who want to confuse public opinion," he 
said. He accused "certain journalists" of wanting to plant 
doubts about the moral revolution, saying extreme measures 
cannot be taken only six days after taking office. 
  He has asked reporters to help him stop those doubts, 
adding: 
"If the press does not help me, the moralization objectives 
might be sullied." 
  Very angry, Reina told one of the reporters it is false the 
doors to information in the Government House have been closed. 
"It is not true, it is not true," he stated emphatically. 
"That is what they have said to tarnish the moral revolution," 
he said.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Feb (NA) -- The UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] platform for the 10 April election of Constituent 
Assembly members emphasizes watering down the presidential 
system, enhancing the legislative branch's role, and the 
judiciary's independence. 
  It also highlights the need to strengthen the federal system 
of government, change the status of Buenos Aires City, and 
broaden the framework of citizens' rights and guarantees. 
  The text was approved during the UCR National Convention 
that 
was in session until early this morning at the Asturian Center 
in Vicente Lopez. The text makes it clear that "in full 
exercise of the plenary's authority," it drafted the UCR 
platform "pursuant to the provisions of the party's national 
by-laws." 
  The platform's most salient points concerning the system of 
checks and balances include the establishment of the post of 
cabinet chief, shortening the president's and vice president's 
terms of office to four years, the direct election of the 
president and vice president through a first round and a runoff, 
and regulating the president's power to issue decrees in cases 
of emergency or need. 
  It further endorses the direct election of three senators 
for 
each constituency as of 1995, streamlining the process of 
enacting laws, and Congress' power to decide on federal 
intervention and strengthening its role as a check on the 
executive branch. 
  With a view to buttressing the country's legal security and 
the judiciary's independence, the UCR tract demands that a 
Council for Magistrates be established for the appointment of 
federal judges and Supreme Court justices -- whose nomination 
will have to be confirmed by the Senate by a two-third majority 
of those present at the session -- and trial by jury as a 
procedure to remove low-level judges from office. 
  Moreover, it calls for strengthening the federal system of 
government and municipal autonomy through the redefinition of 
financial relations between the federal and provincial 
governments, which will include setting up a revenue-sharing 
plan and giving provinces the power to administer their own 
resources without any interference from the federal government. 
  It also states that the federal plan should entail the 
possibility of signing international agreements that do not 
tamper with the federal government's authority, stipulating a 
deadline for a federal intervention, and acknowledging the 
principle of municipal authority. 
  The UCR platform also underscores the importance of changing 
the status of Buenos Aires City by acknowledging its autonomy 
and its special rights concerning legislation and jurisdiction. 
It proposes setting up a constituent assembly for Buenos Aires 
City in order to organize its institutions. 
  With regard to citizens' rights and guarantees, the platform 
provides for the incorporation of semi-direct democracy 
mechanisms like the right to petition and nonbinding referendums 
or plebiscites. 
  It further provides for the express upholding of habeas 
corpus; constitutional guarantees for the protection of civil 
rights; the defense of user and consumer rights against 
constraining practices, monopolistic attempts, or undue 
privileges; and constitutional acknowledgement of political 
parties. 
  Finally, the tract stresses the need to have a qualified 
majority to modify the system of elections and political 
parties, as well as the laying down of rules that guarantee the 
defense of democracy.

  [Text] YPF [Government Oil Deposits] announced that daily 
oil production at the close of 1993 continued to increase: 3.6 
percent for December in respect of the previous month and 12.4 
percent compared to December 1992. The increase was achieved in 
particular in company operated production, which went up by 5.14 
percent, with the Comodoro Rivadavia region showing 7 percent 
growth. Plaza Huincul production also increased, by 4.7 percent, 
despite the fact that this region was still limited in oil 
extraction due to problems of evacuation, which will continue 
unto the start-up of the trans Andean pipeline in February 1994. 
  Total accumulated annual production increased in 1993 by 5.3 
percent in respect of 1992 -- 9.2 percent for company operated 
production and 3.7 percent for nonoperated. 
  If December 1993 is compared to December 1992, the year's 
trend is observable, with operated production increasing by 22.2 
percent, nonoperated decreasing by 2.8 percent and total 
retained increasing by 14.6 percent. 
  At the same time, gas delivered to transporters in December 
decreased by 5.3 percent, in respect of the previous months, due 
to seasonal problems. 
  Crude prices at the end of 1993 were 20 percent below those 
registered half way through the year; the drop was greatest in 
December -- 12.5 percent below November. 
  In December 1993 85 exploration and development wells were 
drilled, as against 79 in the month of November and 28 in 
December 1992. The greater perforation activity was a result of 
the programmes drawn up half way through the year for the Golfo 
San Jorge basin, and which were completed as foreseen. 
  Also in December 1993 the processing of crude in refineries 
remained on the level of the previous month. It diminished 20 
percent in respect of December 1992, as a result of the sale of 
the Campo Duran and San Lorenzo refineries. 
  Sale of petrols in the internal market increased by 12.1 
percent and those of gas oil diminished by 10.4 percent. In both 
cases sales were lower than those of December 1992, but the 
decrease was amply compensated by greater exports. 
  Crude exports in December 1993 increased by 30 percent in 
respect of November. For the whole year, the increase over 1992 
was 122 percent. By-product exports reduced, favouring crude and 
thus improving the company's overall economic picture. 
  The company's programme for protection and recuperation of 
the environment was carried out in the three production regions, 
with particular attention paid to the elimination and filling in 
of oil pools spillages. In 1993, 183 such pools were covered 
over in Plaza Huincul, 265 in Mendoza and 191 in Comodoro 
Rivadavia, a total of 639. 
  Finally, staff was reduced from 13,225 employees in December 
1992 to 7,840 in December 1993.

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Feb (EFE) -- The opposition Party of 
the Democratic Revolution (PRD), the third political force in 
Mexico, asserted today that the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) will not become a political party. PRD Deputy 
Roberto Robles Garnica rejected the possibility that the rebels, 
who rose up in arms in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, will 
participate in the presidential elections to be held on 21 
August 1994. 
  The deputy said he was pleased that a peasant movement had 
arisen in Chiapas because they are expressing what peasants 
throughout the country have been demanding for decades. He 
underscored that the armed conflict has made a significant 
change in Mexican politics. 
  Robles also stated that it has been said that the EZLN is 
only fighting for four small zones but that this is an attempt 
to oversimplify events, as it has been proven that their demands 
are the ones of all poor Indians and peasants. 
  Despite this, he insisted, it will be difficult for the EZLN 
to participate in the next federal elections, "because if they 
become a party it would a local one." However, Robles Garnica 
admitted that the Zapatist rebels could support one of the 
presidential candidates. He said, however, that he did not care 
to comment on how they could go about entering politics.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 8 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Chiapas 
Congress today approved severe sanctions against torture and a 
tax exemption as part of the reconciliation process in Chiapas. 
This reconciliation process prompted an imminent peace meeting. 
  Congress President Juan Jose Rueda said the Law to Prevent 
and Punish Torture, which the state legislature approved, 
establishes sentences of one to 12 years imprisonment for 
committing torture. 
  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno sponsored the measure, which 
also invalidates confessions made in the absence of a defense 
lawyer and which is within a framework of pacification measures. 
These measures include an amnesty for common crimes committed 
during the conflict. 
  The local congress also approved a pardon of state taxes 
between January and June of 1994 in the 30 municipalities 
affected by the conflict, which began on 1 January with the 
emergence of the armed group the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army. 
  According to the measure adopted in Tuxtla Gutierrez, which 
is located 1,100 km southeast of Mexico City, taxpayers of the 
Lacandona Jungle and the Chiapas Highlands will be exempt from 
paying taxes on land, income [nomina], and unlisted businesses. 
  Governor Lopez Moreno has decided to reform the penal code 
following demands made by Indian leaders and farmers in Chiapas 
who have criticized this document by calling it the most 
"backward" in the country. 
  A virtual truce has prevailed in the conflict area since 12 
January, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decreed a 
unilateral cease-fire as a measure to facilitate actions by 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  Camacho Solis and the armed group are awaiting an "imminent" 
and first peace meeting aimed at finding a solution to the armed 
conflict, which, according to official figures, has resulted in 
many deaths. 
  Meanwhile, residents of the Teopisca, Huehuetan, Cacahoatan, 
Tuzantan, and Mapastepec Municipalities have occupied local 
governmental buildings to demand the dismissal of their 
respective mayors, whom they accuse of corruption and of 
promoting violence. 
  Teopisca residents on 8 February also blocked the 
Pan-American Highway between San Cristobal de las Casas and 
Comitan to call attention to their demand, which is similar to 
that of the residents of other municipalities located in the 
conflict area. 
  The demonstrators prevented the delivery of medicines, 
potable water, and food to the municipality, allowing only 
journalists to enter.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over a 
ceremony held at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City today, 
commemorating the 81st anniversary of the Loyalty March when a 
group of cadets of the Heroic Military School escorted President 
Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace. During 
the event, Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan 
praised the soldiers deployed in Chiapas State for their 
dedication and spirit. Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Army's 
intervention in the Chiapas conflict is strictly in accordance 
with the law and ethics of the Armed Forces. 
  [Riviello Bazan] "We did not act on our own, rather, in 
accordance to the law. We are in Chiapas to protect 
constitutional order, which is demanded of us by the country and 
the people of Mexico." 
  Gen. Riviello Bazan said the Armed Forces have acted with 
prudence and firmness, without abuses. 
  [Riviello Bazan] "President Salinas de Gortari is a good 
commander and great social leader. From far and near the hands 
of provocation moved. They found their response in dialogue, 
concord, and national agreement." 
  Gen. Riviello Bazan said values like loyalty are not nor can 
be changeable. 
  [Riviello Bazan] "No one can justify violence and the taking 
up of weapons to demand solutions. We must not attempt to 
glorify those who resorted to violence. If those who encourage 
confrontation were faced with it, the first thing they would do 
is ask the authorities for their protection." 
  The defense secretary said the Armed Forces are reliable, 
and 
this is why the Mexican people support and respect them. 
  [Riviello Bazan] "There are some who would like to separate 
us from the people; that is impossible. We are one and the 
same. Just look at our faces, skin, thoughts, and heart of each 
and every soldier. You will see we are the people; we are 
Mexico just like the rest of the country." 
  The defense secretary added: 
  [Riviello Bazan] "We are no more and no less than any other 
Mexican who works hard for his country. We are an Army for 
peace. We are an Army to have peace. We believe in the law; we 
obey the law; we follow orders. Discipline is our motto." 
  During the event, Gen. Luis Angel Fuentes Alvarez, director 
of the Heroic Military School, read the honor list of the Child 
Heroes of Chapultepec and the Heroic Navy School. Also present 
at the event were representatives of the Legislative and 
Judicial Branches, cabinet members, and the Navy secretary.

  [Text] The investigation into the arrest of 32 people in 
Tuxtla Gutierrez for crimes committed during the armed conflict 
continues. On this and other information, Reporter Susan Soils 
talks to us from the Chiapas capital. 
  [Begin Solis recording] Although a reply is expected today 
on 
the possible release of the 32 people arrested during the armed 
conflict, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for the 
Federal Amnesty Process continue investigating the cases. 
Meanwhile, Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary of the 
Commission for Federal Amnesty Process, announced a reply will 
be issued on their release soon; no date was given however. 
  The Indian State Council will also request the release of 
2,800 inmates, detained in various Chiapas jails, among them 191 
Indians, accused of common crimes, although these have no links 
to the armed conflict. 
  Meanwhile, the State Congress decided to audit 16 
municipalities in Chiapas. They acknowledge that six 
municipalities currently have problems with municipal 
headquarters take-over and sit-down strikes. The municipalities 
in conflict are Huehuetan, Tuzantlan, Pueblo Nuevo, [name 
indistinct], Copainala, (?Yopisca), and Mapastepec. The problems 
have been resolved in Cacahuatan, while a sit-down strike 
continues at the Civic Plaza of Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
  After state police dispersed members of the Citizens Civic 
Front in Mapastepec, who were maintaining blockades on the 
coastal road headling to the Guatemalan border, the protesters 
burned the municipal palace in Mapastepec. The protesters are 
demanding the current municipal council, appointed a few days 
ago by the State Congress after Mayor Lucho (?Puon) Aguilar was 
discharged, be dismissed. 
  At 1430, state police dislodged the demonstrators, who were 
maintaining blockades on the Chiapas coastal road, with tear 
gas. Virgilio Sanchez Roa, leader of the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution in Mapastepec, reported that a person who was 
attempting to flee was run over by a trailer, which then also 
tried to flee. 
  At 1800, some members of the Civic Front moved to the 
municipal palace, which had been occupied for several days, and 
set fire to the building, thereby destroying all the furniture, 
equipment, and archives. In Matastepec, the situations remains 
tense and uncertain, given events that are taking place. Up to 
now, five people have been arrested as part of the operation to 
clear the road. 
  The demonstrators oppose the appointment of Luz Maria Cruz 
Ibarra as president of the Municipal Council. Cruz Ibarra 
assumed the post, replacing Lucho Puon Aguilar. [end recording]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 11 Feb (AFP) -- 
At a time when Chiapas State faces social unrest following the 
seizure of the mayor's offices by the civilian population, the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] demanded in a 
communique published on 11 February that all Chiapas mayors 
resign or be removed. 
  At the same time, the EZLN, in another document sent to the 
media, asks journalists to be "patient" regarding the beginning 
of the peace dialogue. Regarding the peace dialogue, the EZLN 
argues that the delay is due to details over "security for our 
delegates" and not due to "disagreements in the agenda." 
  The EZLN believes that "most" Chiapas mayors "are the 
product 
of electoral fraud, the trampling of the popular will." In this 
document, dated 8 February and addressed to the Civic Front of 
Mapastepec, the rebels state that "municipal councils chosen 
democratically by the people" should fill the mayor posts that 
are left vacant. 
  In the past days, the civilian population has seized five 
mayors' offices in Chiapas to demand the dismissal of the 
mayors, who are all members of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, and whom people accused of mismanagement. 
The offices seized include those in Cacahoatan, Huehuetan, 
Teopisca, Tuzantan, and Mapastepec. According to witnesses, the 
police on 10 February eliminated the blockade of the Mapastepec 
municipal palace with tear gas and shots, leaving a total of 15 
injured. Before the police intervened, residents partially 
burned the mayor's office in order to protest that their demands 
were not heeded.

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Red 
Cross has had contact with retired General Absalon Castellanos, 
the former governor of the Mexican State of Chiapas, who has 
been a hostage of the rebels since 2 January. It is also 
believed that Castellanos will be released quite soon. 
  In a communique, the organization stated that, "following 
Red 
Cross International (IRC) criterion, IRC delegates were allowed 
to see the hostage, who sent a memento to his relatives." 
  Castellanos was abducted from his ranch by members of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The rebels "tried" 
him and sentenced him life in prison. That decision was later 
overturned. 
  The organization's communique added that "if an agreement 
regarding any hostage release can be reached, the IRC is ready 
to meet its commitment as a neutral intermediary." 
  A majority of people in San Cristobal believe that 
Castellanos will be released very soon. Some reports say that 
the event may even take place this very Sunday. 
  Other sources, however, say Castellanos will be freed after 
the first round of talks between the EZLN and the government. 
The place and date for the talks is still unknown, although it 
is believed that they may begin in the next few days.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>
  [Excerpt] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 13 Feb (EFE) 
-- The Armed Forces have discreetly intensified military 
surveillance in the conflict zone in Chiapas State in the 
southeastern part of Mexico. At the same time, the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) is continuing its diplomatic 
offensive by forwarding letters to various social organizations. 
  The community of Altamirano, 850 km southeast of Mexico City 
and one of the four communities attacked by the EZLN in the wake 
of its 1 January offensive, remains virtually occupied by the 
Armed Forces. Cording to an official communique, however, the 
Armed Forces intend to simply maintain a garrison at the 
entrance of the community. Most people in Altamirano who do not 
have to work remain indoors most of the time and prefer to keep 
their opinions on the conflict to themselves. During a brief 
tour of the community, soldiers supported by jeeps and tanks 
could be seen on every street. Also, heightened security 
measures are in effect in the nearby mountainous area where it 
is believed the Zapatist presence is the strongest. 
  Since the conflict began, the Mexican Army has maintained 
some 17,000 soldiers at its primary base in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km 
southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas. As of 15 January when 
a truce was declared, the Army gradually started to withdraw 
from the towns of San Cristobal, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas, 
and it has set up checkpoints at the entrance of each of these 
communities. 
  Yesterday, the Army increased the number of troops at the 
fork in the road leading to Ranch Nuevo and Ocosingo. Ocosingo 
is an access point into the Lacandona jungle, which is a 
Zapatist stronghold. 
  Meanwhile, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
national reconciliation; Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de 
las Casas; and more than 300 journalists are still awaiting a 
possible meeting with the EZLN. The meeting was postponed 
several times over the past week. 
  In his Sunday homily today, Bishop Samuel Ruiz reiterated 
that famine is the most serious problem facing the Chiapas 
Indians who, according to official figures, total 1 million. 
  While waiting for the meeting between the Zapatists and the 
government to take place, Camacho Solis is maintaining contact 
with the EZLN by way of confidential letters. Meanwhile, the 
EZLN also is sending messages to other intermediators. The 
meeting between the EZLN and the government is expected to take 
place in a Chiapas community which has yet to be determined.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of the 
Democratic 
Revolution Party (PRD), has received important support from the 
National Democratic Alliance today. The new electoral alliance 
is comprised by the center-left PRD and by more than 100 small 
political parties and social and people's organizations. 
(Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2105 GMT 5 Feb 94) 
  Cardenas, the PRD candidate, referred to a democracy and 
justice agreement signed by the eight political parties and 
their candidates. "What I want to tell you comrades about what 
we saw in these agreements is a possibility of free elections 
being held, a possibility for our democracy to progress; that is 
the only guarantee we have for peace in the nation," Cardenas 
said. He attended an ecologist forum organized by the PRD this 
morning. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 
5 Feb 94) 
  PRD candidate Cardenas has called on all the nation's 
political forces and the government during a political rally at 
the Revolutionary monument last weekend "to go from promises and 
words to concrete actions to guarantee honest elections on 21 
August." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  Cardenas led a march entitled 100 Hours for Democracy in the 
Mexican capital today. During a news conference, the PRD 
candidate talked about the goal of the this march: "To summon 
officially a special congressional session to implement the 
necessary legislative reforms to guarantee the electoral 
authorities' impartiality," Cardenas stated. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's (Institutional Revolutionary 
Party) official presidential candidate, proposed six basic 
points to guarantee impartial elections on 21 August today. He 
urged PRI members not to resort to methods that may damage the 
nation, thereby risking Mexicans' security. (Mexico City Canal 
13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 Feb 94) 
  PRI candidate Colosio, on the campaign trail in Mexico City 
during the commemoration of the Constitution's 70th anniversary, 
said the Constitution is a guarantee for civil coexistence. "I 
want to restate my conviction and loyalty to its ideals, 
aspirations. I firmly believe in individual rights consecrated 
in the Constitution. I believe deeply in its social orientation 
and valuable democratic contents," he commented. (Mexico City 
XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 5 Feb 94) 
  Colosio has made a commitment to work toward gaining 
convinced and reasoned votes in the coming elections. On the 
campaign trail in Mexico City, Colosio has invited the people to 
compare the PRI proposal with those of the other parties. 
(Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 
GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  PRI candidate Colosio has met with leaders of national 
teachers associations, saying public education is our 
sovereignty's source of vitality. Colosio has said: "I defend 
and will defend the lay and free characteristics of the 
education offered by the state." Subsequently, Colosio met with 
Broad Socialist-Leftist Party members led by Manuel Terrazas, 
who offered him their support. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  Colosio has acknowledged that an ostentatious campaign is an 
insult to the Mexican people; therefore, his will be austere. 
"I will continue with a simple, sober, broadly represented 
campaign in each and every community as we have been doing in 
those we have visited," he has said. (Mexico City Radio ACIR 
Network in spanish 0030 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  On the campaign trail in Jalisco State, Colosio has made a 
commitment to lead a government of actions, not of words. "I 
have come to make a commitment before you, without demagogy, 
without simulations, or myths, because what you appreciate the 
most is the truth. You appreciate straightforward talk; that is 
the way you speak, and that is the way I want us to speak to 
each other," he has said. (Mexico City XEW Television Network 
in Spanish 0435 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party (PAN) 
presidential candidate, has rejected the state as lord and 
master of the economy. Fernandez has said if he were elected 
president he would continue with the Solidarity Program, but he 
said he would strengthen municipal structures. He has spoken 
out for "a peaceful not a violent change in Mexico." (Mexico 
City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 5 Feb 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the 
Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party, has announced as of today his political 
campaign will be against NAFTA, as well as against the 
constitutional reforms, which will allow sons of foreigners to 
aspire to the Presidency after the year 2000. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1803 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  Marcela Lombarda Otero, Popular Socialist Party presidential 
candidate, has said during her tour in Zacatecas that to hold 
the coming elections peacefully, "Mexicans should be on guard, 
given the prevailing threats and pressures." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  Antonio Lozano Garcia, National Action Party secretary 
general, has said perfecting the electoral legal framework is 
fundamental to changing the nation's political reality. Lozano 
has said the PRI and government practices must be eliminated, 
given that until a clear division is made between the official 
party and the government, the democratic process cannot be 
achieved. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in 
Spanish 1300 GMT 4 Feb 94) 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, National Opposition Union (UNO) 
candidate, has said more important than reviewing electoral law 
is "the need to count on impartial authorities." (Mexico City 
Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 Feb 94) 
  UNO candidate Madero has told students of the Spanish 
American University more reforms are necessary to the electoral 
rulings to guarantee honest and democratic elections. Madero 
has said: "The conditions are set to allow for clean elections. 
There has been an undeniable opening in the media, something I 
have said before." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca

  During the last day of his campaign trail in Morelos, UNO 
candidate Madero held a meeting with party members at municipal 
headquarters. After traveling to Jocultal, he said election 
conditions had changed radically. He said the next step for 
Mexico "is to achieve democracy, as this is for the good of the 
nation. Let no one hesitate," he said, "because the good of the 
nation should be above any party interests." (Mexico City XEW

  Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the Labor Party, 
has 
said if elected she will propose procedural changes to achieve 
justice in the nation, and she would reopen the Guadalajara gas 
explosion case, "as someone must be made responsible." "I have 
no possibilities of being elected if the nation and the 
elections develop without any significant," Soto has said.

  [Text] Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar pointed 
out yesterday in the capital of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay 
that Bolivia is willing to gradually -- and with increased 
strength -- approach the member countries of the Common Market 
of the South, Mercosur, made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, 
and Uruguay. 
  Aranibar is in Montevideo, the capital of the Oriental 
Republic of Uruguay, where he is participating in a Latin 
American Integration Association, Aladi, meeting. There are 
problems regarding the participation of Mexico -- which has 
already signed an agreement with Canada and the United States -- 
as far as the free trade agreement is concerned.

<F P=106> [Report on LOS TIEMPOS staff interview with Minister of the </F>
Presidency Carlos Sanchez Berzain in La Paz by Eddy de la 
Quintana; date not given] 
  [Text] La Paz (LOS TIEMPOS)--One of the basic goals that 
the current administration intends to achieve in its four-year 
term is to lay the groundwork for Cochabamba to become the 
nation's largest and most important development pole, owing both 
to its resource potential and to its central location. It will 
thus be able to greatly spur growth in several other regions of 
the country. 
  This goal was set forth by the minister of the presidency of 
the republic, Carlos Sanchez Berzain, who spoke at length with 
the LOS TIEMPOS editorial staff in the city of La Paz during a 
working breakfast, touching in particular on several facets of 
the status of, problems in, and projections for regional 
development in the Department of Cochabamba. 
  After indicating that this major region of the country was 
"constantly deceived during the four years of the previous 
administration," the minister, who prides himself on being a 
genuine and dedicated representative of Cochabamba in the 
Executive Branch, noted that the political and historical 
process that the country is now undergoing raises hopes that 
this department can become a major center for generating and 
spurring national development. 
  "Cochabamba must regain the leadership that it has had in 
various spheres of national life throughout the history of the 
republic," the minister of the presidency stated optimistically. 
<H5>  The Myth of Misicuni </H5>
  During their conversation Berzain and the editors of LOS 
TIEMPOS gave lengthy consideration to the multipurpose Misicuni 
project, which various segments of the population in Cochabamba 
and nationwide see as the major one for promoting regional 
development. 
  "Misicuni is no doubt the project that has been talked up 
the 
most, the one that has been inaugurated most often, and the one 
that has always been manipulated politically by various parties, 
without anything definite ever having been done to realize it in 
the short or medium term," the minister of the presidency 
contended. 
  He reported that so far real sources of financing for the 
project have not been firmed up. He recalled that as the 
previous administration (former President Jaime Paz Zamora's) 
was drawing to a close, it merely started trying to secure a 
loan from the Italian Government so that it could begin work on 
part of the first stage of diverting the Serketa and Titiri 
rivers. This stage was also manipulated politically for 
clear-cut vote-getting purposes. 
  He said that President Sanchez de Lozada's administration 
has 
continued these efforts, and an official response from the 
Italian Government is expected in February or March of next year. 
  He explained that the current administration's policy is to 
preserve the multipurpose nature of the Misicuni Project, which 
is regarded as a national priority. To this end, it will be 
included as an essential component of the package of programs 
that will be submitted to the Consulting Council of the World 
Bank that will be meeting from 8 to 10 December in Washington. 
The administration will also negotiate a line of credit with the 
Inter-American Development Bank for the hydroelectric component 
of the project. 
  He indicated, however, that "the first signs that the 
Misicuni Project is solving the problem of drinking and 
irrigation water are not expected to be seen for about five 
years." He thus said that there was an urgent need to develop 
alternative solutions that can be implemented quickly. 
<H5>  Water Wells </H5>
  After indicating that the shortfall in drinking water 
supplies for the Cochabamba population is about 400 liters per 
second, Sanchez Berzain reaffirmed that the administration is 
determined to find quick solutions to this disturbing problem. 
  In this connection, he reported that the administration has 
decided to give additional support to SEMAPA. It has pledged 
$300,000, $100,000 of which has already been disbursed, to 
harness water in the El Paso zone, where it expects to obtain an 
extra 107 liters a second for Cochabamba. 
  He also mentioned the important technical studies that are 
being conducted with France's cooperation on drilling new wells 
to harness deep waters with the precautions necessary to prevent 
environmental damage in the region. 
  He announced that the overall 1994 budget would include 
$800,000 for these drilling projects and for the expansion and 
renovation of the systems that distribute drinking water to the 
city of Cochabamba. 
  He noted that "all this will be done without putting aside 
Misicuni at any time, but as President Sanchez de Lozada said, 
we are going to crow only after the egg has been laid." 
<H5>  Oil Region </H5>
  Another topic that Minister Carlos Sanchez discussed during 
his talk with LOS TIEMPOS at the seat of government was 
Cochabamba's membership in the club of departments that have 
traditionally produced hydrocarbons, such as Santa Cruz, 
Chuquisaca, and Tarija. 
  He indicated that although Cochabamba's history as a 
potential hydrocarbons-producing region goes back many years, 
the department was long neglected because of the deceit of 
previous administrations and interference by certain sectors 
from other regions of the country. 
  He pointed out that the situation has now been completely 
reversed, as Cochabamba looks to become the second largest 
fossil fuels producing department in 1994 and the largest in 
1995. 
  Sanchez noted that these projections, which President 
Sanchez 
de Lozada recently underscored on his visit to the Bulo Bulo oil 
field, represent a fundamental short-term change for the 
department of Cochabamba, which is taking shape as a major 
center of national development. 
  He announced that the 1994 budget appropriates around $103 
million for oil exploration and development projects in that 
department. He also gave assurances that the Carrasco-Valle 
Hermoso multipurpose pipeline would be completed, adding that 
there is a $23 million credit line for this purpose as part of 
the investment program totaling $77 million. 
<H5>  Export Center </H5>
  The administration's overall plans for the regional 
development of Cochabamba also include turning the city's air 
terminal into one of the country's main export centers, 
especially in connection with nontraditional goods with value 
added. 
  "We want to turn Cochabamba into the country's major 
aeronautical center," he said, adding that for this purpose the 
offices of the president and senior executives of Lloyd Aereo 
Boliviano have been ordered transferred to that city. 
  He indicated that the new air terminal for passengers and 
freight may open in February of next year. He reaffirmed that as 
of then we can start building a major center for the export of 
processed foods, fruits, and other items and promote greater 
exports of various manufactured goods and handicrafts. 
<H5>  The Coca Problem </H5>
  Berzain was equally optimistic about the problem of excess 
coca production in the tropical region of Cochabamba, which some 
opinion groups see as a hindrance to the department's regional 
development. He felt that the problem was on the way to a 
solution. 
  "The excess production of coca is an economic problem that 
has an economic solution," he said, adding that the 
administration is bent on promoting programs to improve social 
conditions in the neglected rural areas of that department and 
other regions of the country to prevent large groups of peasants 
from moving into the Chapare.

enterprises into mixed corporations under government control, 
submitted to the Senate on 31 January] 
  [Text] The Honorable National Congress resolves: 
<H6>  Chapter 1: Establishment of Mixed Corporations </H6>
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  To authorize the executive branch to use the assets and/or 
claims of state-owned enterprises as the paid-up capital of the 
mixed corporations that will be set up. 
  Private shareholders who participate in the establishment of 
these mixed corporations must be Bolivian citizens. 
  A qualified stock option plan for employees of each 
state-owned enterprise will be implemented when setting up the 
respective mixed corporation up to the amount of their social 
benefits. 
<H5>  Article 2 </H5>
  To authorize and approve the articles of agreement to turn 
Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB), the National 
Electricity Enterprise (ENDE), the National Telecommunications 
Enterprise (ENTEL), the National Railway Enterprise (ENFE), and 
the National Smelting Enterprise (ENAF) into mixed stock 
corporations that will have as the state's contribution the book 
value of those enterprises' equity. 
<H6>  Chapter 2: Recapitalization </H6>
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  The Executive Branch will order, through a supreme decree, 
the recapitalization of each mixed corporation established 
pursuant to the present law or of existing mixed corporations. 
<H5>  Article 4 </H5>
  The recapitalization of mixed corporations will be achieved 
by increasing their equity capital through national and/or 
foreign private investors' contributions. The corporate stocks 
that represent these new contributions can under no 
circumstances exceed the total issued share capital of the said 
mixed corporations. 
  Investors and administrators of the mixed stock corporations 
-- the recapitalization of which is pursuant to the provisions 
of the present law -- may not purchase either directly or 
indirectly outstanding shares of the said mixed corporations 
through third parties as long as the administration contract is 
effective. 
<H5>  Article 5 </H5>
  Liabilities of mixed corporations, the recapitalization of 
which will be instituted, may be transferred to the Treasury by 
a supreme decree at the time the recapitalization of said 
corporations is effected. The service of these debts will be 
included in the respective budget law. 
<H5>  Article 6 </H5>
  Authority is deferred to the executive branch to transfer, 
free of charge, the shares the state holds in mixed corporations 
-- the equity capital of which has been increased pursuant to 
Article 4 of the present law -- to Bolivian citizens who have 
come of age by 31 December 1995. 
  This transfer of shares is exempt from tax. 
<H5>  Article 7 </H5>
  The executive branch will, through a supreme decree, 
establish proper, legal, and suitable mechanisms so that the 
Bolivian citizens mentioned in the preceding article may benefit 
from the transfer of the aforementioned shares to pension funds 
of individual capitalization. The executive branch may order, 
through a supreme decree, the implementation of alternative 
mechanisms for attaining the objectives of the present law. 
<H6>  Chapter 3: Disqualifications </H6>
<H5>  Article 8 </H5>
  All government officials and civil servants from national, 
regional, or local government departments linked to the

including chairmen, deputy chairmen, and members of the 
executive boards of the state-owned enterprises or mixed 
corporations, the recapitalization of which will be made 
pursuant to the provisions of the present law, and his blood 
relations, in lineal or collateral descent and/or kindred up to 
those twice removed inclusive -- are banned from participating 
as investors in the recapitalization of companies that are the 
subject of the present law, whether directly or indirectly 
through companies in which the aforementioned persons 
participate in the decision-making process. This ban extends 
for four years after the person ceases his/her functions within 
the government. 
  A contravention of what is stipulated in this article will 
entail the annulment of the actions owned by the offender and 
the reversion of their value to the corporation's equity. 
<H5>  Article 9 </H5>
  No government official or civil servant of national, 
regional, local government departments, or chairmen, deputy 
chairmen, or members of the executive boards of the state-owned 
enterprises or mixed corporations -- the recapitalization of 
which will be made pursuant to the provisions of the present 
law, or his blood relations, in lineal or collateral descent 
and/or kindred up to those twice removed inclusive -- may hold 
management, administrative, consultant, or advisory posts in the 
stock corporations recapitalized pursuant to the present law for 
four years after the date they ceased their public function. 
<H5>  Article 10 </H5>
  Communications, electricity, transport services and 
hydrocarbons come under the jurisdiction of the national 
government and will be regulated by specific sectorial laws. 
  These public services are excluded from what has been 
stipulated in Article 9, Paragraph 4, Articles 72 and 73 of the 
Municipalities Organizational Law enacted on 10 January 1985 and 
will be regulated by an agency whose creation, roles, and powers 
will be established by law. 
<H5>  Article 11 </H5>
  Law 1150 dated 6 March 1985 -- which was published in

reports on economic activities in Bolivia through 10 February: 
  The Andean Development Corporation, CAF, and Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits, YPFB, signed a $20 million loan 
agreement on 28 January. This credit, which will not have to be

  [Text] National Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz has 
noted that despite a huge effort by Bolivia in the field of 
interdiction of drug trafficking and eradication of coca crops, 
illegal narcotics trafficking has increased during the past few 
years. 
  During the opening ceremony of the first subregional 
cooperation meeting of representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, 
Chile, and Peru, Mario Soliz said he hopes effective policies 
for trafficking control will be established. 
  During the first session of this meeting, which will last 
until 3 February, the Bolivian Government raised two programs 
that represent the basis for the alternative development 
strategy: the opening of export markets and the establishment of 
a Subregional Fund for Alternative Development [Fondo 
Subregional Para el Desarrollo Alternativo]. National 
International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio said the 
Bolivian Government is committed to combating drug trafficking, 
its consequences, and one of its main causes: poverty. 
  Soliz explained that the basic task for the four cooperating 
countries is to enhance control and coordination at various 
levels within that broad area of thousands of kilometers of 
shared borders. 
  Soliz said: "There are highways, roads, railways, sea 
routes, 
and airways, which are clandestine routes for drugs, chemicals, 
and precursors. These borders are currently violated by 
criminal drug organizations." 
  In the case of Bolivia, Soliz said, this violation has a 
very 
serious cultural component because coca, a sacred element for 
Bolivians, seriously worries the world when its use does not 
conform to the traditional practices that have been a custom in 
our area for hundreds of years. 
  The social defense secretary said: "Despite efforts by the 
Bolivian Government in the field of drug enforcement, 
eradication of coca crops, and alternative development policy, 
drug trafficking activities have increased." 
  After indicating that Bolivia has achieved significant 
advancements, Soliz noted that 47 percent of the entire coca 
crops existing in 1987 have been eradicated. 
  Soliz added: "Nevertheless, while our country was conducting 
this huge task, supported by international cooperation, the 
international drug cartels attempted to increase the illegal 
crop." 
  Soliz indicated that this subregional meeting of 
representatives of the four participating countries shows the 
responsibility of establishing an alliance against the "deadly 
challenge" posed by trafficking to their governments and 
populations. He said that discussions will focus on all the 
aspects of the drug problem, including the opening of export 
markets for products yielded by the replacement of crops within 
the framework of alternative development and ways to increase 
the effectiveness of interdiction. 
  The social defense secretary said the discussions will also 
involve controls on chemicals trafficking and issues of a 
scientific, moral, and human nature, including the worrisome 
question: Why do people take drugs? 
  National International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio 
said the efforts made by the producing countries, like Bolivia, 
are not matched by the international community. 
  Aparicio stressed: "This meeting is part of a drug 
enforcement strategy that views with interest a solution to 
illegal drug production, trade, and abuse. Nevertheless, a 
solution to the causes encouraging these illegal actions should 
also be found."

  [Text] Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio Molina 
Fonseca has said that even though the UN rapporteur on Human 
Rights (Pedro Micken) never visited the country, he had to study 
the Salvadoran human rights situation very closely. It seems 
that poor coordination between (Micken) and the Salvadoran 
Foreign Ministry prevented his visit to the country. However, 
Molina Fonseca has said that disregard for human rights in the 
country is a matter of concern for everyone. 
  [Begin Molina recording] I believe the human rights 
situation 
concerns all of us. We are going through very delicate times. 
It is a time for much thought. Many deaths are being reported. 
Bodies are constantly being found, and, unfortunately, these 
crimes are not being properly investigated. [end recording] 
  With regard to the murder of Crescencio Diaz by U.S. soldier 
Michael Lopez, the ombudsman said investigations are underway to 
find out what happened. 
  [Begin Molina recording] What should worry us is finding out 
how Major Lopez got out of the country. That is what the 
Salvadoran people should find out. We have opened a file on 
this case and we have requested information from the Foreign 
Ministry, immigration, the judge hearing the case, and the 
National Police director. We want to find out who is 
responsible for this. [end recording] 
  Molina Fonseca also addressed the Goteras Jail massacre and 
said that he is very worried because the Justice Ministry has 
yet to issue a report on the case and establish responsibilities.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani yesterday said he 
thought a U.S. army major accused of killing a Salvadoran 
bodyguard should be found guilty and noted the family of Jose 
Crescencio Diaz should receive "compensation." Cristiani said: 
"We believe the judge should find Major Ismael Lopez, or 
whomever he represented, guilty." 
  Lopez, who was transferred to the headquarters of the U.S. 
Southern Command in Panama, is accused of shooting to death his 
bodyguard, Jose Crescencio Diaz, when they were returning from a 
party in Cabanas Department. 
  The body of Diaz was found in a U.S. Embassy vehicle on the 
outskirts of Soyapango, a densely populated city east of San 
Salvador. Lopez is to be tried by a U.S. military court, U.S. 
embassy spokesmen said in San Salvador. 
  Cristiani indicated he asked the United States to let the 
Salvadoran Office of the Prosecutor General participate in the 
Lopez trial. "We want a representative of the Office of the 
Prosecutor General to be present during the trial of Maj. Lopez, 
but we have not received an affirmative or negative response," 
he stated. 
  The Office of the Prosecutor General indicated Maj. Lopez 
killed bodyguard Diaz since the shot was fired from the back 
seat of the vehicle in which they were riding, according to the 
only eyewitness. Special prosecutor Ricardo Larreynaga made that 
statement after hearing the eight-hour testimony given by the 
only two witnesses at the Sensuntepeque lower court. The 
witnesses are Israel Vasquez, Maj. Lopez' driver who was in the 
vehicle the day of the murder, and Miguel Tomas Nerio, who 
received the embassy vehicle with the body in it. The special 
prosecutor explained Vasquez did not see when the shot was fired 
but that it must have been fired from the back seat and not from 
outside because it was an armored vehicle. 
  This testimony made it clear how the incident took place and 
who did the firing, Larreynaga indicated. Although the 
eyewitness did not identify the person who pulled the trigger, 
"it is truly valid now to say that the major was the one who did 
the shooting." The records show the Criminal Investigation 
Division of the National Civilian Police conducted a paraffin 
test on Vasquez and Lopez hours after the incident, but the 
results of both tests were negative.

  [Text] Relatives of a bodyguard murdered by a U.S. officer 
have demanded compensation from the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador 
to help them through the hard economic situation they are 
experiencing. The widow, who appeared on television for the 
first time since her husband's death, said the family's economic 
situation is precarious and has become even more difficult 
without Crescencio Diaz' support. 
  Blanca Molina de Diaz and her three children, two of whom 
are 
permanently disabled by disease, no longer have the financial 
and moral support of the head of the family, Diaz, who was 
murdered while working as a bodyguard for U.S. Major Mike Lopez. 
This crime has left a mark of deep uncertainty on the survivors. 
  [Begin Molina recording] My husband supported my three 
children and me. Now we have been left with no support. Who 
will help us? We have no one to ask for help. My husband was 
our only support. [end recording] 
  Molina has appealed to the U.S. Embassy for help. 
  [Begin recording] [Molina] I have received nothing except a 
bouquet of flowers and condolences. 
  [Reporter] Will you request the Embassy's assistance? 
  [Molina] Yes. [end recording] 
  There is no law that could force the U.S. Embassy to 
compensate the survivors because Diaz worked for a private 
enterprise under contract with the embassy. The murdered man's 
brother has said that aid for this home, which has been 
virtually decapitated, is urgent. 
  [Begin recording] Two of the children are disabled. One of 
them suffers from mental disorders, and the other is crippled. 
[end recording] 
  The only assistance the family could get is from the Social 
Security Fund, which provides a very small amount to the widow 
for her minor children. No one knows for how long that aid will 
last.

  [Text] San Salvador, 10 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Three masked 
individuals killed a member of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front (FMLN) Political Party, the FMLN reported 
today. The FMLN activist was identified as Ismael Bernardino, 
and the incident took place early on Wednesday in the town of 
Nahuizalco, in western Sonsonate Department. 
  FMLN spokeswoman Aida Sanchez explained that according to 
preliminary reports in her possession three individuals went to 
Bernardino's home and killed him. "The hooded individuals were 
carrying large caliber weapons," the relatives of the victim 
indicated. Sanchez stated the men tried to create the 
impression this was a burglary but did not take anything from 
the house. It cannot be ruled out that a death squad killed 
Bernardino, who was fully participating in the political 
campaign, since these groups "are still active" in El Salvador, 
the spokeswoman stressed. 
  Representative of the UN Observers for El Salvador went to 
the site to begin an investigation.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilfredo Cordoba; from the "KL Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has reiterated that our 
country has made important progress in matters related to human 
rights. For this reason, President Cristiani does not believe 
it will be possible for the United Nations to [words indistinct] 
international agreements on this matter. According to President 
Cristiani, human rights in El Salvador should not be placed 
under the same strict scrutiny it was placed under in the past. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Our country is no longer within 
the same framework [words indistinct] constant supervision. On 
the other hand, we believe that it is more than enough [words 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  President Cristiani also shared the concern expressed 
yesterday on "KL Radio News" by General Mauricio Ernesto Vargas. 
Gen. Vargas said that some points in the peace agreements are 
not being respected by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front [FMLN]. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] I would like to say that what 
creates doubt and unrest is the finding of caches and arsenals 
full of weapons that belong to the FMLN. The FMLN has tried to 
make the people believe they have surrendered all their weapons 
and this is not true. This creates some doubt. People wonder 
if they are planning something other than joining the country's 
political life. [end recording] 
  Regarding the replacement of Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, 
director 
of the UN Observers for El Salvador, President Cristiani said 
that he has not been officially advised of the replacement by 
the United Nations. However, it has been said that he will be a 
Venezuelan.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada at the Legislative Assembly in San </F>
Salvador; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] 
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani said Wednesday that the 
departure of Augusto Ramirez Ocampo as UN Observers for El 
Salvador [Onusal] chief scheduled for 31 March is part of the 
normal Onusal changeover. Within this context, he ruled out 
that the change will in any way affect the mission since someone 
else will be named to replace him, as occurred following the 
departure of Igbal Riza, the first person to head Onusal when it 
began its mission. 
  [Begin recording] [Cristiani] First, or at least the 
information we have is that the contract with Mr. Ocampo was for 
one year. He had said earlier he wanted to return to Colombia 
to continue to participate in some capacity in Colombia's 
political life. In this regard, this is nothing more than an 
administrative change, and, in that respect, I do not see that 
this is something against Ramirez, since he has chosen not to 
remain here for personal reasons. 
  Second, talking about these changes, one took place already 
without affecting the efforts to continue implementing the peace 
agreements. That was when Ambassador Igbal Riza was replaced by 
Ambassador Ramirez Ocampo. We do not feel this change has an 
adverse impact on the implementation of those agreements that 
involve processes such as the transfer of land and the lack of 
public security. [as heard] 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Cristiani] Not true. [end recording] Cristiani also flatly 
rejected remarks by Francisco Lima, accusing him of being 
personally responsible for the corruption in state enterprises. 
He said the charges are so groundless that he will not even 
file a suit against Lima. To end, the president said he was 
satisfied with the development of the electoral process that 
will end on 20 March. He added that the elections are 
contributing to the overall development of the democratic 
process in El Salvador. Cristiani made these remarks after he 
presided over a solemn session held this morning in the 
Legislative Assembly. During this session the city of Santa Ana 
was declared a heroic city owing to the developments that took 
place there in 1894 during the revolution that led to the 
ousting of General Carlos Erzeta. In addition, David Escobar 
Galido was declared El Salvador's most distinguished son.

  [Text] A FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
delegation will meet with the UN secretary general and present 
him with the new peace agreement schedule. FMLN leader Juan 
Ramon Medrano said that in addition to visiting New York the 
delegation will meet with U.S. Government representatives in 
Washington to request increased support for the completion of 
the agreements' execution. 
  [Begin Medrano recording] The peace agreements have been 
rescheduled to reaffirm the pledges made by the government and 
FMLN. This is why the FMLN will travel to the United Nations and 
the United States, where it will also request economic and 
political support for the execution of the remaining agreements 
and also for the 20 March electoral process. [end recording] 
  The FMLN delegation's trip was agreed upon after the 
government's new pledges were disclosed. 
  [Begin Medrano recording] First, the National Police must be 
dismantled, once and for all, by October 1994; second, the 
National Civilian Police budget and resources must be improved 
by decreasing the Army's, and we must pursue and step up the 
land transference process which, had it not been blocked, would 
have been completed by now. 
  We also pledged to support every aspect of the electoral 
process; the elections must be as honest as possible, the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal must be modernized, and the 
distribution of electoral cards must be stepped up, especially 
in municipalities where Nationalist Republican Alliance and 
National Coalition Party mayors have hindered the distribution 
of electoral cards, which require birth certificates and 
identification cards. The government has pledged to move faster 
in all of these areas so the elections can truly reflect this 
new period of concerted effort. [end recording] 
  At the meeting with the UN secretary general, the FMLN will 
also discuss the climate surrounding the planning of the 20 
March elections. It has been disclosed that effective 
international verification will be requested to guarantee free 
elections and prevent any attempts at fraud.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections, 
which are scheduled for 20 March 1994, monitored through 10 
February. 
  Luis Zaldivar, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
[TSE], confirmed on 8 February that more than 60,000 citizens 
qualified to vote in the upcoming elections will be left out due 
to irregularities in the filing of applications for 
identification cards. He said: "There are about 60,000 to 
70,000 unapproved applications; this does not correspond to 
exactly that same number of people or voters, because certain 
citizens have filed more than five applications." He added these 
people were left out for lacking a birth certificate because 
"our country's Electoral Code states approval is granted after 
verifying the information entered in an application with those 
on the birth certificate." Zaldivar assured there will be no 
strike, such as last year's, at the TSE, because the workers are 
aware of the importance of the March elections. (San Salvador 
Radio Farabundo Marti Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  The Democratic Convergence will not be able to participate 
in 
the upcoming elections with deputy candidates. The TSE on 2 
February rejected a request to extend the registration deadline. 
The tribunal also reached a consensus agreement to "suspend the 
advertisements of the Liberty and Democracy Institute aimed 
against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front Party." 
TSE President Zaldivar said "this tribunal decided to suspend 
the political or electoral propaganda promoted by organizations 
that are not political parties, because this is established 
expressly by the code." He added there are certain 
advertisements that violate the Electoral Code, but the TSE 
cannot level fines prior to the filing of a lawsuit. (San

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 10 
February: 
  The World Bank granted a $76 million loan to Uruguay to

development. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 1 
Feb 94 p 8) 
  The gross foreign debt was $7.735 billion and the net 
foreign 
debt $2.242 billion through 30 September 1993. The gross foreign 
debt rose $38 million during the first nine months in 1993 as a

<F P=106> [News conference by Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon </F>
Carpio with unidentified reporters in Guatemala City; place and 
date not given; from the "Telepress" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] The defense minister 
said yesterday that political sectors had approached military 
headquarters days before the 28 January referendum for the 
purpose of promoting a coup d'etat. Can you identify the 
political sectors involved and what are your views on this issue? 
  [De Leon] Unfortunately, Guatemalan history contains 
numerous 
incidents such as these which someday, I believe, we will 
overcome precisely by strengthening the democratic system; we 
will forget that the word coup d'etat exists, but we are still a 
long way from that. Indeed, I find it embarrassing for 
civilians and for myself as president and as a civilian, that 
civilian politicians knocked at the headquarters doors, and that 
it was the military officers who turned them away, so to speak. 
  Unfortunately, as the defense minister said, we do not have 
sufficient evidence to take them to court for this action which, 
of course, constitutes a crime. Knocking at the doors is a 
phrase that does not apply exactly to this topic, but it is true 
that there have been rumors to the effect that certain 
politicians attempted to take advantage of the circumstances. 
Fortunately, as I said recently, the officers of the Guatemalan 
Army are professionals who are fully convinced of their role 
within the democratic system. Therefore, I repeat, today more 
than ever in Guatemalan history, there is absolutely no 
possibility of a disruption of institutional order. 
  This proves the position held by the constitutional Army 
which recently, on 25 May for example, gave tangible proof of 
its adherence to the mandates and decisions of the 
Constitutionality Court. The Army, the same as other sectors of 
Guatemalan society, strengthened the democratic process. The 
circumstances prevail today; that is why I said today that I am 
devoted to governability, economic and social issues, a 
broad-based national agreement, and basic issues because 
institutionality has been saved. 
  We have managed to strengthen institutionality over the past 
seven or eight months since the events of 25 May, which also 
strengthens the democratic system, but we must strengthen it 
even more. That is one of the goals of the broad-based national 
agreement but, I reiterate with regret, there are Guatemalans 
who still believe they can resort to coups d'etat but, 
fortunately, the Armed Forces clearly understand the role it 
must play in a democratic system. Therefore, I am dismissing 
the possibility of a coup. The people would not tolerate such a 
thing and just imagine the international isolation we would 
suffer. Therefore, I have totally dismissed the possibility of 
such an action. 
  This does preclude the possibility that individuals who were 
dismissed from the Army may have made certain remarks and 
started these rumors, and that civilians supported them in the 
hope of succeeding. Fortunately, however, things never got past 
the rumor stage, and things are going to remain this way because 
at this time there is no room for coups, at least in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Who were the persons involved? 
  [De Leon] If I knew that they would be standing trial right 
now. 
  [Reporter] You have spoken of politicians; can you speak of 
the involvement of any political parties? 
  [De Leon] No. There have been references to politicians 
[words indistinct] civilians. [laughs] That description would 
be the traditional [words indistinct] for them but they are 
politicians after all. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] Yes. If we knew who they were they would be 
standing trial. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [De Leon] No, no, no. Rumors were spread and because of the 
atmosphere that prevailed certain politicians tried to take 
advantage of them. [Words indistinct] at present we do not have 
any (?evidence). If we did you could rest assured that those 
individuals would be standing trial for the crimes allegedly 
perpetrated. No, no, I believe you should erase the term coup 
d'etat from your minds. There is no room here for coups and the 
people behind the rumors have probably had their last hurrah.

<F P=106> [All quotations marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Relations Minister Gladys Maritza Ruiz 
Vielman stated yesterday that what was previously described by 
the government as a human rights "diplomatic offensive," was 
called off because it was unnecessary and represented an 
expensive investment which the government has no need to pursue 
at this time. 
  The minister added that she believes there is great 
confusion 
with respect to that issue which needs to be clarified. There 
was an initiative that entailed several trips to Europe and 
North and South America by various government representatives to 
explain the progress made in Guatemala with respect to human 
rights and the peace negotiations. 
  According to the minister, these trips, which were 
mistakenly 
called a "diplomatic offensive," did not materialize due to 
several reasons. First of all, the human rights issue will be 
the object of an in-depth analysis during the 50th Ordinary 
Session of the UN Human Rights Commission currently taking place 
in Geneva, which will be attended by an official government 
delegation. What better way than for the Guatemala delegation 
to take advantage of that opportunity to discuss the issue along 
with the other delegations and expand more on what has already 
been covered by our ambassadors at the respective foreign 
ministries. 
  Second, the cost of a huge tour such as the one that had 
been 
organized represented too high an expense for the Guatemalan 
Government. In addition, it meant duplicating efforts by our 
delegation in Geneva as well as our embassies in the different 
nations. 
  Having taken this into consideration, it was decided to 
specifically undertake trips aimed at presenting the new peace 
negotiation framework that resulted from the last meeting in 
Mexico City. Of course, plans for these new trips are much more 
modest than the previous ones. In most cases, the "delegation" 
will be made up of one member of the peace delegation, except in 
one case where two members of the peace delegation will 
participate. In every case they will be accompanied by our 
ambassadors accredited in each capital. As can be seen, the new 
official tour has been reduced to the strictly necessary, and 
the cost has also been cut dramatically. 
  Finally, the minister indicated that using the term 
"offensive" together with the description of "diplomatic" is not 
the most appropriate since an offensive seeks to attack, or 
assault. Diplomatic task consist of exactly the opposite: to 
convince and explain. The two terms do not go well together. 
<H5>  Will Not Establish "Priorities" </H5>
  With respect to publications indicating that priority status 
will be given to diplomatic relations, Foreign Minister Ruiz 
Vielman stated: "In modern international relations it is not 
only inappropriate but also very difficult to classify 
countries. On a bilateral level a country may not be of much 
importance. However, at a multilateral level that same country 
can acquire much importance, thus grading could be ill-suited." 
  According to the minister, where Guatemala does establish a 
priority order is with respect to issues included in the 
international agenda. The intensity and extent of the current 
international context imposes an agenda which must be met in an 
orderly manner in order to concentrate on those issues more 
relevant to our political, economic, social, and cultural 
development. Issues such as the Central American integration 
process and the new regional and sub-regional integration 
framework; the expansion of markets for our products and 
commercial negotiations; Guatemala's projection within the 
multilateral system with the objective of taking advantage of 
political, economic, and cooperation opportunities that are 
opening as a result of group or block negotiations; and taking 
utmost advantage of existent sources of international 
cooperation; among others constitute priority issues included in 
the Foreign Ministry work agenda. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  With regard to the State Department's report on the human 
rights situation in Guatemala in 1993, Minister Ruiz said that 
in general the government hopes the international community will 
recognize the advances made in the Guatemalan sociopolitical 
process, including the human rights issue. 
  She stressed that the Guatemalan Government cannot and will 
not ignore the problem by expecting the structure of violence 
that continued for decades to disappear spontaneously overnight. 
In fact, she added, the Guatemalan Government recognizes that 
there are still some problems that must be resolved in order to 
guarantee full respect for the Guatemalan people's human, 
political, social, economic, and cultural rights. At the same 
time, however, it feels that the efforts conducted by Guatemalan 
society as a whole, and particularly by the government headed by 
President de Leon, to protect those rights should also be 
recognized. 
  Minister Ruiz finally said: "The Guatemalan situation is the 
result of a transition process we are currently experiencing, in 
which the former authoritarian and arbitrary structures are 
being replaced by new democratic regulations in accordance with 
the state of law we are building. It is not exclusively a 
political matter, as it involves social and cultural aspects. 
In reviewing the situation, we must take into consideration 
general trends -- which in the case of human rights are positive 
-- and the political decisions made on the subject. There is no 
doubt about the final objective of the process. Within the 
framework of democracy, we must guarantee total respect for the 
human rights of all Guatemalans, without any discrimination. 
What we need from the international community is their support 
to consolidate the new democratic structures we are determined 
to build.

  [Excerpt] The suit filed before the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade against the United States by Guatemala and 
other nations for restrictions imposed by U.S. import 
regulations on tobacco was confirmed yesterday by Agriculture 
Minister Luis Arturo del Valle and Foreign Trade Minister 
Eduardo Gonzalez. 
  Del Valle said that Guatemala's intention is for the maximum 
institution on world trade to voice its opinion on the legality 
or illegality of the U.S. ruling with regard to the import of 
this product. The agriculture minister indicated that the United 
States has forced the large cigarette companies to purchase 75 
percent of their tobacco needs from U.S. producers, thus 
violating a GATT regulation. That measure, he noted, implies 
that the nation's import of tobacco would be limited to 25 
percent of consumption. This is the reason it was decided to 
file the suit before the GATT so it may in turn issue its 
opinion as to whether this measure is in keeping with its 
mechanisms or not. 
  Gonzalez said that nations in Latin American, including 
Brazil, that have been adversely affected by the U.S. measures 
also joined in the suit. The foreign trade minister said that 
Guatemala maintains close contact with these nations to set up a 
structure similar to the one organized for the banana case, that 
is, to unite Latin American positions in this regard. 
  In another turn of events, the foreign trade minister said 
that the meeting slated for 7-8 February between Mexico and the 
Central American Northern Triangle [El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras] has been postponed until a latter date that could be 
21 February. Gonzalez indicated that the reason for suspension 
of the meeting was that the Group of Three (Mexico, Colombia, 
and Venezuela) did not reach an agreement. This situation 
forced the Mexicans to request the meeting to be delayed to 
analyze its current position. 
  To conclude, Gonzalez said that Guatemala's position is to 
gain better access for our products in the Mexican market, as a 
series of difficulties have been registered with merchandise 
such as carton boxes, lamina [not further specified], and sugar.

  [Text] Vice President Alberto Dahik, Government Minister 
Marcelo Santos, and Industry Minister Jose Vicente Maldonado 
ruled out the possibility of a coup d'etat in Ecuador and denied 
there is no security for foreign investments in the country. 
The British magazine THE ECONOMIST a few days ago published a 
report that was reprinted by a Quito newspaper about the 
possibility of a coup d'etat in the next two years. The report 
stated that the Ecuadoran president plays merely a symbolic role. 
  Vice President Dahik said that democracy has the support of 
the Armed Forces. He added that these types of reports 
originate in the country to discredit Ecuador's leaders abroad. 
Marcelo Santos said that, God willing, President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen will complete his term. As government minister, he 
said, I can assure the country that there is no evidence to make 
us suspect that the country will experience such a situation in 
the near or distant future. 
  Industry Minister Maldonado said that the British magazine's 
analysis is not objective because it does not take into account 
the government's great willingness to strengthen the democratic 
system or the people's struggle to maintain democracy. THE 
ECONOMIST said that Ecuador is one of the countries with the 
greatest risk to investments because it has had weak governments 
that have not fulfilled their programs.

  [Text] The Court of Constitutional Guarantees, with five 
votes in favor and one opposed, declared the executive decree 
increasing gasoline prices unconstitutional and suspended it for 
fundamental reasons. The Court also submitted this resolution 
to the Supreme Court's Constitutional Court and ruled that it be 
published in the official gazette. 
  The gasoline price increase has sparked a great deal of 
protest in the country for the past several days. Every day the 
Ecuadoran people ask the president to reconsider his decision, 
but Sixto Duran-Ballen has said that he will not reconsider. 
After learning of the Court of Constitutional Guarantees' 
ruling, the president said that he will appeal the decision 
before the Supreme Court's Constitutional Court.

  [Text] Quito, 12 Feb (DPA) -- A sudden political conflict 
that heralds a soon to come collision between the government and 
the opposition erupted today in Ecuador when President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen's liberal government challenged the validity of a 
Court of Constitutional Guarantees ruling suspending an increase 
in gasoline prices. 
  "The ruling is illegal and valueless," Duran-Ballen stated 
while announcing that the new price structure, in effect since 
29 January, "will not be revised." 
  The ruling of the Constitutional Court, which is controlled 
by the opposition parties, would have been implemented 
immediately, halting price increases on several fuels announced 
by the government to compensate for fiscal revenue losses 
brought about by the fall of international crude oil prices. 
  Today, however, prices remain at the same levels as before 
"because there is no reason to alter them," as explained by 
Interior Minister Marcelo Santos. The minister accused the 
opposition of "cheap maneuvers" by requesting a declaration of 
unconstitutionality against the price increase because the 
opposition claims it was done by creating new taxes, an 
attribute that does not correspond to the government but is 
limited to only Congress. 
  The government's challenge came about as a result of the 
Constitutional Court's irregular structure. The mandate of its 
members, which was scheduled to end December 1992, was extended. 
Under this configuration, the court did not obtain the mandatory 
five votes that would have suspended the price increase. 
  On Friday, National Congress President Samuel Belletini, 
"representing the government," unexpectedly swore-in a lawyer as 
the new court magistrate. This same lawyer had been appointed by 
former President Rodrigo Borja but had never assumed his 
responsibilities because at that time he did not have the 
required minimum age. 
  The current administration, which came to office in 1992, 
did 
not appoint its representative to the court because it was 
waiting for a complete reorganization, which was scheduled to 
take place in December 1992. 
  In a swift court decision taken last night (local time), the 
new court magistrate provided the necessary fifth vote allowing 
the fuel increase to be declared unconstitutional. 
  The fuel price increase caused two weeks of violent street 
protests, especially in Quito. In addition, a workers strike and 
an Indian mobilization were also declared. New protest marches 
against the fuel increase have already been announced for this 
coming Wednesday, after the long carnival holidays. Following 
the court's decision and the government's challenge, we foresee 
that the opposition parties, which control the Ecuadoran 
Congress, will react harshly to these events.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Four Chinese citizens who were arrested 
at the end of 1993 carrying forged passports testified on 9 
February before the 10th Federal Court. They confirmed that 
Brasilia is a new route for escaped Chinese citizens to enter 
the United States. In November, three other Chinese citizens 
were arrested by Federal Police in Acre State. They said they 
were trying to reach Brasilia to take a plane to the United 
States. 
  Judge Pedro Paulo Castelo Branco questioned the four 
arrested 
Chinese citizens. They said that they purchased their forged 
passports from Cesar Bezerra Lin for $7,000. Federal Police 
believe Lin is one of the leaders of a gang that forges 
documents for Asians who want to travel to the United States. 
The gang is headquartered in Sao Paulo. It also forges visas 
and possibly identity cards. The Chinese citizens arrested in 
Brasilia confessed that they were aware that the documents were 
forged. 
  Chen Gouxing, Huang Daiyuan, Chen Gongchin, and Dong Shirong 
arrived in Sao Paulo, where a man identified simply as Chou -- 
whom the police believe to be Cesar Lin -- helped them obtain 
the documents. The four traveled to Brasilia by bus. Chen 
Gongchin had a forged identity card for foreigners. Aged 
between 19 and 23, and without stable jobs in their country, the 
four university graduates fear being expelled from Brazil.

  [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and 
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso have signed a 
memorandum of understanding whose main point involves the 
recognition of professions in the two countries. 
  The recognition of diplomas will be studied by the 
professional associations of the two countries. If no agreement 
is reached, the governments intend to draft specific legislation 
that will ensure the validity of registries. 
  Minister Celso Amorim noted that it will now be up to the 
Portuguese institutions to discuss the situation of these 
professionals. He noted that the agreement applies to 
professions such as attorneys-at-law, doctors, and architects. 
  The two ministers also signed an agreement that guarantees 
the promotion and protection of investments between the 
governments of Brazil and Portugal. 
  Foreign Minister Durao Barroso believes that this also 
represents a great opening for Brazil to negotiate with other 
European nations.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] On 2 February the Brazilian Government signed the 
1993 Cocoa Agreement, which will be effective for five years. 
With the signing of Brazil, the main cocoa-producing country 
that had not yet signed the agreement, what is now missing is 
the massive participation of the consumers so that the agreement 
can become effective. The European union is the main cocoa 
consumer. Brazilian diplomats reported last week that the 
Europeans will sign the agreement. 
  The new agreement is based on production and consumer 
committees with the objective of promoting the development and 
strengthening of the sector. Sergio Moreira Lima, chief of 
Itamaraty's Basic Products Division, told this newspaper that 
"there is a commitment to seek a balance between supply and 
demand and thus prevent the overproduction of cocoa that has 
been responsible for the low prices during the past five or six 
years." 
  According to the diplomat, while the agreement is not in 
effect, there is the policy of the Alliance of Cocoa-Producing 
Countries, which functions independently from the international 
agreement and it is working to seek a balance within the market. 
The Alliance, which has its seat in Lagos, met some two months 
ago in Quito, where the producers agreed to a new production 
policy with the implementation of ceilings. 
  The producing countries desire the participation of the 
consumers in the agreement because the success of the new policy 
will depend on the consumers' commitment to encourage an 
increase in the consumption of cocoa within their own countries. 
  The diplomats admit that the main concern is the European 
union's pressure to replace cocoa butter with similar products, 
such as margarine, which would lead to a 200,000 ton annual 
reduction in the consumption of cocoa. 
  Moreira Lima said that "the importing countries must make an 
effort to reduce the obstacles that block an expansion of cocoa 
consumption." 
  The agreement will be implemented after it has been ratified 
by five exporting countries that will be responsible for 80 
percent of the total world exports. The endorsement by consumer 
countries that must commit themselves to a minimum of 60 percent 
of the total imports is another condition for the agreement to 
go into effect.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil through 10 February: 
  Congress on 3 February approved provisional measure No. 49 
establishing ceiling salaries for federal public servants, 
including those in state-owned companies. Executive branch 
employees will be allowed to earn up to 90 percent of a state 
minister's salary. The other branches' employees can not earn 
more than members of Congress, state ministers, and Federal 
Supreme Court members. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 4 Feb 94 Section 1 p 5) 
  Tax revenues totaled $4.8 billion in January, $1.4 billion 
more than the same month in 1993, and $300 million more than in 
December. Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho said this 
is the result of the fight against tax evasion, the increase in 
Social Security contributions, and the collection of the 
provisional tax on financial operations. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 4 Feb 94 Section 1 p 10) 
  Fuel prices were readjusted 16.5 percent on 8 February, the 
third price readjustment this year authorized by the 
Transportation Ministry. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia in 
Portuguese 0900 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics, the January inflation rate in Rio de Janeiro and Sao 
Paulo was 41.14 percent for consumers who earn up to 40 minimum 
salaries and 40.6 percent for those who earn up to eight minimum 
salaries. The inflation rate for the lower income group 
increased 4.08 percent compared with last December. In Rio 
prices increased 42.81 percent for the higher income group and 
in Sao Paulo by 40.54 percent. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 5 Feb 94 Section 2 p 3)

<F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "Who Won and Who </F>
Lost"] 
  [Text] Who won and who lost yesterday when party leaders 
met with the finance minister to discuss the final details of 
the bill that creates the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]? 
Undoubtedly the taxpayers did not win, and possibly the PPR 
[Progressive Renewal Party] lost as well despite Sandra 
Cavalcanti's announcement that she was not going to obstruct the 
amendment any more because the changes she had asked for had 
been accepted. Politically speaking, Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso may also be considered a loser because part of 
the agreement with the PPR was not fulfilled, either through 
technicalities related to congressional regulations or 
misunderstandings by Senator Espiridao Amin. Be that as it may, 
unless the effort to increase revenues surpasses that of Dona 
Maria I, The Demented, who levied taxes that led to the 
execution of Tiradentes [reference to Queen Mary I of Portugal 
who ordered a large portion of Brazilian gold be transferred to 
Portugal, prompting the bid for independence that led to the 
execution of one of its leaders Joaquim Jose da Silva Xavier 
Tiradentes in 1792], we are bound to conclude that it will be 
difficult to balance the budget if salaries of public servants 
and military men are not frozen at 93 levels (in real-terms, of 
course) -- the Law on Budget Guidelines [LDO] lifts the 
requirement to withhold 20 percent of education-related salaries 
-- and at the same time approves housing expenditures three 
times above 1992 levels. Balancing the budget under these 
conditions will be made especially difficult since the executive 
branch agreed to remove from the amendment the article which 
empowered the administration to cut the budget whenever revenues 
fell short of expenditures. 
  The administration managed to prove it can control Congress, 
although the finance minister was forced to make a few 
concessions in the LDO. The congressional advisers of the 
military ministries (who acted openly in favor of salary hikes 
for public servants in 1994 and 1995) made their objective very 
clear -- and they won. Everything has been approved and it is 
now up to the banks to pay up and balance the budget, and the 
Federal Revenue will carry on. The votes cast last night have 
led to a partial success in the effort to correct, during the 
next two years, some of the imbalances that the 1988 
Constitution inflicted on the distribution of revenues and 
services between the Federal Government, the states, and the 
municipalities, and to reduce (or eliminate) the allocation of 
certain percentages of the revenue to specific expenditures 
which slowed down the implementation of any government policy. 
It remains to be seen whether, after enduring a lot of pain 
from the Budget Investigating Committee, Congress has not 
managed -- in a roundabout way without actually setting down 
anything in writing -- to change the budget from discretionary 
to compulsory by removing from the executive branch the 
possibility of cutting expenditures if there are not enough 
revenues. Let us not be deluded by the praise that will be 
lavished on Congress for its patriotism and on the minister for 
his unselfishness. The FSE amendment will come up for the 
second vote on 23 February. A formal vote will also take place 
on the same day for the promulgation. The finance minister also 
hopes to see the final text of the amendment published in the 24 
February issue of the official gazette. There is a little 
problem that must be solved first before the executive branch 
can implement its economic recovery plan without first getting 
approval for the budget: Some parties want the Federal Supreme 
Court [STF] to decide if it is constitutional to promulgate one 
amendment after another. These parties believe the process of 
constitutional revision requires that all, we repeat all, 
approved amendments should be promulgated at the same time so as 
to have a coherent Constitution to which the people can refer at 
any time. Should the STF rule in favor of these parties, where 
will that leave the finance minister's plan? 
  Even though the minister obtained a victory at the plenary 
meeting, the bill that was approved was different from the 
original one -- especially as far as compulsory transfer of 
funds is concerned. The minister and his advisers did not 
manage to fully reverse this situation, which Minister Cardoso 
himself severely criticized in his 7 February speech. 
Approximately 80 percent of federal revenues are committed to 
compulsory transfers or fixed obligations leaving the executive 
branch only 20 percent to carry out its programs. In this 
aspect, which was essential for the success of the initial plan, 
the minister was defeated. We could also say that the efforts 
of General Romildo Canhim, the federal administration secretary, 
to institute some discipline in the pay scales of civilian and 
military public servants were also seriously jeopardized by the 
fact that it is quite possible there will be real salary hikes 
in 1994 and 1995 (which was forbidden in the original bill). 
The victory of the executive branch, although showing some rays 
of hope, should not lead us to believe that the war against 
inflation has been won. Several battles lie ahead, the worst 
being defining whether it is constitutional to promulgate the 
amendment that establishes the FSE before the constitutional 
revision is concluded. The road ahead is fraught with surprises.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Admiral Arnaldo Leite Pereira, the chief 
of the Armed Forces Staff, yesterday confirmed that the military 
opposed Article 74 of the amendment that creates the Social 
Emergency Fund, and that they had pressured to have it rejected. 
Leite said that, if approved, the article would have caused 
"great damage to the military," whose salaries would have been 
frozen, without any increases up until 1995. In light of the 
pressure, the government and the parties yesterday excluded the 
measure from the amendment. 
  Article 74 set forth that expenses for payment of public 
servants' salaries in 1994 and 1995, on a monthly basis, may not 
surpass the expenses incurred last year, plus monetary 
correction. The article added that if monthly personnel expenses 
surpass the level of spending of the same month in 1993, salary 
revisions, adjustments, or improvements -- that increase total 
expenses within each branch of government -- will be vetoed 
until the spending level is recovered. 
  Leite said he sent a fax to 40 or 50 lawmakers asking that 
the article be rejected. The article was drawn up by PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Rio Grande do 
Sul Luiz Roberto Ponte. Leite explained that before sending the 
fax messages he consulted with President Itamar Franco. The 
chief of staff claimed that the article dealt with a matter that 
may not be included in temporary constitutional provisions. He 
said that the military pressure was "legitimate and democratic." 
  Article 74 was approved by the Chamber subcommittee that 
studied the fiscal adjustment, and was included in the amendment 
that creates the Fund by PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul 
Nelson Jobim, the coordinator of the constitutional revision. 
Ponte estimated that this year the government has to cut 
approximately $1 billion in salary expenses. The budget provided 
for $24 billion in salary expenses. After the cut, salary 
expenses would have stood at $23 billion. 
  The government also agreed to exclude Article 75 of the 
amendment, which authorized the executive branch to unilaterally 
reduce the budget if revenues did not prove to be enough to 
cover expenses. This measure was considered as a safeguard of 
the stabilization program, because in practice it compelled the 
government to spend only what it could collect. "This article 
reduced the power of Congress," PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] 
Deputy for Sao Paulo Delfim Netto said. "The budget can be 
changed only through a law, and this is the essence of 
democracy," he added.

  [Text] Brasilia -- In addition to jeopardizing the 
government's economic plan, the Federal Supreme Court (STF) 
trend to banning the immediate promulgation of the measures 
approved by the revisionist Congress has caused another crisis 
between the branches of government. The PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Pedro 
Simon, the government leader in the Senate, has reacted with 
concern, especially because the STF trend was announced the same 
day Congress approved, on the first vote, the economic plan 
measures. 
  "They did not even wait for the opposition to question the 
measure. It is as if the judicial branch was inviting the 
opposition to challenge the plan," Simon said. 
  According to Simon, the government had no alternative 
proposal until 9 February in case the STF rejected the economic 
plan's promulgation, which is scheduled for the first week of 
March. The immediate promulgation method (or "sausage," as it 
was christened in Congress) has always caused controversy, but 
the PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, Nelson Jobim, the 
constitutional revision coordinator, claims that this is an 
internal affair of Congress and does not fall under court 
jurisdiction. 
  After the first vote on the government measures, the PFL 
[Liberal Front Party] deputy for Pernambuco, Inocencio de 
Oliveira, the Chamber of Deputies president, said the Social 
Emergency Fund will be an excellent test for the "sausage 
method." According to Oliveira, both the government and Congress 
want the plan's immediate promulgation. 
  Says Oliveira: "An STF decision against immediate 
promulgation would be a challenge to the two other branches and 
also to the public, which demands urgent measures against 
inflation." 
  The PFL deputy for Minas Gerais, Gustavo Krause, the 
constitutional revision deputy coordinator, said the Social 
Emergency Fund's immediate promulgation is essential for 
continuing the revision. 
  Says Krause: "The first case will set a precedent. If the 
courts do not ban the fund's immediate promulgation this 
principle will apply to all the other changes approved by 
Congress." 
  Jobim said on 9 February that he was surprised at the 
comments by STF members, who spoke before taking any action 
against immediate promulgation. 
  "It is surprising that judges should speak about actions 
that 
have not yet been undertaken. It is not the standard procedure," 
he said. 
  Jobim claimed that the method already has been provided for 
in the regulations for the revision, adding that he does not 
intend to talk with STF members, minimizing the controversy. He 
believes there is no reason for criticizing the amendments' 
immediate promulgation. According to Jobim, considering that the 
revision modifies only some articles of the Constitution, it is 
not necessary to wait until the end of the process to put the 
modifications into practice. 
  The PMDB senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Jose Fogaca, said 
that eventual STF opposition to the promulgation should awaken 
no concern, especially on the part of the government. He claimed 
that implementation of the URV [real value unit] by the economic 
team is very important for the government and does not depend on 
the Social Emergency Fund's implementation.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Verissimo] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco today sanctioned a law 
creating the Brazilian Space Agency which will plan, coordinate, 
and conduct Brazilian space activities through the national 
policy for the development of space activities. The agency 
reports directly to the presidency of the Republic. The 
ceremony took place at President Itamar Franco's office and was 
attended by the science and technology minister, the Air Force 
minister, the industry and trade minister, the Armed Forces 
chief of staff, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Franco said the creation of the Brazilian Space Agency will 
help to develop international cooperation and intensify private 
sector participation in the field. He said: 
  [Begin recording] It is important to emphasize that from the 
domestic viewpoint, the centralization of our space activities 
will allow the private sector to participate more intensively. 
It will ensure the participation of universities and other 
educational institutions, promote research, and help develop 
interest. 
  The establishment of this agency has international 
repercussions and will allow Brazil to participate in the 
exchange of services which are necessary for the economic and 
technological development of the country. For this reason, the 
creation of this agency is not merely an administrative act 
because it will influence Brazilian relations with the 
international community. [end recording] 
  The creation of the Brazilian Space Agency makes it possible 
to install the first national launching facility in the country. 
Currently, the large Brazilian satellites are launched from the 
U.S. aerospace base.

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- On the first anniversary of 
the launching of the Data Collection Satellite-1 (SCD-1), 
Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas and Marcio 
Nogueira Barbosa, the National Institute of Space Research 
(INPE) director, yesterday announced in Sao Jose dos Campos the 
expansion of Brazilian satellite services to Colombian, 
Ecuadoran, Peruvian, and Bolivian scientific organizations that 
have asked the INPE to install data collection station in their 
respective territories. 
  Minister Israel Vargas said the Brazilian Space Agency, 
which 
is civilian run, will by-pass the developed countries' boycott 
against Brazil on the transfer of sensitive technology. He 
commented: "Our program is for strictly peaceful purposes." 
  The minister believes the new service will enable Brazil to 
enter the low altitude communications satellite market. He 
said: "One of the agency's main tasks is a review of the entire 
Brazilian space program." 
  The Science and Technology Ministry has important space 
cooperation agreements with China and is looking into the 
possibility of a partnership with Argentina.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] The Aeronautics Ministry has finalized a deal with 
the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer) on the development 
of a military trainer adapted for attack missions. Embraer's 
commercial manager Paulo Cury said the prototype is based on the 
standard Tucano EMB-312 plane. The current Super-Tucano 
configuration [as published] was initially developed to meet the 
specifications of the U.S. competitor JPATS (English acronym for 
Primary Aircraft Training System). 
  Cury said Embraer has already completed the blueprint of the 
plane, which was ordered by the Aeronautics Ministry, and is now 
preparing the technical and commercial specification prior to 
the construction of 50 to 70 planes. The program will last 5 
years and the planes will be supplied to the Brazilian Air Force 
(FAB). Cury said the new Super-Tucanos will replace the Xavante 
plane. 
  The new configuration of the Super-Tucano, which is built 
for 
primary training purposes, will incorporate advanced training 
features and a weapons system based on machine guns, an air to 
ground system, and rockets. Cury stated that the Aeronautics 
Ministry wants to use the new plane for border control and 
interdiction within the Amazon Control System (Sivam). The 
Super- Tucano is a stretch version of the basic Tucano and has a 
more powerful engine -- 750 horsepower. The Aeronautics 
Ministry has already created a work group to draft the technical 
and commercial aspects of the new plane, which has been 
designated the ALX. Cury added: "By the end of March we will 
have the bid document ready." He could not give an estimate of 
the investment required for the ALX program. He indicated that 
an export version of the Super-Tucano will cost $3.8 million. 
  Negotiations with the Aeronautics Ministry for the 
development of a plane with new specifications began in 1989 
with the engineering aspect. The formulization of the agreement 
with the ministry came during the second half of 1993. The 
program is currently defining the basic operational demands, 
work schedule, and the drafting of an estimate of the resources 
to be disbursed.

  [Text] Caracas, 13 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- There was favorable 
reaction today to the release -- authorized by President Rafael 
Caldera -- of 23 people involved in the 1992 Venezuelan military 
coup attempts, because "national coexistence is strengthened." 
This was the common opinion of social leaders in praising the 
gesture, Caldera's first, which released 12 civilians and 11 
military personnel from the San Carlos military detention 
facility on Saturday. 
  Nevertheless, main coup leaders Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of 
the 4 February coup attempt, and Hernan Odreman Gruber, leader 
of the 27 November uprising, publicly reiterated their refusal 
to be discharged from the Army in exchange for their freedom. 
The 11 freed officers placed themselves at the disposition of 
military tribunals in addition to accepting their military 
discharge as a condition to having their cases dismissed, in 
accordance with requests by Caldera and the high military 
command. 
  Episcopal Conference President Monsignor Ovidio Perez stated 
that the presidential decision is aimed at strengthening the 
country's coexistence and to having greater interaction with 
society to solve the country's problems. Carlos Canache Mata, a 
leader of the former ruling Democratic Action (AD) Party, said 
President Caldera's pacification policies are correct as they 
allow the Armed Forces to heal its wounds. Orlando Contreras, 
acting secretary for the Social Christian Party, said his 
organization shares the reasoning that led President Caldera to 
make this decision, the third one applied to members of the 
military since 1992. 
  Of the 247 military personnel and civilians who took part in 
the uprisings "against the corrupt Carlos Andres Perez 
government," as Chavez Frias says, 124 persons remain in jail, 
most in military installations. Due to the failed 27 November 
coup, about 48 mid-rank officers are in exile in Peru and four 
others are in Ecuador. About 116 people had their cases 
dismissed during the Perez term, which was suspended in June 
1993 due to alleged corruption. 
  Octavio Lepage, Congress president who acted as president 
for 
one month in 1993, pardoned one captain. The last administrator 
of the former ruling AD party, Ramon J. Velasquez, acquitted 
seven officers and "pardoned" Commander Luis Reyes due to health 
problems. Likewise, during the Velasquez administration, which 
ended its term on 2 February, four members of the military, one 
captain, one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one air technician 
returned from exile in Peru. Three had their cases dismissed. 
The military court, due to a counterorder by the arresting 
officer, freed seven of the 11 Air Force officers who took part 
in the 27 November attempt. They appealed the decision and 
reenlisted.

<F P=106> [Report by Adriana Cortes] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Foreign Trade Institute [ICE] Minister 
Alberto Poletto announced that, in accordance with President 
Rafael Caldera's inaugural speech in which he said Venezuela's 
agreements with other countries must be based on reciprocity, 
Venezuela will reappraise its treaty with Caricom [Caribbean 
Common Market] countries -- a pact that calls on Venezuela to 
offer unilateral preferences to Caribbean countries. 
  Regarding this point, the new ICE minister said the various 
ministers who deal with economic issues will study the 
preliminary text of the Group of Three [G-3] agreement to make 
suggestions and draw up a joint position in about a week, 
because, in the words of the ICE minister, "we are very 
interested in signing the G-3 agreement, but not hastily." 
  Poletto added that mechanisms are being sought to attain 
reciprocity in agreements with Caricom member-nations, but 
within the framework of negotiations with these countries. 
  "There is willingness among the Caricom members themselves, 
because they have concluded, just as we have, that reciprocity 
makes bilateral negotiations more efficient, which is the idea 
behind this point. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  The Caricom agreement was signed in 1992 and includes, among 
various points, the entry of Caribbean products and capital into 
Venezuela with increased facility and tariff preferences without 
Venezuela receiving other types of preferences in exchange. At 
the time of its signing, the treaty was part of a strategic, 
long-term foreign policy plan, and, in turn, the primary concern 
was not with commercial issues, although such issues will now be 
examined. 
  According to the ICE minister, studies are under way to 
amend 
the agreement in such a manner that certain Venezuelan products 
would be subject to smaller tariffs than those extant in Caricom 
countries, as well as having Caribbean nations offer possible 
investment incentives for Venezuelan capital, even though these 
countries are less developed than Venezuela. Meanwhile, 
agreements with Central American countries would be retained in 
their current form. These agreements, although not completely 
balanced, do offer a gradual liberalizing of tariffs. 
  In fact, Alberto Poletto is to travel tomorrow to 
Montevideo, 
Uruguay, to represent Venezuela at a meeting of ALADI [Latin 
American Integration Association] foreign ministers in light of 
the fact that the foreign minister cannot attend. At the 
meeting, efforts will be made to reach an agreement concerning 
Mexico's participation in NAFTA, because, according to Article 
44 of the ALADI Charter, any member who gives preferences to a 
third country must extend those same preferences to ALADI 
members. In other words, the 10 Latin American member-states 
should in theory receive the same preferences Mexico has 
extended to the United States and Canada -- a position defended 
by Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries. 
  According to Poletto, Venezuela will adopt a neutral 
position 
that could reconcile both positions, because, according to 
previous negotiations, Venezuela supports Mexico in the search 
for a formula that does not interfere with negotiations with 
third countries.

  [Text] Division General Jesus Rafael Caballero was 
discharged from the National Guard staff as part of the changes 
and transfers in top positions of the National Armed Forces 
ordered by President Rafael Caldera. 
  The unexpected removal of the military officer, who by the 
way still had two more years to serve, caused him to ask his 
superiors to let him retire. They apparently had no difficulty 
in granting his request. Gen. Caballero has, in fact, gone home. 
  Among the many posts occupied by Caballero were the general 
commander of the Caracas Military Police, chief of the National 
Guard Regional Command No. 5, and finally the National Guard 
chief of staff. Gen. Caballero is a graduate of the Armed Forces 
of Cooperation Officers Training School (EFOFAC) and a member of 
the 1966 graduating class called the Battle of the Yokes 
[Batalla de los Horcones]. He is considered a firm defender of 
the democratic system and one of the National Guardsmen who 
confronted the coupist intentions of those promoting the 4 
February and 27 November 1992 uprisings. 
  Names of other officers are being reviewed to occupy top 
positions in other forces, like the Army, Navy, and the Air 
Force, despite obstacles due to a lack of division generals and 
admirals. It was reported that President Caldera's order, made 
prior to yesterday's proposals of the top military command, is 
to completely reorganize the top cadres of the National Armed 
Forces before the promotion of the candidates to top posts 
within the armed institution. 
  The unofficial candidates for inspector general and chiefs 
of 
staff of the respective forces, which are in the hands of 
Defense Minister Div. Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, are the 
following: 
  In the National Guard, as is already known, its commander 
general is Egberto Fidel Artuza Delgado. Those who would serve 
with him, at least until next July, are Brig. Gen. Julio Cesar 
Pena Sanchez, (Inspector General), and Brig. Gen. Euro Luis 
Rincon Viloria, who will surely be out by July. 
  In the Navy, Commander Gen. Vice Adm. Carlos Ramos Flores 
still has two more years of service to go and Rear Adm. Joel A. 
Rodriguez was given the post of inspector general. The post of 
chief of staff is reserved for the commander himself because 
there is apparently "no trustworthy candidate" for that post. 
  The commander general of the Air Force is Otto Garcia 
Rivara. 
Tulio Prado Fernandez, who was formerly the Air Defense chief, 
is the new inspector general of the Venzuelan Air Force, and 
Brig. Gen. Jose Agustin Borges Blanco is the chief of staff. The 
latter is a strong candidate to be discharged in July. 
  In the Army, in addition to Commander Gen. Moises Orozco 
Graterol, the proposal is to appoint Div. Gen. Alberto Emerich 
Esqueda Torres from the Security and Defense Department to the 
post of inspector general and Div. Gen. Nestor Lara Estrano, who 
is currently the director general of the Defense Ministry, to be 
in charge of the chief of staff temporarily. 
  According to the new authorities in Fort Tiuna, the abrupt 
departure of the old top command members has really created 
problems, certain traumas, which can be overcome.

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Feb (EFE) -- Venezuelan Omar Baralt, 
head of the Presidential Commission on Border Affairs currently 
negotiating with Colombia, today reported that more than 80,000 
Colombian guerrillas are operating along the vast Colombian 
border region. 
  The official pointed out that the worst infiltration in 
Venezuela lies in and around the northwestern town of Sierra de 
Perija, where authorities have neglected some 400 km in which 37 
fronts of the Colombian guerrillas operate. Baralt said that 
while only 2 million Venezuelans live in this area, it is 
inhabited by some 7 million Colombians. According to Baralt, 
"between fighters and members of the logistical apparatus, the 
guerrillas have 80,000 men in the area." 
  Baralt stressed that the Venezuelan Government has to 
persuade the Colombian Government to open a dialogue with the 
guerrillas because the Colombian Army cannot be deployed across 
the border. Baralt added that Venezuela cannot get directly 
involved in this problem, but that it must seek a diplomatic 
solution because belligerent actions could mean the destruction 
of the country's main agricultural centers. 
  The Venezuelan official said that migrant workers represent 
another border problem, because Colombians provide most of the 
manual labor in the agricultural and cattle zones. He believes 
this problem must be resolved by issuing identification cards to 
illegal immigrants to integrate them into the country's 
production process. 
  Baralt pointed out that one of the positive aspects of the 
two countries' bilateral relations is the 70 percent decrease in 
smuggling activities because of the creation of a free trade 
zone between Colombia and Venezuela. He added, however, that 
Colombia's Maicao zone has become the foremost international 
trade center in the Caribbean Basin, with imports amounting to 
$1.5 billion in 1993. He recommended the signing of a bilateral 
agreement to regulate trade in this zone.

every Yucpa who has been assassinated and the granting of 6,000 
hectares in the Perija mountain range for their status as first 
inhabitants in the zone. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified Indian] We have always 
had problems, because some of our fellow Indians have no 
identification papers; they are always being harassed for this. 
They know we are pure, indigenous, native Indians, yet we have 
always been mistreated. 
  [Second unidentified Indian] We must protest, because they 
will annihilate us if we do nothing. We are human beings and 
Venezuelans like all of you -- in fact, we are more Venezuelan 
than you. I always said you are like retread Venezuelans, no? 
[Indian leader chuckles, followed by laughter heard in 
background] Therefore, we have always been mistreated by the 
cattlemen and landowners, who have taken away all our land and 
used it to raise cattle -- and we have no land on which to raise 
our crops. 
  [Third unidentified Indian] For the first time in history, 
and I state this as a Yucpa Indian, we have been received with 
so much amity and with a positive attitude. Therefore, I state 
that I believe in the president of the Republic and all his 
cabinet because I believe.... [pauses] no, I know that he has 
appointed the most appropriate persons to hold those posts. 
Therefore, positive things will occur for us from now on. [end 
recording] 
  Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar de Castro later met with 
the president of the Republic and explained her experience in 
this case. The Zulia State leader said she advocates giving land 
to the Yucpa Indians and providing them with technical 
assistance for their crops. In her opinion, the problem can be 
solved this way. 
  [Begin de Castro recording] I understand this solution can 
be 
reached more or less quickly, and there is no reason why further 
aggressions should occur in the zone. I believe we can do this 
without major problems so we can give the Indians what they 
rightfully demand and what they have been deprived of for many 
years. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Mariangela Velasquez] </F>
  [Excerpt] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage yesterday met 
with Venezuelan Investment Fund [FIV] Minister Abdon Vivas Teran 
to discuss the possibility of establishing bilateral investment 
agreements in tourism and to obtain information about the 
guidelines of the Venezuelan program on economic opening for 
foreign capital. 
  Lage said this opening is one of the paths that the Cuban 
Government must try in an effort to pay off its debts. The 
official said Cuba could pay what it owes Venezuela, 
approximately $47 million, through investments by Venezuelan 
businessmen. 
  Cuba's debt problem can be traced back to the agreement 
signed between Venezuela and Russia in 1986. Under that 
agreement, Russia committed itself to supplying oil to Germany 
(a client of Venezuela), and, in exchange, Venezuela supplied 
oil to Cuba. In 1991, the Caribbean island found itself in the 
position of having to pay for Venezuelan oil deliveries in cash 
in line with demands made by the Venezuelan Government. Cuba, 
however, was unable to meet the requirements. 
  With a view to establishing trade relations that would allow 
the island to pay off its debt, the Cuban vice president showed 
special interest in activities related to tourism, because he 
believes this sector could ultimately attract Venezuelan 
investments. Lage also believes that Venezuela has more tourist 
experience than Cuba. Cuba wants to learn from other Latin 
American countries, avoid environmental problems, and create a 
modern infrastructure. 
  The meeting held at FIV headquarters was attended by Cuban 
Ambassador Norberto Hernandez; Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, 
Venezuela's diplomatic representative to Cuba; and Carlos 
Sequera Yepez, former president of the Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
  Although it is gratifying to know that the representative of 
a nearby country considers Venezuela's experience to be a 
reference point for establishing its own framework for 
development, the FIV's record in attracting foreign investments 
has been scant in recent years. We have to give time to the new 
FIV administration headed by Abdon Vivas Teran to determine 
whether we will see the fruits of the privatization of hotels 
and the channeling of multilateral financial support aimed at 
turning tourism and the services industry into a source of 
economic development. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish on 23 
January carries, on pages D6 and D7, a 2,000-word article by 
Pamela Aravena Bolivar on the "controversy" created by the 
signing of an agreement between the Chilean Association of 
Municipalities, ACHM, and the U.S. Peace Corps. 
  The Peace Corps, which returned to Chile in July 1991, 
signed 
agreements with about 30 national organizations without creating 
any controversies until last week, when ACHM Chairman Jaime 
Ravinet signed an agreement with the corps. Political party 
leaders reacted by saying they do not accept new U.S. 
intervention in municipal affairs. 
  Jaime Insunza of the Chilean Communist Party, Councilman 
Herman Chadwick of the Independent Democratic Union, and Senator 
Ricardo Nunez of the Socialist Party criticized the agreement. 
Insunza and Chadwick agree that the Peace Corps presence in 
Chile was a form of "intervention." 
  Chadwick said: "The U.S. policy toward Latin America in the 
1960's was based on the Alliance for Progress. Its relation with 
us was of protectionism. This allowed the U.S. Government to 
intervene directly in the Latin American countries that were 
poorer and less developed socially and politically." 
  Jaime Insunza said: "I believe the main problem is that the 
corps represented a flagrant intervention in the Chilean social 
process that went against the interests of the national 
majorities." 
  Sen. Ricardo Nunez prefers to be more cautious. He said the 
main problem with the corps is that it is an obsolete 
organization. He believes there should be an exchange between 
Chilean municipal governments and municipal governments in other 
countries. He added: "My criticism is not aimed at the 
cooperation itself but at the fact that instruments that are no 
longer part of the international scene should not be used. The 
Peace Corps, no matter how reorganized, is something from the 
past that already has been overcome." 
  Santiago Mayor Jaime Ravinet reacted angrily because he 
believes an agreement of this type should not revive the 
controversy of the 1960's. He said those who will come will not 
be youngsters with romantic ideas about how to help an 
underdeveloped country. He added: "The municipalities will get 
people with high academic training and vast labor experience."

<F P=106> [Interview with Victor Manuel Rebolledo, designated </F>
administration secretary general of government, by Maria Eugenia 
Oyarzun at his residence in Santiago; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Congressional 
sources have said that the General Secretariat of Government 
will have a lower profile during the next administration. What 
do you know about this? 
  [Rebolledo] I have been unable to establish the basis or the 
source of these reports. The president has said the secretary 
general of government will continue to act as the government 
spokesman. I have already performed several assignments for the 
administration that will be installed in March. Moreover, this 
is one of the three posts that deal with the political sector 
and as such it has an indisputably political role. 
  [Oyarzun] How do you see your post within the government's 
three political ministries? 
  [Rebolledo] To efficiently fulfill the duties the law 
assigns 
to the General Secretariat of Government through the 
directorates under its jurisdiction, and to look after social 
organizations and the government's political communications. In 
addition, there is a political role which is more intangible and 
which deals with issues on the agenda. 
  [Oyarzun] Do you think the Frei administration will have a 
more difficult task than [Chilean President Patricio] Aylwin's? 
  [Rebolledo] I believe the Frei administration will face 
different problems. Many issues that were a priority in 
President Aylwin's administration -- such as development and the 
progress of the democratic transition -- are not at the top of 
the agenda as they were in 1990. Better civic-military ties, 
the certainty of continued economic stability that results in 
interesting growth rates, the expansion of Chilean markets, and 
healthy macroeconomic guidelines will help. Right now we have a 
more complex economic situation than President Aylwin's 
administration had to face: International recession has an 
impact on our economy. Although I am not frightened by it, some 
believe that as democracy consolidates itself, social conflicts 
-- which in Chile have been extremely scarce -- will increase. 
  [Oyarzun] What is your response to criticism that 
President-elect Frei has been more "politically cautious" in 
appointing his cabinet than Aylwin? 
  [Rebolledo] I disagree. President-elect Frei appointed his 
cabinet fully exercising his prerogatives. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] You have admitted that you were not surprised by 
your appointment as minister in charge of the political sector. 
Why? 
  [Rebolledo] We made a great effort in the current 
legislature 
to show our representative force nationwide but this was not the 
case in the last legislature where we only had seven deputies. 
One of our goals was for one of our members to head a political 
affairs ministry. 
  [Oyarzun] How long do you think you will be in the cabinet? 
  [Rebolledo] One tends to think that during a six-year term, 
an administration such as the one headed by President Frei will 
work with a couple of teams, at least. But beyond what is 
established by common sense, it is very difficult to predict. 
  [Oyarzun] Are you planning to run for deputy or senator in 
four years or so? 
  [Rebolledo] I am very involved in politics and thus cannot 
reject this possibility, but I am not working toward this goal. 
I am fully concentrated on being a loyal and efficient cabinet 
member of the Frei administration. 
  [Oyarzun] Will this administration be beyond political 
parties or will political parties have great participation? 
  [Rebolledo] I believe both. President Aylwin's 
administration was beyond political parties but it also allowed 
the participation of those political parties that had incipient 
cadres as a result of the military government that we were 
leaving behind. For the past four years, political parties have 
experienced three national elections: the 1989 presidential and 
legislative elections, the 1992 municipal elections, and the 
1993 presidential election held last December. Political 
parties are stronger, they are more clearly aware of their true 
forces and know which of the almost 30 political parties both in 
the government and the opposition are mere acronyms. President 
Frei will have an administration that is beyond political 
parties. 
  [Oyarzun] The newly appointed PS [Socialist Party] President 
Camilo Escalona, has stated he will ask the government to 
restore diplomatic ties with Cuba. Do you agree? 
  [Rebolledo] Yes, I have always said that Chile should have 
diplomatic ties with all countries, particularly with Latin 
American countries. Chile and Paraguay are the only Latin 
American countries that do not have diplomatic ties with Cuba; 
restoring these ties would be advantageous for Chile and for 
Chilean businessmen. 
  [Oyarzun] Will Fidel Castro be invited to the inauguration? 
  [Rebolledo] No, because Chile does not maintain diplomatic 
ties with Cuba. That is my personal opinion, but the foreign 
policy is encompassed in the platform of the Coalition of 
Parties for Democracy and is implemented by the president and 
his foreign minister. [passage omitted] 
  [Oyarzun] All administrations -- including the current one 
-- pressure the media, either through summons, appeals, 
suggestions, etc. How will you handle the situation? 
  [Rebolledo] I would never pressure any member of the media 
nor would I summon them out of principle or for simple practical 
reasons. I believe it is improper and harmful to pressure the 
media. However, I will react if faced with any erroneous 
reportage, but this is something else. 
  [Oyarzun] Why do people say that you are against 
journalists? 
  [Rebolledo] I am very pleased with my ties with the press. I 
have studied each situation individually and conclude that I 
know many important journalists and many who are just starting. 
This has been gratifying because we are engaged in an activity 
that is good for the country with people from different levels. 
I have a positive assessment of the responsible way in which 
the press has worked during these four years of the transition 
process. I believe it has greatly contributed to the excellent 
transition period we have experienced. Even though this 
administration does not control any member of the media, it is 
leaving office with great prestige. This is because the press 
has acted objectively and responsibly. 
  [Oyarzun] During your years in exile, did you ever think of 
overthrowing the military government through armed struggle? 
  [Rebolledo] Never. I have never believed in the armed 
struggle and have always rejected it. 
  [Oyarzun] What credit would you give to the 17-year military 
government? 
  [Rebolledo] Although at a very heavy cost -- with which I 
disagree -- I believe they helped to modernize the country.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile through 10 February: 
  The Chilean trade balance registered a $995 million deficit 
in 1993. Exports totaled $9.215 billion, 7.7 percent less than 
in the previous year, and imports $10.209 billion, an increase 
of 10.5 percent compared with 1992. A decline of 16.3 percent in 
the international copper price was the main reason for the drop. 
The balance of payment registered a $578 million surplus in 1993 
compared with 1992's $2.4984 billion. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in 
Spanish 25 Jan 95 pp A1-A12) 
  The Central Bank reported that net international reserves 
increased more than $500 million in the first half of January. 
The total reserves now are $10.259 billion. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA 
in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p 8) 
  On 2 February, the National Statistics Institute, INE, 
reported that industrial production increased 1.7 percent in 
December compared with the same month in 1992, and that the 
cumulative increase was 3.1 percent in 1993, which is lower than 
the 4.7 percent reported by the Industrial Development 
Association. The sectors that registered the highest increases 
were: nonelectrical machines, 29.8 percent; nonmetal mineral 
products, 16.3 percent; chemicals, 14.1 percent; metal products 
excluding machinery and equipment, 12.5 percent; iron and steel 
industry, 7.3 percent; glass manufacturing products, 6.8 
percent; and beverages, 6.6 percent. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in 
Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 6) 
  The Central Bank reported that Chilean foreign investments 
totalled $409.7 million in 1993. The major investments were made 
in Panama with $146.3 million; Argentina, $50.6 million; Peru, 
$22.5 million; Great Britain, $11.9 million; and Liberia, $11.1 
million. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 2 Feb 94 p 8) 
  The INE reported that the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent 
between October and December 1993, an increase of 0.1 compared 
with the previous quarter and the same period in 1992. The labor 
force totalled 5,219,300 people nationwide in the last quarter 
of 1993, an increase of 4.6 percent compared with the same 
period in 1992. The number of employed people was 4,985,730, 
which is 212,430 more new jobs. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 
3 Feb 94 p 6) 
  On 2 January, the Foreign Investment Committee chairman, the 
Chilean economy minister, and the Japanese firm Daiwa 
Securities, Co. signed a cooperation agreement designed to 
promote Japanese investments in Chile. One clause establishes 
that Daiwa will finance one seminar in Japan every year to 
encourage investments. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 3 Feb 94 
p 13) 
  According to a Central Bank report, Chile's foreign debt on 
31 December 1993 was $19.179 billion, an increase of $937 
million compared to December 1992. According to the report, 
this increase was caused mainly by the private sector, whose 
debt increased $1.526 billion. The public sector's debt dropped 
$589 million. (Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen 
Internacional in Spanish 1700 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  On 9 February, the Scandinavian Airlines System transferred 
its Chilean National Airline, LAN-Chile, shares to a group of 
Chilean businessmen, thus leaving the control of LAN-Chile in 
Chilean hands. SAS held 42.5 percent of LAN-Chile shares, which 
were transferred to Costa Verde and Transnet corporations, which 
represent the interests of the Cueto family and Chilean 
businessman Boris Hirmas who lives in Mexico, respectively. 
Nils Bergston and Luis Davids, SAS representatives on the board 
of directors, have resigned as a result of this deal and a new 
board of directors has been named: Jose Luis Moure is the new 
chairman of the board, Alfredo Etcheverry is vice chairman, and 
Andres Bianchi Larre, Eric Campana, Dario Calderon, Juan Jose 
Cueto, Luis Felipe Cueto, Boris Hirmas, and Jaime Sommerville 
are the other members. The deal reportedly cost $19 million and 
SAS lost $12 million. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in 
Spanish 2200 GMT 9 Feb 94)

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Government May Report About Paraguay, </F>
But..."] 
  [Text] The periodic U.S. State Department human rights 
reports on Paraguay are part of an analysis of the situation in 
all of Latin America. Only First World countries are exempt 
from this report because the United States surely lacks moral 
authority and reasons to pass judgment on them. 
  Undoubtedly, no one feels comfortable with such reports; 
they 
constitute U.S. Government interference in the domestic affairs 
of sovereign countries. Moreover, their use is not always 
restricted to moral sanctions. Sometimes they become the basis 
for economic restrictions and other kinds of pressures that 
indirectly undermine universal principles of noninterference. 
In sum, they are detestable documents. 
  Unfortunately, however, these reports have been shown to be 
effective against the evils they attack. In Paraguay's case, it 
must be noted that, more than any other, these reports helped 
weaken the image of Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship. It is 
also worthwhile to mention that when the U.S. State Department 
reports exposed to the world the infamous human rights situation 
under the repression we were subjected to, the tyrant was forced 
to yield while defense mechanisms against him were strengthened. 
At the time, we appreciated these reports, and in an indirect 
manner, we even helped draft them by supplying reliable 
information. Consequently, for ethical reasons it is impossible 
for us to reject the U.S. Government practice of issuing reports 
on Paraguay's domestic situation. 
  Moreover, it must be stressed that these reports were never 
biased regarding Paraguay's situation. They are limited to 
revealing the information obtained from reliable sources. The 
only objection to the latest report that was issued is that 
although the human rights violation cases mentioned are possibly 
all true and the comments on the justice system's faults are 
true, the overall human rights situation in Paraguay is far from 
being what it was more than five years ago. 
  To be coherent with the aforementioned reasons, we must 
accept the criticisms and charges made in these foreign reports. 
For our international image, however, it would be useful if 
these reports made comparisons showing a foreign reader how much 
progress Paraguay has achieved in this regard, and that our 
political regime is much closer to the ideals of civilization 
than during the dictatorship we were able to defeat. 
  In its next report, the U.S. State Department should be 
careful to continue noting the errors that have been made and 
the faults affecting our institutions because, although it may 
annoy us, it compels us to correct them. But it also would be 
encouraging for these reports to point out the progress that has 
been achieved since the enforcement of the libertarian process. 
This would give a real picture of the situation and reduce the 
risks of hurting any feelings.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should not be Judge and </F>
Jury"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government periodically issues a document 
on the human rights situation in the world's countries. In an 
overall way it should be an objective evaluation due to the 
status of who formulates opinions on a topic that has as many 
facets as the question of human rights. 
  Taking the segment that pertains to Paraguay as a basis, we 
can observe in its writing a certain tendency to magnify certain 
events, such as focusing only on the negative aspects without 
any mention of the progress that has been achieved. 
  Beginning with isolated incidents, many of them not even 
considered important by us, it is not convenient to formulate 
generalities because it is a near certainty that errors will be 
made that do not compare with the seriousness that official 
documents should have. 
  This is precisely what has happened with the document to 
which we are referring. From the detailed reading of the 
incidents mentioned as violations of human rights, it can be 
deduced that they occurred under fortuitous circumstances 
without the Paraguayan Government having had any intention of 
violating them in an overall manner. 
  By using the same method, not even the United States would 
be 
exempt from peccadilloes in a similar examination, because even 
in similar cases in the United States the police must act 
energetically to prevent violence by radical groups, for 
example. Or the Army invade sovereign countries. But no one 
cries that the United States has violated human rights. 
  The United States cannot go against the principle that no 
one 
can be judge and jury, as this report intends to do. At best, a 
supranational organization may have the authority to pass 
judgment on such a delicate issue. 
  A valid critical judgment of Paraguay is that which compares 
the human rights violations cases under the previous regime with 
how the human rights situation fares in today's democratic 
transition process. If this comparison is made, it will be 
obvious that today we are living under conditions quite 
different than those in the recent past. 
  Today, the norm is to uphold human rights; human rights 
violations are the exception. This fact can be ascertained by 
any national or international organization. 
  We hope, therefore, that reports of this nature in the 
future, whatever their source, will be based on real and 
objective national events.

<F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Schvartzman entitled "Computer </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] It is said that a former president of a small and 
poor country travelled to the United States last December. 
Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent -- after 
looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the 
computer -- asked him to wait, ordered a customs personnel to 
bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby office. The 
visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: "What is wrong?" The custom 
official explained: "Your name coincides with that of another 
person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is your age -- 
the custom official complicated matters even more so -- and he 
is registered as a drug trafficker." The foreign visitor 
indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: "That cannot be." 
He complained: "I was president of the Republic and fought drug 
trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. Let me 
phone the U.S. ambassador in my country." 
  The former president managed to get through: "Ambassador, I 
am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a 
drug trafficker with my name." He explained his problem 
sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: "Yes, they 
have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is 
a computer problem." The ambassador promises to do his best, 
saying: "We will resolve the problem." 
  It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90 
minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the 
former president was able to comply with the immigration red 
tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression 
that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning. 
  This anecdote is an example of the political language of 
"demonstrations," like military maneuvers, street 
demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose goals 
-- which exceed their disclosed purposes -- are uncovered, 
sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or 
speculation. 
  The case of the former president delayed by an immigration 
agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres 
Rodriguez -- who perfectly fits the antihero in the anecdote -- 
made to the U.S. Government about handing over the protectors of 
drug trafficking and dismantling their infrastructure. 
  If for the political process the transition meant building 
the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of 
the political institutions and elect -- based on these 
conditions -- the first civilian president, for the U.S. 
Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for 
drug traffickers. 
  The United States was especially concerned about this 
because 
the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed 
Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the Executive 
Branch. The proposal to "dignify" the Armed Forces by the 
rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S. 
aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from 
engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities 
in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state 
resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who 
protect traffickers. 
  The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if 
military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who 
will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges, 
of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone? 
More than four years of transition government have elapsed and 
the strategists received the expected answer: The process to 
dignify the Armed Forces failed -- we have the disastrous 
example of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General 
Bernal who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling 
of the Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly 
upset the United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the 
first stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of 
the members of the high command were and are trapped by links 
related to commitments and protection. 
  The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of 
stones that should have been cast was transferred to [President 
Juan Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under 
the vertical domain regarding military issues of a very 
ambitious general. The situation remains unchanged: The process 
to dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed 
Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous 
facade of a civilian government. 
  So, in view of the careful protection granted from high 
spheres to traffickers -- detected and monitored by U.S. 
intelligence -- it was decided to materialize a plan under which 
U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build 
schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San 
Pedro Department as "training for the shipment of construction 
material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War," as 
Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this 
project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and 
direct: One typical "demonstration" that the U.S. troops 
sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a "Persian 
Gulf-type" intervention in Paraguayan territory. 
  Everyone understood the message of the "demonstration" of 
the 
military social actions. The less discreet commented that 
"there are concealed purposes," without understanding the 
opportuneness of the maneuver. 
  "There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the 
country," commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus 
supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and 
allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the 
dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general. 
For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the 
arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the 
privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted 
the "demonstration." 
  Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of 
protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first 
impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So, 
on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to 
Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to 
the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint 
actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly 
established -- Congress having approved the project it should be 
noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights -- 
the operation zones must be restricted, the importation of 
weapons restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel 
to enter the country should be disclosed, and that it should be 
clearly established whom will be granted privileges and 
immunity. Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the 
old yankee anti-imperialist wave. 
  This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken 
aback by the offense, commented that "similar offers to other 
Latin American countries were never rejected." General Oviedo, 
as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3 
February, asked journalists: "Do you think we would reject 
something that benefits the Armed Forces?" Military strategists 
read between lines: "The interests of the protectors?" The 
almost dramatic answer was: "We have withdrawn the draft bill, 
but beware the consequences." Watch out. 
  That same evening a cable television channel showed a 
documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega 
was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another 
"demonstration"? 
  One can expect anything if this relationship between the 
United States and the military leadership continues to be simply 
horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the 
computer screens in the future?

<F P=106> [Article by Guido Rodriguez Alcala entitled: "Sovereignty of </F>
the Corrupt"] 
  [Text] To allow U.S. troops to enter the country, the 
government demands to know how many, what weapons they will 
bring, where they will be, how they will work, etc. This 
information is needed, according to the government, to defend 
national sovereignty. 
  Instead of saying the government, I should say the executive 
branch which sets the conditions although, according to the 
Constitution, Congress makes the decision. 
  But let us not be pedantic. The division of power here goes 
along with the confusion of power. What I mean is this: The 
government defends national sovereignty by taking a hard stand 
against the North Americans. 
  It seems fine to defend national sovereignty, but it should 
not be defended just once a year and only from the North 
Americans. It should be defended throughout the year, no matter 
who complains. 
  Not just U.S. soldiers should be asked how many weapons and 
of what kind they carry. Arms traffickers should get the same 
treatment. As "most favored nation," however, the smugglers of 
Ciudad de Este sell bazookas, submachine guns, and all kinds of 
stuff. The UZI submachine gun costs less than a deputy. 
  The same strictness should be enforced with the people who 
smuggle logs. These people carry Army "notes" when they cross 
the border at will, carrying the fruit of their work. The 
clandestine lumbermen like the clandestine hunters both steal 
and destroy nature. For these reasons they should be treated 
like U.S. soldiers. 
  Precise information should also be demanded from those who 
launder money. The Army can probably actively cooperate on this 
moralizing task because several exchange houses, banks, and 
finance companies are owned by the Armed Forces members. 
  In sum, the law should be the same for all: Not just when 
dealing with imperialism, which this time wants to give what 
Paraguayan nationalism does not have: $12 million. (with 92 
percent of the national budget allocated to pay salaries, the 
government does not have the money to build a latrine in San 
Pedro). 
  Inevitably, when charity is too generous even a saint 
becomes 
suspicious. This sudden government nationalism is bewildering. 
If there is one sin of which the government is not guiilty, it 
is that of being nationalist. It is neoliberal, therefore it is 
cosmopolitan. It is capitalist and the capital is stateless. 
Yet it is not a savage type of capitalism it is a parochial 
[given in Guarani] capitalism. 
  Under such circumstances, it should be seen if, through its 
intransigence, this government defends national sovereignty or 
the sovereignty of the corrupt 
  I am referring to all those who -- if the soliders come -- 
will find themselves having to explain why instead of growing 
mate they are growing marijuana. It is known that even the last 
square meter of marijuana has been photographed from the 
satellites. It is one thing is to know something in general 
terms and another to run into it headon. Any movement in the 
zone of San Pedro, even to collect yaguarete ka'a [a medicinal 
herb] will highlight the zonal and national problem: drugs. As 
the government cannot stop it, it prefers to play the hero.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Uncomprehensible Obstacles to American Troops"] </F>
  [Text] The entrance of American troops to Paraguay has 
unleashed an unnecessarily raucous controversy. A review of the 
opinions on the issue has allowed us to conclude that there is a 
constant argument being mentioned to avoid the presence of U.S. 
troops. As for the series of conditions imposed by the Foreign 
Ministry, they seem to be both confusing and contradictory. 
  The presence of U.S. troops is related to the "Unitas" 
operations carried out previously in our country jointly by 
Paraguayan and American troops. In this specific case, the 
nature of this operation will be different from the previous 
ones, which sought an exclusive military objective. This 
operation now seeks to improve secondary roads and build health 
centers in San Pedro. 
  The position the Paraguayan Government has recently adopted 
is incomprehensible. To mention sovereignty, understood as a 
rigid and exclusive doctrine, does not seem reasonable in times 
characterized by an increasing integration of countries. Times 
admit that there are problems that know no borders: the 
deterioration of the environment, extreme poverty, ignorance, 
and illnesses. 
  If the problems are common, it is easy to figure out that 
the 
struggle for a better world is a responsibility shared by all 
states and that this responsibility can no longer be considered 
the private affair of each state within its territory. In the 
Paraguayan case, we all know that external cooperation is vital 
if one hopes to successfully face the challenge of social and 
economic achievements. 
  San Pedro Department is precisely a kind of example of all 
the critical problems affecting the country, especially in the 
social area. Without any doubt this is the reason why growing 
marijuana is becoming the desperate option of the peasants in 
that region in their search for a better life. This is the ideal 
place to carry out a program for improving the population's 
standard of living; therefore, it should be welcomed instead of 
being rejected as is currently happening, although in a 
disguised manner. 
  Under these conditions it is possible that no advantage will 
be taken of this brilliant opportunity for cooperating with San 
Pedro Department, which is struggling in the midst of agonizing 
poverty. Therefore, this is the ideal place for implementing 
such a program, which should get the enthusiastic support of our 
government. And not as is happening now when it seems that 
efforts are being made to look for pretexts -- for reasons that 
do not seem very clear -- to delay and obstruct an action that 
from any point of view is beneficial to national interests.

  [Text] The cease-fire agreed upon by the Sandinist People's 
Army [EPS] and the anti-Sandinist rebels in northern Nicaragua 
is being kept, a military spokesman reported on Thursday. There 
have not been any clashes between the EPS and the 3-80 Northern 
Front led by recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias El 
Chacal, the military source added. 
  A peace commission traveled on Thursday to the Quilali area 
in an attempt to make contact with rebel leaders to present a 
government proposal for the pacification of the nation's 
conflict-ridden and tormented northern areas. The peace 
commission is made up of members of the Nicaraguan Catholic 
Church and of the International Commission of Support and 
Verification, CIAV-OAS. 
  On Wednesday, the Nicaraguan Government and the rebels each 
announced -- unilaterally -- a cease-fire aimed at finding a 
negotiated solution to the conflict.

  [Text] The precarious peace -- the truce -- in northern 
Nicaragua is being endangered by a huge military deployment that 
is keeping mediators from contacting rebel commander Chacal 
[Jose Angel Talavera], the leader of the 3-80 Northern Front. 
In light of this situation, the National Assembly unanimously 
and with the presence of all deputies -- those of the National 
Opposition Union, the Center Bloc, and the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front -- called for an end to the massacre and for 
peace in the countryside once and for all. 
  Let us listen to the statement: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] 1. The National 
Assembly, in view of the armed conflict in municipalities in the 
north, believes it is necessary to work for a peaceful solution 
to avoid the death of Nicaraguan people. 
  2. We urge the government to maintain the halt of military 
operations and to carry out all actions to facilitate and 
promote a direct dialogue that should contribute to the creation 
of situations suitable for a definitive demilitarization of 
irregular forces. 
  3. The National Assembly urges the irregular forces to put 
down their weapons and rejoin civilian life to contribute to 
peace and to the economic and social recovery of the 
municipalities affected by the war. 
  4. We urge the government to adopt the necessary measures to 
evacuate the wounded, care for them, and to respect the lives of 
the rebels. We also urge the government to make efforts to 
create jobs and to integrate the rebels into the productive 
process. 
  5. The National Assembly reiterates its commitment and 
support for the peace process and urges the country's various 
sectors to contribute to the overall objective of definitively 
ending the dramatic war in this country. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 12 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Elvin Talavera, also 
known as "Chacalin," the rebel chief of the 3-80 Northern Front, 
has said he is willing to disarm his forces under the condition 
personal security guarantees are provided for the group under 
the supervision of a verification commission. 
  "Chacalin," the younger brother of the main chief of the 
3-80 
Front, Jose Angel Talavera, alias "el Chacal," warned that they 
"will not deliver their rifles and go home with just a little 
piece of signed paper, as this would be equivalent to disarming 
in exchange for a coffin." 
  According to military reports, "Chacalin" reportedly died in 
combat with government troops two weeks ago. However, Talavera 
himself denied this report and delivered statements to the local 
press in Quilali, 280 km north of Managua. 
  In spite of the disarmament order, a group of "recontras" 
under the command of "El Gato" on Friday broke the cease-fire 
when it ambushed a civilian vehicle in La Reforma. According to 
military sources in Quilali, one policeman was killed and three 
were injured in this ambush that took place on Friday night, 225 
km north of Managua. 
  Nonetheless, military spokesmen in Managua said that the 
truce is not officially over, due to the incident that left one 
policeman dead and several wounded. 
  There is a meeting scheduled for this weekend between the 
rebels and the OAS International Commission of Support and 
Verification (CIAV-OEA) in Las Segovias Mountains to determine 
the details of the unconditional disarmament of the "recontras." 
Sergio Caramagna, the coordinator for the CIAV-OEA -- created 
in 1990 to oversee Contra reintegration into civilian life -- 
said that possibly the first contacts will be made this weekend. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Managua, meanwhile, denied reports that 
"el Chacal" had sold several Redeye SAM missiles to U.S. 
officials for $50,000 to $150,000. The transaction reportedly 
took place in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, toward the end of 1993 or 
at the beginning of this year. According to a news bulletin, 
however, the U.S. diplomatic delegation in Managua said the 
reports were mistaken. The United States, the note reads, 
supports the process of reconciliation among Nicaragua and 
condemns the use of violence. 
  The truce began last Thursday to allow the rebels to disarm. 
The rebels announced a cease-fire and accepted a peace proposal 
presented by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and author Pablo 
Antonio Cuadra. 
  "Chacalin's" statements are in agreement with those 
expressed 
on Thursday by General Humberto Ortega, commander in chief of 
the Sandinist People's Army. Ortega said that "no one wants war 
anymore," but there is mistrust amid the recontras. Talavera 
told local reporters that "we are ready to disarm, but we do not 
trust the Sandinists -- their enemies during eight years of war 
-- because the are traitors."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "BARRICADA on the Sandinist Debate"] </F>
  [Text] The debate among Sandinists, now that the special 
session for the First FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] 
Congress looms ahead, has broken out with such a strength and 
vigor that no one in Nicaragua, regardless of his stance on the 
national crisis, can escape the repercussions. 
  This is easily understood because Sandinism is the most 
important political movement and it has the greatest 
responsibilities in terms of the country's future. What the 
FSLN discusses today regarding its political platform, the 
national crisis, its concept of a party, its statutes, and its 
leadership will have momentous consequences for Sandinism. 
Moreover, it also will have an impact on society as a whole 
because there is a direct relationship between the process to 
strengthen democracy within Sandinism and progress achieved in 
the national democratization process. 
  Therefore, we believe all Sandinists are dutybound to 
realize 
the importance of participating in the debate. We have a double 
responsibility -- to support the reorganization of Sandinism, 
the main goal of the First Congress, and to simultaneously help 
outline the perspectives of a solution to the national crisis. 
No one can fail to endorse those efforts. 
  Today BARRICADA wants to ratify its pledge to work and help 
bring Sandinists together again. 
  Because of professional ethics, we reject sectarian 
journalism that is only appropriate for zealots, like the one 
endorsed by the right wing which does not allow other opinions 
or a diversity of sources on current events. Three years after 
BARRICADA was relaunched, when it stopped being the official 
newspaper, the influence and credibility earned by this 
newspaper have proved, as an expression of political efficiency, 
that we adopted the right decision. 
  Just as we have proclaimed on previous occasions, BARRICADA 
has always been and always wants to be a free forum for 
discussion and national debates. We are not a cathedral where 
dogmas are preached; instead, we are a medium open to doubts, 
intellectual honesty, constructive polemics, and exchanges of 
practical experience to seek solutions and guidance for the 
citizens. 
  We support a debate among Sandinists where ethics prevail. 
In other words, we sponsor a discussion of ideas -- political 
and ideological positions -- where sincerity and a spirit of 
unity prevail above all. We oppose the methodology of using 
exclusion and epithets, and we only endorse strong arguments and 
reason when refuting opposing opinions. We understand that all 
debates imply a reasonable quota of zeal, but this does not mean 
the discussion should degenerate into personal attacks. These 
are the basic norms we ask you to share with all those who have 
an opinion and who wish to state it through BARRICADA. 
  Aside from the observance of ethics, the rules for the 
debate 
demand a political willingness to continue advocating a greater 
flow of information and greater editorial opportunities that 
allow the greatest diversity of opinions, whether on an 
individual basis or as a group, in the Sandinist debate. 
  The existence of different currents of opinion has resulted 
from the vitality of Sandinist democratization. BARRICADA, 
being a member of the news media, has a responsibility -- to 
offer the reader in-depth research into the exchange of 
organized opinions. Therefore, we have begun publishing a new 
section in this edition -- the "FSLN Congress" section -- which 
shall be published whenever necessary to divulge the different 
positions and documents, as well as rank-and-file activities, 
polls, and personal interviews, and it will complement the 
"Opinions" and "Readers' Forum" sections. 
  We pledge to follow the policy of allowing all kinds of 
opinions to be heard, and we urge all the Sandinist media to 
open their pages and radio and television programs and to 
sponsor an ample debate without sectarianism. 
  At BARRICADA, we view the media as autonomous areas of power 
that are linked to the broad spectrum of our society, and we are 
sure the debate also will strengthen the media's autonomy. 
Moreover, we want to remind readers that BARRICADA's 
journalists and workers, and the members of its editorial staff, 
have different personal opinions about the topics for the 
Sandinist debate, and they state their opinions in the 
newspaper's pages under their respective signatures. Only the 
editorial represents the official position of the newspaper.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Guevara from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Representing the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
[FSLN], Commander Bayardo Arce held a meeting with diplomats 
accredited in Nicaragua today to exchange views on the country's 
current situation and possible solutions. 
  [Begin recording] [Gabriela Guevara] In order to obtain 
information and learn the views of various sectors regarding 
Nicaraguan problems and possible solutions, the Association of 
Diplomatic Officials at the new ambassadors level are meeting 
with some local, prominent figures. Today, these diplomats held 
a working breakfast with Commander Bayardo Arce, and they 
discussed various topics regarding the Nicaraguan situation. 
  [Marcos Nunez, member of the Association of Diplomatic 
Officials] Personally, and not speaking for my embassy, I want 
to tell you the discussion was very good. I sensed a clear and 
sincere willingness by Commander Bayardo Arce to implement 
changes on substantial and basic aspects of the FSLN for 
Nicaragua's benefit. 
  [Bayardo Arce, member of the FSLN Executive Commission] The 
diplomats' questions reflected the concerns that all Nicaraguans 
have, like how to achieve economic recovery and how to face 
socioeconomic problems. I believe they, as diplomatics, although 
they are not heads of mission, expressed a certain concern in 
their questions because they see that the government is not 
stimulating production. Obviously, we pointed out that that was 
our main complaint against the government's economic policy, 
namely, that it does not seek to stimulate production. Rather, 
the government's economic policy is more interested in scoring 
high marks with creditors. I believe that listening to our views 
will enable these officials to play a different role in their 
bilateral relations. 
  [Pierre Salazar, official at the Venezuelan Embassy] In my 
question to Commander Bayardo, I mentioned that Nicaragua is a 
country facing a very serious situation with a balance of 
payments deficit, a drop in its foreign exchange, and a lack of 
foreign investment. For many reasons [pauses] currently everyone 
wants money. For instance, the Soviet Union wants $3 billion, 
the Arabs want money, and these circumstances all affect the 
situation. We must be realistic and consider all the 
circumstances. 
  [Guevara] Another major point discussed was the FSLN's 
internal debates. 
  [Arce] Regarding debates in the FSLN, I believe their 
questions were restrained. But since questions were asked on 
this topic, I told them that Sandinists have always had internal 
debates, so much so that at one point we split in three groups 
before beginning our fight against Somoza. We have always been 
characterized by internal debates, but since 1990, and under the 
new conditions, we have brought the debate out into public 
light. This debate has been passionate at times and not so 
passionate at others times, but that should not surprise anyone. 
  [Guevara] The diplomats said the meeting was worthwhile 
because, according to them, firsthand information enables them 
to have a clear idea of the situation and therefore they can 
better contribute to Nicaragua. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the FSLN to mark "this month of the </F>
60th anniversary of Augusto Cesar Sandino's death, as well as 
the upcoming special FSLN Congress, responding to the mandate of 
the Sandinist Assembly and the desire of militants to increase 
reflection and debate on the nature of our party"; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] views 
the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the Army 
and police as the fruit of the RPS [expansion unknown], and it 
endorses the subordination of their institutions to human 
rights, the Constitution, and the laws of the Republic. 
<H5>  Political Democracy </H5>
  The legitimacy of political power depends on the people's 
general representation and on the involvement of every civilian 
organization. 
  The FSLN respects and democratically strengthens the 
political institutions and values most representative of 
national culture, administrative honesty, universal suffrage, 
the separation of the branches of state, national sovereignty, 
and independence, and it discourages, questions, and fights any 
exclusionist political culture. 
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all the sectors 
in 
Nicaragua regardless of race, religion, social class, gender, 
ethnic group, or political position, as well as those struggling 
for peace, stability, security, and the political rights of all 
Nicaraguans. As a revolutionary party, the FSLN is struggling 
for real social participation in civilian and state concerns and 
institutions nationwide, especially by workers, the general 
masses, and dispossessed sectors in Nicaragua. 
  The FSLN respects, promotes, and develops civic means of 
enhancing the people's and popular organizations' involvement in 
demanding their political, social, economic, and cultural rights. 
  The FSLN defends all Nicaraguans' individual safety and 
freedom from abuses by the state or any other national or 
international institution. 
  The FSLN is struggling to preserve the nation's ecosystem by 
promoting technical and cultural practices that will strengthen 
the conservation, improvement, and maintenance of our resources. 
  The FSLN promotes economic policies that are favorable to 
all 
social sectors, especially producers in the countryside and in 
the cities; the democratization of loans; investment 
oportunities; and the exchange of commercial and financial 
information between producers and workers. It also promotes 
policies that discourage the flight of capital and the 
plundering of resources. 
  The FSLN uses every possible source of influence, nationally 
as well as internationally, to allow the state to safeguard the 
nation's economic development and to regulate the social 
distribution of wealth. 
<H5>  Partisan Organization </H5>
  The FSLN is open to all sectors of Nicaraguan society and 
aspires to represent all of society, whether from a position of 
opposition or while in power, in order to achieve democracy, 
economic development, and social justice. Its primary concerns 
are the poor and unemployed, who constitute the majority of 
Nicaraguans. 
  The FSLN is a revolutionary, democratic, and participatory 
party struggling to reconcile freedom and individual initiative 
with the party's interests and the programatic principles by 
which it is governed. 
  The FSLN is a party that promotes national and international 
political alliances with other parties to achieve the goal of 
social and economic well-being for all of society in general and 
for the low-income sectors in particular. 
<H5>  Proposal From the Sandinist Democratic Left </H5>
  The de jure state, social justice, and humanistic socialism 
-- The FSLN defines itself as a revolutionary party whose 
fundamental goal is to struggle and work in the short- and 
mid-term for the establishment of a de jure state, social 
justice, and humanistic and democratic socialism which will 
consider the individual, the family, and the community its main 
concerns. To this end the FSLN is opposed to the implementation 
of liberal and neoliberal principles and measures to resolve 
Nicaraguan society's political, social, and economic problems. 
  The FSLN aspires and proposes to all of Nicaraguan society 
the gradual and progressive achievement of humanistic socialism 
in which the de jure state is combined with social justice and 
political and economic democracy in which popular sectors and 
organizations can truly participate in the Nicaraguan nation's 
political and economic power. To achieve these goals, the FSLN 
must join with all forces interested in eliminating dictatorial 
and authoritarian trends in the political sphere, as well as 
polarizing and exclusionary trends in the area of economics, 
which still prevail in Nicaragua's capitalist society. 
  The FSLN advocates relations based on respect and mutual 
benefit, as well as peaceful coexistence with the neighboring 
governments and peoples of Central America and the Caribbean, 
and especially with the United States. 
  The FSLN joins with the peoples of Latin America and the 
Caribbean to defend self-determination and national sovereignty. 
<H5>  Political Power </H5>
  The nation's sovereignty rests with the Nicaraguan people. 
  The people are the source of political power, which is not 
expressed solely by the state apparatus or government 
institutions, but also by the institutions and organizations of 
civilian society -- namely, trade unions; labor unions; 
churches; municipalities; student, women's, professional, 
artistic, ethnic, cultural, agro-environmental, sports, and 
youth organizations; and nongovernment organizations in general. 
  The FSLN must encourage the creation and democratic 
development of local, municipal, territorial, and cooperative 
authorities without excluding anyone. 
  The FSLN advocates a system of full autonomy for the peoples 
and ethnic communities of the Atlantic Coast. 
<H5>  Economic, Social, and Cultural Democracy </H5>
  As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all sectors 
seeking national economic development and social justice. As a 
revolutionary party it especially represents the popular forces, 
middle classes, professionals, intellectuals, and artists 
seeking equitable participation in the distribution of the 
nation's wealth. 
  The FSLN opposes any position that advocates the restoration 
of the oligarchic system, such as exclusionary and neoliberal 
policies that foster contradictions, conflicts, and social 
instability. 
  The FSLN respects public and private property and any other 
form of property; it struggles for the democratization of 
property; and it promotes and encourages all forms of 
associative property -- namely, communal, cooperative, APT 
[expansion unknown], municipal, autonomous, labor, federative, 
and joint businesses. 
  The FSLN is struggling to democratize the economy; to make 
it 
respond to the needs of the majority of people and not to the 
needs of minorities; to prevent its competitiveness from 
becoming oligopolist; to ensure that it is based on ethical and 
popular criteria and not on demagogic morality; to ensure that 
society and the state will guard it without jeopardizing its 
role in the effective and productive allocation of resources; 
and to ensure that it will be an economy that favors human 
beings and not capital. 
  The FSLN promotes economic policies that seek productive 
growth and involve the granting of opportunities based on an 
individual's work, productivity, and initiative, as well as 
promoting policies through which the assurance of employment, 
health, education, and housing are considered priorities. 
  The FSLN is developing every possible initiative and measure 
to diminish the poverty and unemployment suffered by most 
Nicaraguans. 
  The FSLN is struggling to provide the minimal conditions for 
a dignified life to every individual who for reasons of age, 
gender, or physical disability have no access to society's 
general benefits. 
  The FSLN takes its inspiration primarily from the historic 
and cultural roots of the Nicaraguan people, and it is trying to 
establish an economic model that will be the most beneficial for 
the nation as a whole and for the largest and most impoverished 
sectors in particular. 
  The FSLN respects the autonomy and interests of social and 
popular organizations, supports their demands and struggles, and 
strives to attract them to the party's way of thinking. 
  The FSLN is a broad, democratic party that can be joined by 
all citizens who accept the party's way of thinking, respect the 
unity of Sandinism, and abide by decisions made by the majority. 
  The FSLN encourages consensus among its members through 
debate and dialogue as a method for settling internal 
disagreement. 
  The FSLN regards renovation, modernization, change, and 
internal democracy as factors to strengthen Sandinism from the 
left. 
<H5>  Methods of Struggle </H5>
  The FSLN regards as legitimate the combination of 
parliamentary and legal methods of struggle, as well as popular 
mobilizations and public debates. 
  The FSLN believes that the struggle of any one popular 
organization must be backed by the largest possible consensus in 
the organization's own rank-and-file. The organization should 
strive for the help, coordination, and solidarity of similar 
organizations, and it should strive to persuade the population 
to endorse its goals. 
  The FSLN regards humanistic knowledge, education, and 
training as essential tools for strengthening the political, 
social, and economic ethics of Sandinists and all Nicaraguans in 
general. 
  The FSLN regards direct, secret, and universal suffrage as a 
legitimate means of electing municipal and parliamentarian 
representatives, presidents, and all other officials, both 
within the government and within political parties.

  [Text] A new comptroller general of the Republic was 
appointed today. There was no doubt; there was no reason to 
suspect otherwise. The person Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo 
nominated, in other words, his friend Engineer Arturo Harding 
Lacayo, was appointed comptroller general of the Republic in 
elections in which the 74 deputies who attended the plenary 
session participated. 
  Harding got 57 votes and Juan Gutierrez got two votes. One 
vote was from Humberto Castilla and the other vote was from 
Humberto Hassan. Customs General Director Guillermo Ruiz also 
received two votes. There were thirteen abstentions from a total 
of 74 nominal votes, meaning each deputy's name was called and 
each one said for whom he was voting.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 8 
February. 
  The Central American Integration Bank has granted Nicaragua 
$140 million in credit for agriculture production, Presidency 
Minister Antonio Lacayo has said during a meeting with private 
bankers and farmers. In addition, the tourism sector will 
receive $8 million in credits, he has said. (Managua Sistema 
Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 3 Feb 94) 
  The Nicaraguan Government has left cotton farmers without 
financing and allocated resources to the livestock sector only 
for $170 million for the 1994 to 1995 harvest cycle. National 
Development Bank authorities have said there is no credit policy 
for the cotton sector, even though farmers planned to increase 
cotton fields from 2,100 to 7,000 hectares. (Hamburg DPA in 
Spanish 1724 GMT 6 Feb 94) 
  The Consumer Price Index increased 1.16 percent in January 
due to an increase in fuel prices, the Central Bank has 
reported. In addition, the government predicted a 10-percent 
inflation rate and a 12-percent devaluation of the cordoba in 
regard to the dollar in 1994 if the current 1-percent 
devaluation rate per month continues. (Managua BARRICADA in 
Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 8)

<F P=106> [Letter by Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino to National </F>
Civil Renewal Party President Tomas Herrera and Miguel Antonio 
Bernal in Panama City; date not given; passages within boldface 
as published] 
  [Text] I am answering your letter of January 1994, in which 
you convey to the Foreign Ministry your concerns and views 
regarding a topic I deem of the utmost importance for the 
electoral, pluralist, and democratic process we are going 
through and for the future as well. I am referring to the 
regulations on electoral matters issued by the U.S. Government 
agencies that operate in our country, based on the Panama Canal 
Treaties of 1977. 
  Well prior to receiving your esteemed letter, I took 
particular interest in the case. Learning that Panamanian 
citizens who work for the Panama Canal Commission [PCC], U.S. 
military agencies, or any other U.S. Government agencies 
operating in our country based on the 1977 treaties are barred 
by a U.S. law that regulates their status as U.S. Government 
federal employees from running for office in the upcoming 8 
January elections was sufficient reason to conduct a necessary 
and profound study of the topic, as well as to begin a series of 
consultations with accredited diplomatic officials of that 
country and the PCC, specifically, His Excellency Deane Hinton, 
U.S. ambassador to Panama, and PCC Administrator Gilberto 
Guardia, in addition to the consultations conducted by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero and Foreign Ministry legal 
advisers who are knowledgeable of matters pertaining to the 
Panama Canal Treaties. 
  By virtue of the 1977 treaties, the Republic of Panama, as a 
sovereign territory, conferred on the United States the right to 
manage, operate, and maintain the Panama Canal, its operations, 
installations, and auxiliary equipment, and to provide what was 
necessary for the fluid traffic of vessels through that Canal. 
The United States accepted the concession of rights and pledged 
to exercise them in conformity with the treaties and related 
agreements. (See Article III, No. 1 of the Panama Canal Treaties 
of 1977.) 
  In addition to the aforementioned and to carry out the 
previously mentioned responsibilities, the treaty grants the 
United States of America a long string of rights to fulfill the 
treaty's goals. Among others, the right "to regulate relations 
with United States of America employees" stands out. This point 
does not differentiate the employees' nationalities. 
Furthermore, the mentioned legal instrument stipulates that the 
United States of America will fulfill its responsibilities 
through a U.S. Government agency called the "Panama Canal 
Commission." This commission is constituted in accordance and 
adherence to the laws of the United States of America and is a 
federal agency under the U.S. Executive Branch. As of 1 January 
1990, the treaty states and as, in fact, has occurred, a 
Panamanian citizen will be appointed to the post of 
administrator. The Panamanian administrator is proposed by 
Panama but appointed by the United States of America. (See 
Article III, No.'s 2 (e), 3, and 3(c) of the 1977 Panama Canal 
Treaty.) 
  In my opinion, the foregoing, which I am sure was already 
known to you, sets the fundamental legal framework to 
understanding the reason for the subject under study. 
  The importance to Panamanians of the current electoral 
process and the holding of free and honest elections on 8 May, 
is a well-known fact. They are the first elections to be held 
in freedom and amid an undeniable political pluralism in the 
country, after 21 years of a dictatorial government and the 
unclear manner -- to say the least -- in which the electoral 
processes were held prior to 1968. Furthermore, the current 
transition period from the dictatorship which was in power until 
1989 to the democratic system we have today, has had to confront 
enormous problems and attempts were made to resolve them amid 
very pressing circumstances from all sides. One of those 
problems and the one that can serve as an example of the 
military government's irresponsibility is the issue of the 
Panama Canal and the areas and installations that reverted to 
Panama based on the treaty. Undoubtedly, during the next five 
years of government, regardless of who wins the elections, we 
will have to continue establishing the bases to face the 
transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands in a responsible and 
efficient manner. 
  Excuse me for this perhaps lengthy but necessary 
introduction, because I think that the issue at hand is directly 
related to that inevitable obligation that all Panamanians have, 
without exception, to receive the Canal on 31 December 1999 and 
to continue administering it in an autonomous and responsible 
fashion, aside from party or electoral interests. From this 
stems my interest in studying the history of the U.S. 
legislation which governs, in general terms, all U.S. Government 
agencies, including the Panama Canal Commission and the military 
agencies of that country operating in Panama by virtue of the 
treaties. 
  In my opinion, if Panamanian employees working for U.S. 
Government agencies operating in Panama may or may not run for 
office, causes me to distinguish the problem between one that is 
strictly juridical and one that is juridical-political. The 
first one, namely the juridical, outlines the simple analysis of 
taking the instrument called the "Hatch Act" and its 
modifications in 1993, and thus consider, in light of the same, 
that the electoral participation is applicable to electoral 
processes within the territory of the Republic of Panama, where 
by virtue of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty several U.S. 
Government agencies operate. Without delving deeply into this 
matter, I believe that in the strict juridical sense, this 
provision is not applicable. Obviously, it is a federal law of 
that country which was conceived in response to an aim strictly 
in keeping with the United States and U.S. citizens' interests. 
Legislative history, however, raises similar questions on 
whether civil rights of U.S. public servants are restricted or 
not. 
  The second one, the juridical-political question, is from 
where I find the main basis for my opinion. It is important to 
stress that by adopting this viewpoint, I relate the "political" 
term with the interest and spirit of protecting, in this case, 
the total independence of party and electoral politics of the 
institutional life of our future Canal Authority, which will 
come under our control within six years. The Authority's 
absolute noninvolvement in politics must continue to be 
considered a main pillar of the merit system that must prevail 
in the rendering of services by the labor component. 
  Whether we like it or not, the labor relationship currently 
in effect in the Panama Canal Commission responds to U.S. 
interests and the Panamanian officials who work there operate 
under that condition. This is established by the treaties, 
despite our personal views on the matter. However, in an 
attempt to be honest with myself and in light of the 
responsibilities of my official position and the national 
moment, I do not think it is prudent to separate the juridical 
analysis from the great national interest that we must preserve, 
which is to keep politics outside of the current Commission and 
future Panama Canal Authority. 
  The certainly justified aspiration of a small group of 
Panamanian PCC employees to run for elective office is worth a 
review, taking into consideration the impact this may have on 
the future on that entity's nonpolitical stance. If this 
concept does not prevail, in view of the high regard with which 
we must assess our national interest regarding the Panama Canal, 
we may be sharing the responsibility for opening a door that may 
mean the beginning of the end of the professional management 
which based on merit governs that important institution. 
  Seeking a parallel situation with respect to Panamanian laws 
that try to keep major institutions from becoming politicized, I 
found several that partially or totally deal with the political 
rights or participation in elective office of Panamanians. One 
of those laws, and it is related to the Panama Canal, is Law No. 
5 dated 25 February 1993 which creates the Interoceanic Region 
Authority and adopts measures on reverted properties. When 
referring to its board members, Article 8 of said law states: 
"They may not run for elective office." One need not 
go into the merit that such limitations on the exercise of the 
rights of these citizens has within the context of the function 
that said entity must perform in this final transition period. 
  On electoral matters, Article 25 of the Elections Code 
partially limits the rights of a series of public officials that 
have held certain posts or at any time are nominated to elective 
office up to a period of six months before the elections or the 
date in which they were nominated by a convention of the 
respective parties, provided the conventions were held prior to 
that six-month period. That is the case that currently governs 
ministers, deputy ministers, managers and deputy managers, 
directors and deputy directors of autonomous or semiautonomous 
state entities, Supreme Court justices, Electoral Tribunal 
magistrates, and others. One need not also mention or analyze 
the national interest that this partial restriction seeks to 
protect. 
  Regarding judicial officials, Article 49 of the Judicial 
Code 
does not allow Judicial Branch employees, even if 
they are on leave or temporarily absent from their jobs for 
whatever reason: "2. To participate in politics, except to vote 
in official elections or referenda." On this matter, one need 
not say what the nomination of the administration of justice has 
meant in the recent past. [sentence as published] 
  With these three examples I have wanted to compare a 
national 
legal reality where the exercise of clear civilian and political 
rights are prohibited as they are incompatible at a given time 
with a given public post. I acknowledge that we are not dealing 
with a national law -- in case that causes your concern -- but 
with a general situation that is applied to Panamanian citizens 
given their status as U.S. Government federal employees. This 
is legally based on the rights agreed upon in favor of that 
nation in the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty. Nevertheless, the 
future national interest -- which I believe is important to 
guard -- is to continue fostering the nonpoliticization of the 
current PCC and of the future Canal Authority. 
  In light of the treaty, the interpretation given by the 
Canal 
Commission authorities and other U.S. Government agencies that 
operate in Panama is correct. The only restriction applied, in 
view of the aforementioned "Hatch Act," is that Panamanians who 
work there cannot be candidates to public elected posts while 
they are federal employees of those agencies. The other rights 
to participate in politics and to actively participate in 
political parties are not restricted, as long as this is not 
exercised during work hours or with that government's official 
resources. 
  I must confess that I have thought over this reply a great 
deal and thought about the nonconformity it may produce in you 
and in other citizens or political groups of our nation. 
Nevertheless, my position as foreign relations minister, as a 
lawyer, and as a Panamanian forced me to analyze the facts with 
the care required under the circumstances. Above all, I hope 
that the position I am currently adopting, which may be 
criticized by many, will serve for reflection by the whole 
nation on the vital importance to Panama of keeping the Panama 
Canal removed from political party passions and decisions. This 
was the main cause of the absolute collapse of our republican 
institutionalization in the recent past, which we hope will 
never return to our nation.

  [Text] Yesterday, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino rejected statements made in Washington by Robert Gelbard, 
U.S. assistant deputy secretary for Inter-American Affairs. 
Gelbard warned the United States could reduce its aid to 
countries, like Panama, which have not curbed drug trafficking. 
  "Expressing criticism that does not seriously reflect the 
true attitude and determination of the Panamanian Government in 
its fight against this powerful and international network of 
crimes is unacceptable," Mulino warned in a note sent to Deane 
Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama. 
  On 10 February, Gelbard told the international press that 
the 
Clinton administration is studying the possibility of cutting 
aid to countries like Panama, Bolivia, Peru, and other 
drug-producing countries or countries where drug traffickers 
operate and where they have not been punished. 
  Mulino recalled that since 1990, the Panamanian Government 
has been taking "serious and decisive" actions to fight the 
laundering of drug money. 
  "I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay the U.S. 
Senate has experienced in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty on penal matters, signed by the United States and Panama 
in April 1991," and which has been approved by the Panamanian 
Legislative Assembly. 
  According to the diplomat, all these years of postponements 
with respect to this important legal instrument "undermines your 
government official's authority to criticize." 
  In his letter, the foreign minister chronologically recounts 
at least 12 measures Panama has taken against drug trafficking 
as well as the agreements and treaties signed with other 
countries. 
  Mulino adds that "not even the United States, with all its 
resources, has been able to effectively control drug 
consumption. But this real impossibility is not an excuse to 
carelessly say that this government is not working to control" 
this problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno and Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>
  [Text] Planning Minister Delia Cardenas has said the U.S. 
State Department official who said Panama is not making enough 
effort to fight drug trafficking and money laundering "does not 
know the Panamanian situation or what the government has done" 
to fight the scourge. 
  This week, Robert Gelbard, the State Department official in 
charge of overseeing the antidrug fight, said Panama is doing 
very little to fight money laundering. Cardenas said: "I think 
he does not know the Panamanian situation or the efforts the 
government has made to fight drug trafficking and money 
laundering throughout the country. 
  The U.S. official's statement was also rejected by Foreign 
Minister Jose Mulino, who described it as "unacceptable and 
irresponsible." Minister Cardenas said: "We have done our part, 
but the United States still has one important task to perform: 
to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]." Panama 
and the United States signed MLAT in 1991, and it has been 
ratified by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly but not by the 
U.S. Congress. Cardenas described the position of the U.S. 
official as "unfortunate." 
  Gelbard said Panama "has not taken the necessary steps to 
counteract the problem of the presence of millions of dollars 
generated by drug trafficking." In a note sent by Foreign 
Minister Mulino to U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, the Foreign 
Ministry lists twelve steps the administration of President 
Guillermo Endara has taken to fight drug trafficking and money 
laundering. 
  Gelbard's assertion came at a time when the Bill Clinton 
administration has announced a new policy for fighting drug 
trafficking. The new policy is based on the fight against the 
consumption of drugs and foresees a drop in financial aid to 
countries that do not make real efforts to fight the production 
and trafficking of drugs. 
  Hinton, who yesterday concluded his work in Panama, 
apologized to the Endara government for Gelbard's statement. "In 
my opinion," he said, "Panama has done a lot to fight drug 
trafficking and I can point to the efforts of organizations like 
the Judicial Technical Police, the National Air Service, and the 
National Maritime Service in this endeavor." 
  Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos affirmed 
that 
Panama "works seriously" to fight drug trafficking activities. 
He described the statement by the U.S. official as "improper." 
According to Hoyos, there is a "big difference" between this 
government and the past regime in matters having to do with the 
fight against drug trafficking because, in those days, drug 
trafficking was backed by important state officials. 
  He noted that although the state has limited resources, the 
government has done a lot to confront drug traffickers 
throughout the country. The justice said: "We must remember that 
this country has just signed and delivered documents ratifying 
the Vienna Convention regarding the fight against the 
trafficking of hallucinogenic and illegal drugs." Justice Hoyos 
said Panama has signed the MLAT with the United States and 
Colombia. He explained that although Panama has already ratified 
MLAT, which was signed in the United States, the United States 
has not ratified it.

  [Text] A Foreign Ministry communique states the Republic of 
Panama established diplomatic ties with the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan on 7 February. 
  The two countries are establishing diplomatic ties inspired 
by the desire to foster, strengthen, and develop friendship, 
harmony, and mutual cooperation based on the principles and 
objectives of the UN Charter. 
  The diplomatic ties, which will be at the level of 
concurrent 
ambassadors, are established based on provisions of the 1961 
Vienna Convention. 
  The Panamanian and Jordanian Governments, represented by 
Carlos Arosemena and 'Adnan Abu-'Awdah, respectively, signed the 
agreement at UN Headquarters in New York City. 
  The date when the two governments will appoint ambassadors 
was not disclosed during the signing ceremony.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  "The Griper" column reports that "nearly 100 former members 
of the military during the previous regime met at a residence on 
50th Street recently. Led by General Ruben Dario Paredes, there 
were statements in support of the presidential candidacy of 
Ruben Dario Carles. They formed an organization called Union of 
Military Members in Favor of Civilian Rule [Union de Militares 
Civilistas] to fight for their rights." It adds that "the first 
meeting broke up amid strong discussions and disagreements." 
(Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 32) 
  Former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles, presidential 
candidate 
for the National Renewal Movement, Morena, the Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement, Molirena, and the Civic Renewal 
Party, said his ticket is the best one so he does not see any 
need to change it. Mireya Moscoso, presidential candidate of the 
Arnulfist Party, PA, recently issued an urgent call to the 
so-called civic parties to form a great alliance to face the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, in the elections. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 5 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Morena convention delegates on 5 February unanimously 
ratified the presidential ticket of Carles, Guillermo Quijano, 
and Tomas Herrera. In a previous convention on 6 January, the 
delegates had proclaimed the ticket of Carles, Gloria Moreno de 
Lopez and Herrera, but due to the alliance with Molirena, 
Guillermo Quijano was nominated vice presidential candidate 
instead of Moreno de Lopez. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 6 
Feb 94 p 12) 
  The presidential candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles was 
officially registered at the Electoral Tribunal under the 
"Change 94" ticket on 7 February. The ticket formed by Carles 
and Guillermo Quijano as first vice president and Tomas Herrera 
as second vice president was presented by Molirena President 
Alfredo Ramirez. At the registration, Carles said that "we are 
the best and we are going to win." (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares 
registered his ticket at the Electoral Organization Directorate 
on 7 February. He was accompanied by Tomas Gabriel Altamirano 
Duque and Felipe Virzi, first and second vice presidential 
candidates, respectively. Regarding the failure of the 
government parties to establish an electoral alliance against 
the PRD, he said that "nothing unites them because they do not 
have a national objective." Representatives of the Labor Party, 
PALA, and the Liberal Republican Party later presented documents 
accrediting them as supporters of Perez Balladares' slate. 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 
94) 
  The Papa Egoro Movement registered its ticket headed by 
Ruben 
Blades as the presidential candidate and Fernando Manfredo and 
Ricardo Bermudez as its vice presidential candidates on 7 
February. Blades said his movement has the possibility of 
presenting a solution to the Panamanian people. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  The PA presented the documents to register its presidential 
ticket at the Electoral Tribunal on 7 February. PA President 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber was accompanied by leaders of the 
Authentic Liberal Party, the Liberal Party, and Independent 
Democratic Union, which support her presidential candidacy. The 
registration of the PA's slate shows the failure to achieve a 
national unity ticket with other parties. The PA president 
said: "Unfortunately, I made a proposal which fell on deaf ears. 
We wanted an alliance with several parties." Asked whether 
this failure might favor the opposition headed by the PRD, she 
replied: "Well, we are an alliance of four parties. I think it 
is the alliance with the most parties. We are organized. We 
will work and tour the entire country. We are sure we are going 
to be the winners." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in 
Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  Liberal Party President Roberto Aleman and Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber, president of the Arnulfist Party, downplayed Ruben Dario 
Carles' chances of winning the 8 May elections because the 
parties that support him "do not have the strength to take him 
to victory." Convention delegates of the Liberal Party on 6 
February unanimously approved a resolution to join the parties 
that form the Democratic Alliance that nominated Moscoso de 
Gruber as its presidential candidate. Moscoso de Gruber said 
that Carles "is not a threat" to the Democratic Alliance formed 
by her party, the Authentic Liberal Party, the Liberal Party, 
and the Independent Democratic Union. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA 
DE PANAMA in Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 1A) 
  The Popular Nationalist Party, PNP, does not plan to 
register candidates to president, legislator or corregimiento 
representative and instead will nominate several candidates to 
mayors. PNP President Jorge Flores said it will nominate Ana Mae 
de Endara for Panama City mayor and Manuel Burgos for San 
Miguelito mayor. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 Feb 
94 p 8C) 
  The final electoral registry presented to the political 
parties on 6 February indicates that 1,496,323 citizens are 
qualified to vote. Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes 
said there will be 5,310 voting tables at 1,980 polling 
stations. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles said that if he 
wins the presidency, in the first 100 days of his 
administration, he will attack the main social problems such as 
unemployment, crime, and drug addiction. He toured areas of San 
Miguelito on the morning of 8 February. Asked about charges 
that he blocked social development while he was comptroller 
general, Carles stated: "I was the comptroller who had to make 
sure that the money spent by the government would be used in 
accordance with the law. I was not a minister. There was never 
a shortage of money to do the things done well." He adds: "I do 
not make promises that cannot be kept. I am not promising a road 
from here to the moon. I am promising housing to solve housing 
problems and create jobs. I make specific promises. We are 
going to improve public services with available resources." 
(Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 8 
Feb 94) 
  Presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles stated that the 
Panamanian university system is becoming more and more separated 
from the technological and scientific realities in the modern 
world. He said the universities have not bothered to analyze the 
present and future job market so a thorough reorientation of 
their scientific, academic, and research activity is necessary. 
Carles' observations are stated in a document entitled, "For a 
Government That Makes Decisions," in which he sets forth his 
work plan. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 4) 
  PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares said on 
7 
February that "the bad politicians who are trying to smear his 
reputation are doing so because they already 'know they will 
lose' and they will be rejected by the Panamanian people in the 
8 May elections." He added that "there are political leaders 
who are trying to link him to the past, but they will be 
rejected by the people because 'hunger and unemployment are not 
in the past but in the present.'" (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE 
PANAMA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Movement presidential candidate, 
announced that his artistic career will end when he begins his 
task of governing Panama. When his ticket was registered, 
Blades said the "Papa Egoro does not have economic means because 
the party is born from the people's desires, not from economic 
power." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 8 Feb 94 p 
1)

  [Text] Despite the opinions of most political groups, the 
legislative opposition, the Prosecutor General's Office, the 
Lima Bar Association, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court 
himself, the president has promulgated and published in EL 
PERUANO the controversial Law on Venue Dispute [Ley Sobre 
Contienda de Competencia], which in this case transfers the La 
Cantuta case to military courts. 
  Congressmen in the majority, whom the opposition have 
accused 
of violating the independence of the Judicial Branch, broke 
their silence through authorized spokesman Carlos Torres y 
Torres Lara, who justified the law and explained that in the end 
the criminal court may or may not abide by its contents. 
  Opposition legislators reiterated their willingness to 
struggle in Congress and the Judicial Branch to repeal the 
aforementioned law. 
  Amid a great deal of controversy and severe criticism, the 
executive promulgated and published in the official newspaper 
the law eliminating the vote that settles venue disputes, thus 
establishing that the La Cantuta case will be settled in a 
military court. 
  Progovernment Legislator Carlos Torres y Torres said he is 
confident of a fair sentence by the military court and added 
that the provision is aimed at protecting the magistrates of the 
Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, the body that will now 
decide whether this provision will be implemented. 
  [Begin recording] [Carlos Torres y Torres] The law has been 
published, therefore it must be implemented. It is now up to 
the Supreme Court of Justice, which must take note of the case 
and take the action it deems appropriate. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Can the Criminal Chamber discard 
this 
provision? 
  [Torres y Torres] Well, state branches are independent, 
consequently, the judicial branch may take whatever action it 
deems appropriate. [end recording] 
  The first protests were not long in coming. 
  [Begin Popular Christian Party, PPC, Congressman Antero 
Florez recording] The legislative wing of the PPC has just 
presented a draft bill repealing the promulgation of the law, 
which unduly transfers the La Cantuta case to military courts. 
Second, the PPC-sponsored bill declares that the article of the 
Judicial Branch Basic Law requiring four votes to pass a 
resolution instead of three remains in effect. [end recording] 
  Opposition members met privately this afternoon and agreed 
to 
present tomorrow morning an amparo writ against Law 26-291, 
arguing that it is intended to protect the perpetrators of the 
La Cantuta crime. 
  [Begin unidentified opposition representative recording] It 
is a law with a specific purpose: to violate the independence 
of the Judicial Branch. It is a law intended to dodge 
previously established procedures to protect the real 
perpetrators of crimes. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 11 Feb (AFP) -- The Peruvian economy minister 
and the president of the Council of Ministers reportedly 
tendered their resignations to President Alberto Fujimori on 
Thursday, according to unconfirmed rumors published in Lima 
newspapers on Friday. 
  The resignations of Jorge Camet and Alfonso Bustamante y 
Bustamante were especially due to the enactment on Thursday of a 
law which the Peruvian Congress approved at the beginning of the 
week. The law modifies the procedure that has been applied by 
the Supreme Court up to now whenever it had to rule on a case of 
jurisdiction between criminal justice and military justice. 
  According to observers, the application of this law would 
allow military judges to try the "La Cantuta" case -- the 
disappearance at La Cantuta University during the summer of 1992 
of nine students and a professor, whose charred bodies were 
found a year later -- in which several military officers are 
implicated. 
  The voting on this law and its enactment by President 
Fujimori led to a real scandal in Peru and observers have 
pointed out that the text -- published in the official newspaper 
on 10 February -- did not have the signature of Bustamante. 
  Moreover, according to other rumors disclosed by LA 
REPUBLICA 
newspaper, the United States, concerned over the attitude of the 
Peruvian authorities regarding the La Cantuta incident, is 
reportedly ready to announce its withdrawal from Peru's Support 
Group.

  [Text] The Criminal Division of the Supreme Court has ruled 
that the military personnel accused of abducting and killing 
nine students and one professor from La Cantuta's Enrique Guzman 
y Valle University will be tried by a military court. 
  Applying the Law on Venue Dispute -- a law promulgated today 
by the executive branch -- the high court ratified its earlier 
ruling by voting 3-2 in favor of the military court handling the 
case. The Supreme Council of Military Justice and Lima's 16th 
Criminal Court have been informed of the decision. 
  Going against the opinion of the Constituent Democratic 
Congress, the attorney general, distinguished attorneys, and 
Amnesty International, the Criminal Branch of the Supreme Court 
finally ruled on the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta 
case by applying Law 26291, which went into effect today. 
  Following the suspension of a public hearing convened by 
ruling Justice Carlos Giusti Acuna -- a hearing held at 1100 to 
allow the parties involved to make oral statements -- the 
decision from the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court was 
released to journalists without comment from Supreme Court 
President Luis Serpa Segura or Criminal Court President Moises 
Pantoja. 
  The document applying Law 26291 upholds an earlier ruling on 
the jurisdictional dispute in the La Cantuta case. Justices 
Pantoja, Iberico Mas, and Montes de Oca Vegazo voted in favor of 
the military court hearing the case, while Justices Almenara 
Bryson and Sivina Hurtado voted in favor of the civilian court. 
The decision has been reported to the Supreme Council of 
Military Justice and Lima's 16th Criminal Court.

  [Excerpt] Before the Criminal Court's decision on La 
Cantuta case was known, opposition congressmen had presented an 
appeal for the protection of civil rights to the 22d Court 
asking that the controversial Law on Venue Dispute not be 
implemented. Later they visited with the president of the 
Supreme Court and asked that the Law on Venue Dispute not be 
implemented. 
  A few hours before the Supreme Court ruled on the Law on 
Venue Dispute, opposition congressmen represented by Henry 
Peace, Fernando Olivera, Robert Caceres, Manuel Moreira, and 
Antero Flores, among others, presented an appeal for the 
protection of civil rights so the law is not enforced. The 
document was received by Justice Rafael Yager in his office. The 
appeal included a precautionary measure so that the law would 
not be applied to La Cantuta case. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, first vice president of 
the CCD, this evening denounced the U.S. President's statement 
in connection with the Law on Venue Dispute. He said the 
statement represents interference in the country's internal 
affairs. Torres y Torres Lara held a news conference in which 
he decried U.S. President Bill Clinton's statements in 
connection with the implementation of the Law on Venue Dispute, 
which deals with the La Cantuta case. He also said he rejects 
the attack perpetrated against Deputy Chu Meriz's home. 
  [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] I deeply deplore the 
statement released by President Clinton's administration, a 
friendly nation -- meaning the U.S. people -- in a way that it 
represents direct interference in Peru's internal affairs. We 
may err in Peru, and we may err many times, but we cannot allow, 
just as the United States would not allow, statements to be made 
regarding our internal affairs. This is very deplorable. [end 
recording] 
  Moreover, Torres y Torres Lara said the Penal Court made its 
decision with complete independence. He added that the CCD will 
closely monitor the trial, which will now take place in a 
military court and should yield its first results within a month. 
  [Begin Torres y Torres Lara recording] Our concern and 
decision to monitor the case is compelled by our desire to 
ensure that the military court fulfills its duty by drastically 
punishing those responsible. We will closely follow the case so 
that it does not turn out as other cases have on various 
occasions in other governments, meaning that neither a civilian 
nor a military venue punished the crime. The CCD will be fully 
provided with the necessary means to guarantee that justice 
prevails in Peru, whether through a civilian or a military 
venue. [end recording]

  [Text] Lima, 12 Feb (AFP) -- Saturday night, Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori said the country should close ranks 
in defense of sovereignty in the face of a U.S. Government 
protest note regarding a law that relinquishes to the military 
justice system a case involving the abduction and murder of nine 
students and a professor from La Cantuta University. 
  "The important thing is the sovereignty of states. Instead, 
we should close ranks because Peru is a sovereign country; it 
has been totally autonomous and independent since 28 July 1821, 
and this independence must be maintained," the president said. 
  Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Lima Alvin P. Adams read a note 
from his government to journalists. In his note, the ambassador 
urged Peru to respect the autonomy of the judicial branch and 
stated his interest that the people responsible for the "brutal 
La Cantuta assassination" receive justice. 
  Fujimori said that in "Peru, the branches of the state are 
independent." He said this during a brief television statement 
while aboard the airplane that took him to Lima from the city of 
Puno, in the extreme Andean south, where he dedicated some 
community works. 
  Fujimori stated: "There are laws in other countries that 
other countries do not find appropriate, as has happened in our 
country." 
  The chief of state defended his position that the Army 
personnel involved in the abduction and death of the nine 
students and a professor from Lima's La Cantuta University in 
July 1992 be tried by a military court, thereby avoiding "the 
political handling some want to give this case." Fujimori 
indicated that military justice will punish the guilty. 
  Legislation regarding the La Cantuta case was approved last 
Tuesday by the government controlled Congress; on Thursday, 
Fujimori announced it, and on Friday, the Supreme Court of 
Justice penal bench confirmed it by a majority vote. 
  The law has been challenged by the victims' relatives, the 
Peruvian opposition, most of the press, the Lima Bar 
Association, and the National Human Rights Coordinating Board 
because "it is contrary to the new Constitution as well as the 
country's current laws."

  [Text] The conclusions of the report on Peru's human rights 
situation released yesterday by the U.S. State Department are 
"exaggerated and distorted," said Carlos Blanco Oropeza, 
president of the Democratic Constituent Congress Human Rights 
Committee, and General Luis Cisneros Vizquerra, retired. 
  Blanco said that although the document acknowledges that the 
Shining Path is the greatest human rights violator in Peru, but 
also notes the progress attained by the government in this 
field, the report persists in accusing the Peruvian Government 
of systematically implementing a policy of murders and 
disappearances. 
  Besides pointing out that the government's antisubversive 
strategy is based on the concepts of prosperity, democracy, and 
respect for human rights, Blanco maintains that the U.S. State 
Department's view is incomplete and ignores other more objective 
reports such as the ones prepared by the United Nations. 
  Gen. Cisneros, who agrees with Blanco, denied that the 
Peruvian Government systematically implements a policy of abuses 
to human rights. 
  He said that the U.S. report is quite unfair to the Armed 
Forces which last year were very careful to act within the legal 
norms and with respect for the individual. 
  He added that the U.S. Government has a distorted notion of 
the problem as a consequence of "information obtained from 
people interested in creating a false image of Peru." 
  However, Cisneros agreed on the need to modify the trial 
mechanism -- by military courts -- of terrorists to make trials 
"more transparent and according to the law." 
  "We can already observe a change of attitude in the 
government, especially since the installation of new Supreme 
Court members who were chosen by a Disciplinary Board for 
Magistrates," Cisneros said.

<F P=106> [Article by Liz Mineo] </F>
  [Text] With the recent dismantling of the first Shining 
Path cell in Tarapoto, the silent spread of the Shining Path 
[SL] in the Huallaga region was limited, but apparently not 
sufficiently. 
  After the arrest of a cell that planned to "unleash" a 
strong 
wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its 
attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the 
defeat by the Army. 
  During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to 
testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to 
extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their 
latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin, 
control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and, 
what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their 
old areas of influence in the region. 
  The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas 
abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper 
Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and 
injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack 
took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH 
officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley. 
Two weeks before the attack, the SL had threatened the PEAH 
officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso Ugarte. 
  PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have 
received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui 
have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats. 
  A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo 
Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members 
gathered residents together and appointed some delegates. "We 
did not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to 
defend ourselves," a peasant patrol member in the area told us. 
  In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto, 
located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people 
hailed the SL on the evening of 8 December. 
  In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of 
SL members attempted to hold a meeting of residents and appoint 
delegates a few weeks ago. 
  A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the 
towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal 
files. 
  In Ponaza and Biavo, the SL arrived to control some hamlets 
and strengthened their presence in the region's capital in the 
past few months. 
  The SL apparently is concentrating on turning this strategic 
area of the Huallaga region into its most important bastion 
because it has not suffered many casualties there and has made 
much progress. 
  The fast spread of the SL in the region represents serious 
danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had divided 
control over San Martin Department among themselves: The 
territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA and 
the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by the 
SL. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have changed. 
  The SL currently operates freely in the area previously 
controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are located in the 
extended territory between Tocache and the Lower Huallaga. The 
SL still maintains strong influence in its old area of influence 
between Huicungo and southern San Martin Department. 
  In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of 
Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon. 
Military sources guarantee that in these areas several 
subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro 
Rojo, and T-4, which work with the "local force" of the Regional 
Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the 
region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those 
provinces to indoctrinate members. 
  The "main force" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the 
subversives have named "Conquistar," "Atreverse," "Tormenta," 
and "Mar Rojo," or "ZB," "JR," and "AQ." These groups control 
Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and 
San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are "mobile" and 
are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed. 
  According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa 
Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla, 
Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other 
hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new "red zones" while 
La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue 
being areas in which the SL has its "basic force" dedicated to 
production and surveillance. 
  "Open people's committees" are thought to have been set up 
in 
several of the aforementioned places. 
  Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo 
Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter 
Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora -- 
have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin 
region. 
  During a ceremony at the "Leoncio Prado" military post at 
the 
end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the 
SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto. 
Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga 
has kept its structure nearly intact. 
  According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major 
attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The 
cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in 
Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been 
entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting 
new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and 
propagandizing SL ideology in the city. 
  The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the SL, but 
there are no indications that it was a mortal one.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Feb (EFE) -- A Shining Path dissident 
faction which rejects the peace agreement proposed by Shining 
Path leader Abimael Guzman has formed the "People's Liberation 
Army" (EPL) [Ejercito Popular de Liberacion], Peruvian police 
reported today. A National Counterterrorism Directorate 
(Dincote) spokesman explained that the EPL has rejected Guzman's 
leadership and claims it is the authentic representative of 
Maoist communism in Peru. 
  Abimael Guzman, arrested in September 1992 and sentenced to 
life in prison, admitted the political and military defeat of 
his organization that took up arms in 1980 and asked Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori to negotiate a peace settlement. 
  According to the spokesman, the EPL leaders are: Alberto 
Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano;" Julio Cesar Mezzich; 
and a third leader whose identity is kept secret by government 
information services. 
  The schism in the Peruvian terrorist band was confirmed in 
documents found by police when they recently arrested a 10 EPL 
members in the San Juan de Lurigancho district in Lima. In the 
documents, the dissidents call Guzman and his followers, "the 
opportunist rightist line" of the Peruvian Communist Party, the 
official name of Shining Path. In other messages, previously 
confiscated in several Peruvian jails, it was also established 
that the Shining Path members who are loyal to their leader call 
the EPL "the leftist execution line," the police source added. 
  According to police, the arrest of the EPL terrorists has 
neutralized the terrorist offensive launched in Lima on 7 
February, when a car bomb exploded next to the Air Force 
headquarters and a bomb was placed next to an Army garrison. 
  The terrorists were arrested in the Cerro "Casablanca" area, 
where they had established a training camp for handling weapons 
and explosives.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Barrantes] </F>
  [Text] Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- Analysts said on Sunday that 
peace negotiations between government envoys and imprisoned 
Shining Path leaders are classified as top secret and only the 
National Intelligence Service has access to the meetings. The 
police, therefore, can only offer contradictory reports that 
confuse public opinion." [quotation marks as received] 
  The government disclosed the "secret nature" of the talks in 
a written response to a request for information by conservative 
Congressman Antero Flores Araoz. 
  Antiterrorist police believe that Shining Path leader 
Abimael 
Guzman's calls for peace from jail have gained "the support of a 
significant portion of the organization. The rebel group is 
about to present the call at a clandestine congress to take 
place somewhere in Lima in April." The same source indicates, 
however, that Guzman managed to bypass the strict controls at El 
Callao Naval Base, where he is serving a life sentence, and 
delivered a document to rebel leader Martha Huatay ordering 
Shining Path to continue the 13-year-old war. 
  The official government reports state that the terrorist 
leader met with other imprisoned leaders of the organization, 
including Huatay, "to get them to submit to his command and join 
the plea for peace." Huatay, according to the police, hid the 
message in her underwear. She managed to pass the message on 
after she and Osman Morote, Shining Path's second in command, 
were returned to the Puno Penitentiary in the Andean mountain 
plains. Police found the message when one of Huatay's relatives 
was trying to smuggle it out of the facility, probably using the 
same method of concealment. 
  Press reports say that for weeks the government has been 
moving those rebel leaders who support the peace process from 
one detention facility to another so they can promote the idea 
freely. 
  According to documents circulating within Shining Path, the 
movement is divided into two factions: the "pacifists," who 
swear loyalty to Guzman, and "the hard-liners." The latter 
formed the "new reconstituted direction" that replaced the 
leader following his arrest in September 1992. 
  The "hard-liners" deny that Guzman wants peace. Police 
sources reported that their rivals are Oscar Ramirez and Teresa 
Durand -- nicknamed the "porfidios or perfidos" which was 
derived from the aliases of Feliciano and Doris. They were tried 
for rebellion and given life sentences by a military court in 
1993. 
  According to the "hard-liners," Elena Iparraguirre (Guzman's 
companion), Edmundo Cox, and Maria Pantoja, who are also serving 
life sentences, are the current leaders of the "pacifists." 
During a recent visit to one of the jails in Lima, President 
Alberto Fujimori and Edmundo Cox shook hands before reporters. 
  The Peruvian opposition has repeatedly demanded that the 
government inform the people about the negotiation process in 
order for public opinion to stay abreast of developments and 
thus clear all doubts surrounding the talks and deny the growing 
rumors that "Guzman is trying to secure a pardon and his release 
into exile."

  [Text] Lima, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The "Sunday Review" television 
program said that according to a "very reliable source," the end 
of the "popular war," the surrender of weapons, and a general 
amnesty, would be the main points of a peace agreement "without 
victors or vanquished," between the Shining Path and the 
Peruvian Government. 
  The administration of President Alberto Fujimori has 
admitted 
that talks, led by Abimael Guzman who has been serving a life 
sentence since October 1992, are being held between government 
representatives and Shining Path leaders in prison. No details, 
however, have been issued on discussions or possible agreements. 
  According to the "Sunday Review" program, directed by 
journalist Nicolas Lucar on the Lima America Channel 4 
Television Network, the 10-point agreement says its main aspect 
is to "stop the popular war with its four forms of fighting: 
terrorism, selective murders, sabotage, and armed agitation and 
propaganda." 
  Another point refers to "dismantling the People's Guerrilla 
Army with their surrender and the destruction of their weapons." 
It also includes the self-dismantling of the people's committees 
and the Shining Path's support base throughout the country. 
  A general amnesty has been mentioned and a process whereby, 
"little by little and in accordance with the circumstances, 
prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released and 
their sentences reduced." 
  Together with the "improvement of relations between both 
parties," it is also stressed that the agreement would be 
without "conquerors or vanquished," and would ease the way for 
the return of those Shining Path members living abroad "in order 
to recover the country's social and normal life." 
  The agreement would entail a "cessation of hostilities 
toward 
relatives of Shining Path members" and "the movement's archives, 
library, museum, and other symbols would also be returned." 
  One of the points in the agreement mentions the need for 
"economic support and investments in the areas devastated by the 
war." So far, government authorities have not denied or rejected 
the accuracy of this agreement between the government and 
Shining Path.

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont has urged President 
Alberto Fujimori to repeal controversial Legislative Decree No. 
776 so that the municipality can complete all projects awarded 
in bids before 1995. Otherwise, he said, the president must 
assume this responsibility. 
  [Begin recording] [Belmont] I am calling on the government 
to 
carry out these projects. I also want to challenge the 
government: If Legislative Decree No. 776 is repealed, I will 
complete and dedicate all promised projects before 1995 is over. 
If the municipality does not carry out these projects, then the 
government must do it, because these funds belong to Lima 
citizens. The people of Lima have made great efforts to pay 
their taxes to complete these works, which will help Lima become 
the great city we all dream of and want to see. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility of charging 
the government if it does not carry out the projects already 
under way? 
  [Belmont] If the government refuses to carry out the 
projects 
already awarded and behaves like a dog in a manger, which does 
not eat nor lets anyone else eat -- not the mayor, because in 
this case he is not pocketing the funds -- Lima will lose, 
because the government does not want Lima to be successful. [end

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 10 
February. 
  Carlos Montoya, Commission for Promotion of Private 
Investment executive director, said the state earned $526 
million from the privatization of state-owned enterprises in 
1993. He added, however, that $252 million remain to be 
collected. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 6) 
  A European banking group made up of the General Bank of 
Belgium, the Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur, the Banque 
Indosuez, and the Banque Nationale de Paris has agreed to grant 
a $115 million loan to the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. The 
fund will be earmarked to increase copper production and develop 
environmental control projects. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 24 
Jan 94 p B1) 
  The National Institute of Statistics and Information Science 
reported that the consumer price index was 1.8 percent in 
January compared with December's 2.5 percent. The January index

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 12 Feb (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported today, Saturday, that Alvaro Solano, a Colombian 
guerrilla leader also known as "El Guajiro," who is considered 
to be one of the chiefs of the Maoist dissidents from the 
Popular Liberation Army (EPL), was captured today in Neiva, 
capital of Huila Department (in the south). 
  The sources added that "thanks to some information," police 
arrested "El Guajiro" at Los Garzones airport in Neiva as he 
prepared to board a domestic flight. The EPL dissident rebel, 
who did not want to sign the peace agreement with the government 
in January 1991, is being interrogated today by authorities. 
  Solano or "El Guajiro" is accused of rebellion, association 
with criminal intent, and terrorism, among other charges. 
  Last 29 January, authorities captured another rebel from 
that 
group in Cartagena de Indias (in the north) called Guido Meneses 
Ruiz, the alleged author of the murder of 50 former members of 
his organization who rejoined civilian life through the EPL 
agreements in 1991.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin in Washington </F>
by unidentified station reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] We greet Colombian Foreign Minister 
Nohemi Sanin Posada, who is in Washington. Good morning, 
Foreign Minister. 
  [Sanin] Good morning. We are very sad over the loss of our 
ambassador to Honduras [Lucelly Garcia Montoya]. Words cannot 
describe the cowardly assassination of this great patriot who 
was our ambassador. 
  [Reporter] What official information do you have about it? 
  [Sanin] It is being investigated. She was a woman who served 
the country. She prepared the visit of the Honduran president 
[words indistinct]. She traveled quickly from Honduras to 
prepare it and asked us for leave to organize [words indistinct] 
all her personal matters. I awoke very saddened with the news 
that she had been killed. I am really very sad with the news. 
  [Reporter] Did she tell you that she had been threatened? 
  [Sanin] No, she never did, but she did tell me that she had 
never been happier than with this appointment. She said that 
for a long time [words indistinct] and she was happy. I have 
never seen someone so pleased, devoted to her job, and with 
great spirit. She knew well international affairs because she 
had been a member of the Chamber of Representatives' Second 
Commission. She was very knowledgeable in her field. She was 
good with little details [words indistinct] people. She was 
truly an important person for Colombia because of her knowledge 
of the field. She was a great woman. 
  [Reporter] That is how all Colombians are feeling. By the 
way, what are you doing in Washington? 
  [Sanin] Well, I am holding bilateral talks with the State 
Department. I will be meeting with Mr. Watson and Ambassador to 
the OAS Babbitt. I plan to talk with the 34 ambassadors to the 
OAS. I am talking about the possibility of President Gaviria's 
candidacy [to OAS secretary general] and about [words 
indistinct] the course that the OAS should take. The president 
has been receiving opinions not only about the vote but also 
about the OAS philosophy to see if these opinions agree with the 
president's view of what the OAS should be. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the debate that has 
arisen 
over the differences of opinion between the State Council and 
the president over the presence of U.S. soldiers in our country? 
Do you think all this debate, which many think has weakened the 
president in Colombia, can jeopardize Cesar Gaviria's candidacy 
for OAS secretary general? 
  [Sanin] No, I really do not think so. The fact is that in 
Colombia we are in the middle of an election campaign. For 
example, there are people who say there are Marines in Colombia 
as if it were not known that those are members of a Marine 
infantry corps which many times has been used as assault troops. 
As you said, military engineers or soldiers (?came). I totally 
agree with the president's viewpoint. I also totally agree with 
the defense minister in his explanation that perhaps the 
ministry did not provide good information about these military 
engineers. What is really going on? What must the country be 
told? Military members always train. They always undertake 
simulations of possible occurrences. When these actions are 
carried out with other countries, some of them are covered by 
international treaties. There is cooperation, technology is 
provided, and projects are carried out to train and to simulate 
situations that might occur, for example, an air attack. Then 
they would carry out air cooperation operations. For example, 
there is the Unitas exercise, which is staged in the territorial 
sea of various countries and all the navies agree to simulate a 
naval attack. On land, the engineers simulate circumstances and 
instead of building barricades or useless structures, they train 
by quickly building a school, a road, or a health center to show 
how quickly this can be done jointly through cooperation. In 
this way, they can show how our engineers and the engineers from 
the United States, in this case, can work quickly and resolve 
problems by simulating specific operations. 
  I think there was a shortage of information on the part of 
the government but I do not think that sovereignty was harmed in 
any case. The Colombian Armed Forces have always been in 
control of sovereignty. We have always acted in keeping with 
the principles of international agreements. [Words indistinct] 
information and a political use of the electoral situation in 
Colombia. I think the State Council has not condemned anyone 
because it has declared itself [word indistinct] and has 
remitted the circumstances to the Commission of Charges, but I 
am sure that with the explanations that the government has given 
based on international treaties and the military cooperation 
agreements, and the explanations that the government has 
obviously [words indistinct] internationally will be understood 
because all the countries of America and the world have 
international cooperation agreements. Through them, they 
jointly simulate situations that might occur and they work on 
training for them. It is like target practice, building a 
retaining wall, like any training that must take place because 
of military, security, or other circumstances. For example, in 
the area of radar, we do not have the required technology so the 
military engineers train the Colombian engineers. We cannot 
confuse this with sovereignty. 
  [Reporter] Madam Minister, was the Foreign Ministry 
consulted? Did you agree from the start with the presence of 
those U.S. soldiers in our country? 
  [Sanin] The Foreign Ministry did not have to be consulted. I 
was not consulted because this was based on existing treaties. 
Then, I would have to be consulted every day because every day 
[words indistinct] building (?naval) schools for example. Among 
the existing agreements.... [pauses] My staff would have to 
consult with the Senate and the State Council if it is meeting 
[word indistinct] the joint operations that have been agreed on 
with different countries. The Foreign Ministry was not 
consulted, nor do I think from a legal standpoint that the 
Foreign Ministry should have been consulted. These are normal 
training operations that are conducted, I repeat, to rehearse 
situations that may arise and allow our military engineers to 
resolve them quickly. Building a [word indistinct] quickly and 
effectively. That is what they are doing. 
  [Reporter] In reacting irately yesterday to the State 
Council 
position, President Gaviria defended the war on drugs, and 
(?almost) called those who disagree with him enemies of that 
war. My question is this: Why were the people not told from 
the start: soldiers are coming because they are cooperating in 
the war on drugs? Why didn't the government say what it was 
instead of something else that led to this controversy? 
  [Sanin] I think a mistake was made how the information was 
given. Part of this whole cooperation is the war on drugs. It 
is not the only thing, because they practice operations to face 
different kinds of circumstances, namely, the war on crime or 
defense of national security. Why did the president respond 
irately? Because [words indistinct] to be told that national 
sovereignty was violated. He is responding in proportion to the 
circumstances. The accusation is very grave, and we feel that, 
based on solid legal arguments and the existing military 
agreements, these exercises could be conducted without 
requesting the permission of the Senate or the State Council. 
Now, I share the defense minister's view that the country 
should have been told in a normal manner that U.S. military 
engineers were coming to participate in such and such training 
and operations. 
  On the other hand, we cannot comment on all military 
operations. Imagine, how could we fight crime if we were to 
announce that in such and such place a cooperation operation was 
going to be.... [pauses] that a telecommunications apparatus to 
monitor voices was located in such and such place. 
Technological cooperation to combat crime would not be 
effective then. These operations have to be kept secret and 
guarded by the military. The Foreign Ministry knew that for 
over 30 years these joint operations have been conducted. The 
Foreign Ministry has never been informed because they fall 
within a legal framework and treaties. I do agree with the 
president and the defense minister that the topic should be 
handled differently, and that the initial information given.... 
[pauses] They were not prepared for the question, certainly, 
and it was incomplete. They did not explain as they have now 
that these are training exercises. Instead of [words indistinct] 
building roadblocks that served no purpose, the military 
engineers are building a school, or a road, or anything to be 
able to efficiently build what may be necessary for a specific 
event. 
  [Reporter] The Council of State president's reaction to 
President Gaviria's position in the sense that the Council of 
State statement endangers international cooperation against drug 
trafficking was: Were they building a school or struggling 
against drug trafficking? My question is: Have you just 
confirmed that there is an operation against drug trafficking in 
Juanchaco? 
  [Sanin] Look, the activities in Juanchaco are related to 
cooperation in military engineering. There have been joint 
exercises simulating possible situations that include quickly 
and efficiently constructing facilities to handle specific 
situations related to drug trafficking crimes. Instead of 
wasting time building a barricade or a useless road, they are 
building a school and a health center for the community. 
  Within the cooperation agreements I have mentioned, 
obviously 
many are part of international cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. Why? Because fortunately today 
Colombia is not struggling alone. All recent successful 
actions, which fortunately have been recognized by the 
international community, have been carried out with technology 
from other countries, from several countries, that have made 
available to us equipment to track down the voices and locate 
the place where drug traffickers or kidnappers are hiding or to 
deal with situations that really endanger our national 
sovereignty, security, or citizens' lives. 
  There are no contradictions. They were in an operation 
involving military engineering and joint training. Both our 
military engineers and U.S. engineers were training together in 
harmony, learning how to quickly build facilities that could be 
necessary under a given circumstance, such as building a road, a 
base, and many other aspects a country may need for its defense. 
This joint training is based on existing agreements. Our 
engineers are acquiring new skills to build facilities quickly. 
They have experience and must practice, just as they jog, fly 
planes, or practice target shooting every day. It is part of 
their training to prepare them for the struggle against crime 
and drug trafficking, and to defend our national security and 
people's lives. There are so many circumstances we may have to 
face. There have been no lies, and there is no contradiction. 
The information was initially incomplete. 
  [Reporter] With regard to doing an efficient and quick job, 
yesterday, a group of journalists invited by the Defense 
Ministry visited the projects under construction by a group you 
described as military engineers in Juanchaco, and found out that 
the projects are incomplete and will not be completed before 28 
February, the date when U.S. soldiers and military engineers 
must leave the country. Does this mean their stay in our country 
will be extended? Definitely, they will not be able to meet the 
deadline. The supervisors have said that they will not have 
enough time between now and 28 February to efficiently and 
quickly complete their work. 
  [Sanin] Training means learning to do a job. I do not know 
if they are doing a good, bad, or fair job. That must be 
determined by the supervisors of the military engineers who are 
being trained, and the defense minister. The Defense Ministry 
must decide when they will leave. The decision must be made 
within the legal framework. I do not know if they will be able 
to complete the work they began. I hope they can. In any event, 
they are participating in a training program. When journalists 
are being trained, I do not know if their performance is good, 
bad, or fair. I know they must be trained, because they are not 
going to be asked to do a program without any training. This is 
a military training program during which facilities are being 
built for the benefit of the community. If they are not able to 
complete the work before they leave, at least they started it, 
and the community can do the rest. It was not a waste of time, 
no useless walls or roads were built. The training was an 
opportunity to build facilities for the benefit of the 
community, which in my opinion was good. Since they were going 
to learn how to build quickly, it would have been silly to build 
a barricade that would serve no purpose instead of a project 
that will benefit the community. 
  [Reporter] Madam Minister, the president of the Republic 
during a news conference yesterday upheld or upholds that the 
Council of State statement is a political statement. You have 
also said that in all these circumstance there is a political or 
politically biased climate. Is it not strange for those 
accusations to be made against the top body of administrative 
justice in Colombia given that the ruling was unanimous. The 
authors of that measure were 26 justices: 14 Liberal Party and 
12 Conservative Party members. 
  [Sanin] I have not seen the ruling, I have only seen the 
press communique that does not contain the legal arguments most 
certainly included in the ruling. I remove myself from the 
Council of State position, with all due respect, as this is the 
institution at the highest level on this issue. I totally 
remove myself because all these military cooperation agreements 
are contained within a legal framework established in agreements 
and treaties that have been in force for more than 30 years. 
  I want to repeat, however, I have only seen the press 
communique. I remove my myself from its concept because all of 
these military exercises are undertaken in all the nations 
within the same legal framework as ours; they do not attack 
sovereignty. [Words indistinct] meaning of something very 
important that should be known; transit and stationing of 
troops. By international law, a nation can lose its state of 
neutrality when it allows the transit or stationing of foreign 
troops to mobilize against a third nation. Therefore, the nation 
that allows that transit, that stationing loses its state of 
neutrality. We are not faced with any war situation with any 
neighboring nation or with the stationing of hostile troops. 
They are simply, as I said, training. They are training during 
military cooperation exercises in addition to cooperating in the 
struggle against drug trafficking and other crimes. That is the 
truth, that should have been said since the beginning. 
  [Reporter] In another turn or events, Madam Minister, the 
Venezuelan foreign minister has just said that Colombia and 
Venezuela could reach an agreement any moment now on the 
limitation of maritime and submarine areas. Do you agree? 
  [Sanin] There are some negotiating committees appointed by 
the nation made up of Colombians who are politically well-known 
and very well informed on the matter. I have hopes that one day 
we will find the solution to the limitation of the maritime 
areas. It is impossible, however, to give a date. What is 
important is to reach a balanced decision, accepted by both 
nations, convenient for both nations, thereby solving this 
conflict. It is very difficult to know when. However, my 
intentions are geared toward finding a solution.

  [Text] Andres Pastrana Arango, presidential candidate for 
the New Democratic Force Party, assured today that President 
Cesar Gaviria and his advisers were very strict in their 
interpretation of the Constitution with regard to sovereignty. 
He recommended, however, that the president meet with the 
Foreign Relations Commission. Here is what Andres Pastrana 
Arango said: 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] The president, for whom I have 
all 
due respect, should have met with the foreign relations advisory 
commission to clear up the situation. In my opinion, it still 
is not too late, because if international treaties currently in 
force are used as an argument, the honorable members of that 
body can offer ideas on how to avoid personal traumas as well as 
call off the process at the commission to investigate charges. 
[end recording] 
  I have not given my opinion at the last minute [words 
indistinct] Pastrana Arango said, recalling that at the given 
time he had spoken out on the issue.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Liberal Party </F>
presidential hopeful Humberto de la Calle Lombana by Dario 
Arizmendi; from "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] Today we greet Dr. Humberto de la Calle 
Lombana, one of the Liberal Party's presidential hopefuls and a 
former government minister under President Cesar Gaviria. What 
is your position on the Council of State decision regarding the 
conduct of President Gaviria and the presence of U.S. troops in 
our country? Good morning, Dr. Humberto de la Calle. 
  [De la Calle] Good morning, Dario. I am pleased to greet 
you. 
  [Arizmendi] The same here, sir. 
  [De la Calle] I can tell you the following: I criticized the 
little school episode because it was poorly handled. I believe 
that what the country deserved was to be told the whole truth 
right away, however I also want to tell you that I do not agree 
with the decision Council of State decision because I do not 
believe the Constitution has been violated. I share the belief 
that an international treaty is being applied here. We are not 
talking about a wartime situation or the presence of foreign 
troops here but of joint maneuvers aimed at improving Colombia's 
response capabilities in the area of security and the fight 
against crime. I believe there is a precedent. All Latin 
American countries conduct these type of joint exercises. 
Colombia has been holding them for the past 30 or 40 years. I 
believe the Council of State decision endangers all possible 
military cooperation in matters of security and the fight 
against drug trafficking. 
  Among other things, we not only receive military support, 
but 
also judicial support. This excess of nationalism only benefits 
criminals, drug traffickers, and the guerrillas. I do not share 
the positions of the Council of State. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, do you believe 
this decision made by the Council of State can seriously 
endanger the candidacy of President Cesar Gaviria for the post 
of OAS secretary general. 
  [De la Calle] I frankly hope the congress, which will review 
his conduct, will bear in mind what we have pointed out with the 
interpretation, which I believe is the correct one. I hope it 
will clear up this incident, which is naturally disturbing for 
the president and for Colombia.

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said today he was surprised 
when President Cesar Gaviria said U.S. troops are in the country 
supporting the antidrug-trafficking struggle. De Greiff added 
he opposes this help. 
  De Greiff, known for his hard position against drug 
traffickers and the strongest persecutor of Pablo Escobar, the 
dead chief of the Medellin Cartel, said: "I do not believe we 
need the help of foreign troops to fight drug trafficking; we 
have done more than any other country to fight it and have never 
needed their help." 
  De Greiff also said he "had absolutely no idea" the U.S. 
soldiers were helping the Colombian Armed Forces in the 
antidrug-trafficking struggle. "I do not like to be lied to," 
the prosecutor general added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The confrontation between President Cesar Gaviria 
and the State Council is the main news story today. The State 
Council members will hold a special meeting today at 0900 in 
Santa Fe de Bogota to discuss in detail the speech delivered by 
President Gaviria yesterday at noon and rebroadcast by 
television at 2000 last night. Caracol interviewed State 
Council President Amado Gutierrez during the past few hours. 
Here is his statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The president obviously has 
his 
own criteria, which we respect, but the State Council does not 
share his views. After thoroughly reviewing the situation--not 
only yesterday during an eight-hour meeting but for the past 20 
days--we reached a different conclusion. We believe our opinion 
is as respectable as the one the president has just expressed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] President Gaviria has said the State 
Council's position is political and very vague, which apparently 
was the reason why he was so upset. 
  [Gutierrez] Regarding our opinion as being political, I must 
say this subject concerns our national sovereignty and the 
constitutional system we have had since 1991. From that 
viewpoint, we could say the matter is political, based on the 
old concept that politics is the art of governing people the 
best way possible. It is political in that sense, not in the 
sense the word politics is usually meant; in other words, it is 
a political opinion, because it regards the Constitution. 
  Regarding our opinion as being vague, we believe a lengthy 
report is not necessarily more precise. I believe if we clearly 
present in two pages a situation actually occurring in the 
country, it should be enough. 
  [Reporter] How does the State Council view President 
Gaviria's position on this case, considering the situation of 
international cooperation in the antidrug-trafficking struggle? 
  [Gutierrez] I do not see why we should associate a statement 
from the State Council with the antidrug-trafficking struggle. 
First, the public in general was informed about a community 
assistance project and the construction of a school and a health 
center; after that, military exercises were mentioned, and 
recently the topic is being linked to drug-trafficking problems. 
Within that line of thought, we do not know where this is going 
to end. 
  We are respectful of the government functions and policy in 
dealing with crime in general; we respect that. Nevertheless, 
we do not see why this matter should be linked to that subject, 
as it was only mentioned superficially in the document we 
received from the president. 
  In our opinion, this is basically a legal problem. According 
to the Constitution, approval by the Senate, which was in 
session on 29 October 1993 when the agreement was signed, was 
necessary. During the time the Senate was not in session, the 
State Council's previous authorization was necessary. It is 
strictly a legal problem. Any other incidental considerations 
concerning the policy against crime is totally irrelevant to the 
subject. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Azuzena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] After a nine-hour session, the State Council issued 
a six-line communique this afternoon stating their decision not 
to comment on what they described as an affront by the 
president. They announced their intention to leave the 
investigation of the military troops in Juanchaco in the hands 
of the appropriate authorities and to let the public make up its 
own mind about the president's reaction to the Council's 
decision on the presence of foreign troops in Colombia.

  [Text] [Announcer] Our reporter Dario Hoyos is talking with 
President Cesar Gaviria at the presidential building. Come in, 
Dario. 
  [Hoyos] President Gaviria, I can see you are very upset with 
the Council of State. In light of the ongoing political 
campaign, don't you think that this issue, which could turn into 
a confrontation between the executive and the judicial branches, 
will prove detrimental for the country? In addition, could it 
be that your election plans for the OAS are being thwarted? 
  [Gaviria] I will not discuss the last portion of your 
question. I know the State Council does not think along those 
lines. Anyway, we did not discuss it. I am concerned about 
what the Council of State did and the lack of specific legal 
documentation. If we were talking about a judicial ruling, it 
would be easier to study and consider the scope of what 
happened. But we are dealing with an opinion, a simple 
statement. I am not looking for trouble but I (?stick) to my 
convictions and do not allow myself to be intimidated by any 
decision or argument. I fight for the things I believe in. But 
I am not upset. I normally do not get upset, but my convictions 
are strong. What you are hearing indicates firmness of 
conviction. I think the legal arguments that we sent to the 
Council of State are valid.

  [Text] We have learned that President Cesar Gaviria made 
the defense minister responsible for responding to the State 
Council's concern about the presence of U.S. military engineers 
in Juanchaco. 
  It has been said that the president has played down the 
issue, and that he let a colonel, who is also an attorney, draft 
the response letter. 
  What happened to the people who advise the president on 
issues as delicate as this one?

  [Text] During a ceremony in which Police Director General 
Octavio Vargas Silva submitted the final report on the 
modernization of his organization, President Cesar Gaviria took 
the opportunity to say he never intended to offend the State 
Council. He then said he considers the debate generated by the 
presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco Ladrilleros and Bahia 
Malaga to be over and done with. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] Yes, undoubtedly, in the wake of 
the State Council's statement yesterday, what could be called a 
controversy has now ended. I did not intend to offend the State 
Council, and I do not believe I did offend the council. What I 
did was defend a legal position -- an interpretation of the 
Constitution -- and to respect Colombia's international treaties 
and their development, which I consider essential. I consider 
this essential not for the president or his position, but for 
the professionalization of the Armed Forces and for 
international cooperation in efforts to counter drug 
trafficking. [end recording] 
  During the same ceremony, former Police Director General 
Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla for the first time appeared in 
public wearing civilian clothes.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo has reiterated that 
the Cali Cartel has promoted the campaign against the presence 
of U.S. troops on the Pacific coast to keep them out of the 
country. Miriam Ortiz has the report. 
  In his latest speeches, President Cesar Gaviria always 
linked 
the Cali Cartel to the controversy over the presence of U.S. 
military personnel in Juanchaco. 
  The defense minister today reiterated his position, which 
many people are now viewing as plausible. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] When the whole thing began, we 
noticed that drug traffickers were interested in some aspects of 
this scandal. I also think that the debate has had its own 
dynamics, and in many cases it is also a product of some 
people's deep-rooted ideas. We are not discarding the 
possibility that some sectors linked to drug trafficking are 
interested in this situation. [end recording] 
  Pardo also said that as long as applicable international 
agreements are in effect, U.S. troops will continue to come to 
Colombia.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has finally announced his 
counternarcotics policy. He will step up the fight against drug 
consumption in the United States and will give more economic 
support to eradication and substitution of drug cultivation in 
drug- producing countries. Miriam Ortiz has the report on what 
that program means for Colombia. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] President Bill Clinton's new 
counternarcotics program has four fundamental objectives. The 
first is to reduce demand. This is the most important goal of 
the new strategy. Budgets for prevention, treatment, and 
education programs will be increased. The second objective is 
to reduce drug-related violence. The U.S. Government will 
appoint 100 policemen to prevent crime in the streets [as heard] 
and will ask Congress to pass more controls and requirements on 
gun ownership. The third objective is to reject the 
legalization and decriminalization of illegal drugs. The fourth 
is to request international cooperation. 
  According to the drug czar [Lee Brown], the U.S. Government 
will continue to be a strong ally of countries that have 
demonstrated a political willingness to fight drug trafficking. 
  [Brown, in English with superimposed translation into 
Spanish] It's very important that we do not open our borders to 
the Escobars of the world to bring drugs in at will. That is 
why we will continue our program to ban drugs. 
  [Ortiz] The U.S. Government believes that Colombia has one 
of 
the most successful counternarcotics programs, so its budget 
will not be reduced. 
  [Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington] In 
addition to support for efforts to reduce consumption, the new 
program includes institutional support, which will strengthen 
justice and democratic institutions. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (AFP) -- Carlos Lage 
Davila, vice president of the Cuban Council of State and 
official in charge of economic affairs who is on an official 
visit to Colombia, today rejected charges that Raul Castro has 
links to Colombian drug trafficking, terming these charges a 
"barefaced lie." 
  Lage Davila arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota on Wednesday when 
he held his first meeting with President Cesar Gaviria, Foreign 
Minister Nohemi Sanin, and other senior officials of Colombia's 
economic sector. 
  Today he referred to the statement by a lieutenant of Pablo 
Escobar who pointed to Castro as an alleged participant in the 
drug trafficking of the Medellin cocaine cartel's gunned-down 
capo. Lage said that the discovery of Escobar's secret 
documents and tapes, which were confiscated by the authorities 
following his death in Medellin on 2 December and in which Raul 
Castro is accused of being an accomplice of drug trafficking, 
"is an offense to Cuba." Escobar's secret documents were 
revealed on Monday by the QAP television newscast. QAP aired a 
cassette in which Escobar's lieutenant, known as David, accused 
the Cuban president's brother of being an accomplice by having 
cooperated in covering up drug-trafficking operations. 
  Lage Davila reiterated today that Raul Castro "enjoys great 
prestige and affection from the Cuban people" and he indicated 
that such accusations might be the work of "manipulation by the 
enemies of the revolution" who have tried to implicate the 
island in the scourge of drug trafficking. He emphasized that 
"the Cuban revolution has maintained unyielding ethical and 
moral values throughout its history. Neither drug trafficking 
nor corruption, that is why we do not have the least concern 
with that," he stressed. 
  During his visit to Santa Fe de Bogota, the Cuban Council of 
State vice president also held meetings with Agriculture 
Minister Jose Ocampo and directors of the National Planning 
Department. Today, he will hold meetings with Foreign Trade 
Minister Juan Manuel Santos, Health Minister Juan Luis Londono, 
and Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas. At the 
Colombian Foreign Ministry, he will analyze the documents on the 
composition of the joint Colombian-Cuban commission, the 
creation of which will be signed in Havana between 16 and 18 
February. 
  Lage Davila, who returns to Cuba tonight, explained that 
with 
the opening to foreign capital, there are no restrictions on 
investment, especially in areas in which infrastructure already 
exists and good results can be obtained in the short term. He 
stressed that in Colombia's specific case, tourism and the 
pharmaceutical industry open doors to new sectors susceptible to 
awakening interest among Colombian-Cuban businessmen. Regarding 
Cuba's foreign debt to Colombia, he said it will be canceled 
gradually with Cuban pharmaceutical exports. 
  He said Cuba is looking toward the Caribbean and Latin 
America, where it is seeking to diversify the offer of Cuban 
products. He also said his country is ready for more difficult 
moments as a result of the U.S. blockade. 
  Cuba and Colombia renewed diplomatic relations in October 
after a more than 12-year suspension. The Colombian Government 
of then President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala had broken relations 
after it was reported that the Cuban Government was lending 
training and support to the Colombian guerrillas.

  [Text] Economic opening in Cuba continues to be one of the 
Cuban Government's greatest challenges. Colombia is a good 
example for them in this field. That is why Carlos Lage Davila, 
vice president of the Council of State and visible head of 
Cuba's policy, has come to Colombia. 
  Lage also is responsible for the economic policy of Fidel 
Castro's government. His proposal to rescue the island from 
economic backwardness after holding relations with socialist 
countries for more than 30 years can be summed up as follows: 
  [Begin Lage recording] We must seek new markets, open the 
door to capital investment, and develop new economic activities 
for the country's future. [end recording] 
  Lage added, however, that tourism, one important aspect of 
the economic opening that is being discussed with Colombian 
industrialists, is not for all Cubans. 
  [Begin Lage recording] It is true we have given 
international 
tourism priority status. The country is going through a 
difficult situation. Consequently, we must build facilities, 
incur expenses, and make sacrifices to bring in foreign 
currency. [end recording] 
  The official said that the Cuban opening is straightforward 
and that soon the world's markets will be handling Cuban 
products other than sugar and tobacco.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections 
scheduled for 8 May 1994: Liberal Party [PL] presidential 
hopeful Humberto de la Calle Lombana has said "now is the time 
for social issues." He has visited Popayan, Cauca Department, to 
learn firsthand how the country's economic situation is 
affecting the lives of poor people. He has said his 
administration would focus on eradicating poverty. In 
Santander, he has proposed the creation of more mobile counter- 
guerrilla battalions, because "they are more effective and cost 
less." He has also proposed "exerting pressure on the Prosecutor 
General's Office to continue fighting impunity through the 
creation of judicial mechanisms." De la Calle has also proposed 
a reduction in military operation costs. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 31 Jan 94 p 8) 
  PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos was the center of a 
polemic yesterday for using inappropriate language when 
referring to the manner by which his party is being treated. 
His remarks sparked many reactions, but Lemos did not express 
regret about using such language; on the contrary, he said he 
wanted "to call the attention of other PL members," because he 
believes "Liberalism is in decline." He said: "I publicly said 
what everybody is commenting in private. The party is in bad 
shape, and it is going to lose power if it does not change. It 
is sad to see a PL congressman lose his seat every week." 
Otherwise, he added if the party does not react, the country 
could identify with other candidacies such as Andres Pastrana's 
[Conservative Party presidential hopeful]. Meanwhile, PL 
President Julio Cesar Turbay has refrained from commenting on 
Lemos' remarks, saying he "will take no reprisals." Ernesto 
Samper, another PL presidential hopeful, said Lemos' position is 
"unfair," and Ernesto Parejo Gonzalez, a PL dissident and 
presidential hopeful, said Lemos "has no authority to make those 
remarks, because he is a member of the party he criticizes." 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 6A) 
  Treasury Overseer Jorge Garcia Hurtado ordered a 30-day 
freeze yesterday on 94.549 billion pesos of the national budget 
to prevent several congressmen who are seeking reelection from 
using funds of the so-called "social investment programs." 
Garcia said by freezing these funds he is "guaranteeing the 
honesty of the March and May elections, because the use of these 
funds to carry out works could influence their outcome." (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 7A)

  [Excerpt] Comptroller General Manuel Francisco Becerra 
Barney has issued one of the most important reports on 
corruption in the country, by pointing out serious 
irregularities and mismanagement of public funds in nearly 100 
state institutions. 
  In a report issued to Congress and also sent to President 
Cesar Gaviria, the comptroller indicated that the 
Comptrollership's Fiscal Investigations and Trials Directorate 
has detected approximately 40 billion pesos worth of shortages 
that have not been reimbursed. Of that amount, 27.5 billion 
pesos correspond to public institutions and the central 
government sector and the rest to government-private capital 
enterprises and to state-owned industrial and commercial 
enterprises. 
  The comptroller also indicated that his office will do 
everything possible to seize the assets of 1,100 officials who 
committed irregularities in handling funds. The report also 
demanded that those officials present themselves to the Treasury 
to return the funds before the appropriate authorities intervene. 
  The institutions mentioned include several ministries and 
administrative departments. The most often mentioned ministries 
are defense, health, education, and finance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The OAS/UN international civilian mission vigorously 
denounces the massacre of the young men in Carrefour Vincent on 
the night of 2-3 February. According to the earliest evidence 
uncovered in the inquiry being conducted by the mission, a group 
of unidentified, heavily armed individuals, at around 0100, 
invaded a house that sheltered at least 10 people. It seems that 
after they had blocked the access roads, the attackers launched 
teargas and grenades into the building, thus forcing the 
occupants to leave the place. Armed individuals then began 
shooting, fatally injuring at least six persons. Several 
occupants who were present at the time managed to escape. 
  The police authorities of Delmas 33 told the mission that 
the 
victims were part of a subversive terrorist organization and 
that the slaughter occurred following a violent quarrel among 
members of this group over a money split. However, according to 
credible testimony communicated to the mission, the victims, 
ranging in age from 20 to 30 years, were activists in political 
organizations in Cite Soleil who, during the month of January, 
were compelled to leave their neighborhood following intensified 
repression. 
  The OAS/UN civilian mission vigorously condemns these 
violations of the right to life and enjoins competent 
authorities to conduct an inquiry so the authors of these crimes 
can be brought to justice.

  [Text] Both the foreign and defense ministries were caught 
by surprise yesterday by President Carlos Menem's comments 
regarding the crimes committed during the Malvinas war. Menem 
said: "Argentina must struggle tirelessly to have those 
responsible for these aberrant acts severely punished." 
  Menem was referring to the preliminary conclusions of the 
British police -- Scotland Yard -- based on the accusations made 
by former Corporal Vincent Bramley regarding abuses and crimes 
committed by the British after the Mount Longdon battle in 1982. 
Another investigation, similar to the British, the conclusions 
of which are being zealously guarded, was also carried out in 
Buenos Aires two years after the first accusation made by the 
former British corporal. 
  In a news conference Menem said, however, that "this 
circumstance will not change in the least the policy we 
implemented regarding relations with Great Britain." 
  Although some officials labeled the comments as a "political 
declaration," that is, for domestic use rather than aimed at the 
British, the president's comments that Argentina must "struggle 
tirelessly to have those responsible for these aberrant acts 
severely punished" put the foreign and defense ministries --for 
different reasons -- in a difficult situation. 
  Just over two months ago in The Hague, in response to a 
British reporter from the DAILY NEWS, Menem said: "At this stage 
of events it would be useful to bury that past once and for all." 
  For diplomats, the president's change of position involves a 
delicate situation in the even more delicate relations with the 
United Kingdom which is under the so-called "umbrella" 
protection. 
  A Foreign Ministry source explained to CLARIN the steps to 
be 
taken from now on: On one side, wait for the final result of 
the Scotland Yard report which has already been sent to public 
prosecutor Barbara Mills who should make a decision next April, 
and on the other, wait for the British reaction to Menem's 
comments. 
  The concern in the Defense Ministry was different. On 7 
February, after CLARIN carried an exclusive publication of the 
content of Scotland Yard's report, Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion held a meeting with the commanders of the three 
branches of the Armed Forces. 
  In the meeting a decision was made that the final report of 
the Argentine commission which carried out an investigation 
questioning former soldiers be submitted to Armed Forces Auditor 
General Brigadier Eugenio Miari "to make a decision on the 
appropriate legal procedures" and to turn it over to the Foreign 
Ministry to decide "on the appropriate actions to be taken." 
  This is like a merry-go-round. The Foreign Ministry says it 
does not know the content of the Scotland Yard report despite 
the fact that its conclusions have been known for 10 days. In 
the Defense Ministry, depending on who is consulted, it is said 
that the final Argentine report is not ready or that it is 
already in the hands of the Armed Forces auditor general. 
  A source who read the Argentine report said "it is 
absolutely 
inconsistent" and that the accusations "cannot be proven or 
denied." Being more sincere, a high official admitted to CLARIN 
that the conclusions of the Argentine report will be held until 
the details of the British report are known.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella by </F>
Mercedes Korin on advertisements about immigration to Argentina 
published in Hong Kong, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Peru; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Korin] Would the Foreign Ministry accept an 
agreement with the PRC? 
  [Petrella] The PRC is growing; its people have a culture 
that 
values hard work, seriousness, and discipline; and I believe 
they can positively contribute to Argentine development. 
  [Korin] Do many immigrants come to Argentina after reading 
advertisements in their country's newspapers? 
  [Petrella] We are seeking to channel requests for residence 
in Argentina through our consulates in Shanghai and Beijing. We 
want to prevent this from becoming an activity that is not 
controlled by the government because this sort of situation can 
lead to abuse, as already has occurred. It recently occurred 
with Peru, for example. Our laws do not establish that a person 
has to pay to enter Argentina. 
  [Korin] Do you know of any similar advertisement in Hong 
Kong? 
  [Petrella] Yes, but our consulate in Hong Kong is always 
informing everyone that Argentina does not charge anything to 
allow people to enter the country, that except for an extremely 
small sum for stamps, admittance is free. 
  [Korin] What about Russia? 
  [Petrella] I can show you a folder with a list of those who 
want to legally come to Argentina. 
  [Korin] How many people are on this list? 
  [Petrella] Nearly 15,000, all of them professionals. In 
addition, 20,000 Rumanians have asked to come to Argentina. 
  [Korin] To mention a migration policy contemplating the 
admittance of Rumanians to Argentina sounds contradictory 
because, so far, no Rumanian has been able to settle here. 
  [Petrella] The problem is that there has been no agreement 
in 
this sense. Argentina is studying the situation and reporting on 
it to Europeans, thus inviting them to fund the migration 
program. 
  [Korin] Is Korean migration still intense? 
  [Petrella] Yes, but Korean migration has been dealt with 
unofficially; there has been no program for it. The Foreign 
Ministry, however, deems it very positive. According to the ROK 
Embassy, nearly 80,000 Koreans are living in the federal capital. 
  [Korin] Most immigrants, however, come from neighboring 
countries that are not as developed as those you have mentioned. 
What happens to those whom the government believes to have 
little "hard-work culture," as you say, and who come from 
countries that do not have a strong economy? 
  [Petrella] They are all hard workers (he laughs). The idea 
is 
not whether the person is coming here to invest. It is whether 
this person will join our working reality and avoid joining 
criminals. 
  [Korin] The government was interested in having East 
European immigrants. Now it leaked that it is holding talks with 
the PRC. How do these migration projects benefit Argentina? 
  [Petrella] The country benefits from migration that 
generates 
services and jobs. They are not entirely destitute and come from 
countries that traditionally export capital and technology. 
History and previous experiences show that if a society receives 
immigrants from countries with a strong economy, part of this 
economy comes with the immigrant. This is partially what 
occurred with Japanese immigration to southern Brazil. The 
immigrants immediately establish links with the mother country 
and this is positive. This has occurred in Argentina with 
relation to Spain and Italy. Regarding East Europe, while the 
other countries offered these countries financial assistance, 
Argentina was the only one to offer them the possibility of 
absorbing part of the migration that the other European 
countries could not absorb. [Foreign Minister] Di Tella said: 
"We offer them la pampa, blue skies, and Argentine land." 
(Petrella stands up and moves his hands). But we were talking 
about people who could support themselves. Argentina is one of 
the few countries in the world that still offers this 
possibility. 
  [Korin] Which other countries do? 
  [Petrella] Australia, New Zealand, Canada -- but to an 
increasingly smaller degree. To a certain extent, South Africa 
does too. 
  [Korin] What does a country need to have an open migration 
policy? 
  [Petrella] It needs space. A country with large free 
territories must fill them up. Not exactly to fill them up but 
to have a more rational occupation of these territories. 
  [Korin] What are the strictest countries in this regard? 
  [Petrella] The European ones. They have even signed an 
agreement to create a common border alround Europe and thus 
limit the number of possible immigrants. Some even say this 
agreement harms the asylum right that was so traditional in 
countries such as Spain and France. The United States is strict 
but has signed agreements and, in general, is a very generous 
country. 
  [Korin] But not only in regard to the space issue. 
  [Petrella] Ask them about that. 
  [Korin] How can we combine the concept that empty 
territories 
must be filled up with the concept some people have that 
immigrants occupy positions that should be occupied by 
Argentines? 
  [Petrella] The thing is as follows: The arrival of people 
with a certain purchasing power creates jobs and services. They 
do not occupy other people's positions. It all depends on the 
immigrant's social and economic level. None of those listed in 
this folder (points out the list of Russians) comes 
empty-handed. I also would like to explain that I bluntly reject 
the concept that there is xenophobia in Argentina. We can say 
that we have job problems, competition problems, labor law 
flexibility problems. Our problems in this field are related to 
labor and not to a xenophobe attitude. 
  [Korin] I am referring to immigrants from neighboring 
countries who come to Argentina without this standard of living. 
Are agreements to be signed with neighboring countries being 
analyzed? 
  [Petrella] No, we are holding permanent talks with these 
countries because most of those who immigrate to Argentina come 
from neighboring countries. Border control is not as strict as 
it should be. Sometimes a person enters the country as a student 
without being one. Perhaps, Argentine laws are too flexible. To 
enter the United States a person must prove that he or she has 
been accepted by a university, in addition to several other 
things. 
  [Korin] Why have 400,000 immigrants failed to make their 
situation legal even after the Argentine Government granted them 
15 months of amnesty? 
  [Petrella] People are usually afraid of legalizing their 
situation. This is a widespread sociological phenomenon, similar 
to the one responsible for people's refusal to pay the value 
added tax, or freelance workers' refusal to register in the 
social security system. People tend to distrust the government. 
Deep inside, there is a cultural distrust about the solidity and 
fairness of our governmental institutions. This is the only way 
we can explain why a person chooses to live in an irregular 
situation.

  [Text] The Standing Committee of the Congress of the Union 
on 9 February condemned the new immigration measures adopted by 
the U.S. Government as well as the intensification of military 
surveillance along the Mexican-U.S. border. The measures 
adopted by the U.S. Government do not solve the illegal alien 
immigration problem. 
  An agreement approved by all political parties called for, 
through the Human Rights and Border Issues Committees, public 
audiences to discuss mechanisms to promote the defense and 
protection of the rights of our fellow immigrant citizens.

  [Excerpt] Melo -- The interior minister has denied rumors 
of possible police mobilizations in demand of better wages and 
other improvements. 
  Raul Iturria stressed that information received from 
throughout the country indicates that nothing like that exists, 
adding that rumors of transfers and retirements in the Coraceros 
Guard are absolutely false. 
  "Transfers, if they exist, are normal within the functions 
of 
the institution. For example, we have the penitentiary security 
service, but this is a normal everyday occurrence. No officer 
of any rank has been transferred, other than those transferred 
for service reasons," he stressed. 
  On 4 February the minister had a very full agenda, first in 
Rio Branco and during the night he visited Melo, where he met 
with Intendant Rodolfo Nin Novoa. He then officially dedicated 
the refurbishment of Urban Precinct No. 1 and gave a news 
conference in the office of the chief of police, Lieutenant 
Colonel Luis A. Esteba, retired. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Ghost of a Military Coup in </F>
Guatemala"] 
  [Text] It was Sunday 30 January, day of the popular 
referendum. For those who opposed the referendum, the decisive 
vote was in the hands of the more than 900,000 members of the 
Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC). Obviously, however, to the 
joy of some and disbelief of others who were close to the 
government and who expected these men to cast yes votes, PAC 
members did not vote. 
  The story on why PAC members did not exercise their right to 
vote began many days earlier. Ranking Army commanders discussed 
the topic at a very secret meeting. The room was heavy with 
tension and uneasiness. Voices sometimes rose, and at other 
times they dropped to a murmur. It was evident that many of 
them were uneasy, angered more by the issue of peace with the 
guerrillas than by the referendum over the legislative reforms. 
  A general with a great deal of influence within the military 
ranks and respected for his past record told the gathering that 
it was impossible to look on while a victorious Army was being 
led to defeat. He was referring to the presidential decision to 
accept the presence of a United Nations representative at the 
negotiating table. 
  Although an attempt was made to disguise this representative 
as a "moderator," the top UN representative -- according to the 
results of the 10 January meeting in Mexico between the 
government and URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] -- 
would be authorized to present peace initiatives, convene 
meetings, observe, and offer advice. All of this, added to the 
fact that the Guatemalan conflict would be placed on the same 
level as the conflict in El Salvador with its truth commission, 
international military verification, liberated areas for the 
guerrillas, and so forth, prompted the exasperation of more than 
a few officers. 
  This panorama finally unified the views of hard-liners and 
officers who, following Serrano's fall, had been removed from 
the Guatemalan Army and who under no circumstances were willing 
to allow diplomacy to destroy the halo of the winners of an 
internal war that has lasted over 30 years. 
  According to confidential information, the destabilizing 
climate of the past few weeks is closely linked to this 
uneasiness, although it is not known which military group is to 
blame. 
  Meanwhile, there was talk of the return of General Ortega 
Menaldo who many expected to be the new chief of the G-2. 
Strings were pulled to place his people in certain key positions 
within the institution and there was talk of isolating the 
officers who aborted Serrano's dream. 
  Although the Army's granite-like unity is frequently 
referred 
to, everyone knows there are three factions: One is formed by 
the soldiers who were removed following Jorge Serrano's coup 
d'etat. The second is formed by the hard-liners, and the third 
is the institutional wing that supports President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio. 
  The second group, although their hard-line inclinations 
concerning the war against the URNG and their conditional 
support for the De Leon Carpio administration are known, would 
be willing to join with the officers who were removed in order 
to regain the initiative in the sphere of armed actions if the 
effort to further involve the United Nations in the Guatemalan 
peace process continues. 
  The first group has taken advantage of this situation. They 
have used this prevailing uneasiness to attempt to look after 
themselves, eager as they are to see the system collapse and to 
regain their positions within the Armed Forces. 
  This is the panorama that was under discussion at that tense 
meeting prior to the popular referendum. 
  Despite their hard-line position, the second group did not 
want to break away from the democratic system either and was 
desperately seeking measures that would return the peace issue 
to its proper level. They knew it was impossible for the 
president to reverse his decision because the international 
community had welcomed the decision to include the United 
Nations in the negotiations. 
  That is why they adopted the drastic measure of "confining 
the PAC's to their quarters" and asking them not to vote. As a 
result of this, the PAC members' relatives also failed to 
exercise their right to vote. 
  The plan's strategists wanted a low voter turnout to prove 
President De Leon Carpio's weakness and fragility and to isolate 
him from the popular sectors who opposed the referendum from the 
beginning. They also wanted to exert stronger pressure on the 
president. Furthermore, the URNG played a role in the overall 
plan: It was supposed to pretend a military coup was being 
plotted against the civilian president. The URNG sought to 
emerge victoriously from a low voter turnout and, as an 
embellishment, provoke concern within the Army with its 
capricious interpretations -- very typical of the framework 
agreement reached in Mexico, which the URNG pledged not to 
reveal but ended up doing so anyway. 
  In addition, a coup d'etat at a time when subversion has 
almost been annihilated would breathe new life into the URNG, 
particularly at the international level, where its position was 
weakened after Serrano's ouster. 
  (Prior to the 25 May 1993 events the international community 
thought the URNG was the only one which had the right to talk 
with the Guatemalan Government, but following Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio's arrival those governments discovered there are other 
groups in Guatemala, which, with due respect for the political 
system and the rules of the game, sought to reform the state and 
its institutions.) 
  Meanwhile, the military measure preventing the PAC's from 
voting also sought to exert even more pressure on President De 
Leon Carpio. His position within the Armed Forces was 
considerably weaker without the people's support on the reforms 
issue. Only a small step separated this from the coup d'etat 
rumors. 
  Once the referendum results were known, rumors about an 
imminent coup d'etat began to spread in editorial rooms, the 
National Palace hallways, the Congress hallways, as well as the 
political parties' headquarters. There was even talk about the 
assassination of a public figure, a wave of assassinations, 
kidnappings, and a chaotic situation that would provoke the 
president's removal. 
  Everything seemed to indicate Vice President Arturo 
Herbruger 
would be De Leon Carpio's immediate successor, which would 
greatly benefit not only Army hard-liners but also those who, 
due to their actions during Serrano's administration, had to 
fall back into the military ranks but were ready to return. 
  According to labor and popular leaders, a military coup 
right 
now would provoke a veritable bloodbath; it would thwart our 
hopes of achieving peace; and it would place us among the most 
backward Latin American nations in the social and economic 
sector. 
  It seems the situation is returning to normal. Two of the 
Armed Forces factions, the institutional faction and the 
hard-liners, have understood that the only option for this 
country is a democratic solution. They have closed ranks around 
the process, setting aside the lowly attitudes of those who have 
been forced out.

  [Text] Quito, 9 Feb (AFP) -- The police have reported that 
five policemen and 20 civilians were seriously injured today as 
a result of street riots by students and workers in this 
capital. Students and factory workers who were protesting the 
71.2-percent increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline 
confronted Army and police units with rocks and Molotov 
cocktails. 
  On Tuesday, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador [Conaie], to which 3.5 million Ecuadorans of the 11 
million who live in this country belong, had initiated an 
ongoing Indian uprising. 
  Last Thursday the powerful United Workers Front, comprised 
of 
the country's most important labor unions, held a national 
strike to demand that the fuel price increase decreed on 28 
January be repealed. 
  Today other popular organizations held an "empty pots and 
pans march" to reject the price increase, arguing that as a 
result of the government's measure food prices have increased. 
  The demonstrators -- including many women carrying posters, 
banners, and kitchen utensils -- gathered near Central 
University and at El Ejido and La Alameda parks in downtown 
Quito and tried to march on the Presidential Palace, shouting 
slogans against President Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  Security forces, with the support of light armored tanks, 
fired tear gas at the crowd to scare away the demonstrators. 
  Conaie has reported that in the Andean province of Azuay, 
310 
km southwest of Quito, the Army fired on a group of Indians, 
wounding eight. 
  A general state of discontent is seizing the provinces of 
Riobamba, Imbabura, and Carchi, on the border with Colombia, 
according to journalists from those regions. 
  Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has cautioned that 
the 
public order will be protected. Official sources have reported 
that approximately 100 people were arrested in Quito for having 
allegedly participated in riots.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated on 7 February 
that if the United States applies trade sanctions against 
Brazil, it will not be due to the Senate's delay in approving 
Draft Law No. 115/93 that regulates industrial property in 
Brazil. 
  According to the minister, the two countries are no longer 
working on the basis that the law will be approved by 28 
February, the date with which the United States is working to 
decide whether it begins a policy of retaliation. 
  Amorim on 7 February met in Itamaraty with Science and 
Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas; Industry, Commerce, and 
Tourism Minister Elcio Alvares; and Culture Minister Luis 
Roberto do Mascimento e Silva. Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, 
president of the Industrial Property National Institute (INPI 
[Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial]); Paulo Tarso 
Flecha, ambassador to Washington; and his colleague, Jose Arthur 
Denot Madeiros, who last week headed a meeting with the U.S. 
Government. 
  The meeting was held on 6 February in order to discuss 
government ideas regarding the topics discussed in Washington. 
The foreign minister's evaluation indicates that the meeting 
with the North Americans was a failure. "There was progress in 
the aspect of wanting to reach an agreement regarding the points 
that merit a more profound study," he said. Amorim said it 
would be "easy" to say that there is not a risk that sanctions 
will be applied, but he considers as "reasonable" the 
expectation that the United States will close the case on 28 
February. The minister is still considering whether he will 
travel to Washington to give the negotiations a political jolt. 
  According to one of the participants in yesterday's meeting, 
it will be difficult to reach an agreement between the two 
countries. The points of disagreement surpass the points on 
which there is agreement. During a news conference on 7 
February, the minister himself cited just one point that the two 
countries have in common: The computer program software 
[preceding word in English] must be protect by authorship rights 
like literary works. The major disagreement lies in the fact 
that the text concerning intellectual property contained in the 
GATT's Uruguayan Round Accord, which closed in December, is 
ambiguous" [no beginning quotation mark as published]. 
  Thus, for example, Brazil understands that the GATT's text 
considers that a patent can only be exploited when the product 
is manufactured locally. But the United States feels the 
opposite -- that the patent can be exploited through imports 
without the obligation of manufacturing the product patented in 
the country. 
  Another disagreement refers to parallel imports: The United 
States wants the patent holder to have the right to block 
parallel imports, in other words, those imports that are made 
without the authorization of the patent holder. The Uruguay 
Round Accord does not mention this point, but the amendment the 
Brazilian Government intends to send to the Senate restricts the 
scope of the type of patent protection the United States wants 
because parallel imports would only be possible between member 
countries of a common market or based on international 
agreements such as Mercosur. This means, for example, that a 
person in Argentina who has the license for a product with the 
patent holder living in the United States could supply the 
product in a parallel form to Brazil without the patent holder's 
direct authorization. 
  There is also disagreement regarding the "pipeline" 
[preceding word in English], or transitory protection. The 
United States wants a "pipeline" [preceding word in English] 
that protects products already patented in other countries and 
already being commercialized for the same period of time for 
which the products are patented in the country of origin. The 
government is going to suggest an amendment to Draft Law No. 
115/93 that will authorize the protection of the "pipeline" 
[preceding word in English] only for those patents that have 
been registered abroad, but not for products that already are 
being commercialized. 
  The Uruguayan Round text does not clearly define the state 
of 
microorganisms and living beings, but the United States 
considers that they should be patentable, giving as examples the 
super tomato that has been developed in a laboratory and the 
Harvard University rat that has been genetically altered [rato 
transgenico de Harvard], which is used to test products against 
mammary cancer. 
  The draft bill indicates that Brazil's position is that of 
granting a patent only for microorganisms (not living beings) 
that are used in industrial processes. 
  The Brazilian Government is trying to close the gap between 
the two countries' positions. Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de 
Lima will continue to be Brazil's contact with the U.S. 
Government. He departed for Washington on 7 February. 
  Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PA [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement 
Party-Para State]) is the new rapporteur for the industrial 
property draft bill. He will try to present his argument on 16 
February to the Senate's Economic Affairs Committee.

  [Text] Today, Defense Minister Rafael Angel Montero Revette 
met with the president and submitted a report on the officers 
currently being tried in connection with the 4 February and 27 
November events so the president can study the information and 
make his final decision concerning a possible stay of 
proceedings. 
  General Montero Revette confirmed he met with the prisoners 
yesterday at the San Carlos Barracks. He said the goal was to 
explain why they are not compelled to request their release, 
adding that this decision could be adopted at will. He also said 
the government has pledged to give them scholarships and 
employment so they may quickly become part of society. The 
scholarships and employment will be given based on their rank 
and work areas. 
  The defense minister confirmed that Yare Prison's military 
annex was definitely closed down; he added that the officers 
being tried in connection with the 27 November and 4 February 
events will not be transferred to Ramo Verde.

  [Excerpt] There are tensions in Paraguayan-U.S. relations. 
The Paraguayan Government today formally rejected the U.S. State 
Department report on human rights violations in our country. 
After meeting with Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez 
Boettner, U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman noted, however, that the 
report is completely objective. 
  The report, which has revealed worldwide that human rights 
continue to be violated in our country, was formally rejected by 
the government. To this end, Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner 
summoned Ambassador Glassman. The details of the rejection have 
not been disclosed because Ramirez Boettner continues to be 
reluctant to answer reporters' questions, and Glassman, for 
diplomatic reasons, declined to elaborate on the subject. He 
displayed, however, his disagreement with our government's 
position because, in his opinion, the report is quite objective.

  [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta has said the 
military truce declared by the Nicaraguan Government, via the 
Army, does not mean there will be a dialogue with the 3-80 
Northern Front rebels. Minister Mendieta has said talks with 
the rearmed 3-80 Northern Front rebels will only be possible 
once they have laid down their weapons and joined civilian life. 
  [Begin recording] [Mendieta] We believe the government has 
been making big efforts in many areas. The government has 
clearly stated it will not negotiate with armed sectors. All 
talks with [word indistinct] only after they have disarmed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] the 3-80 rebels 
must disarm prior to talks with the government? 
  [Mendieta] Once they decide to disarm, and once they begin 
to 
disarm, then we will begin a process of dialogue with them, but 
this will not be a negotiation. We believe an institutional 
response must prevail in this case, and we are willing to 
implement immediately the social plans in that area. Those 
social plans will benefit all the peasants in that area. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Francisco Diez Conseco, peace adviser on </F>
human rights, by Francisco Vidal in the station's studios; from 
the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Vidal] The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] 
this morning approved a draft bill stating that a military court 
will try the La Cantuta case. Francisco Diez Canseco, peace 
adviser and human rights representative, is with us today to 
share his opinion on the legislative body's ruling, which, 
according to some experts, interferes with the judicial branch's 
duties. Good afternoon, Mr. Diez Canseco. 
  [Diez Canseco] Good afternoon. We believe that the draft 
bill approved this morning by the CCD -- that is, by the 
democratic majority -- is unconstitutional because it is 
retroactive and thus violates Article 103 of the Constitution. 
It also interferes with the independence of the judicial branch 
set out precisely in Article 139, Chapter 2 of the Constitution, 
which was approved by a majority of this very same legislature. 
Therefore, we believe it is absolutely essential that the 
president of the Republic himself -- in accordance with Article 
108, which grants him such powers -- assess this law. This is a 
gross violation of the law and should not be endorsed by the 
executive branch. In addition, it seriously damages Peru's 
image to the extent that it implies a cover-up in the La Cantuta 
case. This case should be thoroughly clarified and those 
responsible punished to the full extent of the law. Both the 
Peruvian and international public demand it. 
  An attempt is being made in this case to defend the Armed 
Forces, but instead the institution is being seriously harmed. 
We who have objectively acknowledged the government's efforts 
toward national peace, specifically the Peruvian Armed Forces' 
struggle against terrorism and subversion, want to say on this 
occasion that this law is totally inappropriate for the very 
Armed Forces themselves, aside from the fact that it is 
unconstitutional. As we have said on other occasions, we 
believe La Cantuta is an isolated case that does not imply an 
intentional policy of human rights violations on the part of the 
government. In this case, however, the legislative majority has 
grossly violated the law. This cannot be ratified by the 
government. We hope it will lead to a presidential assessment 
of the law. 
  [Vidal] But Mr. Diez Canseco, considering the close 
coordination between the legislative majority and the president, 
and supposing that this law will be published tomorrow in the 
official newspaper, thereby becoming effective, what will happen 
to Peru's relations with the international community? 
  [Diez Canseco] In my opinion, they will be seriously and 
meaningfully deteriorated, adversely affecting not only the 
government but the entire Peruvian community. This is 
regrettable because the government has made significant efforts 
these past years to correct the errors of past governments with 
an eye to reintegrating Peru into the economic community, the 
international economic community. The Peruvian people have 
cooperated a great deal in this effort with stoicism and 
patriotism. We cannot, therefore, allow a gross violation of 
the law to put at risk a struggle that has cost considerable 
efforts. 
  To this we must add another aspect which, in my opinion, is 
very important. We have already received the report and studies 
issued by Mr. Watson, U.S. under secretary of State for 
Inter-American affairs, during his visit to Peru several weeks 
ago. One of the points that they, the U.S. Government, stress 
is the need for an independent judicial branch. The 
independence of the judicial branch is being violated here. If 
President Fujimori does not assess the law, the Supreme Court 
has the means to prove its independence; that is, by applying 
Article 138 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can enforce a 
constitutional ruling over a legal ruling that violates the 
Constitution. 
  I do not think we have to go to such extremes. I think there 
is a middle road, and the president should resolve this by 
taking that road.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (DPA) -- Several gunmen 
on a highway leading to the Colombian city of Ibague murdered 
Colombian Ambassador to Honduras Lucelly Garcia today. 
  Garcia, 60, had presented her credentials to the Honduran 
Government 14 days ago and had returned to Colombia to present a 
book entitled "Petition for Protection, Opening to Democracy." 
  The police reported the diplomat was traveling from the 
coffee-producing area of Calarca, her hometown, to Santa Fe de 
Bogota in the company of her sister Ruby Garcia, the Colombian 
consul to Mexico, who was injured. 
  Ruby Garcia said a four-wheel drive vehicle blocked the path 
of the car in which they were traveling, and two men came out of 
it, and one of them shot the ambassador, who was taken to a 
clinic in Ibague where she died. 
  The circumstances surrounding the attack on Ambassador 
Garcia 
are unclear. The police said robbery could have been the 
motive, but murder was not ruled out. 
  Garcia, a Liberal, was governor of the western Department of 
Quindio, where Calarca is located. She was also a member of the 
Lower Chamber of the Colombian Congress. She lost her seat over 
a scandal about alleged irregular activities favoring her 
hometown's Culture House. 
  For more than 30 years the diplomat's political life was 
characterized by her combativeness, which was reflected in 
strong speeches, vigorous decisions, and constant clashes with 
her adversaries. 
  Her body will reportedly be taken to Santa Fe de Bogota in 
the next hours for an homage at the Congress of the Republic, 
political friends of the murdered ambassador said.

<F P=106> [Report by Klaus Blume] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 12 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Affairs Minister Bernd Niehaus, who, so far, is the main 
candidate to aspire to the OAS Secretary General seat due to be 
decided on 27 March, has said that after 40 years it is only 
fair that a Central American hold the post. 
  In an interview granted to DPA, Niehaus pointed out: "We 
strongly believe in the principle of juridical equality of the 
states," and he recalled that in the four decades since the OAS 
birth, the secretary generals have always been South Americans. 
  The Costa Rican politician, who is of German descent, added 
that "Costa Rica holds a special place for the OAS because, 
thanks to this organization, we have lived 40 years without an 
Army." He emphasized that it is uncommon for a country, 
regardless of how small it is, to live without an Army. It was 
precisely the OAS which guaranteed the protection of Costa 
Rica's sovereign interests. 
  He described his chances of winning the election at the next 
OAS Assembly in Washington, D.C. as "excellent." He added: "We 
have 23 sure votes and only 18 are required." In addition to the 
six Central American nations and 13 Caribbean countries, he has 
the support of Chile, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, and Argentina. 
  Niehaus doubts those who say the United States opposes his 
candidacy and pointed out: "I sincerely do not believe that the 
United States opposes my candidacy." He believes that what the 
United States could oppose is a break in the tradition of larger 
countries occupying such a high position. He said that this 
would be unfair because all states are equal. According to 
Niehaus, the secretary general does not have to be a former 
president, as in the case of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 
who the White House supposedly favors. 
  The 52-year-old statesman, who has been an international law 
professor for 20 years and foreign minister twice, noted: "I 
think that have a knowledge of international law is more 
important." He believes that some countries are afraid that the 
small nations of the continent would unite to create a so-called 
"mechanical majority" against larger nations. He added that 
"this is stupid because we are not that foolish." 
  Niehaus feels that the most important thing for an 
organization like the OAS to do is "to reach its basic goal: to 
defend democracy." This means that all countries must give 
democracy the special treatment it deserves. He cited Cuba as an 
example. He believes a change toward democracy and respect for 
human rights will soon come to that country. "That change must 
be promoted so that it will be peaceful and nonviolent," he 
said. Niehaus advocates rapprochement with Cuba to promote 
development. In this specific case, which is very different from 
Haiti, he feels the blockade is inappropriate. "Isolation does 
not lead to positive results," the outgoing foreign minister 
concluded.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has described the 
conference entitled, "Cuba and the Exile Community," which will 
be held on 22-24 April in Havana, a test of extreme fortitude. 
Robaina made this statement during his announcement of the 
conference, which will bring together approximately 200 Cuban 
exiles from diverse countries. Robaina also stressed that given 
the difficult situation Cuba faces today, it is time to prevent 
emigration from being a negative factor in the hands of others. 
  "This invitation is an opportunity for Cubans abroad, acting 
in good faith, to express their logical concerns and hopes to 
Cuba. There is no possibility for political manipulation, nor 
space for meddling with hopes that are by nature the sole 
concern of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland. 
There is no room for doubt or speculation. This invitation does 
not include counterrevolutionary organizations, nor does it 
concern itself with the opinions of their kingpins." 
  Robaina added during the news conference, conducted to 
announce the conference: 
  "In the bosom of the exile community there are today sectors 
and organizations separate from the counterrevolution. These 
concur in criticizing the hostile policies toward Cuba, 
particularly, the blockade. They advocate respect for our 
national sovereignty and the normalization of relations, and 
support the Cuban people. In this manner, they contribute to 
creating an atmosphere conducive to advancement. The maturing of 
this process, despite the counterrevolution and those who 
manipulate immigration issues and try to create a schism between 
the exile community and Cuba, confirms that relations with 
Cubans abroad is an issue Cuba is undertaking in a sovereign 
manner and without conditions by foreign interests. The Cuban 
people and their authorities will not be manipulated by 
illegitimate, minority organizations and spokesmen [words 
indistinct] who with the worst of intentions try to represent 
the exile community and speak on its behalf when in reality they 
are tools of anti-Cuban policies moved by petty personal 
interests." 
  Ricardo Alarcon, Carlos Lage, and Abel Prieto, as well as 
Robaina, will participate in the conference, "Cuba and the Exile 
Community."

  [Excerpts] The paper JUVENTUD REBELDE today published an 
article entitled, "What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?" 
in which it sets forth in detail the incidents that occured in 
the vicinity of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana on 10 and 
11 February. [passage omitted] 
  In the chronology and analysis of the incidents, JUVENTUD 
REBELDE points out that on 10 February, rumors began to spread 
through the city of Havana to the effect that the Cuban security 
guards had been withdrawn from the U.S. Interests Section, and 
that people going to the Section's offices were expeditiously 
being awarded visas. During that day, several groups of people 
appeared in the area, headed for the U.S. Interests Section. 
Party officials explained to them that what they heard was 
false, and they desisted. 
  Later, similar incidents occurred, and the custodians asked 
the people to leave because it was all nothing but a 
manipulation by unscrupulous people. The area was cordoned off 
with police barricades. This cordon was later removed, given the 
characteristics of the people who, deceived, were showing up at 
the site. 
  In the chronology published today by JUVENTUD REBELDE, it 
was 
pointed out that on 11 February, however, the human element that 
began showing up at the site changed. Noted was the absence of 
confused people and the presence of lumpen. One man even had a 
knife hidden under his shirt and was arrested. 
  In the afternoon, a crowd of some 60 or 70 people formed, 
among whom a number of agitators were observed. These people 
headed along the Malecon intending to enter the U.S. Interests 
Section's offices. Revolutionaries gathered at the place 
thwarted the attempt. Those believed to be the ringleaders were 
arrested. The police cordon was immediately reestablished. There 
were another two similar disturbances later, but the 
provocateurs failed to achieve their goal. [passage omitted] 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE'S article adds: It is obvious who 
masterminded the incidents. This is how the mechanisms of the 
counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of 
deception and cynicism. It has once again been confirmed that 
the streets of this country belong, and will continue to belong, 
to the revolutionaries. 
  The item states: The economy is in a special period here, 
but 
the dignity and decorum of a people who evidence daily heroism 
will never be. 
  Let what has occured serve as experience for the 
unscrupulous 
authors of the escapade. Never will anyone be able to ride 
roughshod over the Revolution because to do so, he would have to 
ride roughshod over the righteous anger [coraje] and 
determination of us millions of Cubans who place no stock in 
rumors when it is a matter of defending the unity [integridad] 
of the fatherland.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Reporter Orlando Contreras] </F>
  [Text] All human activities -- and foreign policy decisions 
are human -- are subject to error. This obvious premise leads us 
to a thorough analysis of the foreign policy we have implemented 
for more than three decades. We can say that Cuba has never been 
mistaken about the cardinal principles that rule its behavior in 
relation to other nations, states, or governments. Among these 
principles, as a basis of its policy, we can mention a respect 
for truth regardless of circumstance. 
  Over the past few days, on 10 and 11 February specifically, 
certain incidents took place around the U.S. Interests Section 
in Havana, incidents of which our people are well aware, that 
seek to create artificial tension in an effort, through 
manipulation, to counterbalance the growing acceptance by 
international public opinion, governments, and institutions of 
the obvious truth that the blockade against our country is 
unjust, immoral, and not good for anyone's legal interests; that 
it is an obsolete expression of the Cold War, of arrogance, 
intransigence, and intolerance on this, the eve of a new 
century, and is a special challenge for all of mankind. This 
same behavior reflects the biased, unjust, and often 
extortionist attitude of imperialism toward human rights. 
  Cuba has extensively revealed all details as well as its 
interpretation of the incident without any sign of arrogance, 
but on the contrary, with the composure and firmness with which 
it acts in this and other more tense, more complex 
circumstances. Cuba reasserts that the incidents reported and 
publicly analyzed by JUVENTUD REBELDE in its Sunday issue are a 
faithful reflection of the truth. 
  It is not by fomenting violence, by violating the security 
of 
diplomatic or consular offices, or others of similar status, 
that differences or conflicts are solved, nor do we contribute 
to international peace and security. Cuba honors its 
commitments, and faithful to the principles followed by Marti, 
respects the truth. 
  The facts are well known. Those, once against caught 
redhanded, responsible for these actions should reconsider their 
serious misconduct. If they believe they are even partly right, 
they should have no fear of admitting their ideas within the 
framework of equality and mutual respect with which 
international relations treated. On the contrary, they should at 
least have the sense of decency to remain silent, because in 
this case as in others, silence implies consent.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel de la Guardia from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The U.S. State Department is studying the 
possibility of reducing restrictions on trips to Cuba by U.S. 
citizens. No, it is not a question of easing, even slightly, 
pressure exerted on Cuba or of improving relations between 
Washington and Havana. It is only a measure that seeks to 
minimize the violation of U.S. citizens rights by prohibiting 
visits to other countries, in this case Cuba. As is well known, 
measures adopted by the U.S. Government to exert pressure and 
cause economic damage to the Cuban economy include the 
enforcement of severe sanctions on U.S. citizens who travel to 
Cuba in defiance of these restrictions. Obviously, the reported 
attenuation of those restrictions does not include those who 
want to travel to the Pearl of the Antilles as a tourist because 
that would represent income in dollars to the Cuban tourism 
industry. 
  Cuban specialists on international relations believe the 
elimination of certain travel restrictions to Cuba and the 
expedition of possible information exchanges are part of a 
system designed to influence the Cuban civilian society and 
increase its political influence on the island, as was done in 
Eastern Europe. Others believe that, far from contributing to 
the improvement of relations between the United States and Cuba, 
its real purpose is to weaken Cuba's conclusive arguments before 
international organizations, where it has stated the travel 
restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to 
other countries for personal reasons are a violation of their 
human rights. 
  Cuba cannot be accused of extreme mistrust because it has 
only experienced all kinds of aggression from the United States 
for more than 30 years. Besides, Washington officials have made 
it clear they are not interested in making any policy changes 
towards Cuba as long as Cuba does not adopt changes to resemble 
the so-called representative democracies that follow the U.S. 
model throughout the world. Cuba has repeatedly stated it will 
not tolerate this blatant interference in its internal affairs, 
and it cannot accept conditions to establish and maintain 
diplomatic relations, or other types of relations, with another 
sovereign state. 
  If the United States eliminates or reduces restrictions on 
its citizens so they may travel to Cuba, even with the provision 
that they do not to contribute in any way to the Cuban economy, 
this would be another step towards reason and wisdom. Cuba has 
many friends in the United States and has always been happy to 
receive visitors from all nations, whether they sympathize with 
Cuba or not, if they want first-hand knowledge of the real Cuban 
situation. The Cuban Revolution has always been able to 
differentiate between government and people, as far as the 
United States is concerned, and Cubans have always felt respect 
and sympathy for the U.S. people.

  [Text] The DPRK will consider a declaration of war any kind 
of sanction promoted by the United States against the DPRK in 
order to to solve the nuclear disagreement on the peninsula. The 
daily paper RODONG SHINMUN affirms that the U.S. Government is 
exacerbating the situation by pressuring Pyongyang to accept a 
total inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
threatening to take the nuclear problem before the UN Security 
Council. 
  North Korea has repeatedly denied charges that it is 
developing nuclear weapons on its territory and rejected the 
inspection by the international agency arguing that its 
installations are devoted to peaceful ends. 
  The DPRK calls unjustified the position that has been taken 
by the White House and insists that a negotiated solution can be 
reached only through talks between Washington and Pyongyang, in 
order to reach a global agreement.

  [Text] The U.S. Government, which every year publishes a 
voluminous report detailing human rights violations in the rest 
of the world's countries, in several areas itself fails to come 
up to international norms as regards human rights. A recent 
report from the Human Rights Watch and the American Civil 
Liberties Union says the government fails to comply with 
international human rights norms in important ways, ranging from 
the way it treats Haitians to instances of interference with the 
freedom of religion -- passing through racial and sexual 
discrimination, police brutality, and other such things along 
the way. 
  The two organizations carried out this study in the hopes of 
breaking down the cynical official posture that international 
law protects human rights only outside the borders of the United 
States. 
  Other areas of concern are the systematic, deep-rooted 
discrimination against women in matters of education, 
employment, and salaries; overcrowded prisons; and abuse of the 
death penalty.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] An article in today's JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper 
explains the events that occured in the vicinity of the U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana over the past three days, after the 
counterrevolution launched rumors that the Cuban security guards 
had been withdrawn. The item claims that Miami 
counterrevolutionary organizations and special services of 
imperialism are wholly responsible for the incidents that 
occurred on 10 and 11 February. 
  They had tried to create a massive influx of Cuban citizens 
to the U.S. Interests Section as a way to denigrate the 
Revolution and create an incident that would further damage the 
nonexistent relations between the two countries. The paper 
points out that to do this, they used the rumor technique, 
spreading false reports that the Cuban Government was interested 
in encouraging an event of that nature. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE says: The rumors began on the morning of 10 
February when the counterrevolution began to spread the news 
that the sentries had been withdrawn, and that the U.S. 
Interests Section was expeditiously issuing visas to anyone 
applying for them at the U.S. Interests Section. 
  During all [several seconds lost due to tape change] from 
Centro Habana [Municipality] and from the Cojimar neighborhood 
expressed their intentions of going to the place, while others 
went to the U.S. Interests Section. Those people were joined by 
a number of residents from Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. 
  On 11 February, the internal forces of order cordoned off 
the 
streets that provided access to the U.S. Interests Section to 
prevent the crowds from getting near the Section offices. At 
around noon on Friday [11 February], according to JUVENTUD 
REBELDE, the presence of lumpen in the area was obvious, again 
showing that this is the natural medium from which the 
counterrevolution draws its sustenance. 
  During the course of the incidents at the U.S. Interests 
Section, 82 people were identified and detained for a few hours. 
At present, a number of citizens are still under arrest, and the 
instigators of the events are being identified. 
  In its Sunday item, JUVENTUD REBELDE reports that several 
participants in the incidents said they heard rumors from Miami 
radio stations that visas would be freely granted. 
  It is obvious who masterminded the incidents at the U.S. 
Interests Section. This is how the mechanisms of the 
counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of 
deception and cynicism. Responsibility for what has happened 
belongs wholly and exclusively to imperialism, to the 
counterrevolutionaries in Miami, and to the agitators disguised 
as dissidents. Cuba does not practice policies based on force. 
The force of Cuba's policy lies in its proverbial justice, 
crystal clarity, and fidelity to its proclaimed principles, 
according to today's article in JUVENTUD REBELDE, entitled, 
"What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?" 
  The embassies in Cuba will always be able to count on the 
protection and facilities they need to carry out their tasks and 
ensure the the security of their members. Nothing happened 
inside the U.S. Interests Section. There are no Cuban citizens 
inside the offices. No one was hurt or injured. Once the rumor 
about free issuance of visas was denied, everything returned to 
normal. 
  Nevertheless, JUVENTUD REBELDE adds, these kinds of 
incidents 
and this type of irresponsibility have the potential to provoke 
more serious consequences. The onus falls entirely on whoever is 
responsible for promoting this kind of thing. Let this incident 
serve as an experience for the unscrupulous authors of this 
escapade.

<F P=106> [Station commentary by journalist Jose Armas] </F>
  [Text] Following NATO's ultimatum yesterday that the Serbs 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina remove their artillery within 10 days from 
around the capital, Sarajevo, or the West would undertake air 
strikes against Serb positions, we do not think that is the path 
that will lead that martyred republic to a real and effective 
peace. To the best of this commentator's knowledge, ultimatums 
have never brought any lasting solutions to ethnic conflicts. 
  If NATO leaders and the United States have decided to take a 
major hand in the Bosnian conflict, they should, in a totally 
disinterested manner, at least place their emphasis on a just, 
negotiated solution, without favorites. We stress this point 
because there are some very dark areas in NATO's decision. 
  It has been explained that what brought about the 
organization's meeting in the first place was the explosion of a 
shell in the middle of Sarajevo that killed 68 people and 
injured another 200. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has 
denied Serbian responsibility in the matter, and has called the 
report [not further identified] a mise-en-scene. In his opinion, 
the event was manipulated. In that connection, he has asked U.S. 
President William Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
use every means to uncover the truth. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher himself admitted that his country has no 
proof. No one has proven that the Serbs were responsible for the 
attack on the Sarajevo marketplace. 
  So, where does the truth lie? What dark interests might be 
at 
play behind the Bosnian conflict? Is there a sincere desire on 
the part of all parties for peace to prevail there? Many 
questions remain unanswered. 
  For the time being, amid the tensions, the agreement between 
Serbs and Muslims for an immediate ceasefire in Sarajevo, and 
the holding of peace talks today in Geneva between the warring 
factions, have been received with relief. We reiterate: It is 
there that the emphasis should be placed, not on bombs.

  [Text] Cuba today demanded that the UN Human Rights 
Commission condemn the U.S. blockade against the island for its 
violation of all international laws in this matter. The Cuban 
position was reaffirmed before the 50th UN Human Rights Session 
at the UN Palace where the economic, social, and cultural rights 
and those related to development are being debated. 
  According to Cuban representative to the United Nations, 
Jorge Lago Silva, the UN Human Rights Commission must make the 
U.S. Government understand that a dignified, heroic country 
cannot be subdued by force, nor can it be deprived of its 
subsistence and development. This was the second appeal made by 
the Cuban delegation to that commission during the two-day 
session on economic rights. 
  Speaking before the 50th session of the Human Rights 
Commission at the UN Palace, Jorge Lago Silva said that the U.S. 
blockade, as a coercive measure against a small country, seeks 
to prevent its access to essential goods, whether they are 
called food or medicine, in an effort to destroy the political, 
economic, and social system chosen by the Cubans. 
  Lagos Silva said before the plenary session that Washington 
ignores decisions made by the international community. It does 
not respect the UN resolutions, but on the contrary, tries to 
impose its own unilateral concessions. 
  Within the specific structure of international politics, 
Lago 
Silva stressed the lack of political willingness by countries of 
the North, namely the United States, to promote measures that 
seek to achieve increasing development levels in the Third World.

  [Text] Montevideo, 13 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Ambassador to 
Uruguay Abelardo Curbelo Padron has said Cuba would be willing 
to reenter the OAS -- it was expelled in 1962 -- if this action 
will foster regional integration and reduce tension in the 
continent. 
  The diplomat, who was appointed to represent his country in 
Mexico, told LA REPUBLICA newspaper that "Cuba is willing to 
consider the issue if the OAS asks for the island's reentry. [no 
closing quotation marks as published] 
  "Cuba was arbitrarily removed from the OAS and now the 
decision for its reentry is the organization's problem, not 
ours," the ambassador stated. He added that the international 
political situation has changed so much "that many people 
believe the decision to exclude Cuba is going out of fashion." 
  Curbelo said integration "was an old historic aspiration of 
the continent," and that the regional and subregional advances 
in this direction were "interesting." He noted: "For us, the 
integration process and the international meetings have an 
effective and practical value because, regarding the Caribbean's 
participation, they foster rapprochement of all countries." 
  Cuba, he added, does not participate in any regional 
integration process but has made important steps in this 
direction through the Caribbean Common Market. Therefore, he 
said, the experience gathered at the Latin American Integration 
Association will be important in the future.

<F P=106> [Relay from Santiago de Cuba by Carlos Sanabria] </F>
  [Text] Recently appointed Colombian Ambassador to Cuba 
(Ricardo Santamaria Salamanca) was welcomed here by Santiago de 
Cuba Governor [title as heard] (Reinaldo E. Vicendis). Relations 
between Colombia and Cuba are favorable and are growing 
satisfactorily, the Colombian ambassador said. 
  [Begin recording] [(Santamaria Salamanca)] One of the first 
actions of the recently established Colombian Embassy in Cuba is 
to establish immediate friendly relations between Santiago de 
Cuba and Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia, to unite those who 
already are united, de facto, by history and culture. They are 
two peoples with parallel histories, both capitals of the 
Caribbean which, thanks to a good initiative of the two 
governments, will again strengthen their friendly relations. 
  Within this framework, we hope to develop cultural and 
commercial activities that promote new points of cooperation 
between Colombia and Cuba, through Santiago de Cuba and 
Cartagena de Indias. We are going to receive visiting Colombian 
officials and businessmen for two or three days here in Santiago 
de Cuba, and we hope to begin talks between those two sectors. I 
would say that Colombia and Cuba are experiencing good, friendly 
relations at this moment. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
was visiting Colombia at the end of 1993; Vice President Carlos 
Lage also met with President Gaviria; and by the end of April, 
Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will visit Cuba. We are 
going to have a number of visits. Our relations are at a good 
level at this moment. This complies with President Gaviria's 
policy of tightening relations with the Caribbean, of 
strengthening an international relationship of friendship; and I 
am here to begin implementing those guidelines. 
  [Sanabria] Would it be possible to receive a visit by 
President Cesar Gaviria, as well, during the development of 
these relations? 
  [(Santamaria Salamanca)] For the time being, we are working 
on visits by two or three ministers, a delegation of Colombian 
businessmen, and [Foreign Minister] Noemi Sanin; then will we be 
able to plan future objectives. So far, we are working with 
these goals, which surely implies relations at a high level, 
because for almost 12 years we had no diplomatic relations. [end

  [Text] Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of the Council of 
State, returned early this morning to our country after a 
fruitful working tour of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. In an 
exclusive interview by our reporter (Carea Bermudes), Lage 
stresses the importance of the trip. 
  [Lage] "We are very satisfied with the trip. I believe the 
meetings we held with the presidents of the three countries were 
excellent. We established an excellent channel of communication 
and I think the opportunities represented by these meetings are 
very important for us. We had the occasion to explain our 
situation, what we are doing, the measures we are adopting, and 
the importance of the struggle against the U.S. blockade under 
current conditions. 
  "We met not only with the presidents of those countries, but 
also with other officials, with ministers and businessmen. I 
think the environment is very positive for strengthening current 
political, economic, and commercial relations with the countries 
we visited. The fruit of this positive environment was the 
visits to those countries, and I believe these visits can 
contribute to improving relations. 
  [(Bermudes)] "In your opinion, what were the highlights of 
those visits? 
  [Lage] "I think the most outstanding points were the respect 
for the Cuban Revolution, the interest in our country's 
situation, the increasing awareness of the need to fight against 
the U.S. blockade, an understanding of the measures the country 
is adopting to adjust itself to current circumstances, and the 
possibility that the measures we are adopting can lead to 
greater economic integration with Latin America. I think one of 
the main results of the visits is the thrust we are giving to 
inviting investment in the Cuban economy and strengthening 
economic and commercial ties, as well as opening new 
possibilities for the export of Cuban products to those 
countries of the region." 
  Colombian Ambassador to Cuba (Ricardo Santamaria) also 
returned to Havana. He participated in Lage's visit to Colombia. 
Santamaria also conveyed his opinion to this station. 
  [(Santamaria)] "I would say that the visit was very positive 
because bilateral relations were strengthened, especially in the 
area of business. Vice President Lage met with Colombian 
businessmen, six ministers, and President Gaviria. We must also 
mention the visit of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and 
the reestablishment of relations. We hope that after this visit, 
we will be able to arrange a visit to Cuba between Colombian 
businessmen and various ministers for closer identification of 
points of cooperation. 
  [(Bermudes)] "And what about the invitation extended by Lage 
to President Gaviria to visit Cuba? 
  [(Santamaria)] Well, we have a program which includes a 
visit 
by the transport minister and by the foreign trade minister for 
the signing of a preliminary agreement, and finally the visit of 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. These arrangements are in progress 
and we hope they will develop well. I am certain that the 
development of these relations will be fruitful both for 
Colombia and Cuba."

<F P=106> [Report by Marianella Samper from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] This weekend, Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of 
the Cuban Council of State, returned to Cuba after a fruitful 
work visit to Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. He said the 
meetings with the presidents were excellent, and there was great 
communication. This visit, he pointed out, provided great 
possibilities for explaining the island's current situation, the 
measures which are being adopted, and the importance of the 
struggle against the U.S. blockade in our conditions. 
  Lage added that he also met with other leaders, officials, 
and businessmen of those nations and he noticed there is a very 
positive atmosphere for strengthening the political, economic, 
and social relations. With regard to the most outstanding points 
of these meetings, the Cuban vice president said: 
  [Begin Lage recording] I think the most outstanding aspects 
were respect for the Cuban Revolution, interest in our country's 
situation, the growing awareness of the need to fight the U.S. 
blockade, an understanding of the measures the country is 
adopting to adapt to the circumstances we are living under, and 
the possibilities these measures will provide for an economic 
integration with Latin America. 
  I believe the results have stimulated the participation 
process with investments in the Cuban economy, strengthened 
economic and commercial relations, and opened (?possibilities) 
of exporting Cuban products to those countries in the region.

  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government, arrived at the 
Jose Marti Airport a few minutes ago and made the following 
remarks to this station. 
  [Begin recording] Well, the most significant, the most 
important point of the visit was the attitude that exists in 
Europe toward Cuba, an attitude of interest in Cuba, and a very 
respectful interest. Many people are following the development 
of the Cuban situation, its problems, and the way we are facing 
them. There is interest and concern. I would also say that there 
is a great respect for, a great understanding of what we are 
doing. This has been conveyed from an official point of view. 
  We received very cordial treatment from government officials 
in Belgium, Germany, and France. This same attitude was conveyed 
by all political sectors of those countries we visited. I think 
this process will lead to the imminent signing of that framework 
agreement, that overall cooperation agreement between our 
country and the European Union, that is, the set of countries 
that comprise the European Economic Community. 
  As you know, we have relations with each of those members 
bilaterally. We also talked, and there is great mutual interest, 
especially with Germany, about working on a specific agreement 
for the promotion and protection of investments between our two

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, has termed his meetings in France as 
very positive. France is the third country he visited as part 
of a tour of Europe, which, he said, has been very fruitful and 
has demonstrated the friendship and affection of the people of 
France for the Caribbean island. This has materialized in the 
sending of donations, he continued. 
  In statements to Radio Rebelde, Alarcon said his meeting in 
Paris with (Robert Hue), new secretary general of the French 
Communist Party, was very friendly. Alarcon said (Hue) 
reiterated his party's support for Cuba and vowed to maintain 
the solidarity movement toward the Caribbean nation. 
  Upon assessing his tour, which also included Germany and 
Belgium, the president of Cuba's legislative body added that 
there is a great and growing interest in Europe in learning 
about Cuba's reality. He stressed that the initial amazement 
over Cuba's survival without assistance from the now defunct 
Soviet Union and the socialist bloc is over. 
  Alarcon told Radio Rebelde that currently on the continent 
there is a great deal of interest in learning about the problems 
of the island, how they are being confronted, and the current 
development perspectives, because for many people in Europe this 
is a very unique case. He added that this is a country facing 
serious economic difficulties, which has continued to preserve 
firm human values of respecting people and maintaing a feeling 
of solidarity.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] As we reported in the beginning, Army General Raul 
Castro Ruz, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], 
has paid a visit to the province of Holguin. 
  Army Gen. Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of the Communist 
Party of Cuba [PCC], together Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del 
Toro, member of the Politburo, visited a large Antiaircraft 
Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] unit of the Eastern 
Army. The minister [Raul Castro] and his first vice minister and 
chief of the General Staff [Ulises Rosales] were accompanied by 
Division Gen. Ramon Espinoza Martin, chief of the Eastern Army; 
Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary of the PCC in Holguin; 
as well as other Central Committee members, generals, and 
high-level officers. 
  The unit chief, Colonel Carlos (Negrin) Rodriguez, briefed 
the minister about the results attained during the past year, 
and the prospects for this year, stressing the seven main tasks 
of the Western Army. He verified the progress achieved in the 
training of personnel, maintenance of armaments and of the 
theater of military operations, morale and discipline, and the 
fighting capacity of the troops. 
  The work carried out in livestock production can be clearly 
seen in the 30-percent higher growth than last year. An example 
of the creativity in this area is the production of milk: larger 
cattle farms in larger units; minicattle farms in smaller units; 
and goat milk production in the more distant, smallest units. 
The agricultural and livestock plan for 1994 seeks steps beyond 
those of the previous year, making the troops almost 
self-sufficient, to the point of providing a modest food 
provision to the families of the officers' corps. 
  Brigadier Gen. Ruben Martinez Puentes, DAAFAR chief, and 
Col. 
Negrin Rodriguez gave a tour of the combat operations center to 
the FAR minister and his retinue. Raul here greeted the soldiers 
and the many female personnel who work at the National Airspace 
Defense screens. 
  At the flight ramp, the FAR minister was shown various types 
of equipment for air safety built by the rationalizers 
[racionalizadores] and innovators who replace the numerous forms 
of equipment that used to be imported, but which today would 
demand a considerable amount of currency. 
  Raul also held a lively conversation with Comrade (Raciel 
Bovines), a civilian worker who has been in the unit for 18 
years, a National Vanguard member for the past three years, and 
whose contributions are decisive solutions for the Air Force 
operation. 
  At the technical research unit, master engineer, (Raul 
Trinchet), graduate of the Technical Military Institute, showed 
the Army general other achievements in fighter plane repair, and 
the creation of basic materials for study. Proof of the quality 
of work is the fact that no aircraft from this unit has 
experienced an accident due to technical failure over the past 
three years. During the chat with Raul, Master Engineer 
(Trinchet) said that his efforts are inspired by the 
metaphorical words of the minister when he said that inventions 
during the special period could reach the point of flying an 
aircraft by a gasoline-operated generator. 
  [Begin recording] [Raul] [passage indistinct] ... from 
generals to the last soldier, to civilian workers, technicians, 
and engineers, you are a good example. So, allow me to 
congratulate you on behalf of the commander in chief, on behalf 
of my fellow comrades who are accompanying me, and for myself, 
wishing you greater success because now, as I told (Trinchet) a 
few minutes ago, that our technicians, engineers, experts, 
having reached an accomplished level, life is forcing us to 
develop even further. We must admire this, especially since you 
are responsible for such a fate. [sentence indistinct] 
  But that is not the essential point. The essential thing is 
that with what we have, we are capable of solving problems such 
as those you have solved. Is that correct, Comander? 
  [Unidentified colonel] Yes, General. 
  [Raul] Then, I ask my comrades who are accompanying me, that 
as a humble homage to you, and through you to everyone 
throughout the country, to recognize that our air force, our 
DAAFAR, and our Armed Forces have achieved and have greatly 
contributed to maintaining the fighting capacity of our FAR, and 
in an increasingly less expensive manner, as we said recently. 
  We are going to have, or are continuing to have the most 
powerful Armed Forces in Latin America, and besides, the least 
costly Armed Forces. And you here play an essential role, 
repairing an engine, or carrying out some of those activities 
that Engineer (Trinchet) just explained. 
  (Negrin), we are talking here about millions of dollars. 
[passage indistinct] I ask for applause for these officers, our 
comrades. [applause] [end recording]

  [Text] Soon, the prototype of a sugarcane harvester capable 
of operating in wet soil will be tested. The project is being 
developed by the Center for the Development of Agricultural 
Machinery of the scientific hub in Holguin Province. The new 
machine includes a trailer or cart and its basic mechanism is 
similar to that of the KTP. The new harvester uses tracks 
[esteras] instead of tires and is much lighter than the 
conventional harvester to prevent damage to the cane stumps when 
the water content of the soil exceeds the normal limits. 
  This project is one of the four tasks assigned to the 
scientific hub of Holguin in view of a need to equip the country 
with machinery capable of continuing the harvest during rainy 
seasons.

  [Text] The budget for the current year is the object of 
special attention by the Provincial Assemblies of the People's 
Government, which have held or scheduled special sessions to 
analyze this matter. Journalist Gisela Bel Heredia comments on 
this topic. 
  [Bel, live or recorded] The qualitative change in the way 
the 
state budget is being discussed and approved at various levels 
can be considered an important part of the battle won. With 
regard to the budget projections for 1994, from approval that 
was almost a mere formality, approval essentially handled 
internally by specialists, responsibility for rigor and 
awareness of each and every figure, as well as knowledge of the 
funds' destinations, are no longer theirs alone. Indeed, those 
who bear responsibility for finances and for requesting or 
granting more money have not been left alone. Rather, those who 
manage the various spheres or organizations have been called 
upon -- and, moreover, insistently -- to fully grasp the budget 
in question. 
  Furthermore, in order to reduce the budget deficit in every 
province, for example, action plans have been provided for, 
plans in which the word "monitoring" is written in capital 
letters. 
  For the delegates of the local People's Government 
assemblies 
and the deputies of the National Assembly, to approve the budget 
or not turns into an exercise that requires a position much more 
collegial and realistic, assuming the characteristics conferred 
upon them by the Constitution of the Republic. We thus reach the 
conclusion that, although open to important improvements, the 
new stance vis-a-vis the budget is not a simple skirmish, but 
rather a battle that heavily influences victory in the long run.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 8 and 11 February. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 8 February reports that a 
miscellaneous crops plenum was held in Cienfuegos Province at 
which it was announced that an additional 400 caballerias of 
plantain are going to be planted in Cienfuegos Province, above 
and beyond those under the current agricultural plan. Also, in 
salute to 26 July, 42 organic plots are to be added to the 
present 15. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 February reports that in 1993 
Cuba received approximately $50 million in diverse donations -- 
mainly food, medicine, and school supplies -- channeled by the 
Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP] from 72 
countries. ICAP President Sergio Corrieri added that 11 
international brigades visited Cuba in 1993, and 32 cultural 
delegations traveled abroad. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 9 February reports that 
the Faustino Vega rice mill in Manzanillo, Granma Province, has 
fulfilled its 1993 goal by husking a total of 8,500 tons of 
rice. This rice mill belongs to the Fernando Chenique Rice 
Company, which must plant 2,000 caballerias of rice this year, 
the largest number in the country. With an industrial 
performance of 64 percent, the Faustino Vega rice mill is also 
one of the best in this area. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 9 February reports that the 
Antillana de Acero enterprise produced 8,000 tons of steel in 
January. This year's plan per four-month period is 50,000 tons. 
  Radio Reloj at 1508 GMT on 9 February reports that Pinar del 
Rio Province has approximately 170 caballerias of land planted 
in miscellaneous crops, earmarked for use by schools. These are 
self-sufficiency plots. In 1993, 62 percent of the schools' 
needs in food were provided for by these plots. Over 64,000 
quintals of miscellaneous food crops were produced in Pinar del 
Rio Province in 1993. This year, the School of Medical Sciences 
and other centers of higher learning will be given land to 
cultivate for self-sufficiency. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 10 February reports that 
Federico Ramon Puerta, governor of the Argentine province of 
Misiones, announced a donation to Cuba of 28 tons of paper. He 
announced this shortly before his departure for Argentina after 
a visit to several Cuban provinces. He was accompanied by 
Argentine Ambassador (Susana Sara Grane) [Diplomatic List shows 
Adolfo Enrique Nanclares as Argentine ambassador to Cuba), and 
Pedro Chavez, president of Havana's People's Government. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 10 February reports on an 
"experiment" underway in the food industry in Sibanicu 
Municipality, Camaguey Province, where workers are receiving a 
portion of the profits from sales at all centers, in lieu of 
salaries. "The worker earns according to his sales, receiving 
some 20 or 30 percent of what he sells." Omar del Risco, the 
local first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, explains 
that a unit's administrator is authorized to negotiate and 
purchase products from specific places and to manage the entire 
supply process for the unit. The administrator also decides, 
after consulting with the workers, how many workers should be 
kept at a given unit. Del Risco notes that "by distributing 20 
percent among the workers, the workers try to have as few 
workers as possible. They do not keep anyone they do not need. 
Since they are paid in profits, they try to reduce costs to a 
minimum. They are tripling sales but lowering costs, and of 
course, there is an improvement in income." Del Risco notes that 
working for profit seems to motivate workers. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 February reports that at the 
end of an extensive tour of San Cristobal Municipality 
cane-growing areas, Fidel Ramos, first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Pinar del Rio Province, has 
issued a call to catch up and to increase both efficiency and 
the amount of sugar produced during the current harvest. 
Rebelde's correspondent notes that workers are working around 
the clock at the 30 de Noviembre agroindustrial complex to get a 
1,000-cubic-meter water tank operative again because problems 
with it paralyzed the sugar mill's operations. Ramos also 
inspected the Basic Cooperative Production Units' [UBPCs'] 
planting areas and a Youth Labor Army military grange. Along 
with Jose Marrero Camacho, like Ramos a member of the PCC's 
Central Committee and also president of the Provincial Assembly 
of the People's Government in Pinar del Rio, Ramos participated 
in a seminar for the economists of the 47 cane sector UBPC in 
the province, as well as in an overall inspection of the sugar 
harvest in Pinar del Rio. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 February reports that the 
country's objective is to plant more than 18,000 caballerias of 
sugarcane by the end of June 1994, the largest figure over the 
past 13 years. Thus far, 61 percent of that program has already 
been achieved. Havana and Cienfuegos Provinces are leading in 
this planting program. 
  Rebelde adds that the Armed Forces will be in charge of 
maintaining more than 11,000 light and heavy tractors, and more 
than 11,000 previously inoperative light trucks, to participate 
in this new Cuban agricultural project. The Armed Forces has the 
most experience and best techniques for maintaining both Armed 
Forces and agricultural equipment. 
  The same newscast reports that despite the economic crisis 
affecting the country, there are and have always been the 
fraternal hands of many governments and institutions supporting 
our government. Such is the case with the Spanish Government, 
which in 1993 alone contributed approximately $5 million worth 
of donations. Spanish ambassador to Havana Jose Antonio San Gil 
said his government hopes to maintain and further develop 
cooperation with Cuba. In 1993, the Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation brought 337 tons of powdered milk for 
children. Spain also contributed, with $550,000 worth of 
medicine in 1993.

  [Text] A regrettable railroad accident occured this morning 
in Remedios, Villa Clara Province. 
  [Journalist Boris Fuentes] "Four dead and 64 injured was the 
toll of a train accident that occurred at 0740 on 13 February, 
when a bridge at a place known as Tahon suffered damage. Tahon 
is part of Remedios Municipality. The train consisted of seven 
cars and two locomotives, and was covering the Santa 
Clara/Moron/Nuevitas route for the northern line. 
  The dead are: Luis Garcia Sanchez, from Sancti Spiritus 
Province; Felix Aguila Morales, from Remedios; Pedro Antonio 
Gomez Alonso, from Santa Clara; and Alberto Munoz Alvarez, from 
Placetas. 
  Shortly after the event, Cuban Communist Party and 
Government 
authorities and a group of experts appeared in person at the 
site to investigate the causes of the accident. 
  One of the most direct sources of the events is the train's 
driver, Manuel Rodriguez." 
  [Rodriguez] "When... [rephrases] accident... [rephrases] 
upon 
going over the bridge, the locomotive that was in front gave a 
leap [bachon], and the train broke in two. I had pulled the 
emergency (?brake) there. I... [rephrases] It was the bridge 
that was the cause of..."[breaks off, interrupted by 
unidentified journalist] 
  [Journalist] "How fast were you going?" 
  [Rodriguez] "Forty, forty-five...."[voice trails off] 
  [Journalist] "Was that permissible, on this track?" 
  [Rodriguez] "No. Sixty." 
  [Fuentes] The director of the Central Cuba division of Cuban 
Railways [Ferrocarriles de Cuba] also comments on what has 
happened." 
  [Director] "It looks like the bridge has been affected, and 
an investigation must be conducted to see if some element in the 
bridge failed, or whether there was another, as yet unknown 
cause. A definitive cause has not yet been found." 
  [Fuentes] Thirty-one people are currently in Villa Clara 
hospitals, nine of them seriously injured, another nine with 
slight injuries, and 13 under observation. The province's 
Defense Council has announced that a ministerial commission that 
will conduct a thorough investigation into the causes of the 
accident has already been created. 
  "This is a Boris Fuentes report from Villa Clara." 
  We learned just a few minutes ago that one more person has 
died: Olga Hernandez, from Zulueta, Villa Clara Province.

  [Text] The Matanzas engineering regiment has been once 
again rewarded for its outstanding work. Making a sustained 
effort in refurbishing the theater of military operations and in 
maintaining techniques, the Central Army engineering regiment 
obtained the special Victoria-25 Emulation award. Engineering 
Unit 3170 received the award of being the first group of its 
type in the country, and the banner that raises it to the level 
of National Vanguard of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, an award 
obtained for the sixth consecutive year. 
  During 1993 this unit made laudable efforts to build 
tunnels, 
silos, and firing positions, and achieved considerable progress 
in conserving resources and improving the troops' living 
conditions. 
  On evaluating the fighting capacity of the regiment, 
Division 
General Joaquin Quintas Solas said: 
  [Begin recording] The fighting readiness of this regiment, 
as 
well as that of the other regular units, the militia, and the 
production and defense units throughout the Army territory, is 
high and is equal to the times in which we are living today. All 
warriors clearly understand that only by fighting does one enter 
this country, and one leaves -- well, we all know how, if one 
manages to leave. 
  I was told that the readiness of this unit is very 
satisfactory, an outstanding grade within the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Central Bank of Venezuela has granted 60 
billion bolivares to Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] in 
financial support for the operation required by Banco Latino. 
The sum is intended to enable account holders who have up to 1 
million bolivares to withdraw their money from the bank in two 
weeks. This information was released by Fogade President 
Esperanza Martino, who said she received written notification 
from the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela early Friday 
morning. 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela's contribution is expected to 
enable Banco Latino account holders whose deposits range between 
400,000 and 1 million bolivares to withdraw their money. Fogade 
would thus fulfill its obligation to 75 percent of its account 
holders. 
  [Begin Martino recording] The Central Bank of Venezuela has 
demanded that we act in coordination with the audit board, the 
Bank Superintendency, and the Central Bank of Venezuela so we 
may receive the advance payment. The goal is to provide the 
guarantees specified by law so we may reach a settlement with 
the audit board. We will get 60 billion bolivares to meet what 
we consider to be our basic obligation, guaranteeing accounts of 
up to 1 million bolivares. [end recording] 
  Esperanza Martino also said Fogade is studying a series of 
formulas to cooperate with all the account holders who have more 
than 1 million bolivares in Banco Latino. The possibility of 
issuing Fogade bonds is being analyzed, but Esperanza Martino 
said this does not represent an obligation for her organization, 
adding it will be done as a courtesy.

  [Text] Managua -- Tense calm prevails in northern 
Nicaragua. Talks to disarm the Nicaraguan recontras of the 
so-called Northern Front 3-80, led by Jose Angel Talavera, 
a.k.a. Chacal, begin today. Local media sources report that a 
peace commission composed of Catholic Church and CIAV 
[International Commission for Support and Verification]-OAS 
delegates have already made contact with recontra leaders to 
establish the necessary conditions for the negotiations. The 
people are afraid rifles will be heard again given the 
recontras' mistrust for the military presence. 
  On Sunday, Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, vicar of the Managua 
Archdiocese, advocated the rapid resolution of the situation in 
the country's north. We hope the rifles will remain silent and 
that the pacification process will move forward so Nicaragua can 
tread the path of balance, he said during his homily at the 
Managua Cathedral. 
  The disarmament talks will be held at El Naranjo, Nueva 
Segovia Department, close to the Honduran border. Despite the 
cease-fire announced separately on Thursday by the Sandinist 
People's Army staff and rebel leaders, the presence of 
government troops increased over the weekend, a CIAV-OAS 
official reported. 
  Sergio Caramana, CIAV-OAS coordinator general, warned that 
the peace commission's mediation might fail if the Army's 
presence near the town where the talks with the recontras will 
be held is maintained. A military source, however, denied that 
the Army is hampering the Catholic Church and CIAV-OAS 
mediation. We remain in our positions and maintain the 
cease-fire to facilitate the disarming, the source added. 
  The suspension of Army offensive operations only covers the 
Nueva Segovia Department, where the Northern Front 3-80, made up 
of some 400 rearmed men, is stationed. The Army source said the 
operation continues in the rest of the country, but declined to 
report on any new clashes. In exchange for disarming, the 
recontras operating in the country's north demand that the 
government of Violeta Chamorro implement social programs for 
Nueva Segovia Department peasants and protection for the 
would-be demobilized.

<F P=106> [Interview with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria </F>
Figueres Olsen in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Jacobo Zabludovsky 
from the XEW Television studios in Mexico City; from the "24 
Hours" newscast -- live relay] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Good evening, Mr. Figueres. 
  [Figueres] Good evening, Don Jacobo. It is nice to say hello 
to you. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much. Congratulations on your 
victory. What do you hope to accomplish in Costa Rica? 
  [Figueres] Thank you. I greatly appreciate your kind words. 
Ahead of me I have the clear responsibility to fight poverty -- 
the main problem we face as a country -- in two areas. One is 
the impoverishment process suffered by our middle class, the 
backbone of our democratic system and our national production. 
The other area in which we need to fight poverty is the poverty 
and extreme poverty some sectors of our population are living in. 
  [Figueres] Jose Maria, you are the son of someone who was a 
great friend of mine -- the three times Costa Rican President 
Don Jose Figueres, whom I remember very fondly. He also tried 
to end poverty in Costa Rica and was unsuccessful. What are 
your plans to accomplish this? 
  [Figueres] Don Jacobo, I believe this is an endless 
struggle, 
and there are always new wars to wage. The important thing is 
to persevere. The important thing is to have the social 
awareness, to admit that Costa Rica has been successful in many 
fields because we have always been a country united in 
solidarity. Costa Rica should not lose our fatherland's 
solidarity in the face of modernizing and integrating into the 
world economy. We have indeed advanced toward globalization 
since 1982, during the administration of Don Luis Alberto Monge, 
but we want to be able to participate in the world economy in a 
much more intelligent way -- a way in which we can offer the 
benefits of this integration to all sectors of our society and 
not only to a select few. 
  [Zabludovsky] Do you intend to seek admittance into NAFTA? 
  [Figueres] We are very pleased that NAFTA has been ratified. 
We believe this is a great step forward in the integration of 
our economies by the signatory countries. To us, it also 
represents a challenge, because the truth of the matter is that 
we have the impression that NAFTA places us at a relative 
disadvantage in attracting the foreign investment our country 
needs, as well as in the competitiveness of our products, 
especially within the U.S. market. 
  We believe the countries that have signed NAFTA are not very 
willing to increase the number of participants until they first 
see the effect the treaty has on their own economies. I believe 
that in Central America and in the Caribbean we have the 
responsibility of seeking the understanding of Mexico, the 
United States, and Canada to enable the Caribbean Basin 
Initiative, which has benefited our economies, to offer us the 
same options and opportunities available to members of NAFTA. 
This would allow us to continue strengthening our economies and 
to give greater support to the very positive political changes 
we have seen in this area these past few years. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mr. Figueres, Central America and the 
Caribbean are now somewhat quiet but not completely quiet. Some 
40 years ago your father abolished the Army in Costa Rica and 
gave your country a distinct image in the area. Do you not fear 
Costa Rica might be contaminated by nearby unrest? 
  [Figueres] No sir, not at all. We abolished the Army 45 
years ago. This has allowed our country to invest in health, 
education, infrastructure, and telecommunications by way of a 
series of programs that have brought much well-being to Costa 
Rica. Costa Rica respects the domestic decisions of every 
country. We will also always be at the head of human rights 
causes and will be prepared to contribute as much as possible to 
a greater peace and calm in the Central American region. This 
can lead to a reduction of military budgets and to the 
apportionment of those resources to social programs. 
  [Zabludovsky] As president-elect you now have a different 
function and you must prepare your programs in ways different 
from the way you prepared them when you were a candidate. You 
will be sworn in on 8 May. What will you be doing from now 
until then, basically? 
  [Figueres] We outlined a very clear platform during our 
campaign. Our government commitment is to fulfill what we 
promised during the campaign. We are returning to a policy that 
gives prominence to domestic matters. 
  Economic and social concerns are two sides of the same coin. 
This requires looking not only at macroeconomic projects, which 
are important for the country's development, attracting foreign 
investments, and encouraging domestic investment, but also at 
microeconomic policies to encourage production among the 
national sectors that have lagged behind in recent years. 
  In the social field, this means investing more on health 
care, an area in which we have good services but still need to 
improve the quality of the services. There is a need for more 
investments in health care. There is much to be done to improve 
the quality of education, at both the primary school and 
higher-education, or university, levels. 
  I am saying this because our country wants to return to the 
path of sustained mid- and long-term development. We are going 
to make the government aware of the fact that our responsibility 
is not only to adopt day-to-day decisions, which of course are 
important and are a function of the government, but we also have 
the responsibility of directing our country and our society 
toward mid- and long-term objectives. This type of development 
must be sustained not only to preserve our natural resources and 
environment, which are new aspects that we must consider while 
engaging in national production and day-to-day life, but also to 
preserve and improve human life, which is after all, the 
objective of all of our policies. 
  Costa Rica wants to join the international economy and to 
compete on the basis of technology, quality, productivity, and 
efficiency, not on the basis of workers being paid low salaries. 
This kind of integration requires more investments in education. 
  [Zabludovsky] One last comment, perhaps the last question, 
Jose Maria: I met your father for the first time in 1956, which 
was also the first time I interviewed him. How old were you 
then? 
  [Figueres] I was two. 
  [Zabludovsky] Fine. At that time he was a unique person in 
Latin American politics, especially in Caribbean policies, 
because he was a civilian who enjoyed much prestige in an area 
where people like Fulgencio Batista and Anastasio Somoza were 
presidents. In that respect, your father was an odd-ball. He 
had no bodyguards and no fear, and he abolished the Army while 
others in other places were upgrading and strengthening their 
armies. My question is this: What did you inherit, personally 
and politically, from Pepe Figueres? 
  [Figueres] I am proud of my father and of my name. From him 
I learned to love the fatherland. I have that in my heart. I 
also learned how to value people for what they are and not for 
how much they have. I learned that work, regardless of how 
humble it might be, brings honor. With regard to public life, I 
learned that if one is going to engage in public life, one must 
do it to serve others, not to serve oneself. 
  With these principles and ideals in mind, I have 
participated 
in politics and will participate in our forthcoming 
administration. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you, Jose Maria. I wish you success in 
governing that grand country of yours: Costa Rica. 
  [Figueres] Thank you, Jacobo. Good night. 
  [Zabludovsky] Good night.

  [Excerpts] San Jose, 10 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Costa Rican 
Foreign Ministry announced today that it believes the Summit of 
the Americas proposed by the United States should be held by the 
OAS. [passage omitted] 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus stressed that 
"without a doubt the summit will be of great importance for the 
future of America, but unfortunately the OAS, which is the 
appropriate international organization to hold such a summit, 
has not been taken into consideration." 
  Niehaus held a news conference during which he added that 
"we 
consider this initiative to be very important and welcome it 
without reservation, but it would be important if the meeting 
were organized and had the logistical support of the OAS in a 
parallel manner and with the will of all countries that form 
that organization."

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria 
said yesterday before the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva 
that El Salvador is showing evidence that its peace process is 
irreversible and called on the commission to give El Salvador 
the credibility it deserves and to decide by consensus to remove 
it from the list of observed countries. 
  The speech by the Salvadoran foreign minister centered 
mainly 
on demonstrating that the country's regime has basically changed 
with regard to respect for and encouragement of human rights, as 
proven by the testimonies of various agents designated by the 
United Nations, such as Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], 
and the main UN and international community organs. 
  Salaverria said that El Salvador "is the only sovereign 
state 
that has encouraged and granted facilities for international on 
`site' observance of the development of political events." He 
added that the 150 Onusal members move about freely and have all 
the means to fulfill their designated tasks. 
  After admitting that during the conflict "serious violations 
to human rights took place," Salaverria added that today "the 
topic should be viewed from a realistic perspective and 
according to the new existing circumstances." He admitted that 
there is a problem of common crime due to the postwar situation. 
Despite all this, he said that "it should not be linked to 
human rights violations by the state." 
  Salaverria gave assurances that Onusal's presence in El 
Salvador is the best national and international guarantee in the 
observance and verification of the country's human rights 
situation, because this is done directly and with the active 
presence and backing of the UN Security Council. 
  Minister Salaverria said that El Salvador has decidedly 
begun 
consolidating peace, implementing national reconciliation, 
placing emphasis on a legal state, and strengthening the 
democratic system. 
  On several occasions he insisted on the favorable evolution 
of human rights and pointed out how the administration of 
President Alfredo Cristiani is complying with the pledge made to 
the Salvadoran people and the international community. In fact, 
we have even gone "beyond it by giving new ideas to consolidate 
world peace." 
  In this area Salaverria mentioned the National Forum for 
Reflection on Education and Peace Culture organized by the 
Salvadoran Government in April 1993, which proved to be a 
valuable initiative. 
  He then added that because peace consolidation requires 
conceptualizing and putting it into practice, the government has 
made invitations to the First International Forum on Peace 
Culture, which will take place on 16 February in San Salvador 
with UNESCO [UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization] support. Numerous delegates are expected to attend. 
  When thanking the international community for the support 
given to the peace negotiation and consolidation process, he 
warned that this support could, however, run the risk of 
becoming "an obstacle" if the recommendations are followed by 
those who intend to maintain unnecessary observation in El 
Salvador "when undisputable evidence has been given that peace 
in El Salvador is irreversible and can only become stronger." 
  In this part of his speech, Foreign Minister Salaverria made 
his call for members of the UN Human Rights Commission to grant 
"the deserved credibility to the Salvadoran process and decide, 
by consensus, to remove El Salvador from its list." 
  He pointed out that El Salvador is on its way to an election 
on 20 March with the participation of all political forces, 
without any of them being hindered, that will be witnessed by 
international representatives from several states and by more 
than 1,500 observers.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa 
has said that the report presented by the United Nations, and 
which was written by Pedro Nikkens, stating that a systematic 
violation of human rights continues in El Salvador "is very 
politicized and not in accordance with the country's reality." 
  The aforementioned report was made public a few weeks ago. 
Nikkens states that human rights violations persist in our 
country. However, Gen. Corado believes that "these violations 
are not systematic nor are the number of violations as high as 
years ago. The report gives the impression that in our country 
there is a lot fear and that no activities can be conducted 
because it is not safe." Gen. Corado said: "It is indispensable 
that the United Nations draft these reports in a balanced and 
impartial manner and not politicize them." 
  With regard to the legalization of private weapons, Minister 
Corado said that the Defense Ministry is opening a special 
office where interested parties can go and request a license to 
carry a weapon. The first office will be opened in San 
Salvador. At a later date offices will be opened throughout the 
country. Corado said that the appropriate guidelines are being 
drafted and that they should be ready in the next few days. 
  Regarding the Salvadoran Air Force A-37 aircraft that 
crashed 
at sea off the coast of La Paz Department, Gen. Corado said that 
despite the efforts made it has been impossible to rescue the 
crew and that it is believed that the pilot, Captain Julio Cesar 
Godoy Aguirre, and technician, Juan Carlos Ramirez, died in the 
accident.

  [Text] "The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front] was demobilized a long time ago," said Onusal [UN 
Observers for El Salvador] chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo when 
commenting on General Mauricio Ernesto Vargas' statements that 
the FMLN was still armed. 
  Vargas, a member of the government commission that signed 
the 
peace accords, reportedly said yesterday there are FMLN groups 
that have yet to be demobilized. 
  "Vargas is misinformed," Ocampo said, adding "he (Vargas) 
was 
a witness" of the FMLN's total demobilization, which the United 
Nations has also affirmed. 
  He recalled that the FMLN's structure was dismantled in 
August 1993 and that FMLN leaders rejected any responsibility 
for weapons found in the future. 
  Ocampo said "everyone is protected by the law" now, and 
sanctions will be enforced against those who violate it. 
  Referring to human rights supervision in El Salvador, he 
said 
"this is the most supervised country in the world as far as 
human rights are concerned," adding there are three operations 
underway: a permanent operation by the Onusal Human Rights 
Division, an independent observer, and one operation by the 
Human Rights Commission, which has its headquarters in Geneva. 
  He said the human rights situation "has achieved 
extraordinary progress." Ocampo made those statements after 
signing as a witness the 12th gentlemen's pact signed by 
representatives of the political parties that participate in the 
electoral process.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Embassy Does It Again"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Embassy has reverted to its old ways by 
protecting a military attache accused of murdering his 
Salvadoran bodyguard under circumstances that have not been 
clarified. With the same arrogance it has always displayed in 
total disregard for the Salvadoran authorities in other cases of 
similar violations, the U.S. Embassy quickly took the major out 
of the country virtually as a criminal would leave the country 
-- by not filing the requisite immigration paperwork. 
  The incident showed the lack of organization characteristic 
of the government. The Presidency accused the Embassy of 
hindering the investigations conducted by the Nacional Civilian 
Police [PNC] and the district attorney. The PNC and district 
attorney supported the accusation made by the Presidency. 
Attracted by a sense of nationalism, the president of the 
Supreme Court of Justice also expressed interest in the problem. 
The foreign minister, however, refuted everyone when he 
declared that the Embassy was in constant contact with him, that 
the major had diplomatic immunity, and that all Embassy 
officials can enter and leave the country freely. 
  On the other hand, the Embassy praised the Salvadoran 
authorities, as it had done very few times before, for its 
investigation and cooperation. If the Embassy is offering 
praise while government officials are protesting, then one of 
the two is lying, and neither of them have enough credibility 
for us to take their word at face value. Both have proven to be 
capable of lying quite openly. The fact that the victim is 
Salvadoran must not make us lose our perspective. The 
Salvadoran officials crazed by the ruling party's false 
nationalism have protested the Embassy's actions, thereby 
demonstrating their ignorance regarding diplomatic immunity and 
their provincialism. If they are so interested in justice, why 
do they not investigate why the military attache left the 
country. 
  The Embassy should have followed established immigration 
procedures rather than pulling the major out of the country like 
a criminal. The U.S. Government can also strip the major of his 
immunity so that he can be tried by the Salvadoran courts, but 
that would be asking too much. The Embassy is accustomed to 
acting with this kind of arrogance and disregard. Therefore, 
the Salvadoran authorities should not be surprised, because they 
have allowed this to go on for many years. Likewise, we must 
not overlook the friendly "agreements" reached over the 
telephone by the foreign minister and the Embassy. 
  Still, we must also ask ourselves: Who, on his own accord, 
would place himself in the hands of Salvadoran justice? The 
Embassy knows better than anyone else how it operates; it knows 
the vices that plague it, and the passionate nationalism of the 
magistrates, judges, and lawyers. To allow a U.S. citizen to be 
tried in El Salvador is to abandon him to the calvary the 
Salvadorans, who must deal with the judicial system, must 
endure. Despite all this, the United States has set a bad 
precedent when it proved, once again, that he who is the 
strongest can avoid the laws and justice.

  [Excerpt] On 11 February Paraguayan Interior Minister 
Carlos Podesta was asked at Government House whether the 
peasants of Tava'i Borda had been found to be armed. The 
minister answered: "We found no military weapons." He stated 
that leftist activists are operating in Tava'i Borda. He added: 
"I am warning my fellow countrymen, the peasants, not to 
participate in adventures at the invitation of some enthusiastic 
people, because most probably, at the time of truth, those 
enthusiastic people will be nowhere near the front line... I 
want to reiterate that according to information on hand, to the 
investigation we conducted, and to what we actually found, the 
peasants will not last five minutes in a battle." The minister 
stressed that he "does not want any innocent victims." 
  Podesta stated: "The leftists are there," adding that "there 
is nothing wrong with that.... It is no longer a sin to be a 
leftist." He went on to say that "it is still a sin, however, 
for leftists, rightists, centrists, people from above or below, 
to advocate breaking the law. It cannot be tolerated." 
  The minister indicated that sometimes the leftists, as well 
as other groups, advocate breaking the law. He did not specify 
which other groups. Podesta said: "Sometimes we tend to forget 
the rules of the game and if we find these rules inappropriate 
we have a democratic congress which we can ask to amend the law. 
Until the laws are amended they must be complied with. The law 
must be obeyed." 
  Podesta admitted that the state does not have a 
representative in Tava'i Borda, adding that state supervision is 
not good, nor should it last forever. He explained that the 
settling of the area began in 1989 "amid general approval, but 
nobody could have imagined that peasants would be expelling 
other peasants. Furthermore the administration was unable to 
provide the followup support to guarantee the success of the 
settlement." 
  The minister added that a state emergency program is under 
way to help the peasants. He announced that a permanent and 
broader plan will be implemented later. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Peasants from Guayaiby today blocked Route No. 3 
in San Pedro Department. They belong to the same group of 
peasants that had been evicted from a property owned by 
[Colorado Party] Senator Blas N. Riquelme, on which they were 
squatting. The National Police quelled the riot, causing 
injuries to 12 people. 
  [Begin National Police Chief Superintendent Mario A. Sapriza 
recording] At approximately 0900 this morning, a group of 
peasants who had been evicted from Mr. Riquelme's property 
blocked Route No. 3 with six logs that they laid on the highway. 
They even had gasoline at their disposal so as to set fire to 
these logs and also destroy the highway. This is the reason why 
the police had to intervene in this affair. They ordered the 
some 400 peasants who were blocking the road to leave and make 
way for vehicles, as there was already a bottleneck. The 
peasants, however, responded violently to the security forces. 
Hence, the riot police were summoned and following a clash that 
lasted approximately two or three minutes, they managed to drive 
them off. [end recording] 
  As a result of this crackdown, one peasant was seriously 
injured and 11 others sustained minor injuries. They were 
rushed to Santani clinic, located at Santani City, where they 
were given medical attention. [passage omitted] 
  Peasants blame the government for what happened today and 
expect it will try to find a solution to the conflict. 
  [Begin Adalberto Benitez, leader from the Struggle for Land 
Movement, recording] The way the government and institutions 
acted today is not surprising to us because they prefer to quash 
us instead of solving our land problems. This attitude finally 
goaded us into the use of force and into taking the measures we 
are taking to air our grievances. We want congressmen who sit 
on the Human Rights and Agrarian Reform Committees, the IBR 
[Agrarian Reform Institute], Judge Silvio Flores Mendoza, and 
the owner [of the property] to come here to settle the following 
issues: 
  1. The immediate release of our comrades who are being held 
in custody. 
  2. Clearing up the murder of our comrade Maximo Prieto. 
  3. Medical attention for our comrades who are in the 
hospital 
and for a child, who following the crackdown, developed mental 
problems due to the blows he received. 
  4. A commitent to investigate Senator Blas N. Riquelme's 
large, unproductive estates and the expropriation of the 5,000 
unproductive hectares we have laid claim to. 
  5. Immedate withdrawal of bulldozers and specialized riot 
police from the place and the return of our belongings. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Through a symbolic vote, the Brazilian Senate on 9 
February approved the quadripartite agreement on comprehensive 
nuclear safeguards signed in December 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, 
the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control 
(ABACC), and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
  The treaty's approval has put an end to rising speculation 
in 
the international community about Brazil's real commitment to 
using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in light of the fact 
that the bill was only approved after difficult discussions took 
place in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
  The German Government has conveyed satisfaction over the 
Senate's endorsement of the special inspections to be conducted 
by the IAEA, which will control the movement of nuclear 
materials to and from Brazilian facilities. In remarks to 
GAZETA MERCANTIL, a German Embassy source said: "It is a 
positive step, but we are still awaiting the approval of the 
amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty on nuclear nonproliferation 
in Latin America and the Caribbean." The Tlatelolco Treaty will 
be discussed after the Carnival celebrations. The source added: 
The nuclear issue will no longer be a problem for the visit 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim is scheduled to make to Germany on 
23 February. 
  In recent months, Germany has expressed great interest in 
the 
approval of the nuclear agreements by the Brazilian Congress 
because a German law will only authorize international 
cooperation in sensitive technology with countries that are 
signatories of comprehensive safeguards agreements with the 
IAEA. The deadline for the recipient country to meet this 
requirement expires late next year. 
  Foreign Minister Amorim also expressed satisfaction with the 
Senate vote that, in his opinion, clears the way for developed 
countries to provide technological cooperation to Brazil. 
  Amorim also noted that the quadripartite agreement is more 
important than the Tlatelolco amendments -- which have yet to be 
approved -- for the international community because the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons in Latin America, 
is applicable only to the region. Both Amorim and the German 
Embassy have expressed confidence that the Tlatelolco amendments 
will be approved in the next few weeks. 
  Argentina, which is Brazil's partner in peaceful nuclear 
projects because they both set up ABACC, also has welcomed the 
agreement's approval. A Buenos Aires source said: "The image 
of the two countries, particularly on the nuclear issue, will 
improve." The Argentine Congress already had approved both the 
quadripartite agreement and the Tlatelolco amendments some time 
ago.

  [Text] The PP [Popular Party] federal deputy for Sao Paulo, 
Alberto Haddad, escaped a bomb attack in his political office in 
Pinheiros (western Sao Paulo). This information had been kept 
secret since 2 February, when the PM [Military Police] bomb 
squad was called. There are no clues on who planted the bomb. "I 
have suspicions about my enemies within the party," Haddad said.

<F P=106> [Article by Andre Lozano from Manaus Bureau] </F>
  [Text] The Coordinating Board of Brazilian Amazon Region 
Indian Organizations (Coiab) and the Ibama [Brazilian Institute 
for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources] have 
accused Colombians of fostering the smuggling of fish out of the 
Amazon region into the United States. Both agencies estimate 
that returns on the illegal business with alevins (newly-hatched 
fish) amount to $2.4 million per week. 
  The Pastoral for Indigenous Communities of the Upper 
Solimoes 
contends that former members of the gang of Colombian drug 
kingpin Pablo Escobar, who died recently, might be members of 
the band of fish smugglers. 
  According to Father Joseney Lira, the Colombians leave their 
country through the city of Leticia, enter Brazil through 
Tabatinga, and go to the cities of Atalaia do Norte and Benjamin 
Constant, Amazonas State, using the Javari River. Lira said: 
"Most smuggling occurs in these two municipal districts. The 
Colombians purchase alevins at puny prices and resell them for 
600 real cruzeiros each." 
  The smuggled fish reportedly enter Colombia through Leticia, 
are flown by airplane to Bogota, and then to Miami (United 
States of America). Amazonas PF [federal police] Superintendent 
Mauro Sposito said the smuggled fish are also used to camouflage 
cocaine shipments from Leticia to the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Eduardo Alves] </F>
  [Text] Luiz Inacio Lula Silva did not like the draft 
government program that he asked the PT [Workers Party] to 
design. He decided to react against some of the topics defined 
by the party, and will designate Sao Paulo federal Deputy 
Aloizio Mercadante to introduce the changes he considers 
essential in the text. The orthodox majority ruling the party 
has been hostile to Mercadante. 
  For example, Lula does not agree with a moratorium being 
included in the party program, not even as a possibility. He 
believes a moratorium is a unilateral measure. He advocates 
"political renegotiation" with the governments of creditor 
countries. If the principle of "default" is admitted in an 
official document of his candidacy, Lula says, it will be 
ridiculous to advocate renegotiation. 
  Lula also disagrees with the emphasis the preliminary 
document attached to privatization. First, because he fears that 
it will be almost impossible to reverse some of the 
privatizations, something that almost all PT groups have 
demanded. Second, because he believes the so-called "strategic 
areas" in which the party will not agree to private control will 
be questioned by the revisionist Congress, which will be an 
appropriate forum for maintaining, for example, the petroleum 
and telecommunications monopolies. 
  Lula also disliked the chapter dealing with land reform. He 
wants a section on a farm policy especially favoring the owners 
of small farms. Lula also disagreed with the emphasis the party 
attached to the debates on the military. While he does not want 
to overemphasize the importance of the military in the document, 
the party is turning the subject into a central issue of the 
debates. 
  Another restriction that Lula marked on the draft program is 
the inclusion, even if "shameful," of socialist prospects. Lula 
does not want references to socialism in the text because he 
believes the program cannot be a strictly partisan document, 
because this will make it impossible for the party to make 
alliances. 
  Lula and Mercadante held a long phone talk on 9 February, 
and 
they had a meeting scheduled for the evening. In the morning, 
Lula told the deputy that the public considered him his main 
economic adviser, and that it was time for Mercadante to 
participate in the internal debate. 
  Mercadante said he will participate in the debates on the 
program. He will outline a critical view of what has been done 
so far. "The program lacks targets, objectives, and 
quantification," he said. 
  The deputy's opinion on the functioning of Lula's campaign 
is 
shared by a great majority of those close to Lula. "Wherever 
Lula goes, things work. The part that depends on the party is 
not operating properly," he said. Mercadante will attend a PT 
executive board meeting on 17 February, at which attempts will 
be made to introduce changes into the program. 
  PT Vice President Rui Falcao, who leads the faction that 
opposes Mercadante within the PT, has labelled his rival's 
joining the debates as "positive."

<F P=106> [Interview with Attorney General Aristides Junqueira by </F>
Joyce Russi and Bartolomeu Rodrigues in Brasilia on 10 February] 
  [Text] Brasilia -- Attorney General Aristides Junqueira on 
10 February asserted that the only way to prevent the 
promulgation of the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) from being 
reviewed by the Federal Supreme Court (STF) is by concluding the 
constitutional revision work as scheduled on 15 March. Junqueira 
believes that the possibility of extending the deadline 
established by Congress' internal regulations -- the party 
leaders already are negotiating to extend the deadline until 30 
April -- does not allow the promulgation of amendments in stages 
as they are approved, a process known as "salami amendments" 
[promulgating them slice by slice], because otherwise there 
would be a risk of turning the constitutional revision into an 
endless process. This is why the attorney general wants to file 
a case before the Federal Supreme Court to prevent the 
promulgation of amendments by stages, although he is sure that 
the political parties that oppose the constitutional revision 
will do so before him. 
  [O ESTADO] Couldn't your intention to resort to the Federal 
Supreme Court if the Social Emergency Fund is promulgated create 
a new crisis among the government branches? 
  [Junqueira] That is exactly my concern. Article 3 of the 
Temporary Dispositions of the Constitution allows a 
constitutional revision five years after its proclamation. The 
criterion in that article are flexible and allow changes in a 
much easier way than what is established in the text of the 
Constitution. It establishes that the amendments must be 
approved by three-fifths of the congressmen in a simultaneous 
voting session in the two chambers and in two voting rounds. 
According to Article 3, all the constitutional amendments must 
be promulgated at the same time. Thus, we have two 
alternatives: either to close the constitutional revision 
process once an amendment is proclaimed, or to strictly comply 
with the period of time established to finish the work [to 
proclaim all the amendments together]. If the deadline is 
extended, the revision will run the risk of lasting indefinitely. 
  [O ESTADO] Even if Congress' internal regulations allow the 
promulgation of amendments as they are approved? 
  [Junqueira] That is not appropriate based on the 
interpretation of Article 3 of the Transitory Dispositions and 
the text of the Constitution itself. However, if the 
constitutional revision ends on the established date, the 
problem would be smaller because then the promulgation of 
amendments by parts would be irrelevant. We need to know the 
size of the salami. 
  [O ESTADO] And if the work was extended a short period of 
time? 
  [Junqueira] An extension is not possible. The two things do 
not combine with each other. 
  [O ESTADO] Isn't this an internal congressional problem? 
  [Junqueira] No, it is a constitutional problem that pertains 
to the Federal Supreme Court. 
  [O ESTADO] Then you will not think twice about filing a case 
before the Federal Supreme Court if the Social Emergency Fund is 
promulgated? 
  [Junqueira] If any deputy decides to file a case before the 
Federal Supreme Court after an amendment is promulgated, the 
court will have to make a decision. This is a serious matter 
that deserves juridical analysis. Whoever wishes to object to 
the constitutional revision through an injunction will have 
considerable arguments to do so. 
  [O ESTADO] Would you do that? 
  [Junqueira] If a second amendment is promulgated, I 
understand that the constitutional revision will have ended with 
the promulgation of the first one. 
  [O ESTADO] Is this a threat to the constitutional revision? 
  [Junqueira] I am not threatening but calling attention to a 
problem that may be created. 
  [O ESTADO] Are you against the constitutional revision right 
now? 
  [Junqueira] It is not my business to give an opinion about 
the constitutional revision. 
  [O ESTADO] Don't the latest scandals justify a 
constitutional 
revision to give the judicial branch more efficient instruments 
with which to combat corruption? 
  [Junqueira] Will they really be revised? 
  [O ESTADO] Why wouldn't they? 
  [Junqueira] Because they affect the congressmen themselves. 
  [O ESTADO] Would Congress corporatism reach that point? 
  [Junqueira] I do not know. I hope not. My concern is that we 
are always worried with amending the Constitution rather than 
complying with it. That is not the way I understand the 
Constitution. I understand it as something that limits the 
actions of government. If those limits did not exist or were 
amended by any absolute majority with the easiness of this 
revision, I do not think our future will be too good. 
  [O ESTADO] Are you in favor of external control of the 
Judicial Branch? 
  [Junqueira] Yes, as long as it does not interfere with the 
conscience of the judges. I think a control would be very 
healthy in the disciplinary field. The judicial branch's 
self-control has been very inefficient to correct the mistakes 
or defects of some judges. I even dare to imagine a mutual 
control among the magistrates, the Attorney General's Office, 
and the Brazilian Attorney's Association. Each one could control 
each other through mechanisms that would allow bad judges or bad 
prosecutors or bad lawyers to be fired.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Feb (DPA) -- Today in Santa 
Fe de Bogota at the start of a three-day official visit to 
Colombia, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori defended his 
government's measures to fight the "Shining Path" terrorist 
group. Fujimori, in brief statements to the press, said his 
country could no longer tolerate attacks by the fundamentalist 
Maoist group; therefore he implemented severe measures, like the 
so-called "self-coup" in April 1992, when he dissolved Congress 
and assumed extraordinary powers. 
  "What country in the world would accept 25,000 deaths 
(number 
of victims caused by political violence in Peru since 1980)? No 
developed country would have allowed this. That is why we took 
the appropriate measures; some of them were tough, but 
effective," the president said. 
  The Peruvian president, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota 
this morning and met at noon with his Colombian colleague Cesar 
Gaviria, said his visit shows the good relations between the two 
countries. 
  According to Narino House sources, Gaviria and Fujimori 
discussed basic topics like the fight against the 
drug-trafficking mafia and communist guerrilla groups, as well 
as the results of the Peruvian-Colombian Joint Commission to 
protect the Amazon jungle at their first meeting. 
  After speaking with Gaviria, Fujimori met for a few minutes 
with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and laid a wreath at the 
statue of Liberator Simon Bolivar, located in the historic 
central plaza surrounded by the Congress and Bogota's main 
Cathedral. 
  Tomorrow, Fujimori will explain to Colombian businessmen the 
measures he has adopted to internationalize the Peruvian economy 
to attract foreign capital. 
  Fujimori arrived in Colombia accompanied by Prime Minister 
Alfonso Bustamante, Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg, Health 
Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne, Fisheries Minister Jaime Sobero, 
and several ruling party congressmen and businessmen.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori said today in Santa Fe de Bogota that 
by the end of his term there will be no more terrorism in Peru, 
because he will wipe it out. 
  "Two of the world's most violent terrorist groups are being 
defeated, and by the end of my term they will no longer exist," 
Fujimori said, referring to the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). 
  Fujimori, who began a two-day official visit to Colombia 
today, made the statement to journalists at the end of his first 
meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. 
  According to the Peruvian president, terrorism and 
subversive 
violence have claimed 25,000 lives in Peru. 
  He asked jokingly: "What has been the meaning of `Emperor' 
Fujimori's government?" He replied that his government "is 
defeating" the violent groups. 
  Fujimori reiterated by the time his constitutional terms 
ends 
"neither the SL nor the MRTA will exist in Peru. I am going to 
wipe them out." 
  Fujimori and Gaviria discussed during their first meeting 
topics such as drug trafficking and guerrillas, topics that 
affect both countries. They also discussed bilateral relations. 
  Both leaders will lay the groundwork for the creation of a 
Binational Neighbor Commission, and tomorrow they will sign a 
joint declaration in which they will announce new mechanisms of 
cooperation for the struggle against drug trafficking and 
guerrillas.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "There Is No Reason"] </F>
  [Text] It is incredible, unbelievable, to see how trivial 
events can push the country into a crisis that could have very 
serious consequences. The reason for what is happening is the 
simple presence of a small group of U.S. soldiers who want to 
build a school, a road, and a base. These are works that will 
benefit Colombia. The U.S. soldiers will be leaving the country 
shortly. Efforts are being made to give this episode 
constitutional significance. The State Council admitted that 
the Constitution could have been violated, transferred the 
incident to the Chamber of Representatives, and hinted that the 
president should face trial. If one looks into the origin of 
the problem, we would find that it does not have the importance 
some people are trying to give it. The problem is serious, 
though, because as the matter unfolds, dangerous elements may 
appear. 
  The State Council has every right to issue an opinion but it 
has not replied to the government's legal pronouncement and, on 
the other hand, has spoken about whether the Constitution was 
violated. As Colombians we respect what the State Council 
members think, but we believe that their position is undue 
because the authorization by the president, or the government, 
rather, of the presence of foreign soldiers has well-known 
precedents. Military missions or ships with crews from other 
countries arrive and disembark, not for warlike actions but to 
fulfill protocol activities. This is not a violation of 
sovereignty. We think that the Constitution specifically states 
that permits are necessary when armed personnel go through 
Colombian territory with the intention of intervening in a 
conflict in another country. 
  We hope we do not appear distrusting if we say that we think 
that the nasty preelectoral climate exerts influence on 
decisions in which the interests of the fatherland should 
prevail over any other motivation. Can anybody imagine that the 
presence of these U.S. soldiers implies a violation of our 
sovereignty? Are Colombia's liberty and independence in danger 
for allowing the performance of works that do not involve 
warlike activities at all? Those who have visited or are 
visiting Juanchaco could testify that the soldiers are armed 
only with shovels and that the tanks are simple tractors. 
  The president is defending a government branch, the National 
Defense Ministry, or more specifically the Armed Forces. We 
would be the first ones to demand all sorts of sanctions or 
adopting urgent measures if the sovereignty of the homeland we 
love so dearly was in danger. We therefore support the 
president, because the opposite is true. National peace is not 
consolidated with actions as the ones to which this editorial 
regrettably refers. 
  We ask our compatriots to listen to the president, evaluate 
the news conference he gave on 9 February not only to 
journalists but to the general public. Analyze the government's 
position and the valid reasons given by a president who has been 
doing a good job. We should also realize that those who want to 
attain power and are seeking future political positions take 
advantage of well-known incidents to try to undermine the 
prestige President Gaviria has honestly earned during the last 
months of his administration.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Curtain of Lies"] </F>
  [Text] One of the worst things that could happen to a head 
of state is losing his credibility with the people. That is what 
happened to President Nixon, and we all know the consequences he 
had to face, ending with his resignation from his post. The 
smoke screen, or lies, to use a strong but realistic word, which 
the President has created to cover up two events have no 
justification. 
  The first event is that he violated the Constitution by not 
consulting the Senate, or if that was not possible, the State 
Council, before authorizing the transit, not only the transit, 
but the installation of U.S. troops in various parts of our 
country. This action, as the State Council members have 
unanimously agreed, hurts our national sovereignty. 
  The second event is the president's stubborn attempt to hide 
the truth about the activities carried out by the U.S. soldiers 
in our country, which have gradually been disclosed. It has been 
learned that they are not here simply to build a school or a 
health center at a beach in the Pacific Ocean in Valle del Cauca 
Department. 
  The accusation of indignity, for which President Gaviria 
could be judged should the Chamber of Representatives accept the 
State Council's request, would be the result of constant 
attempts by the government and its officials to try and hide 
facts or actions that were finally disclosed or partially 
revealed with vague or unclear intentions, or carry out actions 
that violate the laws and regulations approved by the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  During the current administration, the permanent violation 
of 
juridical and constitutional regulations has been almost a 
normal practice in implementing various economic and political, 
and even judicial measures. In the case of the agreement signed 
by the defense minister and the U.S. ambassador supposedly to 
obtain assistance from military engineers to build facilities 
that could be built by Colombians, the president invoked an old 
treaty, from the time of the Cold War, which according to some 
people has not been ratified by Congress. 
  The treaty and the juridical situation are not the most 
serious problems he faces. The fact that he took advantage of a 
congressional recess to infringe on the Constitution by allowing 
the entrance of foreign soldiers who are currently operating in 
Juanchaco, in the eastern plains, and the control of some radar 
that scan our skies are also serious. He did this without 
consulting the State Council, which was his constitutional duty. 
  Now the State Council has issued an urgent call to the 
Attorney General, asking him to initiate a possible disciplinary 
action against the president. It also submitted a unanimously 
approved statement to the Accusations Commission of the Chamber 
of Representatives, asking them to take immediate action to 
determine if the president should face a political and penal 
trial for his prevarications. 
  The president's attacks on a high body of the judicial 
branch, like the State Council, are unjust and senseless. He has 
attributed statements to the State Council which it never made. 
During his 9 February news conference, he said the State 
Council's declaration would prevent the appointment of military 
attaches from other countries. Nowhere in its letter to the 
president or in its 9 February declaration did the State Council 
make such a statement. It was also absurd, almost irrational, to 
describe the members of the State Council or anyone else opposed 
to the presence of the U.S. soldiers as accomplices of drug 
trafficking. 
  Are the U.S. soldiers here to implement, using the Vienna 
Convention, the policy of repression which the United States has 
already announced will not be applicable in that drug-consuming 
country, but which is applicable in drug-producing countries 
with the bloody results we have seen in Colombia? Why were the 
Colombian people not informed that the detachments sent from a 
base in Alabama are here for that purpose? Why did the Juridical 
Secretariat of the Palace threaten Senator Gomez Hurtado with 
removal from Congress if he dared to inspect the area near 
Juanchaco? What unspeakable pressure is there behind this drama 
which has led the State Council to make such a serious decision 
as the one it recently made by categorically affirming that the 
head of state broke the oath he made when he assumed the 
position his compatriots gave him at the polls and which has 
endangered national sovereignty?

<F P=106> [Column by Enrique Santos Calderon] </F>
  [Text] How things change. Until a few weeks ago President 
Gaviria enjoyed a prestige and popularity not very common for a 
president so close to the end of his term. He was way ahead, 
perhaps too far ahead. 
  In less than a month his radiant image has dimmed 
noticeably. 
The airplane episode [in which musicians traveled on government 
aircraft] and the Juanchaco problem -- the disappointment 
["Juanchasco" -- play on Spanish word chasco] -- has eroded 
presidential credibility. Paraphrasing the latest vallenato 
[Colombian folk dance] tune, one could say that the bottom has 
fallen out of Gaviria's popularity. 
  The truth is that it is regrettable. But one could see 
something of the sort coming. I hate quoting myself, but 15 
days ago I warned in this column that one got the impression 
that the president was slacking off certain affairs and that it 
was not advisable to let go of the reigns of power in a country 
as unpredictable as ours. Among other reasons, this is because 
there is nothing so fickle as public opinion about a president 
and any negligence in an area sensitive to public opinion can 
wipe away any prestige in a matter of days. 
  The affair dealing with the presidential airplane -- one of 
those slips that public opinion tolerate less and less from 
politicians and presidents -- has taken a back seat in the face 
of the Juanchaco affair following the unanimous decision by the 
State Council to request the Chamber of Deputies Accusation 
Commission to investigate the president's conduct. 
  This is how a white lie, the negligent and light treatment 
of 
a potentially explosive topic, became a crisis of state in a 
delicate legal-political process that can end up as a trial 
against the president by Congress for violation of the country's 
Constitution and national sovereignty. 
  If the country is spoken to clearly and frankly on the 
presence of U.S. military units in Juanchaco and if the people 
are told directly why they are here or even told that they are 
here to help us fight drug trafficking and terrorism, I am sure 
that a very positive current of opinion would have been 
generated in favor of the arrival of the corps of engineers 
military battalion. 
  But when trivial explanations or artful subterfuge are 
resorted to, when legal entities are bypassed for the sake of 
commodity or ease, and when contradictions and inconsistencies 
begin to appear, public opinion starts to become distrustful and 
critical. The fact is that nobody, even if they are in total 
favor of the U.S. military presence, likes to be told half 
truths or have the pill sweetened. 
  Openness is what was lacking right from the start. Such a 
fashionable concept was totally absent, especially in the 
statements of many high-ranking government officials who forgot 
to apply it when they should have remembered it the most. 
  The closest presidential advisers are to blame in this 
regard. Perhaps they have been too naive, dull, or slow, or they 
are simply inexperienced. 
  The lack of a more open and honest attitude with the public 
during difficult moments has affected the Gaviria administration 
on other occasions. The blackout, Escobar's escape, and the 
presidential plane incident have been situations in which 
Colombians got the impression that they were being cheated. It 
is true that every time this impression has become general, the 
president has faced up to things and has called news conferences 
to clear any doubts. But it is always difficult to erase the 
initial bad taste of knowing that someone was trying to deceive 
you. 
  This said, I should add that I believe the Juanchaco 
situation is being blown out of proportion. It seems as though 
we are being invaded militarily by an enemy foreign power. But 
anything is possible in a country where more value is given to 
the form than the spirit of the law. 
  We should not forget either the repeated tensions between 
the 
Executive Branch and the State Council, whose statement will 
create a difficult political situation for the president, 
particularly because we are in an electoral campaign toward the 
end of an administration. This is the time in which all 
opportunisms emerge, new opposition members sprout, and 
everywhere the most unsuspected defenders of national 
sovereignty appear. 
  The electoral use of the Juanchaco episode should not 
convince anyone. Its political use is too obvious and clumsy. 
That the campaign against the "yankee invasion" is being led by 
those who are encouraging the terrorist destruction of our 
economic infrastructure -- which is truly vital for our 
sovereignty -- is just another depressing chapter in this 
electoral chauvinism. 
  It is sad, ironic, and certainly unfair that a good and 
capable president must suffer all these hardships toward the end 
of his mandate. Everything indicated that Gaviria would finish 
his presidential period with flying colors. However, instead of 
being carried out on people's shoulders through the big door, he 
suddenly ends up gored in the infirmary. 
  The reason behind this is that this mad bull called Colombia 
charges without warning and gores treacherously. That is why it 
is always advised to take the bull by the horns without letting 
go for a minute until the next bullfighter comes along -- never 
before then.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian and 
international cocaine cartels are now resorting to using 
minisubmarines to smuggle cocaine, the Colombian police 
disclosed today. 
  Colombian police seized seven of these minisubmarines in 
1993, according to a report released by the Administrative 
Department of Security (DAS -- the secret police) and published 
today by the Santa Fe de Bogota daily EL ESPECTADOR. According 
to the report, the DAS and Interpol have determined that the 
submarines used for shipping large amounts of drugs to Europe 
and the United States are manufactured in Santa Marta and 
Barraquilla, two Colombian ports on the Caribbean coast. 
  EL ESPECTADOR disclosed that these minisubmarines are five 
meters long and equipped with electronic systems that allow them 
to navigate just a few meters deep and as shallow as one meter 
below the water surface. Colombian authorities first seized 
submarines that were smuggling cocaine a few months ago, and 
this allowed them to determine that the shipments were leaving 
Santa Marta and Barranquilla en route to black markets in the 
United States and Europe. 
  DAS Director Fernando Brito explained that with these 
minisubmarines, drug traffickers avoid radar and naval convoys 
patrolling international waters. He said that after the use of 
these minisubmarines was discovered in 1993, authorities 
intensified their efforts in fighting drug trafficking at sea, 
which is conducted by way of cargo ships and the minisubmarines. 
The minisubmarines are made of fiberglass, which insulates them 
from the sea's temperatures. 
  Investigations by Colombian authorities warn that the 
Italian 
and Colombian drug cartels are taking advantage of the political 
turmoil in some European countries and their lack of resources 
for fighting drug trafficking. EL ESPECTADOR emphasized that 
the capos of the Cali Cartel are closely linked to the Italian 
Mafia and some Israelis, warning that their presence was 
detected in Colombia in 1993. 
  EL ESPECTADOR also pointed out that recent investigations 
have established that the Cali Cartel is using Ecuador and 
Venezuela as transshipment points. In these two nations, the 
Cali Cartel has established front companies that it usese to 
ship containers to Europe and the United States. 
  The newspaper concluded by saying the DAS will forward a 
report to the Interpol Secretariat headquartered in France with 
a description of the labels the drug traffickers use on packages 
that contain drugs. This document will be distributed in 167 
countries affiliated with Interpol, along with a list of names 
and codes used by the drug traffickers. According to a DEA 
report, the Cali Cartel is responsible for 80 percent of the 
world's cocaine trafficking.

  [Text] The magazine SEMANA reported today that Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff, acting on his own and without 
consulting anyone, has been negotiating for more than a month 
with the Cali Cartel. According to the publication, the document 
signed by De Greiff reportedly gave a kind of safe-conduct pass 
to alleged Cali and Tulua drug traffickers to keep them from 
being arrested. The names of these drug traffickers are 
well-known figure Pacho Herrera, Jose Olmedo Campo, and a man 
named Renteria. According to the magazine, the passes would 
clearly show Prosecutor De Greiff has been in direct contact 
with Cali Cartel leaders for more than a month, without 
previously consulting the government or informing the security 
corps or the Attorney General's Office. SEMANA said a top 
government source expressed the government's surprise about the 
actions taken individually and privately by the prosecutor, 
because late last year the government and this office agreed to 
keep each other informed of any developments. 
  According to SEMANA, the serious thing about the case is not 
the fact that the prosecutor is acting like a loose cannon, but 
that from the moment when the drug traffickers first came to his 
office -- on 14 January -- it marked the beginning of the 
preliminary investigations. In other words, this marked the 
beginning of the search for evidence that must be provided by 
the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], the Dijin 
[Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] in Colombia, 
and Interpol. The odd thing is that the Prosecutor General's 
Office did not officially inform any of these organizations.

  [Excerpt] Just a few minutes ago, the National Police 
director handed President Cesar Gaviria the final report on 
changes that will enable the National Police to provide better 
services. With this, the National Police entered a new era 
today, which was the deadline for reforming the institution. 
  A commissioner has been appointed to oversee relations 
between the police and the community. In just one month, the 
commissioner has received 60 complaints concerning abuses of 
power. Meanwhile, 5,300 policemen have been dismissed for 
disciplinary reasons during the year of reorganization. 
  [Begin Defense Minister Rafael Pardo recording] This package 
of reforms will strengthen the National Police, and it will 
enable the organization to provide more efficient services to 
all Colombians. This process should be accompanied by citizens 
showing greater respect for the police and, in general, for all 
of the authorities trying to improve national security. [end 
recording] 
  Subdirectorates specializing in urban and rural patrols were 
created, as well as one that will include the participation of 
the public. The police will follow a line of action that is 
less military and more oriented toward civilian society. Also, 
the Police Social Security Institute has been created to look 
after police, and will provide education, housing, and health 
programs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The first Environment Minister Manuel Rodriguez 
Becerra assumed his post just a few weeks ago, and the Attorney 
General's Office has already filed charges against him. The 
charges involve the cutting of trees in the forests of El Choco 
Department. 
  According to investigations, the minister and 20 other 
officials of the Choco [word indistinct] Company, CodeChoco, 
authorized the indiscriminate cutting of over 200,000 hectares 
of forest in 1980. Investigations reveal that Rodriguez Becerra, 
who was the director of Indirena [Institute for Development of 
Renewable Natural Resources] at the time and a member of the 
CodeChoco Board of Directors, did not control or verify the 
permits of five companies, including (Barza 1 and Barza 2), for 
exploiting the lumber in the (Chajerado) area. The new minister 
feels that the Codechoco Board of Directors are not responsible 
for that ecological crime. 
  [Begin Rodriguez Becerra recording] I did not directly 
participate, nor am I responsible for the exploitation of lumber 
in the Indian territories. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, the Attorney General's Office has said the 
exploitation authorized by CodeChoco led to the extinction of 
over 10 animal species, contamination of the Atrato River, and 
the expulsion of Indian communities from southern Choco.

  [Text] Quito -- The Ecuadoran Government has rejected the 
label of unrealistic that European Union [EU] authorities have 
used for a proposal that was presented by five Latin American 
countries to increase their banana export quotas to the European 
market. 
  Representatives of the Ecuadoran, Guatemalan, Honduran, 
Panamanian, and Mexican governments a few days ago presented to 
Rene Speicken, European agriculture commissioner, a Latin 
American proposal to abolish the current license system and 
establish a higher tariff without allocation to countries for 
non-EU suppliers. [sentence as heard] 
  The European Union had labeled as unrealistic the new 
proposal presented by several Latin American countries on the 
system to export bananas to the EU market. Jose Vicente 
Maldonado, Ecuadoran industries and commerce minister, has said 
labeling the proposal as unrealistic is equivalent to labeling 
as unrealistic the commercial opening and economic globalization 
processes that have originated in the European Community. 
  The European Union today announced the withdrawal of its 
most 
recent proposal on banana imports due to the five Latin American 
countries that had filed a lawsuit at GATT; only Colombia and 
Costa Rica had accepted the proposal. 
  According to a report from Santa Fe de Bogota, the Colombian 
banana industry on Friday considered the possibility of joining 
forces with Guatemala to file a third recourse at GATT against 
the EU's banana-importing system. Juan Diego Velez, president 
of the Association of Uraba Banana Producers, has said this 
possibility will have to be studied, because the Colombian 
banana market's situation is unfavorable. According to Velez, 
Colombian banana producers have already lost approximately $32 
million since the EU changed the terms for importing bananas.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Industry, Commerce, Integration, </F>
and Fisheries Jose Maldonado Davila; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Quito--Jose Maldonado Davila, the new minister of 
industry, commerce, integration, and fisheries, has announced 
that the body he heads is working closely with the nation's 
business sector to strengthen the productive apparatus, to 
develop foreign trade, and to strengthen social action in 
response to the challenges posed by the globalization of the 
economy. 
  Emphasizing that the development of the nation's foreign 
trade will be the first priority during his administration, he 
also emphasized the need to simplify the procedures in that 
sector and to intensify the processes of integration and 
establishment of bilateral commercial agreements. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] What level of concern do foreign trade and the 
processes of integration merit? 
  [Maldonado] During my administration, foreign trade will be 
the number one priority. It is essential that we speed up the 
processes of integration; strengthen the Andean Pact agreements 
and the relationships we must maintain with other countries as a 
community, as the Andean Pact; reinforce the bilateral relations 
our country has with other nations; strengthen the policy of 
fostering open trade with the world; and integrate our country 
in the world process and in technological and economic 
globalization. Blocs are being formed on every continent, and it 
is therefore necessary to strengthen our economic bloc in the 
Andean area, comprising Chile, Mexico, the MERCOSUR [Common 
Market of the South], and the rest of the Latin American 
countries. There is not the slightest doubt that, for Ecuador's 
nontraditional products in particular, the Latin American market 
is very important, very promising. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] Is Ecuador experiencing difficulties with 
Colombia with regard to the sale of alcoholic beverages and iron 
to Venezuela? How will this situation be handled? 
  [Maldonado] We must demand that all countries adhere to 
those 
mechanisms that the agreements in the Andean area already 
provide. This will perhaps be the focus of the first efforts 
made by the ministry. I will be meeting with representatives of 
the domestic liquor industry and the domestic iron and steel 
industry for the purpose of developing a strategy. This strategy 
must be one that is best suited to the standardization and 
regularization of the situation involving dumping and the 
marketing of liquors by the Accord Commission. All of the Andean 
countries must adhere to the mechanisms in effect. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] What will the policy pursued with regard to 
medicines be? 
  [Maldonado] Each industrial sector has its own special 
characteristics and its own production, market, sales, and price 
problems. I will have to meet with representatives of all the 
sectors, so that within the framework of an overall policy for 
the development of industry and trade, we can proceed to resolve 
each of the problems they encounter. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] Do you advocate the liberalization of medicine 
prices? 
  [Maldonado] That is a problem we will have to study at the 
ministry. I do not have a precise definition to give you on this 
matter. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] Although the norms for holding back coffee are 
in effect, has it not been announced that Ecuador will not 
comply with these regulations? 
  [Maldonado] I will be happy to respond to questions on these 
current issues after I have held meetings with the sectorial 
representatives and those who have studied this policy. What I 
should indeed mention is that the government will support all of 
the efforts made by the private sector to ensure growth and 
development, to create jobs, and to advance the social 
development of the country. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] If you foresee an open door for the productive 
sectors, how will this be achieved? 
  [Maldonado] It will be achieved based on mutual cooperation 
through permanent dialogue and the harmonizing of the policies 
pursued and the efforts made, and with a view to facing up 
successfully to the challenge of competition on our own market 
and foreign markets. We must modernize industry in terms of 
quality, obtain better yields and better prices, and provide the 
appropriate legal-reference framework that industry needs in 
order to develop. In the final analysis, the productive sector 
is demanding clear rules of the game and the simplification of 
the state. I have been in the forefront of the battle for 
modernization, and I am confident that I will be able to sign 
the draft decree that has been submitted to the president of the 
Republic before this week is over. This decree will abrogate a 
series of accords, regulations, and decrees that are definitely 
making the task of the state and the productive sector more 
difficult. 
  We are going to put a very special effort into this process 
of simplifying the state, and to this end we will work together 
with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and all of the 
sectors that deal with the nation's productive process on a 
daily basis. 
  An effort is being made to simplify about 3,000 agreements, 
regulations, and normative Ecuadoran legislative texts that 
pertain not only to the norming of the productive sector, but to 
the state as a whole and to the procedures involved in importing 
raw materials and exporting. This means price setting and the 
elimination of a series of administrative hindrances. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] Will the single form for exports be eliminated 
in this simplification process, as the business sector is 
demanding? 
  [Maldonado] I cannot give you any details as yet, but as 
soon 
as I have the information, I will reveal everything involving 
this ministry. 
  [EL UNIVERSO] It is said that with you in office, concrete 
agreements within the Andean Group are guaranteed. 
  [Maldonado] I believe that considerable progress has been 
made. What we need to do is to speed up the process. A series of 
negotiations with other countries is being pursued by the Andean 
Pact, as a community, and very important bilateral agreements 
are also under way. 
  The task of this ministry is not Andean integration alone, 
but foreign trade in general. It is obvious that we must 
therefore combine our efforts with those being made by the 
Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ana Lucia Armijos, president of the Monetary </F>
Board, by Roberto Peralta Cardenas; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The first step included in the plans for the new 
year is the reduction of expenditures in the public sector, 
Monetary Board President Ana Lucia Armijos has announced. 
  In an interview with EL UNIVERSO, this official emphasized 
that the goals set for the government do not mean that a period 
of stagnation lies ahead for the economy. On the contrary, the 
reactivation of the productive apparatus will basically be 
supported by the dynamism of the private sector, and in part by 
the improvement in the levels of public investment. 
  Armijos explained that despite the fact that production 
growth came to about 2 percent in 1993, as compared with 3.5 
percent in 1992, the rate of growth in the gross formation of 
fixed capital exceeded 50 percent. This represents growth that 
is greater than the increase in the population. 
  "Greater growth in productive activity, in both the public 
and private sectors, is expected in 1994," she said. 
<H5>  Inflation Below 20 Percent </H5>
  She stated that the government will seek to provide the 
economy with responsible fiscal management in 1994, making it 
possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation at a rate of 
less than 20 percent by the end of 1994. 
  Armijos did not mention the goal of 15-percent annual 
inflation for 1994, to which reference has been made over the 
past several months, in what might be interpreted as one of 
the principal effects of the most recent fiscal crisis. 
  Armijos said that as of the end of 1993, the greatest social 
benefit provided to the people of Ecuador by the government of 
Sixto Duran-Ballen has been the reduction in inflation. 
  This official refuted the criticisms voiced by businessmen 
who maintain that on balance 1993 was a year of recession. She 
went on to say that intermediary credit for the financial sector 
increased by 30 percent, in real terms, so that it can be said 
that the formal sector had adequate resources for the financing 
of its activities. 
  Armijos said that the monetary and foreign-exchange boards 
will continue to be used in 1994. This will make strict control 
of liquidity possible. She further said that it is expected that 
the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System will be "taken 
up and approved by the Congress" within the first two months of 
the year. 
  Our interview with the head of the body that directs the 
economy follows. 
  [Cardenas] How do you assess the economic activity in 1993, 
as 1994 begins? What is the legacy left for the new year? 
  [Armijos] In the year just ended, it was possible to reduce 
inflation to 31 percent--a goal that for more than five years, 
the preceding governments were unable to achieve. The goal for 
the reduction of inflation was reached thanks to the 
responsible, consistent, and concerted effort made in the 
monetary and fiscal sectors. Other important achievements 
include the stabilization of the rate of exchange, the 
stabilization of the financial market, and a substantial 
reduction in the fiscal deficit. In addition, the foreign sector 
was strengthened, enabling the country to accumulate reserves of 
more than $1 billion since the program was adopted. 
  In 1993, the country made progress toward the more flexible 
use of the tools of economic policy. Better management of the 
utilization of the tools of monetary policy based on the market 
was achieved. A new system was designed for interest rates, 
allowing greater flexibility for the middlemen and greater 
efficiency in the allocation of financial resources. And the 
foreign-exchange policy was made fully flexible, with a view to 
rendering the establishment of the most important price in the 
economy--the rate of exchange--a much clearer process. 
  [Cardenas] What is the lesson taught by the achievement of 
the inflationary goal in the year just ended? Are there some who 
maintain that it is a relative success? 
  [Armijos] There is no sense in speaking of a relative 
success 
when we have succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation from 60 
percent in December of 1992 to 31 percent in December of 1993. 
This is the greatest social benefit the government of architect 
Sixto Duran-Ballen has given the people of Ecuador. 
  The reduction of the rate of inflation to 31 percent and the 
maintenance of macroeconomic stability have additionally allowed 
investors to plan their activities with greater confidence. And 
what is more, they have expanded their investment horizons into 
the medium time range. 
  [Cardenas] What the productive sectors have suffered has 
without a doubt been a recession, rather than a slowdown. How 
can this situation be improved in the new year if recession does 
reoccur in 1994? 
  [Armijos] The major increase in intermediate credit for the 
financial sector, which was 30 percent in real terms in 1993, 
allows us to say that the formal sector had adequate resources 
for the financing of its activities. 
  The initial estimates indicate that an increase of 
approximately two percent in production growth was planned for 
1993, as compared with the growth of 3.5 percent seen in 1992. 
It should be noted, however, that the rate of growth in the 
gross formation of fixed capital for this year exceeds 50 
percent. In real terms, this represents growth greater than the 
increase in the population. 
  Still greater growth in productive activity is expected in 
1994, with the impetus being provided by the greater gross 
formation of fixed capital in both the public and private 
sectors. In fact, the state budget provides for projects of 
vital importance that will promote growth in various sectors. 
  [Cardenas] In your opinion what are the economic prospects 
for 1994? 
  [Armijos] In 1994, the government will seek to provide the 
economy with responsible fiscal management, making it possible 
to consolidate the reduction in inflation and to lower the 
inflation rate to less than 20 percent by the end of 1994. This 
responsible fiscal management will involve a major reduction in 
current expenditures and a substantial improvement in tax and 
customs management, which will serve to generate additional 
budget resources. 
  This does not mean that a phase of stagnation will begin for 
the economy. On the contrary, the reactivation of the productive 
apparatus will be due basically to the dynamism in the public 
sector, and in part, to the improvement in the levels of public 
investment. This dynamism will be based on the maintenance of 
foreign-exchange stability, a level of interest rates consistent 
with inflationary expectations, and a considerable increase in 
productivity. 
  It must be pointed out that the growth seen in 1993 was 
achieved despite the implementation of a strict adjustment 
program, which reduced inflation. This is a result that has been 
achieved in very few countries in Latin America. 
  [Cardenas] How much will the progress that may be achieved 
in 
the modernization of the state influence the economic prospects 
for the coming year? 
  [Armijos] The approval, in 1994, of the Law on the 
Modernization of the State and its application will enable us to 
consolidate the efforts to ensure stability with growth and will 
provide the international community with a favorable picture of 
the scope and duration of the reforms in Ecuador. Modernization 
and monetary stability do not constitute just a situational 
phenomenon, but rather a permanent one. It will continue in our 
country and will sink deep roots in our society. 
  [Cardenas] If it is not possible to realize the government's 
aspirations with regard to increased taxes and total income 
collected, might new measures be contemplated? 
  [Armijos] As the vice president of the Republic has said, 
the 
results of the tax reform would justify a revision of the 
economic program for 1994. In addition, as was noted by the 
minister of finance, the first measure must be the restriction 
of the expenditures of the public sector, including both current 
expenditures and the investments initially planned for 1994. 
  [Cardenas] What does the government hope to see in 1994 
where 
the foreign debt is concerned? Might there be a definitive 
renegotiation, and along what lines are the negotiations 
progressing? Might the Monetary Board approve the foreign-debt 
conversion operations within the framework of the Securities 
Market Law? 
  [Armijos] The renegotiation of the foreign debt is a slow 
process that is advancing as macroeconomic stabilization is 
achieved and as the country consolidates its foreign solvency. 
The intention of the government is to obtain an agreement on the 
renegotiation of the debt, because this will not only enable us 
to establish a better payments profile for the future, but will 
basically allow the consolidation of the credibility, for the 
international financial community, of our efforts in the realm 
of stabilization and modernization. Renegotiation will enable 
the country to obtain credit again and will expand the 
opportunities for domestic and foreign investment. However, 
despite all of the benefits we will derive from the 
renegotiation of the debt, the current government is not 
prepared to agree to conditions that will be burdensome for 
future generations. In this connection, progress is being made, 
with firmness and determination but without haste, taking the 
national interests into account. 
  As to the debt-conversion operations, they will be governed 
by the overall renegotiation agreement achieved. 
  [Cardenas] Several months have passed and we are still 
waiting for the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System. 
When will something concrete be known? Might some major 
alteration at the last moment be expected, as happened with the 
amendments to the Tax Law? 
  [Armijos] The amendments to the Law on the Monetary System, 
duly approved by the Monetary Board, have been submitted to the 
president of the Republic for his approval and sent to the 
Congress. It is to be expected that they will be discussed and 
approved by the Congress in the course of the first two months 
of this year. 
  The Law on the Monetary System is an eminently technical 
text 
designed to perfect that which was approved in 1992--that is to 
say, to introduce basic changes in the way shown to be necessary 
by the application of the law in effect, so that the Central 
Bank can fully carry out the proper functions of a 
currency-issuing institute. 
<H5>  Auctions Have Not Threatened the State </H5>
  [Cardenas] Will the criticisms voiced by the 
securities-exchange sector because of the fact that the 
government has used auctions rather than the securities market 
be refuted? 
  [Armijos] The negotiation of state bonds by the minister of 
finance through the Central Bank of Ecuador has its legal basis 
in Article 63 of the Regulations Governing the Securities Market 
Law. That article clearly provides for the possibility of 
placing the bonds issued by the state and bodies in the public 
sector by means of the auction mechanisms supported or used by 
the Central Bank of Ecuador. Such mechanisms are not just used 
by Ecuador, but are in place in the majority of other countries, 
such as the United States of America, Mexico, Chile, etc. 
  The auction mechanism has not worked to the detriment of the 
interests of the state, because in the adjudication of the bonds 
in question, the reserve price was not relevant. This was 
because the bonds sold out at a higher price (90.01 percent), 
and the average weighted price at which they were adjudicated 
was also obviously higher (91.3333 percent) than this value. 
  [Cardenas] Will the monetary policy for 1994 be linked with 
the continuity of open-market operations of the monetary and 
foreign-exchange board type? Will the issuance of monetary 
stabilization bonds perhaps entail a cost for the Central Bank? 
  [Armijos] In fact, open-market operations are an effective 
tool that has made it possible to maintain strict control of the 
liquidity of the economy. And consequently, this has created the 
capacity for more efficient management of the variable monetary 
factors. Therefore, the use of this tool will be continued in 
1994. 
  Since the stabilization bonds are the securities being 
placed 
on this market, this does involve a cost for the Central Bank. 
However, it is a cost that has been carefully calculated and 
duly provided for in the budget of the issuing establishment.

<F P=106> [News conference by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina </F>
with local and foreign reporters and Press Secretary Juan Ramon 
Duran as moderator at the presidency in Tegucigalpa -- live] 
  [Text] [Duran] Thank you for accepting our invitation to 
speak with our president. He will issue a brief message on the 
topics he had discussed recently, when he had no contact with 
you. Then we will have a question and answer segment. Kindly 
identify yourselves and the media you represent, as is the 
custom in this conference room, whenever you ask your questions. 
Here is President Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  [Reina] Dear Juan Ramon Duran and dear friends of the press 
and the different media. I fulfill my word of being in constant 
contact with you. I have come to briefly tell you about the 
latest events -- they are not momentous news but they reveal the 
progress achieved by our thesis of the moral revolution. Today 
I had the great satisfaction of talking with members of the 
Armed Forces, at the highest level, about an issue that has 
caused great interest in the Honduran nation: military service. 
  During our campaign we defined military service as a 
voluntary and educational service, and there is a proposal from 
the Armed Forces, at the highest level, for a constitutional and 
educational military service. I have heard an excellent 
exposition by Colonel [Jose Luis] Nunez Bennet and I think his 
conclusions convey the great historical moment which currently 
prevails in Honduras. In other words, this is part of what we 
called a consultation, which begins with a great dialogue, an 
open dialogue, a dialogue among equals, a fraternal dialogue, 
and which leads to conclusions and recommendations from either 
side on the way we will understand ourselves, meaning all the 
Hondurans. 
  If Honduras wins prestige, all its institutions win 
prestige. 
If Honduras' image deteriorates, all its institutions are 
harmed; it is that simple, and if we improve it, we all improve. 
I think one of the conclusions that were reached is excellent: 
that the forceful recruitment used by the Armed Forces until 
April 1993 was negative and harmful for the image of the armed 
institution. I think this is a classy act that reflects high 
awareness. 
  What young men and their mothers, fathers, brothers, and 
sisters thought about the way in which people were taken away, 
in a somewhat unusual manner, to render military service was 
detrimental to the Armed Forces' prestige. We said this during 
our campaign and they fully recognize it. 
  I also recognize the fact there has been no political will 
to 
organize institutions in Honduras because their organization 
entails starting a different period in the country's history. 
That is why I believe this consultation is part of what we have 
called the moral revolution, meaning a dialogue that will lead 
us to a consensus and will allow us to advance on the road 
toward the human development we have proposed. The new Armed 
Forces' role in times of peace. We have to consult on that; we 
have to discuss that; we have to review the theory of the 
Honduran people's safety. 
  Regarding problems with the police, there will be no 
discrepancy about creating a technical, scientific police that 
guarantees rights and procedures to find the truth, instead of 
the procedures that resulted in so much negative publicity about 
Honduras. The Armed Forces say its members are aware that 
mistakes were made in the past and this discouraged the citizens 
from fulfilling their patriotic duty of rendering military 
service. Those are beautiful words stated by the corps, which 
should bring prestige to Honduras by fulfilling its 
constitutional duties. 
  One of the recommendations is that the political will be 
expressed. I have already expressed the political will in my 
status as president of the Republic in order to establish an 
Army for peace, development, and the well-being of our people. 
  I think it is an excellent recommendation that the Education 
Ministry provide its full support to the Armed Forces to provide 
education there too. I reiterate their recommendations, which I 
have praised very much. That moral and civic education be 
included in the study plans and programs for elementary and 
secondary schools. These classes were eliminated as a result of 
suggestions from abroad, but today all Hondurans without 
exception realize that this hurts the solidarity of the national 
identity. Furthermore, that discipline be instilled in citizens 
at schools at all levels because discipline is a basic factor 
for the development of the society. 
  With this, and proposing to them that we form a joint 
commission of the Armed Forces and the government of the 
Republic to discuss compulsory military service, I have received 
their proposal and will appoint a commission to begin discussing 
the compulsory military service, in a conscious manner and with 
full competence. This is one of the points that I wanted to 
mention to you. 
  There are other points that have been mentioned, which are 
still being studied, in regard to the so-called Trifinio Project 
which is located near Ocotepeque, the Armed Forces Budget, the 
reorganization of the Armed Forces, and the police. 
  I am, thus, very satisfied with the dialogue we have held 
and 
I am convinced that we are on the right path to reaching a 
concerted agreement that will produce national theses that we 
will all defend. 
  I am at your disposal for any question or any concern. 
  If there is no air conditioning, it is the fault of KNEE 
[National Enterprise for Electric Power] and not of the 
presidency. [Laughter] But, we will try to provide you with all 
the comforts, as I told you before. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] however, there is 
something that currently concerns the Honduran people in the 
economic field. 
  There is an IMF mission in Honduras and it logically causes 
concern among the Honduran people. Could you tell us anything 
about the topics that have been discussed with the mission? 
And, is it true that the Honduran Government has already agreed 
to increase the electricity rates, tolls, and other services? 
Is there any truth in the rumors circulating this morning? 
  [Reina] The arrival of the IMF representatives must be taken 
as it is, and not as a ghost that comes to threaten or impose on 
us. We are a sovereign country, but 40 percent of our budget is 
dedicated to paying the foreign debt -- immense amounts of money 
that disappeared during very regrettable periods in our history. 
  I believe this is the first discussion, there is still no 
letter of intent. But, what I do guarantee to the Honduran 
people and to the majorities of this people, is that we will not 
accept, under any circumstance, that sales taxes be increased 
because those deeply hurt the poor majorities of Honduras. 
Other things are being discussed, other possibilities, but I 
have still not received the report from the economic cabinet. 
  I met with them this morning, but to discuss a topic that I 
find to be passionate: solidarity -- this is a contribution from 
Mexico. To implement what in that country has been called the 
Solidarity [Program]. What does it consist of? That the people 
cooperate for their own benefit, for their own well-being. 
  Honduran boards of trustees are organizations that have not 
functioned too well. They become sectarian, fight each other, 
neutralize each other. We have to have neighborhood residents 
improve their own living conditions with government and 
international aid. This approach has yielded good results in 
Mexico. I studied it this morning with the Economic Cabinet and 
feel very optimistic about it. 
  The fare issue has not yet been decided. The Honduran poor 
majorities should not be taxed. The possibility of taxing 
either the poor or other social sectors is what is being 
debated. The final decision, however, will be made by the 
Honduran Government. The IMF, as an international organization, 
is not as tough as before. I can say this because I have talked 
with them in Washington and Honduras. Their purpose is similar 
to ours: to favor the majority of the people. Together, we will 
be able to face the foreign debt without hurting the Honduran 
people. 
  [Reporter] The people want to know whether taxes will be 
increased and when a decision will be made regarding raising 
electricity rates and those of other public services. 
  [Reina] The matter is under discussion, and there will soon 
be a solution, and this government's philosophy is to avoid 
hurting the poor majority of Honduras. I think this is a very 
clear and truthful idea. 
  [Reporter] A list of three candidates for Social Security 
Fund director has been presented to you. It has been reported 
that you turned down this first list. What can you tell us 
about this? 
  [Reina] I tell you frankly, Walter, such a list has not been 
presented to me, although I have been told it would be brought 
to me. When it is indeed sent to me, I will study it and 
appoint someone who can understand the true nature of social 
security. I will appoint the most capable person. For the time 
being, we have designated Dr. Ogden Rodriguez in the position. 
It was said a number of times that he had been discriminated 
against, that he was unpopular, things like that. It is 
impossible for all capable men to be appointed. Nevertheless, 
we will gradually correct the situation. Early in March, I will 
present a report to the Honduran people. It is necessary that I 
sum up thoroughly the condition of the country when I receive 
it. This will be done early in March. Many things will be 
clarified, things that have been touched upon only slightly in 
an effort to keep in touch with you journalists constantly. 
  [Reporter] Much was said about privatization during the 
previous administration. This is my first question. Will you 
privatize the National Enterprise for Electric Power and 
Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]? My second 
question is this: The National Party has already accused your 
administration of nepotism. Does nepotism exist here? How will 
you handle the pressure from liberal activists regarding job 
applications? 
  [Reina] I will answer your questions with pleasure, Ms. 
Diaz. 
First of all, privatization as such is neither good nor bad. It 
depends on what is privatized and how it is done. A 
privatization process that is not clear, that is not absolutely 
honest, ends up being a disaster, because it would turn out to 
be a huge swindle against our people. The sale of assets worth 
many millions [currency not specified] would be mishandled, and 
the people would pay the consequences. If we were to privatize, 
we would do so under local and foreign audits to ensure absolute 
purity and to the defend the interest of the workers of the 
companies involved. Two factors would have to be considered: 
absolute honesty and respect for the rights of those who work in 
the enterprises. 
  But those are issues that will be discussed in the future. 
What are we going to do if half of the Honduran budget is 
destined to pay a debt and the other half to pay employees? It 
is a country that cannot continue to function that way. We must 
defend our stability and identity with our assets. This is one 
of the areas that must be tackled. 
  Nepotism is a vice of politics. But what can I do if I have 
many distant relatives who worked hard during the campaign. Am 
I going to stigmatize them or deprive them of some rights? The 
fact that Jorge Arturo Reina, my brother, could become and 
became Congress vice president has nothing to do with Carlos 
Roberto Reina. He has his own image, his own leadership. That 
cannot be considered nepotism. Nepotism is when one person 
appoints his relatives to exclude those persons with merits. 
  Some people said a relative of mine -- a very distant 
relative I should note -- would be education minister. However, 
some people said he was a very close relative of mine. I am not 
going to commit those mistakes. However, I am not going to 
deprive someone who has worked and has merit and solvency to be 
a soldier of the moral revolution of the right to a position 
because they [words indistinct] I am not going to deprive that 
person of that right. 
  Regarding influence peddling, I call on my fellow party 
members.... [pauses] How long did I wait to get to this post? 
Half a century. Can't they wait a few days? They said all 
government appointments have been made. I have just appointed 
the ministers. Other people are telling party members they have 
been left out. They say: Do you see how they used you? They 
just used you to get there. And that person becomes nervous. I 
ask you for patience. I am asking for nothing I did not have. 
I was very patient in putting up with injustices, humiliations, 
[word indistinct] I ask you to wait for some time while we solve 
the problems of giving some compensation to Liberal Party of 
Honduras [PLH] members who were dismissed from the government by 
the previous administration for their political party 
affiliation. I think this is logical. 
  The government must not be sectarian. It must be for all 
Hondurans who will choose the best persons for public office. 
  [Villanueva] Armando Villanueva of EL HERALDO. [Words 
indistinct] not to approve new direct taxes against the people. 
But what will happen with indirect taxes? For instance, it has 
been said a new toll collection system will be implemented and 
also [words indistinct]. In the end, industrialists and 
businessmen pass these increases on to consumers and it is 
ultimately the people who suffer the consequences. 
  On the other hand, I would like to know if your government 
will reactivate this commission to oversee [words indistinct] 
last administration, whatever it's called, to oversee public 
officials? 
  [Reina] A highway toll system operates in many countries. It 
is in place in San Pedro Sula and there is no problem. The 
thing is that people must have alternatives. If you want to 
travel on a paved road, then pay for it. If you don't want to 
pay, then use the dirt road. This gives people an alternative 
and is in place in many countries of the world. We all pay it 
because no one [words indistinct] because he has to pay one 
lempira. 
  Regarding the other issue, the customs value factor is 
another topic currently being discussed. But if we permit taxes 
to be passed on to the poor, we would not be doing anything. We 
are working to prevent that from happening. This would permit 
us to really protect the poor majorities of this country. 
  Regarding fares, this is a very broad issue. I ask you 
[words indistinct] is it fair for a person who lives in Las 
Lomas del Guifarro neighborhood to pay the same as someone who 
lives in Alemania neighborhood? There was a time when both the 
multimillionaire and worker paid 12 lempiras to the 
municipality. Is this fair? This is what we are discussing. 
The same holds true for water and electricity service. These 
are issues that are still under discussion, which involve the 
social justice we have always talked about. 
  The easier thing to do would be to increase prices of basic 
market basket products and medicines for the defenseless. But 
we are not going to do that. 
  [Words indistinct] this and many other intervention 
commissions so that they find out what is happening or happened 
in such state institutions as Cohdefor [Honduran Forest 
Development Corporation], Conadi [National Investment 
Corporation], and Banasupro [National Supply Agency for Basic 
Products]. In an article for EL HERALDO, I called what happened 
in the said companies the blank books. The people should know 
what happened in each of these institutions. 
  [Boza] Mr. President, Ramuel [name indistinct] Boza of Radio 
Tegucigalpa. I want to know if you [words indistinct] 
governments have had a difficult situation regarding the 
increase in urban transportation fares, which have been 
maintained. Will you allow an increase in transportation fares 
that will affect the Honduran people, especially in Tegucigalpa 
and San Pedro Sula? 
  On the other hand, pharmacists have said they have no 
alternative but to increase the price of medicine because each 
day the price of the dollar continues to increase with regard to 
the lempira. These are my two questions, Mr. President. 
  [Reina] Both questions concern the entire population. I will 
never authorize an increase in the price of medicines or 
transportation fares, because that can topple a government. 
That is what made the Venezuelan people explode, when new taxes 
were implemented. The challenge we have ahead of us is finding 
ways to increase our revenues quickly without affecting the 
majority; that is what we are doing. We are intensively seeking 
those measures, which the economic cabinet will announce at a 
news conference in due time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Reina, public employees are 
afraid of the possibility of mass dismissals. A few minutes 
ago, you said that the activists of the PLH must be patient. In 
this regard, how will your government fill some vacancies 
without engaging in the famous mass dismissals, on one hand? On 
the other hand, how far will your government go in the 
investigation of some transactions made in the past, one of them 
called the big car [el carrazo] scandal, so that those 
responsible will be punished and do not escape the arm of the 
law, as is customary? 
  [Reina] We are going to appoint you to the commission that 
will investigate this affair. [laughter] We have already 
appointed a commission that will investigate those cases so that 
those who looted this country are punished. This is a firm 
decision by our government. 
  The other thing is a problem. Can we continue to have 
sinecures in many offices, where 50 percent of the employees 
don't do anything because they got their jobs thanks to past 
administrations? We must review this situation and pay them 
compensation, but there is no money. We are seeking a solution 
to this situation. We must get the money and keep the 
employees. We will not fire anyone out of sectarianism. 
Sectarianism is a vice, it is a disease. A good employee must 
not be dismissed. How much did the state pay to train that 
employee? But if he is a sinecure and this phenomenon is 
widespread, how are we going to advance with such heavy 
bureaucratic burdens. 
  To me, the most appropriate thing is to evaluate the 
personnel, respect the abilities of public employees, and apply 
justice at the bureaucratic level. If someone was dismissed as 
a result of sectarianism by previous administrations, it is 
necessary to reinstate that person, provided that he fulfills 
the requirements of the post. 
  With respect to the big car incident, it is already being 
investigated. You have already heard statements by the deputy 
finance minister and he is very committed to solving this issue. 
  [Reporter] In reference to decisions involving the selective 
military service which I believe will bring relief to our youth, 
will there be a government commission? What are your intentions 
in this respect? [Passage indistinct] Do you have any names? 
  [Reina] I still do not have any names. We first have to 
consult with some of the candidates to see if they agree since 
they might have to resign afterwards due to lack of time. 
However, I believe that we must meet with them sometime between 
today and tomorrow. We will announce the decision afterwards. 
I thank you for being here today and I am at your disposal.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 12 Feb (AFP) -- Local media reported on 
Saturday that the military service will still be compulsory in 
Honduras despite pledges by the recently sworn-in Carlos Roberto 
Reina administration, which said military service would become 
"voluntary and educational." Presidential designate (vice 
president) Walter Lopez, a former general, said in statements to 
the newspaper LA TRIBUNA: "There will be no exceptions because 
it will be compulsory." 
  On Thursday, the Armed Forces announced a mixed commission 
will be created with the government to propose law reforms which 
allow the implementation of "a constitutional and educational 
military service." The announcement was made by Armed Forces 
Chief General Luis Alonso Discua following a meeting with Reina. 
  Reina, who replaced former President Rafael Leonardo 
Callejas 
on 27 January, promised "a military service that was 
educational" and voluntary, instead of the habitual "hunt" 
conducted in public places for poor, young men who are taken to 
the Army barracks. Nevertheless, the new president apparently 
failed to obtain the powerful Honduran military forces' support. 
  Bertha Oliva, coordinator of a movement against 
conscription, 
said Reina's promise "is another lie from politicians who say 
one thing during their political campaign but do another once 
they achieve power." The leader said that members of her 
committee will organize a hunger strike in front of where the 
mixed commission will meet to discuss the alleged reforms to the 
military service law.

  [Text] Last night, the IMF exerted pressure on the new 
government to eliminate some subsidies, including transportation 
subsidies, and it also demanded the establishment of tolls and 
an increase in electricity and water rates. The Economic Cabinet 
met with IMF representatives last night at the Central Bank of 
Honduras offices to compare figures, in what would be a preamble 
to the letter of intent that will be signed in March. 
  On 7 February, the Economic Cabinet announced it would 
immediately eliminate all investment, transfer, and current 
expenses to reduce the fiscal deficit. 
  IMF representatives argue, however, this is not enough and 
that it is necessary, among other measures, to eliminate 
transportation and kerosene subsidies which the government is 
absorbing. 
  The IMF also says tolls should be permanently established to 
collect revenues, and the National Enterprise for Electric Power 
(ENEE) and the National Autonomous Water and Sewage Service 
(SANAA) should increase their rates. 
  In this give and take situation, the government has said it 
would rather seek other revenue sources than to eliminate 
transportation subsidies because the people would suffer the 
most by having to pay more than one lempira in transportation 
fares if these demands were met. 
  Certain businessmen and economists also believe it is not 
appropriate to increase public service rates such as 
electricity, first of all because ENEE does not even have the 
capacity to meet current energy demands. In fact, electricity is 
rationed because of the very low water levels at its main source 
of energy, the "Francisco Morazan" or "El Cajon" Hydroelectric 
Project. 
  Regarding the international credit organization's demands, 
perhaps the only feasible one right now is that of establishing 
tolls.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said yesterday 
the Foreign Ministry's top priority is obtaining a Honduran 
nonpermanent membership on the UN Security Council. 
  "We have been working on this for a long time. It takes 
several years to work on such a candidacy. Honduras is going to 
obtain that post at a world level for the first time," he said. 
He said the election will take place at the next UN General 
Assembly scheduled for September in New York. We are now trying 
to garner our votes, he said. There are more than 160 states in 
the United Nations, and therefore we have to hold good 
negotiations with friendly countries. 
  Concerning the election of the next OAS secretary general, 
he 
said Honduras will keep its promise to support Costa Rica in the 
first round, and "there will be an ample debate among the Latin 
American countries for the second round." 
  Regarding the candidacy of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
for that post, the Honduran foreign minister said there are 
different opinions as to the person who should direct the 
Inter-American organization. 
  He said it is very important for Honduras to be a member of 
the Security Council, because this would practically entail 
making decisions on world issues. There are permanent and 
nonpermanent members on the Security Council. The great powers 
are the permanent members, the others the developing nations. 
  "For the first time, there is going to be a Honduran 
representative on the Security Council. The only countries that 
have had this privilege in the past are Panama, during the 
government of Omar Torrijos, and Nicaragua, during the time of 
the revolution," he said. The foreign minister said, however, 
no decision has been reached yet on the candidate.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Code of Silence and Democracy"] </F>
  [Text] The La Cantuta case must be transferred to the 
courts of common law, and those responsible must be punished. 
These are the rules of democracy and of civilization. They are 
inescapable, despite the fact that many of us feel that great 
injustice is done when, after having borne the brunt of an 
atrocious war, in which they proved capable, moreover, of 
implementing a correct and humane strategy, the Armed Forces are 
made the target of pseudo-apostles of good. 
  In internal wars--and above all, in one as long as this one 
has been and against as treacherous, cruel, and savage an enemy 
as Shining Path--the tendency to form secret extermination 
groups is almost spontaneous. In a recent interview, Enrique 
Obando stated that in every army of the world there is a double 
code: a written one that comprises the regulations and conforms 
with the Constitution, and an unwritten one that in a veiled 
manner authorizes the existence of groups that carry out illegal 
operations. If this double code is a commonplace in all armies, 
it is also one in ours, which has endured the strain of an 
extremely hard internal war. 
  This is what occurred in Argentina. But, there, the secret 
code was applied in a systematic manner, and became official 
strategy. In Peru, it was applied only sporadically, never 
systematically. On the contrary, the incredible, the truly 
extraordinary fact, is that, beginning in 1990, the Armed Forces 
were able to implement the opposite strategy. Starting from that 
year, their systematic strategic policy was one of alliance with 
the population, under which the Armed Forces gave arms to the 
civilian patrols, food and civic aid to the disadvantaged urban 
populations, and built roads in high-risk areas. An intelligent 
action that enabled the capture of thousands of terrorist 
leaders without firing a single shot. An astute strategy, in 
sum, extremely respectful of human rights, diametrically opposed 
to the strategy of indiscriminate slaughter. This is why it 
produced results. This is why it had the people's support. These 
are the facts. 
  In Peru, that code of silence did not become strategy. There 
was a group of executioners, but it was a vestige of a previous 
stage, and in conflict with the strategy that in the end 
succeeded. 
  In truth, the Peruvian Army, being in no way compromised by 
the investigation, has no reason to feel mistreated by it. Very 
much on the contrary, the Army must proudly show everybody its 
proven ability to learn and adapt its war strategy not only to 
humanitarian principles but also to the reality of the only 
effective action for defeating an enemy that felt it could move 
among the people like a fish in the water. 
  Clearly, the code of silence is incompatible with democracy. 
What we know today about La Cantuta is owing to the fact that a 
policy split within the Army has led certain officers to reveal 
the identities of those who might have been the perpetrators of 
that massacre, bringing information to public light that, in 
another time, would not have been made known. This, in addition 
to its hard-fought rivalry with the accusing group, is why the 
Army is resisting the investigation. 
  But justice is inevitable. And in the end, in spite of 
everything, the truth shall prevail: That the Peruvian Army was 
able to overcome the terrorist enemy cleanly, by intelligent, 
humanitarian, and democratic means.

  [Text] Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santagadea 
has told the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva military 
courts will try the soldiers allegedly involved in the murder of 
10 people at La Cantuta University. The minister has said if 
Armed Forces members are indeed involved in this crime, their 
sentences will show there is no impunity in Peru. 
  On another topic, Vega has also reported that 95 percent of 
terrorist leaders are now in jail and that hope has been 
restored in Peru. The shadow of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist 
Communism no longer hovers over the country's future, the 
justice minister has said. He added, however, the struggle 
against terrorism and the state of emergency continued, and he 
justified the validity of several measures geared toward 
punishing and eradicating subversion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Antero Flores Araoz, congressman for the </F>
Popular Christian Party, by Eduardo Lindo Collantes at the 
Congress of the Republic in Lima; from the "Newspaper of the 
Airwaves" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Collantes] Good afternoon. I am at the Congress 
of the Republic covering reaction to the bill which Congress 
approved early this morning on the conflicts over civilian 
versus military jurisdiction in cases that do not involve drug 
trafficking. The bill eliminates the possibility that one 
person alone can decide if a case is to be tried by a civilian 
or military court. 
  We have Antero Flores Araoz, congressman for the Popular 
Christian Party [PPC] with us. Congressman, we would like your 
comments on this issue. How do you view the fact that a 
congressional majority passed this bill when the La Cantuta case 
is still to be resolved? 
  [Flores] Listen, what we saw at the Congress last night is 
something we never imagined could happen. Really, all moral 
principles were trampled. They [the ruling majority] did not 
care about anything and displayed an attitude of total arrogance 
and gall. The issue was not on the agenda and had not been 
discussed at the council board meeting. The issue was presented 
between midnight and dawn. They took advantage of the fact that 
the tribute to Don Luis Alberto Sanchez [recently deceased 
American Popular Revolutionary Alliance leader] had ended, and, 
without even distributing copies of the bill beforehand, they 
started the debate. The bill had not even gone through the 
commissions. This bill really dashes all the international 
pacts on international law signed by Peru. Those agreements 
clearly stipulate Peru's commitments with the due process of law 
and the people's right to be tried by competent courts. This 
law has a set purpose. 
  [Collantes] However, the argument presented to substantiate 
the bill's approval is that the physical integrity of the 
magistrates, who have to decide on the jurisdiction of the La 
Cantuta case, has to be protected. 
  [Flores] Does this mean the Armed Forces and the Police are 
not able to protect one, two, or three supreme court justices? 
Does this mean our Armed Forces and Police are so inefficient 
that they can't provide this protection and that we need to 
trample all moral principles and violate five articles of the 
Constitution simply because a leaflet fell in a justice's home? 
Is this their excuse for trampling the Constitution and 
international agreements? Please! This is only a plot between 
the Executive and Legislative branches to cover up the people 
involved in the famous La Cantuta case. They have become 
accomplices in this case. 
  [Collantes] Congressman, a few minutes ago you presented a 
bill to repeal the questionable habeas data [as heard] article 
included in the 1993 Constitution. What prompted this action? 
  [Flores] It is really very simple. Many people are talking 
about the need to regulate the constitutional article on habeas 
data and stressing that some of its dangers should be expunged. 
The PPC bloc believes, and said so when the Constitution was 
being debated, that the habeas data has to disappear. Dead dogs 
do not bite. Let us wipe out this article from the Constitution 
and kill this deadly institution at the root. 
  [Collantes] This was PPC Congressman Flores. The opposition 
congressmen are currently meeting at Democratic Movement 
Congressman Henry Peace Garcia's office and will shortly issue a 
communique on the case having jurisdiction problems and on the 
bill approved early this morning. Back to the station.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rospigliosi from the "Controversies" </F>
page: "`Vaticano' and the Military"] 
  [Text] The arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, aka 
"Vaticano," seems to confirm what some have feared: The 
involvement of the military -- and not only those of lower ranks 
-- with drug trafficking and the existence of corruption within 
the Armed Forces. Several factors point to this. 
  First, there is the testimony of Major Evaristo Castillo 
Aste 
that was published in CARETAS issue No. 1295 and then by other 
media. He gave a precise, detailed, and brave account of the 
military's relationship with drug trafficking. 
  The fact is that Maj. Castillo's charges not only link 
subordinate officers to drug trafficking. He mentioned the 
names of generals who, through action or omission, may be 
linked: General Eduardo Bellido, head of the Huallaga front for 
two years; Interior Minister Juan Briones; and Army Commander 
General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. 
  There is also the version of another Army officer published 
in the same issue. This information confirms many other similar 
reports. 
  Second, "Vaticano" was labeled as a narcoterrorist and was 
placed under the military court. Why should a military court 
judge a drug trafficker? Didn't [President Alberto] Fujimori 
reorganize the judicial branch and issue all the laws he wished? 
Why can't the new judicial branch judge "Vaticano"? 
  This strange behavior leads to the belief that they do not 
want "Vaticano" to talk. If he is tried by a military court, 
the trial will be secret. Nobody will know what the drug 
trafficker said. There will be no point in him telling the 
military about his contact with other military from whom they 
receive orders. 
  Moreover, by keeping him under military control they can 
negotiate with "Vaticano", without the people knowing about it 
as they have done -- and continue to do -- with Abimael Guzman 
and the terrorist leadership. 
  Another query that arises immediately from labeling 
"Vaticano" as a narcoterrorist is that if he only dealt with 
other terrorists and not with the military, where is the fortune 
the terrorists amassed? This raises another theory mentioned a 
few weeks ago by this column: The money that the Shining Path 
leadership keeps abroad is probably part of the negotiation 
between Abimael Guzman, Fujimori, and Montesinos. 
  When jounalists recently ago asked Fujimori about Guzman's 
money, he replied: "I don't know." Why? Didn't he have the 
world's best intelligence service? Doesn't he control 95 percent 
of the Shining Path leaders? Have the tens of millions of 
Shining Path dollars vanished? 
  Third, Fujimori, General Hermoza, and Dinandro [expansion 
unknown] have refused to admit that there is one single 
authority, either civil or military, who is involved with 
"Vaticano." 
  This refusal is totally unbelievable. If Fujimori, Hermoza, 
and Dinandro had admitted the links between "Vaticano" and some 
of the military, and if they had begun impartial investigations 
within the regular jurisdiction, they could have been given some 
credibility. 
  Fourth, the distracting maneuver with the artists, which was 
so obvious and unintelligent, makes it clear that there is an 
attempt to conceal something. Otherwise, what is the explanation 
for this plot that was personally initiated by the president and 
that has led nowhere? 
  The implications of the links between drug trafficking and 
the Armed Forces are dramatic. Corruption in other institutions 
can create many problems. If the police, customs offices, or the 
judicial branch are corroded by this disease, the problem is 
serious. But if the Armed Forces contract the disease, the 
situation is much worse, for several reasons. 
  One is that the military play a decisive role in the 
government, especially since 5 April 1992. 
  Another reason is that they enjoy a privileged status within 
society, like having their own jurisdiction for trials of 
military men, even in cases of common crimes. No institution can 
make a serious investigation into the military: neither 
congress, nor the police, nor the judicial branch. 
  Still another reason is the power of arms, which can be 
illegally used with much impunity, as was disclosed by General 
Rodolfo Robles, who referred to the "gang of henchmen" made up 
of military men. 
  If drug trafficking, or another form of corruption, reaches 
a 
deep level within the Armed Forces, affecting the command level, 
there could be political complications that could produce long 
authoritarian government terms and/or very costly damage to the 
country. This occurred in Bolivia with General Garcia Meza, in 
Paraguay with Stroessner, in Panama with Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
and it is currently happening in Haiti. 
  Yet, unlike Panama, Peru does not have a strategically 
important canal, and no one will come here to take away a 
corrupt military man. We will have to solve the problem 
ourselves. Honest Armed Forces officers have a great 
responsibility in this task.

  [Text] Lima, 9 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Peruvian Interior 
Minister Juan Briones Davila rejected alleged ties between 
high-ranking Army officers and drug traffickers as claimed by a 
former DEA agent. 
  The high-ranking military officer expressed his concern that 
some press have given credence to statements "by any person 
accusing officers of having covered up activities of powerful 
drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as 
`Vaticano.'" 
  "Every report is investigated, but we must treat this 
information with great care," the minister stated. 
  Chavez Penaherrera was mentioned as the connection between 
Peruvian drug traffickers and Colombia's Cali cartel, which, 
after the death of Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar, 
controls 90 percent of drug shipments to the United States. 
  "Vaticano" was captured on 13 January in Cali and was 
deported the next day to Peru, where he is being prosecuted for 
drug trafficking offenses and ties to subversive groups. 
  Last Sunday on a Lima Channel 9 program, former DEA agent 
Augusto del Rio said "Vaticano" had the personal protection of 
Army troops deployed in the area of Alto Huallaga. 
  More than 60 percent of coca leaf produced in the Andean 
nation is grown in the region, 700 km northeast of Lima. It is 
also considered the main storage center for international drug 
trafficking. 
  Del Rio, who has infiltrated drug trafficking organizations 
since 1988, said that between February 1992 and March 1993 he 
tried to capture Chavez Penaherrera during the "Campanazo" [Toll 
of a Bell] operation, but he failed because he was protected by 
the military in the area. 
  Del Rio accused Generals Eduardo Bellido Mora and Alberto 
Arciniega Huby, former chiefs of the Huallaga Front political- 
military command in the jungle region of San Martin, of 
protecting "Vaticano" in exchange for large sums of money. 
  He said Bellido Mora foiled the "Campanazo" operation from 
which authorities hoped to seize some 3,000 kg of drug, but only 
managed to seize some 500 kg of cocaine basic paste. 
  Interior Minister Gen. Juan Briones Davila stressed that 
Bellido Mora is an "excellent officer" and as chief of the 
Huallaga Front fought "narcoterrorism" in that part of the 
Peruvian Amazon region in an efficient manner.

  [Text] An unofficial source has stated that the number of 
Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) police personnel might be 
reduced by 30 percent following a decision by high-ranking 
Interior Ministry officials. It is believed that PNP [Peruvian 
National Police] General Luis Dominguez Soliz, the Dincote 
Commander, has been notified. 
  The promoters of this decision believe a cut in personnel 
will enhance the efficiency of police action. This opinion, 
however, is not shared by most Dincote officers who say that 
many times Dincote personnel cannot cope with the volume of work 
in their fight against terrorism. 
  Reliable sources state that this decision reflects a 
government decision to cut the Dincote budget and eliminate the 
300-soles bonus given to its personnel. 
  It was leaked that the cut in Dincote's specialized 
personnel 
will be made in three stages. The first stage entails the 
dismissal of 200 chiefs, officers, and subalterns, in February. 
  The second and third stages foresee the lay-off of other 100 
detectives, thus concluding the personnel reduction. 
  It has not been disclosed what will become of those who will 
be laid off. 
  Asked to comment on this, some officers noted that the 
decision caused disappointment among Dincote personnel and a 
split into two groups -- those who favor and those who oppose 
the measure. 
  Officers pointed out that the latter group represent the 
majority who believe a reduction in personnel will virtually 
curtail the unit that has produced the most resounding successes 
of the PNP. 
  Our source stated that the current budget was drafted when 
PNP Lieutenant General Antonio Ketin Vidal Herrera was installed 
as the Dincote commander. 
  It was precisely at that time that Dincote personnel made 
the 
so-called "most spectacular capture of the century," when they 
arrested [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso without 
firing a single shot on 12 September 1992. 
  Unless the Interior Minister reverses its decision, morale 
will be further undermined -- especially that of subalterns 
whose wages are very low. 
  One Dincote officer remarked that last month Interior 
Ministry spokesmen announced a pay increase for subaltern 
personnel, but this has not yet happened.
