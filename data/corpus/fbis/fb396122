  [Text] A worrisome fact that could be a decisive factor for 
the expansion of poppy plantations in the country is the coca 
growers' readiness to replace their traditional coca plantations 
with poppy plantations. 
  The Cedro [Information and Education Center To Prevent Drug 
Abuse] has conducted a poll among 200 peasants from various 
settlements of San Martin and Huanuco Departments. Only 12 
percent of them said they would not replace coca with poppy. 
  Another 28 percent said that they would and the remaining 60 
percent were undecided. They said that, depending on the 
circumstances, they might. 
  Considering that the price of coca is extremely low and that 
very few people are purchasing coca leaves, these "undecided" 
peasants could easily begin to plant poppies. 
<H5>  A Matter of Survival </H5>
  Our correspondent in Tarapoto talked to Jesus Rivera, leader 
of the Selva Maestra Agrarian Federation (Fasma). Rivera 
asserted that a large number of peasants were willing to plant 
poppy if they had someone to sell it to. 
  "It is a matter of survival. The peasants must survive and 
to 
be able to do so they are willing to plant poppy. They have no 
other option because they have no access to loans that would 
enable them to replace their coca plantations with subsistance 
crops or any other authorized crop," he said. 
  Rivera, who participated in the crop replacement program 
negotiations, said that a large numnber of peasants have 
threatened to begin sowing poppy seeds next month, unless the 
government grants them credit or some other sort of assistance, 
as the regional officials have promised.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel d'Ornellas: "How Long Will This </F>
Constitution Last?"] 
  [Text] The view is held by different sectors of the 
opposition that the Constitution promulgated yesterday will last 
only as long as the Fujimori administration. But that cannot be 
considered an infallible forecast. 
  In truth, it will all depend on who succeeds Fujimori in the 
government. Obviously, if a leader from the so-called 
"maximalist" opposition takes office in 1995, he will 
immediately endeavor to revoke the new Magna Carta, going back 
to the one of 1979. No chief of state, either "aprista" [of the 
APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]], or 
"acciopupulista" [of the AP [Popular Action Party]], or of the 
classic Marxist left, or of Mario Vargas Llosa's movement, will 
coexist with the 1993 Constitution. That is sure. 
  Things change, however, if the winner of the elections to be 
held 15 months from now comes from one of the less radical 
organizations. What is more, if he is a "pepecista" [PPC 
[Popular Christian Party]] who is not enrolled in the ranks of 
self-exiled Alberto Borea, he will most probably accept the text 
of the Constitution approved by the referendum of 31 October 
last, even though he will try to introduce some amendments. 
  The same goes for possible independent candidates like 
Carlos 
Bolona or Ricardo Belmont, any member of Renovation and, of 
course, Fujimori's possible dauphins in the event the president 
decides not to seek reelection. Moreover, Javier Perez de 
Cuellar has accepted the validity of the Constitution 
promulgated yesterday, although with reservations on 
unicameralism and the death penalty--which we share--and on 
immediate reelection. In his case, of course, everything will 
depend on the terms of whatever agreement he may have reached 
with the conglomerate that catapults him into the presidency, in 
the hypothetical case that this were to happen.... 
  So, the chances that the 1993 Constitution will outlast 
Fujimori's tenure are greater than that they will not. Those 
whose opposition to its survival is inflexible are the country's 
political minority. The rest accept its validity, in varying 
degrees, with reservations ranging from total intangibility of 
its text to the inclusion of substantial amendments in it. 
  The hypothesis that the new Fundamental Law will meet the 
same fate as Leguia's last Constitution, which was thrown out 
the window together with him, is, in the final analysis, rather 
remote. Particularly, if the new Constitution demonstrates, in 
terms of effective performance on the road between now and July 
1995, that it is better than the preceding ones. Or that public 
opinion thinks that it is. The measuring stick will be the 
performance of the government, particularly in terms of the 
relations among its branches, and how well the unicameral 
Congress works. 
  If it passes this efficiency test, a return to the past and 
its 1979 Constitution will be difficult, not to say impossible.

  [Text] Peru has recovered the trust of investors as a 
result of structural reforms, the opening of trade to foreign 
markets, and local competition, within the framework of a 
serious economic stabilization program initiated in 1990, the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade stated today. 
  During an assessment of Peruvian trade policy, GATT 
highlighted the reduction of tariffs in general as a result of 
the government's goal of tariffs reaching 15 percent by January 
1995; the elimination of price controls, subsidies, quantitative 
and exchange rate restrictions; and the policy of state 
intervention. The report states, however, that the private 
sector's reaction to the changes is limited due to the high 
levels of interest rates and taxes, sectoral competition, 
infrastructure deficiencies, overevaluation of the exchange 
rate, and terrorism.

<F P=106> [Paid advertisement on communique issued by the </F>
Superintendency of Banks and Insurance on 10 February 1994; from 
the "Global TV News" newscast] 
  [Text] Communique 
  1. The Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, in complying 
with the general law on banking, financial, and insurance 
institutions and in accordance with its basic law, on 10 
February has decided not to authorize the formalization of the 
Latin American Business Advisory Center, CLAE. 
  2. It is a known fact that the Superintendency of Banks and 
Insurance, considering the interests of CLAE investors, has 
shown a great deal of willingness and flexibility to facilitate 
the formalization of this enterprise. Nevertheless, this has 
not been possible due to serious irregularities, of which we 
will mention the main ones: 
  A. Despite frequent requests from this Superintendency, 
the CLAE Board of Directors has not clearly explained the 
destination of the funds received from the public. In the 
information delivered to this Superintendency as of 31 December 
1993, CLAE directors declared that approximately 90 percent of 
CLAE investments were placed in German government bonds issued 
between 1924 and 1930 [as heard]. According to CLAE directors, 
the value of those bonds was reportedly $308 million. CLAE 
directors have not been able to prove the ownership or 
authenticity of those bonds, or the way or means used to 
purchase them, the actual value paid for them, and other 
conditions. All the missing information, according to German 
government authorities, are absolutely necessary to confirm the 
authenticity of those bonds. In addition, CLAE directors have 
not been able to prove the legality and value of the other 
assets. The announced investments in lobster and asparagus 
production are only reported with a value under $800,000, and no 
evidence is provided of their capacity to generate income. 
  B. CLAE directors have not presented irrefutable proof, as 
required by law, of the total amount of money they actually 
received from the public. On 29 April 1993, when they took 
control of CLAE, its directors reported that the amount received 
from the public was approximately $206 million. Afterward, on 
31 December 1993, in a report sent to the Superintendency on 
diskettes, the amount reported was $454 million. In addition, 
that amount did not agree with the balance sheet presented that 
same day by CLAE directors, who have not explained the 
differences or supplied the necessary information on the credit 
accounts in order to directly confirm the amounts with its 
creditors. 
  C. CLAE has not presented irrefutable evidence, as 
required by law, proving its real financial situation. Despite 
the facilities given by the Superintendency of Banks and 
Insurance, CLAE directors have not satisfactorily proven the 
real value of its assets and liabilities. Therefore, it has not 
been able to determine its exact financial situation. Based on 
the scant information supplied by its directors CLAE reportedly 
faces a loss surpassing $110 million, which technically and 
legally places the institution in an obvious bankruptcy 
situation. 
  3. In accordance with the law, the Superintendency of Banks 
and Insurance has issued instructions to its ad hoc attorney to 
report the situation to the judicial authorities in order to 
determine the responsibilities in the case. In the same manner, 
and also according to the law, it has asked the Supreme Court of 
Justice to order the closure of the Latin American Business 
Advisory Center, CLAE.

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In a news conference this afternoon, Luis 
Cortavarria Chequeli, director of the Superintendency of Banks 
and Insurance, justified the definitive intervention in the 
Latin American Business Advisory Center [CLAE]. As one of the 
reasons, he mentioned failure to meet the schedule of payments 
to CLAE depositors. 
  [Begin recording] [Cortavarria] Here we have a letter 
stating 
that the clients would begin to get their money on 7 February. 
By this date we had already started to prepare CLAE's closure. 
We reached the conclusion that if CLAE had not started to pay by 
this date, we would start the closure procedure. CLAE failed to 
begin returning the money on 8, 9, or 10 February. I believe the 
superintendent's office made the best possible effort to try to 
formalize CLAE. It is not that we intervened in CLAE even though 
CLAE reported on its operations. CLAE has been handing over 
documents that do not support the reported value of its assets. 
As we said since the beginning, CLAE's obligations to the public 
are not guaranteed. The proper procedure [words indistinct] 
because it is an organization not authorized by the 
superintendent's office. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] previously? 
  [Cortavarria] What do you mean previously? 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Cortavarria] Banking Law 637 of 1991 stipulates in a 
temporary article that banks that receive deposits from the 
public without authorization can formalize their status by 
providing information. A process then starts. The law provided 
the opportunity for CLAE to formalize its status, but it failed 
to stick by the law. [end recording]

  [Text] Army Commander General Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
yesterday announced "no reprimand is foreseen" against the 
corps, in reference to a report to be presented by the 
independent UN human rights expert in Geneva, Switzerland. 
  Referring to a report published yesterday by this newspaper, 
the president said Monica Pinto believes the Army should return 
to its barracks in areas where it is not needed, but a special 
situation should certainly prevail in the areas where its 
presence is really necessary. 
  "We accept it as an unofficial report," the president of the 
Republic said, adding "in fact, the Army High Command is 
reviewing the measures, but we believe the unofficial report has 
no specific charges." 
  Pinto's report, which will be presented to the commission in 
Geneva, cites the need to demilitarize Guatemalan society, to 
carry out a progressive reduction of its Armed Forces, to 
eliminate military commissioners, and to dismantle the PACs 
[Civilian Self-Defense Patrols], among others. 
  Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso has said the 
independent expert's latest report did not refer to social 
realities as the armed groups's responsibility within a context 
of national violence. 
  The official has admitted this and other economic 
realities-- 
including poverty in rural areas and others that are detrimental 
to society and result in a military confrontation--were not 
fully discussed because the expert could not possibily spend so 
much time in the country for her work. 
  He said: In general terms, it is a frank and honest report 
that reviews many of the country's realities. Although she does 
not fail to cite problems in many paragraphs, she also admits 
the progress achieved; for example, civilians' participation in 
society and the respect for freedom of thought. 
  Regarding the creation of an intelligence service, he said 
this is nothing new, because countries such as Honduras and 
Costa Rica have such a unit assigned to the Presidency, not to 
mention the fact it was also one of the recommendations the 
previous expert made. 
  He said our country is capable of doing this and has the 
support of other friendly countries, adding there are certain 
organizations that do not operate as civilian intelligence but 
could do so with the proper statistics, fiscal, banking, and 
planning coordination. 
  National Police Director Mario Rene Cifuentes has referred 
to 
the issue and said the report "objectively reviews the country's 
human rights problems and emphasizes we should pledge to improve 
and surpass ourselves in certain issues." 
  He said the civilian intelligence issue is a state security 
problem rather than a police problem, but he said a 
recommendation to create a central unit to investigate human 
rights violations was already carried out, and the UN expert was 
notified about this via her representative.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Monday, 
the Ramiro de Leon Carpio administrtaion and the Army spoke out 
against negotiating with URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity] guerrillas on the creation of a commission to investigate 
human rights violations during the 33 years of armed conflict in 
Guatemala. 
  While the government considers that the time is not right to 
discuss forming a commission called the "Truth Commission" or 
"Commission of the Past" with its immediate international 
verification, the Army flatly rejected "any possibility" of 
doing so. 
  The "Truth Commission" and the participation of 
international 
agents are things the URNG guerrillas have demanded as part of 
the peace discussion with the various governments over the past 
decade. 
  Copaz [Peace Commission], a government sponsored 
organization, President Hector Rosada, admitted today in a 
meeting with foreign journalists that "there are military 
sectors who are unhappy" about reaching an agreement on human 
rights and the creation of the Truth Commission. Deputy Defense 
Minister General Julio Fidencio Otzoy told ACAN-EFE today, 
during a visit to El Salvador, that "we do not accept the 
so-called Truth Commission or Commission of the Past, under any 
circumstance. The commission is definitely bad because we are 
searching for peace and reconciliation, but the commission seeks 
to reopen wounds; it brings out the bad side of people, bad 
blood, which in turn causes violence and instability," stressed 
Otzoy. 
  The military leader, nevertheless, considered positive the 
fact that the government and the guerrillas reached a framework 
for agreement in January for the resumption of peace talks, 
possibly next month. "Our position is to immediately seek peace, 
but unfortunately the URNG is not interested in peace; what they 
are interested in is a political aspect," stated Otzoy. 
  According to the military leader, the URNG "has already 
militarily lost the war" and is now fighting "tooth and nail" to 
ensure political recognition so that "their effort is not 
described as useless and so the situation does not turn against 
them." 
  Copaz President Hector Rosada said the government "is not 
refusing" to discuss the creation of the commission at another 
time in the peace process, but stressed that the Army believes 
this affair "seeks to weaken or blame the Armed Forces." 
  The government representative denied that an Armed Forces 
purge or reduction will be discussed in the negotiations with 
the URNG "because these are military affairs; civilians have no 
business discussing them. These are matters that depend on 
geopolitical reasons." 
  Hector Rosada, an expert sociologist in military topics, 
stressed that "by dividing the Army all that will be gained is a 
coup d'etat," therefore, he warned that the government is not in 
"position to unnecessarily relinquish political opportunities" 
to the guerrillas. "The Truth Commission," he added, "is a 
verification mechanism not a human right commission, therefore 
we will discuss it when the time comes." Rosada insisted that 
the government "is not refusing" to discuss this affair. 
  Rosada maintains that the United Nations cannot adapt the 
mechanisms used in El Salvador to Guatemala because it is not 
the proper procedure and in addition, he stressed, "I have my 
reservations" about the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal). 
  To his way of thinking, the Truth Commission should be an 
educational and political instrument so the population can learn 
that "the politics of animals were used throughout 20 years" and 
so sectors learn not to hide in impunity. Rosada believes this 
commission should take the most representative cases of 
genocide, kidnappings, and murders to demonstrate that "what 
happened when the country was a mess." 
  Copaz has requested President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and 
Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez not to change any of the 
three high-ranking officers who comprise it, given negotiations 
with the guerrilla are due to begin in the next few weeks with 
UN mediation.

  [Text] It was officially announced that the military 
members of the Peace Commission will be replaced before the 
government begins direct negotiations with the commanders of the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) scheduled for 
early March. 
  Peace Commission President Hector Rosada Granados confirmed 
that Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez Morales 
informed him of his decision to seek new mechanisms to 
participate in the peace process. In that sense, he said that he 
plans to carry out a number of military changes within the 
government Peace Commission. He added that a consensus is being 
sought to determine who will replace Generals Marco Antonio 
Gonzalez Taracena, Victor Manuel Ventura Arellano, and Victor 
Manuel Argueta Villalta. 
  Rosada Granados said he is getting ready for discussions on 
human rights with the URNG and is preparing with information 
from human rights representatives at the Archbishop's Office, 
the Presidential Commission, and Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge 
Mario Garcia, with whom he will arrange a meeting. 
<H5>  Former Guerrilla Commander Offers To Cooperate in Process </H5>
  It was also reported that former guerrilla commander Cesar 
Montes or Macias on various occasions has expressed his 
willingness to cooperate with the peace process, particularly 
with the demobilization of rebel troops. 
  Rosada Granados said that although he has talked with the 
former rebel commander on several occasions, he has never 
expressed his desire to seek amnesty or safe-conduct that would 
enable him to join society. In any event, he added, if he wanted 
to return to legal life, Montes or Macias would be protected by 
the amnesty program implemented in 1986 and 1988.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (DPA) -- The country's 
teachers and public employees began staggered work stoppages 
today to demand raises and other benefits. The length of the 
stoppages will increase every day leading up to a total strike 
next Monday, Hugo Estrada, president of the National Association 
of Middle School Teachers, announced. 
  Teachers and public employees are joining a strike initiated 
several days ago by public health employees, including doctors 
and nurses. Because of this strike, state and Guatemalan Social 
Security hospitals are providing emergency services only, to the 
detriment of patients who now must go to private medical centers. 
  The state employees are demanding a 40-percent pay raise, 
although it is highly unlikely that Ramiro De Leon Carpio's 
administration can agree to it. Armando Sanchez, secretary 
general of the National Federation of State Workers Unions, 
stated that public employees will stand firm in their demands, 
because "we know the resources do exist to grant a wage 
increase."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- While 
Guatemalan Government employees today requested the resignation 
of President Ramiro De Leon, the government considered the 
possibility of imposing sanctions on striking employees for 
refusing to negotiate and for failing to show up for work. 
  Edgar Batres, National Federation of State Workers Unions

approximately 1,000 employees, that beginning today partial 
strikes will take place at 50 percent of government offices and 
that by Friday the strike will be total. 
  Meanwhile, Labor and Social Security Minister Anabella 
Morfin 
reiterated today that the government has not dismissed the 
possibility of filing a lawsuit against the employees who leave 
their jobs because the government will not tolerate the 
employees adopting illegal measures if they do not first exhaust 
the possibilities of dialogue. "If they are to be paid they must 
work," said Morfin, who has asked the labor leaders to 
reconsider. 
  Hour-long strikes have been held every day to demand a 40 
percent salary increase and they have continued despite De 
Leon's threats of punishment. According to Batres, 180,000 state 
employees will not show up for work on Friday. 
  "We are not going to stop," said Bernardino Arriaza, a 
Postal 
Workers Union leader, who explained that the increase they are 
requesting is an adjustment to the inflation accumulated between 
1992 and 1994. During the demonstration, labor leaders 
criticized President de Leon for his economic policy, which they 
described as neoliberal, and they demanded his resignation.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified 
individuals blew up nine utility poles in the countryside, the 
police reported here today. 
  The police report published in the local media added that 
the 
departments (provinces) of Solola in the west and El Quiche in 
the north were left without electricity as a result of the 13 
February attack. 
  According to experts, the bombs were activated by remote 
control more than 100 meters from the site of the explosion. 
  There were approximately 20 bomb attacks against Congress, 
the electric power grid, television repeater stations, and 
several businesses in the latter part of January within the 
framework of the referendum on constitutional amendments.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Police have disclosed at least three explosive devices were 
deactivated today by members of the Guatemalan Armed Forces in 
the northwestern Department (province) of Quiche. 
  Three bombs were placed along public light posts in the 
Chichicastenango Municipality, 200 km northeast of Guatemala 
City, and deactivated by Army specialists. The police report 
adds Army troops are searching the area, attempting to locate 
the terrorists. 
  According to police, a knapsack with explosive devices and 
documents linking guerrillas to the attempts were found in the 
area where the explosives were discovered. 
  The deactivation took place after three electricity high 
tension wire pylons were sabotaged less than 48 hours in the 
same area of Quiche. 
  Nine electricity high tension pylons have been destroyed 
with 
dynamite charges in the western Department of Quetzaltenango, 
Solola, and Quiche. 
  The Government Ministry and Army are trying to locate those 
responsible for these incidents.

  [Text] San Salvador, 14 Feb (AFP) -- Today, Julio Otzoy, 
Guatemalan deputy defense minister, ruled out any possible 
participation of the Army in a coup d'etat. He admitted, 
however, that some "irresponsible people" have invited the Armed 
Forces to do just that. The Guatemalan Armed Forces "cannot 
accept" a coup, Otzoy told the press. 
  He participated in an event to hand out prostheses to people 
mutilated in the Central American war. The event was held in 
Santa Ana, 66 km from San Salvador, today. 
  Last week, the media reported rumors of coup preparations in 
Guatemala to remove President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who is 
facing growing political opposition and labor protests. 
  Although Otzoy ruled out the Army's involvement in these 
plans, he said that "irresponsible people," who he declined to 
identify, have "knocked on the barracks' doors" with political 
motives. He added that if any officers are involved, they will 
be handed over to the administration of justice because "our 
laws clearly indicate that no military personnel can participate 
in politics." 
  "We have already experienced the consequences of a coup," 
the 
deputy minister said. He said a coup would hurt the Guatemalan 
people, cause chaos, and prove "inconceivable" under the present 
circumstances. 
  Guatemala's most recent institutional crisis took place last 
year on the occasion of then President Jorge Serrano's aborted 
self-inflicted coup. Serrano was later overthrown by the 
military.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- President Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio has allowed the U.S. "Fuertes Caminos" program in 
Guatemala without official authorization, congressmen said 
today. Congress president Vinicio Villar Anleu said De Leon 
failed to ask Congress to authorize the program. Villar said any 
possible penalties will be handled by the Attorney General's 
Office. "It is up to the Attorney General's Office to determine 
whether the U.S. military personnel in Guatemala are active or 
reservists, and whether or not De Leon should be penalized for 
failing to request permission from Congress," Villar Anleu said. 
  In "Fuertes Caminos," U.S. National Guard Reserve members 
participate in building highways, repairing schools and health 
centers, drilling wells, and providing dental services in the 
country's interior. The program was started last week and is 
slated to last until next June. 
  The U.S. Embassy explained that 300 men will be rotated 
every 
15 days and that the number of U.S. military at any one time in 
Guatemala will never exceed 500. 
  Villar Anleu admitted that he attended the inauguration of 
"Fuertes Caminos," but he only saw engineers, medics, mechanics, 
and carpenters, but no soldiers. 
  The Constitution stipulates that Congress must approve the 
deployment of foreign troops in Guatemala or the transfer of 
foreign forces. National jurists suggested that De Leon may have 
violated the Constitution by not consulting with Congress or 
allowing legislators to ratify the execution of "Fuertes 
Caminos." 
  Legislative sources said "Fuertes Caminos" is the result of 
an agreement between President de Leon and the U.S. Government, 
therefore it is up to the president to disclose the details of 
the program. 
  This week, former Guatemalan President Francisco Villagran 
Kramer (1982-86) suggested to President De Leon that to avoid 
speculations, he disclose the contents of the "Fuertes Caminos" 
agreements.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] More than two months before the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion in Chiapas, the 25 
October PROCESO carried a 23 September letter to the editor from 
the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ), denying any 
involvement in earlier Chiapas guerrilla activities. Such 
guerrilla activity had been alleged by Jesuit priest Mardonio 
Morales in the 13 September issue of the magazine (for this and 
related reports, see the 9 December FBIS LATIN AMERICA DAILY 
REPORT). The OCEZ letter also criticizes high-level officials 
who prior to beginning their government careers were involved in 
leftist political activities in Chiapas during the 1970's. 
  The letter asserts that since its formation in 1982 the OCEZ 
has operated entirely within the law in its struggle for land 
and in its organizing activities throughout Chiapas. It also 
acknowledges that the group that eventually became the OCEZ had 
had political ties with a Maoist group, the Popular Line (which 
later became the Proletarian Line), or so-called "northerners," 
during the period March-August 1978. The letter concedes that 
"we dealt with Adolfo Orive, Javier Gil, and another two dozen 
`cadres' who came to Chiapas to develop `support bases'" but 
claims that in the course of our dealings "we discovered serious 
contradictions between their radical phraseology and their 
actual behavior, most notably: their great waste of economic 
resources, their unusual links with public officials, a 
so-called `two-faced policy,' a disguised pro-government 
approach, manipulation and immorality--all of which clashed with 
our viewpoints and principles and prompted us to break relations 
with them." In addition, the letter denies that the OCEZ ever 
sought to penetrate the Church to increase its influence, as 
charged by Father Mardonio. 
  The letter's criticism of the northern organizers' integrity 
touches on an issue already raised in the press: the 
government's reported efforts to recruit leftists for government 
service. The 13 September PROCESO report itself, for instance, 
asserts that while Orive had been a professor in the School of 
Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where 
he founded the Popular Line and Proletarian Line groups, he has 
since gone on to serve as current training director of the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)-affiliated 
National Peasant Confederation (CNC) and as a director of the 
National Solidarity Program (Pronasol) as well as adviser to 
Pronasol Coordinator Carlos Rojas Gutierrez. The letter also 
implicitly criticizes former Popular Line leader Hugo Andres 
Araujo de la Torre, who is identified as a PRI federal deputy 
and CNC secretary general by Father Mardonio in the 13 September 
PROCESO report. A 7 September 1992 PROCESO article on political 
recruitment had described the careers of Orive (written there as 
"Oribe," but clearly referring to the same person) and Araujo, 
adding that the latter "had passed through almost the entire 
gamut of organizations on the left, ranging from radical Maoists 
to the...Popular Action Movement." A 9 December 1991 PROCESO 
article had identified Araujo as sharing a "compadre," or 
godparent, relationship with President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari.

<F P=106> [Bulletin No. 29 issued by the Defense Secretariat in Mexico </F>
City on 11 February; from the "24 Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] Several news media have reported the exodus of the 
indigenous population toward larger cities and townships because 
of the armed conflict in the state of Chiapas. Although the 
National Defense Secretariat has kept the public informed about 
the violence unleashed by the rebels against both people and 
property, it wishes to offer the following figures and 
information in an attempt to provide the people with a more 
complete picture -- a picture to which they are entitled. 
  1. The migratory flow toward major cities and towns in the 
region originates in the villages and hamlets under rebel 
control or influence. 
  2. Testimony by the people who have sought shelter and 
protection at the refugee camps indicates that they fled their 
villages after being stripped of their land, animals, crops, and 
property, and because of constant harassment for refusing to 
join the armed groups. 
  3. As of this time, 19,188 displaced inhabitants are at 
various shelters or with relatives and friends in the areas 
under Army protection listed below: 
  In Escarcega, Campeche, there are 207 people; at individual 
homes in Chanal there are 50; in (Ochuc), 100; in La Trinitaria, 
1,042; in San Cristobal de Las Casas, 250; at shelters in 
Ocosingo, 544 and 8,206 more are with friends or relatives; in 
Altamirano there are 403; and in Las Margaritas, 8,283. The 
total number of all refugees is 19,085. [figures as heard]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 11 Feb (AFP) -- 
The remains of three people who had been arrested by the Mexican 
Army were found today in Chiapas by members of the nongovernment 
organizations (ONG) that work to defend human rights. 
  Martin Faz from the National Network of Civilian 
Organizations All Rights for All [Red Nacional de Organismos 
Civiles Todos los Derechos para Todos] assured at a news 
conference that Severino, Sebastian, and Hermelindo Santiz were 
arrested by the Army on 7 January in Altamirano, one of the 
municipalities taken over by guerrillas. Since then, they had 
been reported as missing. 
  Faz said ONG members today found the "remains, bones, 
clothing, and footware, allowing us to assure that they 
correspond to the people who were reported as missing." 
According to Faz, reports from residents of Morelia in 
Altamirano municipality indicate that the three people were 
"arbitrarily arrested by some Mexican Army soldiers on 7 
January." Fax added that "there is no doubt" that the remains 
correspond to those three people; a relative has identified the 
clothing and a "dental bridge" that belonged to one of the 
missing. 
  Thomas Craine, a member of the organization Medical Doctors 
for Human Rights [Medicos por los Derechos Humanos] that 
participated in the search, said, "We did not find evidence of 
the cause of death, but we have asked for a completed forensic 
and anthropological investigation." Craine said the remains 
have been turned over to the Attorney General's Office and the 
National Commission for Human Rights which had initiated earlier 
investigations. 
  The Mexican Army's conduct during the Indian armed rebellion 
has been criticized by the ONG for engaging in extreme actions, 
such as secret executions and arbitrary arrests.

  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat has issued a 
bulletin denying the Mexican Army's alleged participation in the 
murder of three people in the area of Morelia, Altamirano, 
Chiapas State. 
  In reply to a request made by various political and human 
rights organizations that requested clarification of the 
incident, the National Defense Secretariat said the Mexican Army 
never carried out any action to arrest, much less to murder 
these individuals, given that on 7 January there was no military 
presence in the area. 
  The Defense Secretariat added that at the request of the 
people, the Army arrested 32 individuals who had broken the law, 
clarifying that this occurred five days after the armed 
confrontation began. The Army turned over the 32 arrested 
individuals to local authorities after a public medical 
examination was made to determine their physical condition, the 
bulletin concluded.

  [Text] Brussels/Geneva, 13 Feb (DPA) -- Colombia suffered a 
major diplomatic setback and was isolated in the "banana war" 
when it unilaterally announced the withdrawal of its demands to 
the GATT, and the EU disregarded its urgent request to maintain 
the quota distribution offer made in December 1993. 
  New and significant details were disclosed the weekend of 11 
February regarding the desperate diplomatic efforts made on 10 
and 11 February by Colombian Ambassadors Carlos Alberto 
Marulanda in Brussels, and Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez in Geneva 
following Costa Rica's withdrawal from the group made up also of 
Nicaragua and Venezuela. 
  In a last and desperate attempt to convince the Europeans to 
maintain the quotas, Colombia sent a letter to GATT disclosing 
its decision to withdraw its demands against the questioned 
European regulations for banana imports so long as the EU offer 
was still standing. The letter was accompanied by a new offer 
made by the Colombian Government to the EU, which proposed a 
23.4-percent increase in the relative percentage of the total 
quota for Costa Rica while for Colombia the quota was set at 21 
percent, for Nicaragua, 3 percent, and for Venezuela, 2 percent. 
  The EU ignored the Colombian request, from this sterile 
fight 
among the Latin American countries and decided definitively to 
withdraw the 14-December offer once the decision by the GATT 
committee of experts was revealed on 11 February in Geneva. 
This decision declared the EU regulations for banana imports 
discriminatory and in violation of international trade rules. 
  Rene Steichen, the European commissioner for agricultural 
affairs, said that the formula that proposed an increase of the 
quota to 2.2 million in 1995 and a distribution of quotas and 
licenses among the Latin American exporting countries had been 
discarded because two of the exporting countries, namely Costa 
Rica and Guatemala, had not accepted it. 
  In this manner, Colombia's position, which it had secretly 
negotiated with the EU, fell apart and at the same time 
compromised Nicaragua's and Venezuela's position, two countries 
that had supported Colombia's stance. 
  A diplomatic source close to the other countries (Colombia, 
Nicaragua, and Venezuela) indicated that Costa Rica's attitude 
caused "considerable unease" within the group. The weakening in 
this group's position reinforced the stance held by Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico who are challenging the 
European import system and have presented a counterproposal 
consistent with GATT regulations and currently under evaluation 
by the EU. 
  Diplomatic sources have pointed out that Ambassador 
Marulanda's performance, the obvious proponent of the secret 
negotiations held last year during a three month period with the 
EU in Brussels, is fully backed by President Cesar Gaviria and 
his Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos. It has been 
learned that Marulanda is expected to return to Colombia in the 
next few days in response to his government's summon. 
  Since last Wednesday, the Governments of Ecuador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Panama, and Mexico increased their high-level contacts 
with Costa Rica following President Gaviria's and Trade Minister 
Santos' unsuccessful bid to persuade Ecuadoran Vice President 
Alberto Dahik, currently visiting Santa Fe de Bogota, to adhere 
to Colombia''s thesis. 
  Following the inevitable failure of the quota offer made by 
the EU (which was brought about by Colombia's initiative), the 
Latin American countries are now once again trying to close deep 
wounds and restore lost unity. The announcement related to the 
fall of the quota offer was made to the Latin American foreign 
and trade ministers on Thursday in Brussels by Commissioner 
Steichen himself when they delivered the counterproposal. 
  Costa Rica was the first country to realize in time the need 
to reaccommodate its diplomatic position in light of the 
strength of the other countries' initiative which is supported 
within the GATT by Brazil and now also by the United States. 
  GATT General Director Peter Sutherland and EU Commissioner 
Leon Brittan were advised of the U.S. position by Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. Sutherland is attempting to 
reschedule the 25 March deadline for an earlier date in order to 
present proposals to improve the Uruguay Round offers (which 
will finally be signed on 15 April in Marrakesh, Morroco). The 
negotiating period with the EU expires on 28 March, before 
experts committee decision on the banana issue is passed to the 
GATT contracting parties council. 
  There is the likelihood that negotiations between Latin 
American countries and the EU will take place sometime before 27 
March. With the EU withdrawing the quota offer made on 14 
December, the original offer No. 404 made in March 1993 on the 
import system in effect since 1 July of last year remains 
standing. 
  A better offer could rise from new negotiations between 
Latin America and the EU which is in an uncomfortable position 
as well as under pressure that the technical committee decision, 
which establishes a poor precedent as regards international law, 
will be made public during the meeting between the 117 GATT 
member countries. 
  There are several formulas circulating around Brussels as 
well as Geneva diplomatic and technical circles, including one 
by the German Government, another by the U.S. Senate, in 
addition to a counterproposal by a group coordinated now by 
Guatemala. This proposal includes an assistance fund for those 
banana producing countries who are signatories of the Lome 
Treaty (Africa, Caribbean, and the Pacific).

the presence of U.S. military forces in Latin America by 
Bolivian Senator Andres Solis Rada in La Paz, former Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich in Caracas, retired 
Ecuadoran Division General Richelieu Levoyer in Quito, Peruvian 
General Sinecio Jarama in Lima, and Colombian General Gabriel 
Puyana in Santa Fe de Bogota, with moderator Eduardo Lozano at 
the Santa Fe de Bogota Radio Cadena Nacional studios in Santa Fe 
de Bogota -- live] 
  [Text] [Lozano] Lately, agreements and pacts that 
governments have signed with the United States have basically 
allowed U.S. military forces, including military engineers and 
some technicians, to visit countries in the region to teach or 
to work on construction projects. Colombia is no exception, and 
currently the presence of U.S. military forces in this country 
has generated a strong dispute between the State Council and 
President Cesar Gaviria. What do Latin American countries think 
of the U.S. military presence in our nations? Let us recall 
that not long ago in Paraguay and Uruguay, senators reacted 
against the presence of U.S. technicians in their countries. 
Let us immediately begin to learn the viewpoint of each nation. 
Let us begin with La Paz, Bolivia. Welcome Juan Jose Hidalgo. 
  [Hidalgo] Thanks, Eduardo. Good morning, Latin America. The 
presence of U.S. troops in Latin America has raised concern and 
has prompted various responses. In Bolivia, they use the word 
technicians, even the word doctors, to avoid direct reference to 
the U.S. military regarding the presence of U.S. military units. 
To deal with this issue, we have invited Senator Andres Solis 
Rada, who is among those who have strongly criticized the U.S. 
military presence in Bolivia. Senator Solis will give us his 
opinion regarding the current situation in Bolivia. Senator, 
130 million Latin Americans are listening to you. Good morning. 
  [Solis] Good morning, and a Bolivarian greeting to my Latin 
American brothers. We believe that the systematic presence of 
the U.S. Armed Forces in our countries is the result of the 
existence of a new U.S. strategic doctrine regarding Latin 
American countries. That doctrine is called the new world order, 
and it was outlined by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan [as 
heard] immediately after the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 
December 1989. 
  According to the new world order, concepts such as 
sovereignty, nation, armed forces, dignity, patriotism, or 
borders are obsolete terms. This doctrine comprises both a 
pretext and a practical reality. The pretext is the fight 
against drug trafficking. We believe that if the United States 
truly wants to eliminate drug trafficking, it can achieve this 
goal very in a short time -- I would say two or three weeks. 
How? It can simply control the laundering of $3 or $4 billion 
by international banks. Instead of controlling the banks, 
however, the United States has opted to send military forces 
with the illusory goal of catching mosquitoes with boxing 
gloves. The biggest drug traffickers are not in the jungles, 
but in New York's skyscrapers or in the modern buildings of 
Latin American capitals. Therefore, this is all a great pretext. 
  We believe their primary objective is the occupation of the 
Amazonian region. According to the developed countries, the 
Amazonian region is one of the world's lungs, but from the 
Eurocentric viewpoint, humanity only includes Europeans and 
white North Americans. According to this outlook, the Amazonian 
region does not belong to Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, 
Ecuador, or Colombia, but to them. They are seeking to rule the 
world with ideas that date back to 200 years ago -- the ideas of 
Adam Smith or Thomas Robert Malthus. 
  To illustrate my point, I will recall that in May 1992, 400 
U.S. engineers, who were specialists in troop landings, arrived 
in Bolivia. The odd part was that to justify their presence, it 
was argued that they were coming to repair schools and dig 
latrines. These schools and latrines cost $20,000, while 
providing transportation for these 400 U.S. engineers rang in at 
$8 million. Therefore, they are clearly not coming to build 
latrines or schools; they are getting ready to occupy the 
Amazonian area, especially the Brazilian part, where there is 
the greatest opposition to this policy. 
  Their second goal is to get people used to the presence of 
foreign troops. Before I conclude, I cannot overlook the 
occupation of our countries by police forces. We have denounced 
the fact that Bolivia's major cities -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and 
Santa Cruz -- are patrolled 24 hours a day by agents under the 
command of Bolivian officials and who also work for the U.S. 
Government. Their vehicles have license plates that belong to 
international cooperation or intelligence services. In the end, 
if we remain passive regarding this situation, we will soon 
become colonies with a parliament and a flag, but the parliament 
and the flag will merely be a facade to cover this intervetion. 
Nevertheless, a slave who realizes his slavery begins to be 
free. Let us realize this situation of dependence to be loyal 
to Simon Bolivar's legacy and resist the very tense situation we 
are currently living. This is our viewpoint from La Paz, 
Bolivia. 
  [Hidalgo] Thank you Senator Andres Solis Rada. You have 
heard the senator's position, which strongly questions the U.S. 
military presence in Bolivian territory. Back to you, Eduardo 
Lozano. 
  [Lozano] Juan Jose, I really appreciate your report from La 
Paz, Bolivia. What are the thoughts in Venezuela? What are the 
Venezuelan people's ideas on whether or not they agree with the 
U.S. military presence? Caracas, welcome Elsy Verrueta: 
  [Verrueta] Many thanks, Eduardo Lozano, and good morning to 
all our Latin American listeners. The topic has been a matter of 
controversy in our country in the past. The possibility that 
U.S. military forces could come to Venezuela arose emerged and 
it became the task of Division General Fernando Ochoa Antich to 
take charge of the problem. First, he was defense minister and 
then foreign minister until 2 February. He is our guest and he 
is going to give us his opinion and how he handled the 
situation. Of course, we also want to hear his opinion about the 
possibility that U.S. troops could remain in some Latin American 
country. Go ahead Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, we want to hear 
your opinion. 
  [Ochoa] Many thanks. First, I want to take advantage of this 
extraordinary opportunity to send my cordial greetings to the 
Latin American people listening to us. When I was defense 
minister, I had the great responsibility of negotiating, with 
the United States, agreements for the antinarcotic radars. 
Venezuela was very firm in the position we presented to the U.S. 
negotiators, and we managed to convince them this was not 
possible in Venezuela because of a basic feeling or principle 
among Venezuelans of not accepting foreign troops under any 
circumstance, even though they were unarmed. 
  Venezuelans would not accept, under any circumstance, that 
the radars be handled by U.S. troops. If this point was not 
amendable, then these radars could simply not be located in 
Venezuela, with all the consequences this would have had for the 
struggle against drug trafficking. We managed to convince the 
United States; they understood the Venezuelan position and 
fortunately an agreement was reached whereby the radars are 
operated entirely by the Venezuelan Armed Forces. 
  This is a very strong feeling, both among Venezuelans as 
well 
as Latin Americans. I really cannot understand how Latin 
American Governments can accept foreign troops in their country 
-- mainly U.S. troops -- behind the back of the people, even 
though these troops need not be involved in any military 
activity. This is a problem of nationalism, which is deeply 
entrenched among Latin Americans because of our sad history of 
colonialism. That is why we and the people have always rejected 
this. This, despite the fact that current relations with the 
United States are much more constructive than relations based on 
Marine invasions. None of our people can accept the presence of 
foreign troops in our country due to our concept of liberty, 
which is so very much a part of our feeling. 
  Another very basic point, which was discussed very 
intelligently by the Bolivian senator, is the interest in the 
drug-trafficking problem. The U.S. interest toward our countries 
right now, aside from the permanent interest in raw materials, 
is simply to do with drug trafficking. There are two very 
complex problems. One, their interest that our Armed Forces 
direct the work to fight drug trafficking. I have maintained a 
doctrinal position on this. The Latin American countries' Armed 
Forces cannot be used against drug trafficking because the 
corruption capacity of drug trafficking would force the Armed 
Forces to lose their main capacity as institutions intended to 
defend our countries and sovereignty. Therefore, this is a 
position that Venezuela has also maintained very firmly by 
rejecting the idea that our Armed Forces be used to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  We accept that the National Guard, which is part of the 
Armed 
Forces but tasked mainly as an administrative police, can be 
used for this. In no way, however, will we accept the 
involvement of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force in fighting 
drug trafficking because this would change the main purpose of 
our Armed Forces. The third point, which I believe is very 
important and which I will stress, is that the struggle against 
drug trafficking cannot be successful until consumption in 
developed countries is controlled, as it should be. This is a 
fight which these countries must face because while the drug 
trafficking business remains so productive, this struggle is 
simply a loss of time, even though we are fighting. In this 
respect, I admire the people of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, who 
are waging an all-out war against drug trafficking, with a lot 
of sacrifice. 
  The fact of the matter is that until consumption is not 
checked and until money laundering is not controlled, we simply 
cannot be successful in our struggle against drug trafficking. 
  [Verrueta] Thank you Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich for your 
valuable opinion. We return once more to Eduardo Lozano. 
  [Lozano] Thank you Gen. Ochoa for your participation in 
this special program. Now we are with Jorge Ivan Melo, in Quito. 
  [Melo] Thank you, Eduardo. Greetings to our 130 million 
listeners throughout Latin America. 
  In 1987 in Ecuador, the Ecuadoran and U.S. Armies signed an 
understanding memorandum to allow military maneuvers and works 
in support of the civilian population. This resulted in the 
construction of a road that according to budget figures should 
have been 57 km long. Only 2,200 meters were built. 
  We invited retired General Richelieu Levoyer to discuss 
this. 
He has been government minister, general commander of the Army, 
and a deputy. Currently, he is the president of Omidelac, 
Organization of Military Men for Democracy and the Integration 
of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  General, what has been the result of the U.S. military 
presence in Ecuador? 
  [Levoyer] Thank you. First I want to cordially greet the 
Latin American community, which is very concerned about this 
very important issue. I can say the Ecuadoran people have always 
been opposed to the presence of U.S. troops in our territory. 
These troops sometimes come to build roads but the fact is we 
have excellent military and civilian engineers who can do this 
work. 
  We also find it strange that U.S. troops have to come here 
to 
build one, two, or three small schools in the countryside. This 
is something our civil engineers, who can rely on the 
cooperation of the teachers, can do perfectly well. Why then 
must troops, and not civil engineers and technicians, come here 
to build roads or schools? 
  In any event, the clearest evidence of the Ecuadoran 
people's 
position on the presence of U.S. troops in our country took 
place in 1987. I was a congressional deputy at the time. In 
March of 1987, there was a tremor that destroyed an interior 
road in our country's Amazon region, the Baeza-La Guagrio road, 
leaving approximately 100,000 people isolated. 
  The U.S. Army and our government reached an agreement called 
Opening Routes. Based on this agreement, the U.S. Army would 
open an alternate 57 km long road going through the towns of 
Ollin, Loreto, and Coca. A total of 6,000 soldiers, arriving in 
groups of 600, came to the country to do the work in six months. 
The performance of this task force, the U.S. 1169 Task Force, 
was, to say the least, lacking. As a member of the congressional 
commission charged with overseeing the work of the U.S. troops, 
I personally confirmed that they built only 2,200 km 
[measurement as heard] of road. 
  [Melo] General, the Bolivian senator and some Ecuadoran 
analysts have said the U.S. military wants to learn about Latin 
America's geography to put pressure on the jungle areas and to 
familiarize the people with U.S. troops so a future invasion is 
not seen as odd. How true could this be? 
  [Levoyer] I agree with what Bolivian Senator Andres Solis 
Rada said. The 1987 event confirms his statement. That year I 
personally spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Powell, the commander 
of the U.S. group that came to build the alternate road in the 
Amazon region, and he emphatically and carelessly told me the 
U.S. objective had been accomplished: the training of U.S. 
soldiers in a jungle area like ours. He told me the U.S. troops 
had become accustomed to performing in this type of environment. 
  Regarding the objectives of cooperation with and the 
transferal of technology to our military engineers, these 
objectives failed because equipment was lost, the soldiers did 
not know the river flow variances, their equipment sank in humid 
regions, and they could not work well. 
  [Melo] We thank retired General Levoyer for his 
participation 
in this Solar program. Now we go back to Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  [Lozano] Thank you. We will now contact Dennis Vargas, in 
Lima. What do Peruvians think about the involvement of U.S. 
military forces in aid programs? Go ahead Dennis. 
  [Vargas] Latin America's tradition has been that of 
defending 
the principles of nonintervention and sovereignty. This should 
be clearly established in international law. American or North 
American doctrine on international law better outlines these 
principles. In the specific case of drug trafficking, we would 
have to analyze the situation. Legislative Branches are always 
concerned about respect for the legal framework of fighting drug 
trafficking in the various countries, especially in Bolivia, 
Peru, and Colombia. Some concepts put international law in 
danger when there is meddling. 
  Our guest today is General Sinecio Jarama. We are asking 
him, as part of the Solar network, about the U.S. military 
presence in Peru or how much of a presence there was before and 
what can he tell us about the topic. What is the role of U.S. 
soldiers or military engineers in our countries? Over 100 
million Latin Americans are listening to you. 
  [Jarama] I would first like to thank you for this 
invitation. I also wish to send greetings to those 100 million 
Latin Americans listening to the Solar System. Getting into the 
topic of whether U.S. troops should be in our countries, it is 
worth noting first that this has been and remains a permanent 
concern for all Latin Americans, both civilians and military 
personnel. Second, it is also worth noting that in Peru there 
has been adamant opposition to the authorization of the presence 
of foreign troops in our territory. Whenever this has happened, 
or whenever there have been complaints about it, the people or 
various political or social sectors have reacted by demanding an 
explanation, and the appropriate authorities have explained the 
matter. Third, I also want to point out that the presence of 
foreign troops is addressed in the constitutions of all our 
countries. This is not a decision or whim on the part of the 
Pentagon or the U.S. Administration. Our constitutions give 
specific details of the measures to be followed, the steps to be 
taken, or the institutions to be consulted when a foreign 
country wants to bring its troops into our territories. This is 
also a problem that involves the exercise of our sovereignty. 
The president and his military advisers normally handle such 
matters. In addition, the respective legislatures must be asked 
for their authorization; that is, the countries' respective 
legislatures. That is where the exercise of our sovereignty 
comes in. I must also say, however, that over the past four 
decades, from the 1950's until now, the United States, through 
its military offices or military attache offices, has maintained 
relations with our military forces. These relations have 
allowed the development of cooperation programs, which are 
basically military training programs that have entailed joint 
actions by combined U.S.-Peruvian forces. There are also 
programs like Operation Unitas. There are other programs that 
are part of the training of U.S. reserve troops, which is the 
case with the troops in Panama. They come with engineer 
battalions, conduct training exercises, and leave behind some 
benefit for the community. 
  [Vargas] Thank you, Gen. Jarama, for being with us on the 
Solar network. We are returning to Santa Fe de Bogota. Eduardo. 
  [Lozano] Thanks, Denis, you are very kind. General Gabriel 
Puyana, our guest today, is a very well-known military man in 
Colombia, and although he has retired already, he is a true 
Colombian. We only have a minute, General. We would like to 
hear your opinion as a military member and a Colombian regarding 
the presence of foreign troops -- in this case, U.S. soldiers -- 
in Colombia. 
  [Puyana] Thanks to Radio Cadena Nacional and the Solar 
Network. Since I only have a minute, I will be clear and 
concise. I was able to hear part of what the other guests have 
said on this program, and basically I agree with them. 
  A distinction must be made, especially with the current 
controversy in Colombia, between troops being in a country on a 
temporary or permanent basis. The Inter-American Reciprocal 
Assistance Treaty signed in 1947 has been mentioned here. We 
must recall that Colombia participated in Korea. However, we 
must differentiate between technical advisers, who teach and 
help facilitate learning about new and sophisticated equipment, 
and regular troops, because the latter causes wariness and 
rejection. 
  But there are different viewpoints about this issue. People 
in those isolated areas, who have been systematically and long 
forgotten by various governments, are satisfied because their 
urgent needs are somewhat relieved. But let's not confuse the 
issue. We cannot think that a military attache in another 
country implies a foreign military presence in that territory. 
The Peruvian General has discussed this already. These are two 
different situations. 
  In addition, our histories give us certain obligations. If 
there are two countries that must assume dignified attitudes, 
setting aside the pragmatism of convenience, they are Mexico and 
Colombia. We must only recall Theodore Roosevelt and how Panama 
was taken away from Colombia. We were definitely better off, 
because it is as if one's arm is cut off [words indistinct], it 
is better to cut off the arm as it happened to Colombia. We 
were better off that another country, Panama, had to bear all 
that it has had to tolerate and will tolerate in this unending 
century. That is why I believe the presence of armed forces -- 
to be specific, logistics and operational units -- should not 
be accepted. 
  There is some background to this issue. For example, there 
was an operation here called America 1962. We must clarify that 
there is a difference between technicians who teach and help and 
troops who are here on a permanent basis. 
  Regarding the recent controversy, the problem arose 
basically 
due to a mishandling of information. It was very sad for 
Colombia -- and I say this as a Colombian -- that we had to 
learn about the entire episode through a statement by the 
ambassador as if this were a unilateral decision by the 
Pentagon. It was disgraceful. There has been a lack of 
information and misinformation. I want to reiterate that this 
is my personal opinion: I am not quoting anyone. As a 
Colombian, I do not approve of U.S. soldiers being here and 
doing things that we can do ourselves. 
  [Lozano] Many thanks, Gen. Puyana, you have been very kind.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Our Opinion" commentary] </F>
  [Text] Encouraged by the United States, many Cubans want to 
emigrate to that northern country. Why has the United States 
sponsored an incident involving the Interests Section in Havana? 
What has hurt the United States? Could it be that after 35 years 
of frustration it can no longer resist a Cuba that keeps 
resisting, and which in its [word indistinct] has adopted 
initiatives to facilitate the reunion of Cuban families? Or is 
it perhaps trying to create incidents with rumors like these, to 
prevent the meetings called for by Cuba? Or was it perhaps 
trying with this incident hastily to create charges to justify 
its groundless accusations against our country at the UN Human 
Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva? Or was it perhaps 
trying to tarnish the rally it knew was scheduled to be held in 
New York on 12 February in support of Cuba and the proposal that 
Charles Rangel will submit to the U.S. Congress demanding the 
lifting of the blockade? Or perhaps, because of its arrogance, 
the United States can no longer resist the many blows such as 
those scored by the success of Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina's tour of Africa; the great Israeli rabbi's recent 
remarks about Fidel Castro; Ricardo Alarcon's tour of several 
European nations; the agreements signed with businessmen from 
developed nations who have publicly stressed the feasibility of 
Cuban projects; and of Carlos Lage's successful visit to three 
Latin American countries? 
  Imperialism, the Miami counterrevolution, and the warmongers 
disguised as dissidents are fully and exclusively responsible 
for the incident. 
  Cuba does not implement any coercive policy; neither does it 
have any military base in any country whatsoever, nor does it 
finance radio or television stations against any government, nor 
does it lend its territory to shelter terrorist organizations 
with all material and radio means to promote incidents like this 
one. 
  The strength of the Cuban policy is based on its universally 
recognized justice, its clear openness, and its loyalty to the 
principles it proclaims. 
  The embassies in Cuba will always have the necessary 
protection and facilities to carry out their activities and 
provide security to their staffs, who also have the moral 
obligation not to promote incidents which have nothing to do 
with their diplomatic roles. 
  Trying to hold the Cuban press responsible for this incident 
because of the recent publication of a number of works on the 
emigration issue is a maneuver by certain U.S. sectors which can 
have no other objective than trying to disguise the true origin 
of the problem. It is childish to try to hold those who condemn 
and denounce such an action responsible for it. 
  Once again it is confirmed that the streets of this country 
belong to and will belong to revolutionaries. Under no pretext 
will anyone jeopardize the fatherland's independence. 
  The economy is experiencing a special period, but the 
dignity 
and decency of a people who are displaying heroism will never be 
at stake. 
  Today we must be more alert than ever. What imperialism 
could 
not achieve at Playa Giron or during the past 35 years, it is 
now trying to achieve, as in the 1960's, by spreading lies and 
rumors that could create incidents propitious for its goals. 
  It is not the Cuban Government that must give explanations 
to 
the people who might go to the U.S. Interests Section, but 
rather the U.S. officials. Surely they have publicly explained 
their rules for the issuance of visas, which will help dispel 
the false rumors and unfounded illusions created. 
  Our action and our duty, clearly outlined during the 
incident, are strictly based on the obligations of a nation and 
have been fulfilled impartially and efficiently. Cuba will 
continue granting all guarantees to those who are authorized by 
the United States to travel or to emigrate to that country. 
  Nothing happened within the U.S. Interests Section. There is 
not a single Cuban citizen inside the building. No one was 
either injured or wounded. With the dispelling of the rumor, 
everything returned to normal. 
  However, this type of incident or irresponsibility can 
provoke more serious consequences, all the responsibility for 
which will fall upon the promoters. This incident will serve as 
a lesson to the unscrupulous perpetrators of this ordeal. No one 
will ever step on the Revolution, because to step on the 
Revolution means to step on the courage and resolution of 
millions of Cubans who believe neither lies nor rumors when they 
must defend their country's integrity.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said today the government of President Fidel 
Castro will not make concessions to negotiate with the United 
States, and he accused the United States of not complying with 
the 1984 immigration agreements. 
  "Cuba is willing to talk with the United States but is not 
begging and will dialogue with the United States only on an 
equal footing," Robaina stated this Monday when he called Cuban 
emigrants who are living in the United States and other 
countries to a meeting to be held from 22 to 24 April. 
  The Havana conference, entitled "The Nation and Emigration," 
will attempt to regularize the ties between the Cuban community 
abroad and their relatives and local institutions. The 
organizations that are hostile to the Cuban Government have been 
excluded from this conference. 
  During a news conference, the foreign minister expressed 
regret that contacts to further immigration negotiations with 
Washington have not advanced much, and he said this situation 
"is not due to the Cuban position." 
  According to the Cuban foreign minister, the White House 
"systematically and repeatedly" breaks the immigration agreement 
signed 10 years ago, which mandates the United States will grant 
20,000 visas a year to Cubans who want to travel to that country. 
  An official Cuban memorandum yesterday accused U.S. special 
services and Miami exiles of spreading rumors that visas were 
being granted in order to trigger a massive entry of people to 
the U.S. Embassy in that capital city. 
  Special operations police and Defense of the Revolution 
Committee members cordoned off the diplomatic mission, and more 
than 80 people were arrested in several incidents, official 
sources have revealed. 
  Robaina clarified that the differences between Washington 
and 
Havana and the relations with the community of Cuban exiles "are 
two separate issues" and that they cannot wait to solve the 
first issue to start broaching the second problem. 
  The head of the Cuban foreign office urged the Washington 
government to understand that the Cuban immigrants in the United 
States include a much wider spectrum than the conservative 
National Cuban American Foundation, headed by Jorge Mas Canosa.

  [Text] Santa Elena, 14 Feb (AFP) -- Visibly exhausted by 
the Army's persecution and "sick and tired of war," Nicaragua's 
main rebel group announced today that it is willing to begin 
disarmament talks immediately and without political conditions. 
  The leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front (FN 3-80) proposed a 
meeting to be held today, Monday, with a peace commission that 
would be made up of representatives of the church and the 
International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS. 
Recontra leader Elvin Talavera, alias "Chacalin," told the press 
that the rebels had accepted a peace proposal by the church and 
writer Pantonio Cuadra and that they are willing to negotiate on 
the basis of that document. 
  The plan, disclosed more than a week ago, suggests the 
demobilization of the so-called "recontras" but does not mention 
any of the political demands the recontras have made since they 
took up their weapons against the government. 
  The unconventional forces are respecting the cease-fire they 
unilaterally declared 10 days ago, even though on Friday a group 
killed two soldiers and injured three others when they ambushed 
a military vehicle in Buena Vista, 8 km from a big military 
base. The Army has also refrained from conducting military 
operations in the northern area of the country and has announced 
that they do not wish to hinder the efforts being made toward 
disarmament. Therefore, they will not take reprisals for the 
attack. 
  Chacalin, whom the Army reported as having been killed a 
week 
ago, said that the group is willing to talk but that the 
presence of the soldiers in that area "could hinder" the process. 
  To date, the recontras have not mentioned any political 
demands in exchange for disarming and have only asked that their 
safety be ensured. A few months ago, the rebels demanded the 
resignation of President Violeta Chamorro and Presidency 
Minister Antonio Lacayo and the removal Humberto Ortega, 
commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army. 
  Regarding their former demands, Chacalin said that "we are 
thinking about the upcoming elections (in 1996); we must head 
for a civic struggle." Chacalin hinted that there is a 
possibility that the group will join the recently formed 
Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN). The PRN is formed by former 
contras who, several years ago, chose the civic way of struggle. 
  Another FN 3-80 leader known by his alias, "Martin Negro," 
told AFP that they will ask the government to establish new 
safety zones to which the Army will not have access. If the 
government agrees to these demands, "the meetings will continue" 
to discuss other points in the proposal that includes the 
creation of another peace commission, Martin Negro said.

  [Text] The Paraguayan Government will refute a U.S. 
Government report on the human rights situation in our country. 
The national government is apparently drafting a document in 
which President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's administration will state 
its viewpoint and refute information it deems incorrect. The 
government thus inaugurates a new stage in Paraguayan foreign 
relations, abandoning its passive posture and acting more 
independently before other countries. Proof of this is the 
stance regarding the U.S. Government's request to send troops to 
our country to build six schools and eight water wells in San 
Pedro Department without the participation of the Paraguayan 
Army. 
  Before accepting this "social aid", the government sent the 
U.S. Embassy a lengthy note requesting more details about the 
mission and the funds that each party will have to invest in the 
joint exercise, and proposing the participation of the 
Paraguayan Armed Forces. 
  The Paraguayan Foreign Ministry note to the U.S. Government 
conditions the development of the operation to the participation 
of Paraguayan sappers, a detailed list of the tasks the U.S. 
troops will carry out, and an account of what the operation will 
cost each country, among other requirements. 
  The U.S. State Department has issued a report on the 
situation of human rights in Paraguay that was released by the 
U.S. Embassy in Asuncion. 
  Contradictory reactions -- for and against -- to the 
negative 
aspects of the report flew as soon as it was disclosed. 
  U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman was summoned by Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, who informed the 
ambassador of the government's unrest over the U.S. State 
Department report. He was told that the Paraguayan Government 
would rectify and clarify some points of the report. 
  That same day German Ambassador Joachin Kausch was also 
summoned by Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner to explain his 
statement to the media regarding the absence of Paraguayan 
guarantees for foreign investors. 
  After a long interview, the German ambassador said the media 
had misinterpreted what he had said, that he never described 
Paraguay as an unsafe country for foreign investments. 
  Asked about a lack of guarantees for investors, President 
Wasmosy said that there seems to be an orchestrated campaign to 
distort the country's image abroad, although he did not say who 
is responsible.

<F P=106> [Article by Senator Dirceu Carneiro, Brazilian Social </F>
Democracy Party-Santa Catarina State, coordinator of the nuclear 
safeguards bill and second vice president of the Budget 
Committee] 
  [Text] The Executive Branch's position regarding nuclear 
safeguards has been causing controversy in the national media, 
which has been unable, so far, to supply society with useful and 
clarifying information on the issue. The nuclear safeguards are 
being examined by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, but it 
is a complex matter and demands that the Foreign Ministry hold 
exhaustive negotiations at the international level. 
  The consequences of signing this sort of treaty are, 
theoretically, permanent in the history of a country. Before 
signing it, therefore, society must meditate and debate the 
issue and the government must disseminate information on it. In 
such cases, the Legislative Branch digests all the information 
and assigns to it the period of political and social time 
required to allow all areas of society to give their opinion on 
the issue. It is legitimate that the Legislative Branch does so: 
It is its right and duty. 
  Brazil did not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(TNP), and will not do it in the future either, considering it 
discriminatory and unfair. The Brazilian Constitution, however, 
forbids the construction of atomic bombs, and I believe Brazil 
is the only country to have done so. Nonetheless, the 
international community conveniently included Brazil in the 
group of countries that did not sign the TNP because they do not 
have the bomb, side by side with India, Pakistan, and Israel. It 
thus punished the country and made it difficult for us to have 
access to sensitive technologies. 
  To overcome this discrimination, Brazil and Argentina 
created 
the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control 
(ABACC), which is a regional agency similar to the EC's Euraton. 
The establishment of ABACC and the signature of the 
Quadripartite Accord by Brazil, Argentina, ABACC, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reduced foreign 
pressure on Brazil and allowed it to join the international 
community. 
  To comply with these agreements, we must offer guarantees to 
the safeguards but we also can prevent foreign organizations, 
which comprise more than 85 countries and have differing 
interests, from using the "special surveys" argument and harming 
our country. These agreements may be used as tools to exert 
political pressure over matters absolutely unrelated to nuclear 
energy. This is what we want to prevent by better analyzing the 
text of the safeguards agreement. 
  So far, we have corrected certain vague parts of the text of 
the Supplement Adjustments to the Quadripartite Accord on 
control of nuclear energy use. All the Senate has to do now is 
approve the agreement, and it probably will do it without 
difficulties. 
  Anyway, the world already expected Brazil to adopt the 
safeguards. This is why I deem absurd the news reported by the 
press, which I believe to be fake news proposed by a lobby 
[preceding word in English], that Germany plans to break the 
nuclear agreement signed with Brazil and oppose our 
participation in the UN Security Council, unless we approve the 
Quadripartite Accord and the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
  Our agreement with the Germans, which is independent, 
already contemplates safeguards with Germany. The Germans have 
no relation whatsoever with the Tlatelolco Treaty, which is a 
regional agreement. The Quadripartite Accord, however, is a 
claim by the entire developed world that, through the news of an 
alleged threat by the Germans, seems to be interested in 
exerting pressure on Brazil to transform it into a captive 
market. 
  Nowadays, there is a basic problem that must be solved 
before 
the safeguards are voted on. Otherwise, we may take from Brazil 
its right to sovereignty. We must eliminate an amendment to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty that forbids the construction and use of 
atomic weapons in Latin America because it clashes with one of 
the objectives Brazil sought to maintain in the text of the 
Quadripartite Accord, i.e., the prohibition on conducting 
special surveys based on charges made in the national territory. 
The amendment that must be eliminated allows this sort of survey. 
  Through this amendment, the IAEA experts could come to 
Brazil 
to survey any facility, reported or not to IAEA, and take 
possession of industrial information that could be used to stop 
our development. Learning about progress in a specific research 
project, the developed countries could harm Brazil by failing to 
transfer technology to us that would allow us to advance in that 
research and begin manufacturing the same products they do. As a 
result of commercial interests and other sorts of interests, 
these countries would struggle to maintain international 
preservation of their products. 
  These concerns, which are known to all Brazilians, have been 
guiding the Brazilian Foreign Affairs Committee's analysis of 
the issue. 
  The first positive result of this position was Brazil's 
obtaining the approval of the Supplemental Adjustments even 
before ratification of the quadripartite agreement. This gave 
acknowledged, obvious benefits to Brazil. 
  Other results were the formal statements by the IAEA and the 
Organization to Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL), 
confirming that the supplemental adjustments of the 
quadripartite agreement apply to the Tlatelolco Treaty. The text 
of the Tlatelolco Treaty, unlike that of the quadripartite 
agreement, permits inspections in any country under suspicion. 
After the Persian Gulf war, this instrument became a dangerous 
tool used by the IAEA, especially for inspections prompted by 
the pressing of charges, a method that is unacceptable to Brazil. 
  The responsibility of Congress is to obtain the best for 
Brazil. Despite the desires of some government officials, who 
are efficiently lobbying through the press, we will not 
deliberate before the matter is fully clarified. Ratifying the 
treaty -- which has already been signed -- one week earlier or 
one week later will make no difference. Consequently, the 
Brazilian position has been clearly outlined to the 
international community; it is a fact. Within this context, 
ratifying and adjusting are mere details.

  [Excerpts] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori, who arrived in Colombia today, 
denied having conducted any negotiations whatsoever with the 
Shining Path, and he reiterated he will continue to implement 
harsh measures against that organization. 
  "We have made no contact with the terrorist leaders who are 
free," Fujimori said, denying Lima newspaper reports stating the 
government and Shining Path are holding meetings aimed at 
initiating a dialogue. 
  During a news conference, the Peruvian president added: "We 
have established contact via our intelligence services to 
capture their leaders but not to establish communication, let 
alone establish talks." 
  "The policy of my government is to capture the terrorists or 
confront and annihilate them," said the Peruvian head of state. 
  Fujimori warned: "I will not allow terrorists to continue 
perpetrating so many murders, and that is why we have adopted 
adequate measures, some of them harsh but effective." 
  According to official figures, the Maoist organization has 
caused the death of 25,000 Peruvians. [passage omitted] 
  President Fujimori reiterated his support for the candidacy 
of his host to the post of OAS secretary general. [passage

  [Text] Quito, 12 Feb (AFP) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen today defended the legality of the recent 
71.2-percent increase in the price of gasoline, which yesterday 
the Court of Constitutional Guarantees (TGC) declared 
unconstitutional. 
  The president questioned the legal status of the court's 
members as Samuel Belletini, the president of the National 
Congress, "swore in" Gonzalo Machado, the government 
representative at the TGC, as the court's chief justice. 
  In addition to declaring the price hike unconstitutional, 
the 
TGC ordered the suspension of all other effects of the 
presidential decree, stating that the increase "could be very 
detrimental to the country's future." 
  Duran-Ballen said that the previous Rodrigo Borja 
administration (1988-92) appointed Machado as a nonvoting member 
of the TGC and, as such, he cannot very well represent the 
current administration. He also questioned the authority of the 
other TGC members, whose terms were extended in light of 
differences prevailing in Congress regarding the appointment of 
new members. 
  Duran-Ballen said, "Belletini made an arbitrary decision by 
installing a presidential representative I did not appoint." He 
announced that Attorney General Carlos Larreategui [name and 
title as received] will appeal the decision before the 
Constitutionality Court of the Supreme Court of Justice. 
According to constitutional reforms approved in 1993, the 
Constitutionality Court can ratify or overturn TGC decisions, 
which were previously indisputable. The president recalled that 
the TGC itself previously had not accepted Machado because he 
did not meet the court's age requirements. 
  Of the 11 nonvoting TGC members, six met to discuss the 
issue 
and five voted in favor of the unconstitutionality of the 
decree. The order triggered demonstrations that are threatening 
to continue if the government upholds the validity of the price 
hike that has increased the cost of living for the Ecuadoran 
people. 
  According to recent reforms made to the laws governing 
hydrocarbons, the president has the authority to set the price 
of oil products in Ecuador, which was a member of OPEC up until 
last year. The oil industry produced 40 percent of the 
government's budget, and the drop in the price of oil on the 
international market created a controversial deficit. The 
government tried to cover the deficit by passing new tax laws, 
which the Congress rejected, and then decided to raise the price 
of gasoline. 
  Contrary to the trend in other countries, the Ecuadoran 
Government said if the price of crude goes up on the 
international market, the price of gasoline may go down.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Miro Quesada G.: "Cover-Up Also a Crime"] </F>
  [Text] A reading of the well-documented report written by 
Ernesto de la Jara Basombrio and published by IDEELE magazine, 
on events that began on the fateful morning of 18 July 1992, 
when nine students and a professor at La Cantuta University were 
kidnapped, and later murdered, cannot but leave the reader 
stricken as deeply by the savagery of the murders and treatment 
of the remains as by the significance of the ensuing acts of 
suppression, of dilatory judicial proceedings, of obstructive 
tactics, and finally, even of cover-up of such a despicable 
crime, at the military, judicial, and political levels. The 
following is based on information taken from the IDEELE article. 
  The events having taken place as they did, it was obvious, 
as 
the CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Committee's report 
later indicated, that the raid had been of a paramilitary 
nature. The university campus was guarded by the military and 
was under curfew at the time. And the raid itself--the type of 
weapons used, the silencers, the subordination of the military 
personnel stationed there, the secrecy of identities, the 
existence of a previously prepared list, etc.--all indicated 
this to be the case. Instead of launching an investigation, the 
military authorities limited themselves to denying the 
detentions. For months, while the victims' families fought to no 
avail in the courts--in a quest for justice, as we will see 
further on--the military command took no action in the matter 
until April 1993 when, as a result of an anonymous document 
received by Congressman Pease and read by him on the floor of 
the Congress, it agreed to appoint an investigating committee. 
  According to the anonymous document, Vladimiro Montesino is 
said to have coordinated the carrying out of the raid designated 
"Kidnap," with the participation of the chief of the 
Intelligence Directorate and the chief of the Special Forces 
Division, both of whom, in turn, allegedly coordinated the 
operation with the commanding officer of the siege of La 
Cantuta, and with the commanding officer of Headquarters 
Battalion 19. The document alleges that the Army Commander in 
Chief was informed, and that he ordered that no mistakes be 
made. "The document certainly did not constitute proof of 
anything, but it definitely pointed to allegations requiring 
investigation." In view of this, the Investigating Committee 
summoned General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza to testify on the 
subject. The high military official twice postponed his 
testimony, and during the intervening days, in consideration of 
two disclosures on his part, a judicial proceeding was 
instituted within the military jurisdiction, that thus far, nine 
months later, has served more to stifle justice than to shed 
light on the facts. 
  The chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declined to testify 
before the Committee because the case was before the Supreme 
Council of Military Justice and, according to this Council, "no 
authority may take over cases pending before the mentioned 
military jurisdictional body, nor interfere in the exercise of 
its functions." As is public knowledge, General Hermoza Rios 
stated that it was all a political maneuver by left-wing members 
of Congress to slander the Army. Then, in a move ostensibly 
aimed at intimidation, he ordered the tanks out into the 
streets, as high-ranking military officials read a supporting 
statement, characterizing Congress's action as "A base attempt 
to implicate the Peruvian Army in an alleged violation of human 
rights, maliciously using for that purpose spurious documents 
forged by a small group of opposition congressmen...." 
  Thus, naively or maliciously, an investigative proceeding 
was 
transformed into an incrimination of the Armed Forces; and a 
parliamentary investigation was thwarted. 
  On 29 April, General Robles, a political refugee in the 
United States Embassy, issued a public statement in which he 
indicated that the La Cantuta crime had been perpetrated by a 
special detail of the SIN [National Intelligence Service], in 
collaboration with the SIE [Army Intelligence Service], and with 
the Intelligence Directorate of the EMGE [Army General Staff]. 
General Robles detailed the names of officers and subordinates 
who had participated; and stated that the mentioned special 
detail operated under the orders of Vladimiro Montesino with the 
knowledge of the chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
  Serious though the accusation is, equally serious are the 
actions that have been taken to silence it. According to 
Robles's public statement, when he learned of these occurrences 
of utmost gravity, he requested a talk with General Jose Picon 
Alcalde, president of the Military Tribunal, informed him of 
what he had learned, and urged that the Tribunal proceed 
accordingly. The answer was: "Look, friend, the General 
Inspectorate of the Army has concluded that neither the Army nor 
any of its members had anything to do with this case.... 
Therefore, I am going to drag it out until the people forget 
about the matter." The allegation is a grave one indeed, 
implicating as it does the very president of the Military 
Tribunal, but a conversation between two persons is the word of 
one against that of the other. 
  What makes the account credible in this case is the fact 
that, the day after, Robles was summoned by General Hermoza 
Rios, to receive the Supreme Decision signed that day 
transferring him to the IADB [Inter-American Defense Board] to 
which post he was to travel most urgently. In this ugly story, 
which is seemingly on the verge of being substantiated, there 
is, concerning the La Cantuta affair, an accusation and an 
attempt at silencing. 
  With the discovery of the graves at Cieneguilla and 
Huachipa, 
the affair acquired so much notoriety that the chief of the 16th 
Provincial Office of the Public Prosecutor, Doctor Victor Cubas 
Villanueva, finally instituted proceedings against those whose 
names appear in the cited incriminatory documents, and, having 
requested arraignment of the detained officers, summoned them to 
appear in court. They have not appeared, in contempt of the 
writ, and the Supreme Council of Military Justice has instituted 
a conflict of jurisdiction proceeding, that if settled in its 
favor would make it very difficult, in view of the history of 
this case thus far, to arrive at a total clarification of the 
events, and full punishment of those responsible. 
  The intent to not investigate has been no less evident at 
the 
judicial level. The writ of Habeas Corpus filed by the president 
of La Cantuta University at the end of July, was declared 
contrary to law for lack of substantiating evidence. The Habeas 
Corpus filed by the mother of one of the victims, after being 
bounced back and forth, was declared contrary to law, with the 
incredible argument that "the material kidnapping of the 10 
persons was not proven." Finally, the 6th Criminal Branch of the 
Court confirmed the ruling denying the Habeas Corpus, with the 
equally incredible argument that "neither has the physical 
existence of the citizens been verified." 
  The Public Prosecutor's Office, because of the university 
president's report, knew of the case as of 1 August, but there 
as well, action to investigate and prefer charges was delayed. 
And in the end, that office instituted no proceedings whatever, 
opting for disqualifying itself and forwarding the matter to the 
Superior Council of Military Justice, notwithstanding the 
existence of a record that the 8th District Public Prosecutor's 
Office had reported to the nation's Attorney General that it was 
clear that the high command of the Peruvian Army "are 
concealing" the said information. 
  And procrastinations and postponements continue. Instead of 
ruling on the question of the courts' jurisdictions submitted to 
him by Judge Flores Chacon, Public Prosecutor Cubas Villanueva 
is contending that he cannot rule until the question of that 
judge's recusation is resolved; as if judicial rulings on the 
jurisdictions of the courts depended upon this or that person. 
  At the political level, in government circles, the same line 
of conduct has been followed for many months: that of acting not 
to clarify the facts, but on the contrary to impede their 
clarification. The best proof of this is that, in the face of 
determined pressure by the CCD's Investigating Committee to 
obtain the testimony of the implicated military personnel, the 
CCD opted to approve, by majority vote, the opposing motion, 
which provided that the military personnel summoned by the 
Committee not be present in person, but be represented by their 
chiefs. 
  Clumsily wrought, this device implemented a policy if not of 
cover-up, certainly one of not uncovering the truth. Statements 
by the ministers of state and by the president himself have been 
purely rhetorical, platitudinous utterances of principle but, de 
facto, neither reproving nor intending to correct such an 
obvious process of cover-up. A process reaching such extremes as 
the contention by Congressmen Sigra and Freundt, in their 
minority report as members of the Investigating Committee, that: 
"Voluntary disappearance is probable, considering that, from the 
information at the disposal of the Committee, it is clear that 
there are many cases of persons reported as disappeared who, 
later, have been located in other places, to which they have 
moved so as not to be identified, and thus engage in terrorist 
activities." The remains at Cieneguilla and Huachipa are 
accusatory attestations to the contrary.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Recent Mexican press coverage of the 
rebellion in Chiapas, which includes commentaries and reports of 
official and local views, touches on a broad range of topics, 
including the rebellion's ideological and organizational 
origins, political and economic factors promoting it, guerrilla 
methods of operation, viability of the movement, and the 
national political ramifications of the uprising. 
<H5>  Paz Stresses Particularity </H5>
  Poet and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz characterizes the revolt 
as a manifestation of problems peculiar to Chiapas, rendering it 
unlikely to spread to other states. In his view, the Chiapas 
rebellion bears traits more akin to Guatemala and El Salvador 
than to other parts of Mexico. Paz observes that the guerrillas' 
statements reflect a mix of elements: Maoism, liberation 
theology, and ideas borrowed from Peru's Shining Path, and 
Central American revolutionary movements, "in sum, the remains 
of the great shipwreck of 20th-century revolutionary 
ideologies." He pronounces the uprising "unreal and...doomed to 
failure...[and out of touch] with our country's situation and 
its needs and current aspirations." He adds that "the Indian 
communities have been deceived by a group of irresponsible 
demagogues, and these are the ones who should be held 
accountable before the law and the nation." He retreats somewhat 
in his conclusion, however, saying that the leaders of the 
rebellion "are not the only ones responsible. A big share of the 
blame--perhaps the biggest, in historical and moral terms--rests 
with the well-off classes in Chiapas and many state politicians. 
What has happened should serve notice that if there is any place 
in Mexico where social, political, economic, and moral reform is 
necessary, that place is Chiapas." (Mexico City LA JORNADA 5 Jan 
94) 
<H5>  Modernization Need Seen </H5>
  Historian, novelist, and editor of the Mexico City monthly 
NEXOS Hector Aguilar Camin similarly criticizes the intellectual 
underpinnings of the revolt as remnants of Cold War leftist 
thinking, attributing special responsibility to church base 
communities and "groups of religious" inspired by liberation 
theology and the Catholic Church's "option for the poor." He 
declares "the Catholic Church as a whole and the Church in 
Chiapas in particular have some explaining to do to Mexican 
society about its radicalized wing, which appears to be the 
central actor in the makeup of the conflagration in Chiapas." 
Aguilar Camin concludes that "the explosion in Chiapas appears 
more like the last chapter of the now past Central American wars 
than the first chapter of any future violent instability in 
Mexico," adding that the rebellion's "cathartic eruption does 
not deny, but rather confirms, the process of 
internationalization in the country: the end of its proud 
insularity; the permeability of all its borders to the fair and 
ill winds of the world. And rather than refute, the rebellion 
ratifies the urgency of the modernization already undertaken, 
bringing to the fore the essential modernizations of the 
future," which he identifies as (1) a "political agreement that 
completes the pending democratic transition and sets aside 
violence as an alternative for public action," and (2) an 
"awareness that galvanizes the national will once and for all to 
confront the evils of poverty as the leading challenge and 
inescapable condition for the modernity that Mexicans neither 
can nor should abandon." (Mexico City PROCESO 10 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Chiapas Official Assessment </H5>
  A Chiapas State document, identified by LA JORNADA as a 
confidential report to high levels of government in Mexico City, 
voices state government concerns over possible future violence 
in 42 "high risk" municipalities, as occurred in Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal de las Casas. The 
list includes: Yajalon, Chilon, Tila, Tumbala, Citala, 
Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, Palenque, Nicolas Ruiz, Chiapilla, San 
Lucas, Venustiano Carranza, Villa de las Rosas, Socoltenango, 
Teopizca, Simojovel, El Bosque, Huitiuipan, Pueblo Nuevo, 
Bochil, Jitotol, Pantepec, Tapalapea, Rayon, Tapilula, Ocotopec, 
Coapilla, Tecpatan, Copainala, Francisco Leon, Chenhalon, 
Larrainzer, Chalchihuetan, Pantelho, Sinacatan, Tenejapa, 
Chamula, Chanal, Huixtan, Oxchuc, Angel Albino Corzo, and La 
Concordia. 
  The 16-page document, titled "Political Diagnosis of the 
Conflict Zone," also names 13 areas in various other 
municipalities requiring what LA JORNADA calls "special 
surveillance": In Cacahuatan, the municipality's main town of 
Agustin Iturbide and Salvador Urbina; in Union Juarez, the Santo 
Domingo ejido and Once de Abril; in Tapachula, the ejidos of 
Manacal, Chespal, Mexiquito, Toquiancito and Toquian; in 
Motozintla, the ejidos of Belisario Dominguez and Male Cuaresma; 
in Amatenango de la Frontera, Pajayal ejido; and in Ciltepec, 
the municipality's main town. 
  According to the LA JORNADA account, the document devotes 
considerable attention to the economic and political problems it 
sees as the root of the conflict. It notes that the 
"considerable investments" made by the federal government have 
been "insufficient in comparison with the needs of the region" 
and notes that rural residents have been hurt by tight credit 
that has affected coffee, corn, and cattle operations; 
inadequate supply and marketing systems; the burden of past due 
loans; and a government decree "that makes the region an 
ecological reserve and blocks cattle and forestry operations 
without offering alternative means to survival." The document 
identifies other serious problems as the drop in coffee and 
cattle prices, the presence in the state of large numbers of 
Guatemalan refugees and workers, a high rate of alcoholism, the 
activities of middlemen, drug trafficking, and racial 
discrimination. Also seen as contributing to the unrest is the 
"activism...of social organizations and the religious activism" 
of priests, deacons, catechists, and, particularly, the bishop 
of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz. 
  The document urges the cancellation of past due debts 
accumulated by impoverished coffee growers and cattle ranchers, 
and a change in the government's attitude toward peasants to 
demonstrate, in LA JORNADA's words, "a treatment respectful of 
their dignity as humans, taking care that individuals assigned 
to the region are socially committed, with special attention 
being given to securing and administering justice." It further 
recommends establishing a single, microregional governmental 
point of contact in each municipality, as well as the creation 
of additional municipalities out of what are now the 
municipalities of Ocosingo and Las Margaritas. The document also 
recommends a policy of cooperation with the churches, 
particularly the Catholic Church. 
  LA JORNADA notes in passing that the document reports the 
area affected by the rebellion as inhabited not only by 
Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Chol Indians, but also "mestizos from 
Michoacan, Guerrero, Puebla, and Oaxaca." (LA JORNADA 9 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Indian Support Cited </H5>
  In two interviews, Carlos Montemayor, author of the novel 
"Guerra en el Paraiso" ("War in Paradise," set during the 
insurgency in Guerrero in the 1960's and 1970's) and specialist 
in guerrilla affairs, characterizes the rebellion as the "tip of 
the iceberg" of discontent, asserting that it is supported by a 
vast network that has discreetly supplied food, money, 
information, and protection to the guerrillas through a complex 
Indian social and familial organization. He asserts that "Indian 
family structure is at once very simple and very complex. 
Deep-running communication, social organization, and economic 
networks run up and down the mountains, rivers, and forests of 
Mexico's various regions. It is very hard for groups, movements, 
or individuals from outside the area to pass unnoticed. My 
experience has been that whether one is talking about rural, 
mestizo, or creole areas, the mountains and forests have more 
eyes than the cities. It is impossible not only for vehicles but 
even for individuals to move about undetected." 
  Montemayor appeals to federal and state governments to enter 
into negotiations with the Indian communities in which for the 
first time concessions would be made not only by the authorities 
but also by Chiapas's large land, cattle, and timber interests, 
and the rights of the Indian communities would be protected. He 
then cautions that these negotiations will be fruitless "if 
there is no will among Chiapas's creoles and mestizos, 
landholders and politicians to stop thinking like 17th-century 
encomenderos [Spanish royal Indian labor grantees] and if the 
government and the army do not refrain from seeing these 
negotiations as a defeat rather than a social victory in the 
very evolution of the country." Montemayor warns against seeking 
a strictly military solution to the rebellion; such movements, 
bred over a long period, are "very resistant" to suppression, 
and seeking only a military solution "could lead us to a Central 
Americanization" of the situation. (LA JORNADA 4 Jan 94, PROCESO 
10 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Antecedents Reviewed </H5>
  In a wide-ranging review of the rebellion's antecedents, 
Luis 
Hernandez Navarro, an adviser to the National Coordinating Board 
of Coffee Grower Organizations, asserts in the 9 January LA 
JORNADA that while colonization of the Lacandon Forest region 
was begun by lumber companies, area settlement received a major 
impetus in the 1940's from the many migrants who arrived there 
after unsuccessful efforts elsewhere in the country to secure a 
piece of land through the nation's agrarian reform program. 
  Discussing the role of the Church, he adds that, as part of 
the "enterprise of building communities and lives where there 
had been none before," the settlers came to rely upon the 
presence and sympathy of the Catholic Church, while at the same 
time there was a "notable absence of government institutions," 
making "religion" one of the "key foundations upon which the new 
communities were built." According to Hernandez Navarro, 
catechists not only provided religious instruction but also 
became key elements in linking communities with the outside 
world. Educated and mobile, many of them having a mastery of 
Spanish, they unquestionably became the "organic intellectuals" 
of their congregations. 
  Observing how the struggle for regularization of land claims 
and the delivery of government services also marked the area's 
development, Hernandez Navarro points out that a division of 
opinion arose as how best to seek improvements: "democratic 
organizations" sought to promote "peasant self-development"; 
others felt that only systemic change brought about through 
armed force could solve the problem. He says groups like the 
Rural Associations of Collective Interest-Union of Unions are an 
example of the first approach, and that what is today known as 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) is an expression of 
the second. Hernandez Navarro writes that the main arena of 
activity for years was occupied by the self-development groups, 
despite resistance from state governments; but some three years 
ago this approach began gradually to lose influence among the 
region's inhabitants, owing to years of conflict with 
landholders and their "white guards," who monopolized state 
government institutions and resources and blocked the flow of 
resources (itself inadequate) the federal government sought to 
channel into Indian communities through its programs. 
Elaborating on the federal programs, he claims that for "many of 
those initiatives it had been intended to use the local elites 
as promoters of modernization; and on top of this, the ongoing 
dismantling of government institutions that was part of the 
reform of the state has created a vacuum which has been only 
partially filled by democratic organizations." (With respect to 
one such program, the National Solidarity Program, Pronasol, 
journalist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa notes in a 9 January 
Monterrey EL NORTE commentary the Pronasol claim that prior to 
1993 its funding for Chiapas was obliged to submit to 
traditional, inefficient state government controls under then 
Governor Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido.) 
  These problems were compounded by a drop in earnings from 
the 
state's key products, writes Hernandez Navarro. Timber, 
protected since 1989 by conservation regulations, ceased to be a 
source of income. Coffee growers were hurt not only by the fall 
in international coffee prices from $120/140 per 100 pounds to 
$60/70, but also by the disappearance of government marketing 
and technical assistance. A decline in corn productivity 
resulted from population pressures and a contraction of the 
slash-and-burn cycle from 30 years to only two years. Also cited 
is the declining profitability of the cattle industry. 
<H5>  Catechists' Role Noted </H5>
  A Tzotzil Indian interviewed in Huixtan (Chiapas) by LA 
JORNADA, who asked to have his identity withheld, addressed the 
role of catechists in the rebellion. Without identifying them, 
the Indian says that catechists who had taught him 20 years 
earlier were the ones who "tried to convince us to join the 
guerrillas" the morning of 1 January, when 300 EZLN members 
occupied the town's main square. He identifies the catechists 
turned guerrillas as current residents of the town who had once 
held "positions of authority" in the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI). He also says that most of the rebel 
force, consisting of both men and women, ranges between the ages 
of 16 and 20, and that in talking with the guerrillas he learned 
that they communicate with each other by using skyrockets and 
red lanterns. (LA JORNADA 7 and 8 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Political Aspects Emphasized </H5>
  While maintaining that economic injustice played a crucial 
part in fomenting the rebellion, four prominent commentators 
emphatically stress in separate commentaries that inadequate 
political reform was an equally important factor, one that, if 
neglected, threatens unrest during the August presidential 
elections. 
  Linking Chiapan developments with the prospects for societal 
peace nationally, PRI member of the Federal District Assembly of 
Representatives and political reform advocate Demetrio Sodi de 
la Tijera writes that the rebellion "is not just about changing 
social conditions, nor is it a problem of resources or 
solidarity." He argues that it is "basically a rebellion over 
political conditions, government corruption, electoral fraud, 
and the imposition of officials from above, a response to 
plotting by officials and caciques, injustices, lawbreaking, and 
repression that Indian communities suffer every day, and 
infringements of the law that occur in many parts of the country 
and that affect the majority of Mexicans." In the aftermath of 
the rebellion, "the danger of social explosions occurring in 
other parts of the country and becoming generalized" has "risen 
immensely," especially if the upcoming election's results are 
"unacceptable" to "political forces" in the country. (LA JORNADA 
7 Jan 94) 
  Drawing heavily on Thomas Benjamin's 1989 historical study 
"A 
Rich Land, A Poor People: Politics and Society in Modern 
Chiapas" to document his case that unjust social and economic 
structures dominate Chiapas, Colegio de Mexico international 
relations specialist Lorenzo Meyer argues that "the challenge 
facing Mexico as a whole and her political class in particular 
is deeper and more serious than that which brought the 
government to negotiate the free trade agreement with the United 
States." What is involved, he said, is "negotiating, under 
difficult circumstances, a new political pact between those who 
govern and a majority of the governed" that recognizes "their 
status as citizens and redistributes in a less unjust manner the 
burden of economic development, without any of the irresponsible 
acts, chicanery, corruption, and shams that have made the 
Mexican political class world famous (`the perfect 
dictatorship')." (Mexico City EXCELSIOR 6 Jan 94) 
  National Autonomous University of Mexico political scientist 
Jorge Castaneda similarly criticizes the political as well as 
economic roots of the rebellion during an interview and then 
asserts that "the problems of poverty are not resolved with 
money alone, because the problem is not one of expenditures but 
rather one of structures, of organization, for [Indians] to 
participate in decisions concerning their communities, jobs, 
decent treatment by officials, the return of lands, etc." On 
account of this, Castaneda sees the political system facing a 
dilemma, a "political crisis," because to carry out the needed 
reform, the government will have to weaken the powerful economic 
and social interests upon which the system is built and which 
remain outside the control of elected officials. For him, the 
rebellion signals that citizens have reached their "limit," and 
that if there is a failure to achieve an "electoral process that 
is clean and acceptable to everyone, there is a danger of 
violence." (PROCESO 10 Jan 94) 
  In a Spanish-language version of his NEW YORK TIMES 
Syndicate 
column carried by LA JORNADA, novelist Carlos Fuentes stresses 
the importance of democratic political reform as a prerequisite 
for a successful and just economic reform undertaken by the 
government. He emphasizes that propagation of democracy must 
start at the most elemental level, "in the smallest villages, 
where the inhabitants know each other and know how to choose the 
best persons. All democracy starts by being local.... On the 
other hand, the central authorities almost always impose the 
worst officials [upon communities].... Only they are able to 
work with the Chiapan oligarchy." In his view, the "Mexican 
political and economic system, antidemocratic and unjust, shares 
responsibility for the explosion in Chiapas." Fuentes sees 
achievement of parallel political and economic reforms in 
Chiapas as a necessary first step in the genuine "economic, 
political, and cultural transformation" of the country. (LA 
JORNADA 7 Jan 94)

  [Text] Argentina supports "the firmness of international 
reaction against attacks on Sarajevo inhabitants," and places 
itself at the disposal of the United Nations to perform 
humanitarian tasks. 
  This means that our country will support the UN position 
whether it is decided they will use planes to defend the Bosnian 
areas under attack or conduct military operations against the 
attackers. 
  The Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that Emilio 
Cardenas, 
Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, said so to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali during a long meeting they 
held on 8 February. 
  Following clear instructions given by Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella, who is visiting three Caribbean countries, Cardenas 
told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that President Menem's administration 
will support the UN decision on air operations. 
  It has not been reported, however, whether Argentina merely 
supports the operations or also will participate in them. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella explained to LA 
NACION in New York: "It must be made very clear that Argentina 
does not approve measures of force; all it did was offer full 
support to whatever the secretary general may decide." 
  Cardenas told Butrus-Butrus Ghali that Argentina strongly 
rejects attacks against Sarajevo's civilians. He insisted on 
"the need to consider the possibility of using security troops" 
from the United Nations who currently are controlling the region 
and include Argentine units.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Vega] </F>
  [Text] Amid almost total secrecy, General Martin Balza -- 
the Army Chief of Staff -- on 7 February invited the commanders 
that participated in the Malvinas War to visit him in his office 
in Libertador Building. 
  The objective was to obtain precise information as to how 
the 
chart mapping the minefield planted during the war had been 
handed over to the British. 
  According to reliable Army sources, Balza's decision follows 
the publishing of an article in the British newspaper THE 
ECONOMIST which indicated that the Argentine generals refused to 
give the information to President Carlos Menem. 
  General Mario Benjamin Menendez, the governor of the islands 
at that time; General Oscar Jofre; and Colonel Manuel Dorrego, 
all of whom are retired, participated in the highly confidential 
meeting. 
  It was learned that Dorrego told Balza that he -- as the 
most 
senior officer of the Army Engineer Corps and on Menendez' 
orders -- had handed the chart to Major Thompson, and engineer 
officer of the British Army. 
  Dorrego added that one week later, while detained in San 
Carlos, several British officers asked him if he could redraw 
the chart because they said Thompson had lost the original. 
  Army sources confirm that the incident was reported to the 
Fourth Commission, which preceded the UN General Assembly. On 
that occasion, Argentine delegates, diplomats, and military men 
slapped the British representative with responsibility for the 
matter. The British delegates did not deny it. 
  Asked by LA NACION on 8 February, Balza admitted that the 
meeting had been held. He said: "Between 19,000 and 20,000 
antitank and antipersonnel mines were planted on the Malvinas, 
in addition to those planted by the British." He added that 
reports of allegedly concealing the information "are completely 
untrue and despicable. The honor of Argentine generals and the 
subordination of the Army to the constitutional power cannot be 
questioned." 
  Balzo said: "The details have for some time been in the 
hands 
of the Foreign and Defense Ministries." He admitted that the 
Argentine officers did not retain a copy of the report, and that 
a receipt for the file does not exist. "The circumstances did 
not permit asking for a receipt," he said. 
  Dorrego confirmed for LA NACION that on 15 June 1982, one 
day 
after the end of hostilities, he gave Thompson the information 
on the rows of mines, because no complete minefields were ever 
planted. He said he handed over the information at the request 
of Menendez in accordance with the Geneva Convention. 
  He explained: "It was a brief meeting that took place at 
about 1900 in the building occupied by the British staff in 
Puerto Argentino. I gave him a pink file. Thompson asked me to 
sit down. He read the file, asked me if anything was missing, 
and then thanked me. One week later in San Carlos, a colonel 
asked me to whom I had given the file because they could not 
find it." 
  According to Dorrego, the file was complete and fully 
detailed, "because when we planted the mines we thought we were 
going to win the war, that we would have to clear the mines 
ourselves."

Article Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Against a backdrop of ongoing tripartite 
labor-management-government negotiations on labor reform, a 
"secret memo" on labor "flexibility," giving employers more 
freedom to determine work schedules and more control over hiring 
and firing, is reportedly being circulated among prominent 
leaders of industry and a handful of labor leaders. According to 
a report by Marcelo Bonelli in the column Business Panorama 
published in the 14 January Buenos Aires daily CLARIN, the 
points detailed in the memo are soon to be promoted by the Menem 
administration. 
  Bonelli notes that although many of these points "irritate" 
the unions, what really makes them "scream bloody murder" is the 
insistence throughout the memo that these changes could be 
agreed upon either through collective bargaining or through 
shop-level negotiations. This would, he explains, "categorically 
end the unions' hegemonic control over labor negotiations." 
  The unions are questioning whether yielding on these "labor 
conquests" would actually increase employment as promised by the 
government, writes Bonelli. He adds that labor leaders plan to 
offer the government a counterproposal, which would move toward 
a pact not restricted solely to labor issues. "Large businesses 
are waiting for (labor) flexibility in order to lay off 
personnel, not to create more jobs," asserts Peronist economist 
Eduardo Curia, advisor to labor leaders Armando Cavalieri of the 
Commercial Workers Union and Health Workers leader Carlos West 
Ocampo. According to West Ocampo, the unions are willing to 
discuss labor "flexibility," but only in exchange for guarantees 
of more jobs and other cost-cutting measures. 
  Some of the 18 points detailed in the memo are as follows: 

  -  Shift changes, determined by either labor unions or 
employers, would be set for periods no longer than one year. 
  -  The 
average eight-hour workday could be "extended to 12 hours," 
depending upon the needs of each employer. Employees would not 
be paid overtime, but would be given compensatory time during 
periods of slack production. 
  -  Weekly time off could be 
"postponed" for as long as one month. 
  -  The existing vacation 
system--specifically regulations on qualifying requirements, 
restrictions on timing and duration, advance notice to 
employers, and remuneration for time off--could be changed in 
any way. 
  -  A special set of rules governing temporary employment 
would "totally deregulate" current labor relations and be used 
by employers in hiring. 
  -  This special system would be applied for 
a period of six months, but could be renewed every six 
months. 
  -  Employers would benefit from a 50-percent exemption from 
labor taxes for temporary workers and from the elimination of 
severance pay.

  [Text] The Cuban Government has lied: former Brazilian 
President Fernando Collor, wife Rosane and their friends Luis 
Carlos Chaves and Eunicia Guimaraes stayed at Fidel Castro's 
guest house in Varadero, a sea resort. 
  For three days Cuban officials extended VIP treatment to 
Collor and his entourage despite the vehement denials of the 
Cuban Government. 
  Collor tried to see Fidel Castro but failed. The Cuban 
president chose to avoid him after receiving a number of 
telegrams of protest from the Workers Party and other Brazilian 
leftwing parties. 
  The former president stayed at a modest guest house located 
a 
few meters from the posh mansion which Al Capone, the gangster, 
used in the thirties. 
  Francisco Marchante, a bodyguard whom the Cuban Government 
had reportedly assigned to the former Brazilian president, 
accompanied Collor wherever he went in Cuba. 
  This episode undermined Fidel's credibility; the nickname 
Red 
Pinocchio suits him just fine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso </F>
by Nelia Marquez in Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Text] [Marquez] Although Provisional Measures 404 and 407 
-- which are important for the stabilization plan -- were not 
approved, will it be possible to create the URV [Real Value 
Unit] after Carnival, as you announced? 
  [Cardoso] I have always said that creation of the URV will 
be 
possible only if the fiscal adjustment is guaranteed. If the 
adjustment is not approved, the URV will be delayed. 
  [Marquez] Following the implementation of the URV, when will 
a new currency be created? 
  [Cardoso] It is impossible to set deadlines. If we set a 
date, we run the risk of a repeat of what occurred last December 
when entrepreneurs adjusted prices either in self defense or to 
attack the economic plan. Support for the URV must be 
voluntary, precisely to avoid that type of problem. 
  [Marquez] Do you not consider it very unfair on workers to 
convert salaries into URV's by an average value, while prices -- 
especially utility rates -- will be converted by the value in 
force on the date of conversion? 
  [Cardoso] Nothing has been decided yet. We have said that 
there will be a negotiation process. Stories about conversion 
by the average or by the top value presupposes there will be a 
freeze and that no more fluctuations will follow. As we are not 
planning to implement a freeze, how can I know if conversion 
will be by the average or by the top value? Converting prices 
by the top value and salaries by the average value is 
unacceptable. The rules have not yet been established. We will 
never adopt two different measuring units, one for prices and 
another one for salaries. Either Economic Policy Secretary 
Winston Fristch was misinterpreted or he inferred more than what 
he actually wanted to say. 
  [Marquez] Utility rates are quite high, while salaries, 
which 
are based on the current salary policy, are rather low. 
  [Cardoso] A plan to fight inflation does not seek either the 
redistribution or the contraction of income. Our entire effort 
concentrates on preventing a socially unfair mechanism. The 
important factor is to compare the URV's starting point with 
what is happening now, which is a steady deterioration of 
salaries. This has happened independently of the law, because 
no law can protect salaries from inflation. We are studying 
ways to update salaries, which will provide stronger protection. 
I am not saying salaried people's living conditions will 
improve right from the start. I am saying that from the very 
beginning, losses will be smaller. 
  [Marquez] So it will not be like the Cruzado Plan, under 
which salaries received a productivity adjustment at the moment 
of the conversion, right? 
  [Cardoso] One of the problems of the Cruzado Plan was a 
mistake at the start, when there was excessive demand without 
sufficient supply. This happened because of an increase, in 
real terms, of salaries, which ended up producing a loss. It is 
wrong to imagine that through a law or a provisional measure the 
government will set salaries according to the mid-URV and prices 
according to the top URV value. That would be absurd. 
  [Marquez] Labor unions have announced that they will strike 
if salaries are adjusted by average values and prices are 
adjusted by top values. 
  [Cardoso] I repeat: There is no definite rule yet. They 
should strike against businessmen who increase prices and not 
against the government. 
  [Marquez] Labor Minister Barelli has been defending the idea 
that when salaries are converted into URV the previous year's 
productivity be taken into consideration. The productivity of 
Sao Paulo industries, for example, was 18 percent. Will that 
also be taken into account? 
  [Cardoso] This must be discussed by the labor unions. We 
want the negotiation to be based on the collective bargaining 
contracts. We do not plan to introduce this element in the URV. 
  [Marquez] So, there will be no rule for salary conversion? 
  [Cardoso] As far as I am concerned there is no need for a 
salary conversion rule, especially this sort of rule. 
  [Marquez] One of Fritsch's concerns is that salary 
conversion 
has to be very carefully done to avoid creating financial 
cushions [gorduras] in the costs of companies, which they then 
incorporate into their prices -- forcing them up. 
  [Cardoso] Salaries are only one component of a product's 
price. We realize that salaries are not being increased, but 
prices are. This concern would apply if our economy were stable, 
open, and had a well-defined cost structure. But we have an 
inflationary economy which is very confused and allows companies 
to increase prices without linking them to salary hikes. There 
is no definition yet. I refused so firmly to discuss the URV 
before the fiscal reform is approved that I am sure no one has 
been able to adopt this or that formula. Fritsch referred to 
theoretical considerations about relations that should exist 
between salaries and prices. This, however, is not related to 
the government's decision, let alone to a provisional measure 
that can be drafted by the government. 
  [Marquez] So, there is no provisional measure to establish 
the URV? 
  [Cardoso] There may be one later, but so far there is 
nothing 
definite. 
  [Marquez] Another one of Minister Barelli's proposals is 
that 
the government consider a long period, two years, to figure out 
the price average to be used for the conversion. Is this 
feasible? 
  [Cardoso] It is a possibility, but nothing has been decided 
yet. There is no reason to discuss that before having defined 
the fiscal reform. I do not confirm any of these conversion 
studies. 
  [Marquez] State-owned companies have updated prices, but 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] has been passing 
financial costs onto its products -- such as raw material for 
packing -- thus forcing the private sector to increase its 
prices. 
  [Cardoso] I deem that very bad. I have already asked for 
confirmation that Petrobras is really increasing its prices by 
passing on its financial costs. So far, Petrobras has not given 
me any information. One of the advantages of the URV is that it 
makes speculative increases in cost and prices unnecessary. All 
that has to be done is to add cost and the interest rate. 
  [Marquez] How will rents be converted? 
  [Cardoso] This is very complicated. In rents conversion we 
will be discussing not only URV's but also demand, which is very 
low. We are being asked to reduce the renewal term on contracts 
under the excuse that otherwise rents could drop. Others say 
this is unnecessary, because it does not alter the level of 
rents. At the moment of figuring the URV, we will need a rule, 
but as I have already said, the URV is not compulsory. So far, 
nothing has been defined. A request has been made that the law 
on rents be reviewed. We will not do it because we are going to 
create the URV and the review may become unnecessary. 
  [Marquez] What is the government's greatest concern 
  over the implementation of the URV? 
  [Cardoso] We did not want to enforce the URV during a period 
of high inflation. Right now there is a tendency to halt this 
growing trend. There were estimates that the inflation rate 
would surpass 40 percent, but the FIPE [Economic Research 
Institute Foundation] has already stated that this figure stands 
at 39 percent. According to information supplied by Labor 
Minister Walter Barelli, the cost of the family basket in Sao 
Paulo increased by 35 percent. Public rates are not being 
readjusted on the basis of current inflation, neither are fuels 
or electricity rates. This concerns us most because it is 
important not to have growing inflation in February. 
  [Marquez] Do you believe the talks that Adviser Jose Milton 
Dallari is holding with businessmen will help to curb inflation? 
  [Cardoso] He is not there to control prices. His job is 
important because he identifies problems regarding prices, even 
regarding public rates so that we may make decisions. It is 
also important for businessmen to know we are watching. The 
entire price monitoring system was destroyed during Collor 
administration. We must restore it. 
  [Marquez] Why did Congress not approve provisional measures 
that increased taxes on financial corporations and banks? Was 
it against the economic program or against you? 
  [Cardoso] It was because it happened on a Friday. 
  [Marquez] But Senator Pedro Simon, the government leader in 
the Senate, said that the economic program was rejected because 
of your presidential candidacy... 
  [Cardoso] I have never said I am a candidate and I believe 
it 
would be very selfish to try to prevent an eventual candidacy by 
voting against a national program proposed by someone who has 
said he is not seeking to be a candidate. 
  [Marquez] But you went to the Northeast to distribute family 
baskets... 
  [Cardoso] I did not go to distribute family baskets. I went 
with Planning Minister Stepanenko and Regional Development 
Minister Canhim in response to an invitation by the governor of 
Pernambuco. We went with four PFL [Liberal Front Party] 
governors and one PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
governor to show that the federal government is implementing the 
largest food distribution program in the country. I did not go 
there to distribute any family baskets. Representatives from 
several political parties were there. This is the third time I 
have visited the area and now they come up with this. It is 
mere speculation, it is completely groundless. I do not even 
believe what some people say that the provisional measures were 
not approved out of fear for my candidacy. Had the deputies 
attended the session, we would have won two to one. But they 
were not there because they never attend sessions on Fridays. It 
was a lack of articulation. They were not there but they should 
have been; I consider it unforgivable that they were not there, 
particularly those from my party. The PPR [Progressive Renewal 
Party] -- which is most opposed to these provisional measures -- 
was almost compelled to oppose it because of its business ties, 
particularly with important businessmen. The PPR has to show it 
is strongly defending their interests. 
  [Marquez] Did you really tell National Health Council 
leaders 
that you were annoyed with Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf because 
of the instructions he gave the PPR? 
  [Cardoso] Paulo Maluf phoned me that same day and told me 
that he would intercede so that the voting would not be blocked. 
I believed him. He said he achieved an understanding to 
readjust bus rates by only 33 percent. Before it was 40 percent. 
  If they sought to upset a presidential candidacy, why lower 
it from 40 percent to 33 percent? There is a more serious issue 
behind all this. 
  [Marquez] So what is the problem? 
  [Cardoso] It is not just political. On one side is the PPR 
which does not vote in favor of increasing taxes, on the other 
side is Congress, which only votes on Wednesday. How can we 
conduct a constitutional reform this way? But it is even more 
serious. There was a huge scandal just because the government 
had two provisional measures rejected. From the financial 
viewpoint, $400 million is not a lot of money. The most serious 
aspect is that I cannot see in anyone the required zeal to fight 
inflation, as if inflation were not a very serious problem. I 
do not see the required zeal in dealing with other matters 
either. Perhaps this lack of coordination and unity is a result 
of the Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI. But we have 
had several victories. For the first time, Congress agreed to 
modify the ITR [Rural Property Tax]. I now hope the Social 
Emergency Fund will be approved. 
  [Marquez] Will the agreement reached on 28 January with the 
Chamber of Deputies and Senate presidents, and with 
congressional leaders lead to the approval of the constitutional 
amendment to create that fund? 
  [Cardoso] An agreement had already been reached but it was 
broken. Deputy Adilson Peres said he would vote against it, 
that he would not obstruct it. He changed his mind. In 
politics people change their minds but when an agreement is 
reached it is better not to change. The conclusion of today's 
meeting was not really an agreement but a demonstration of 
support. The president is very worried because it is difficult 
to run the government if Congress does not allow it. The danger 
is a crisis of governability. I have been warning about this 
for a long time. No candidacy or my position in the ministry 
are at stake. It would be easier for me not to be a minister. 
I am not a minister for political or personal reasons but 
because the president asked me in the midst of problems. 
  [Marquez] What should be done? 
  [Cardoso] It is necessary to take some measures on time 
otherwise we will have problems. What worries me is that things 
may happen any time. Congress must realize that we are in the 
final phase of the negotiations of the foreign debt which took 
years to implement. The issue of voting in Congress can 
compromise the possibility of resolving the problem of the 
foreign debt and of freeing the government from the need to ask 
for money from the bank all the time which increases interest 
rates and inflation. But what is so disappointing is that no 
alternatives are presented. 
  [Marquez] Do you feel betrayed? 
  [Cardoso] No. There is indifference, a part of the political 
sector does not seem to be in touch with the country. When 
there is a link, there is debate. I am a senator and I know how 
Congress works. It is not always 100 percent. Sometimes there 
is weakness. Unfortunately this has lasted too long -- since the 
CPI activities. I don't know if the CPI was a problem or a 
revelation. I believe next week congressmen will show up to 
vote. They may talk badly about me now that I am talking badly 
about Congress. But what do I care? Will the people think the 
same? I believe not. When people have conviction they should 
speak out. One should not be worried about applause and 
popularity, but always remember what is necessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Sonia Carneiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral 
Mario Cesar Flores on 7 February admitted that the Brazilian 
Government is willing to allow the inspection of its nuclear 
plants at the request of a third country as long as the request 
is lodged with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA). 
Flores asked government leader Pedro Simon to ask the Senate to 
immediately approve the two nuclear nonproliferation treaties to 
avoid retaliatory measures against Brazil. 
  Flores said: "There is no reason to fear the ratification of 
the agreement if we do not intend to build the atomic bomb." He 
made this statement following Germany's threat to break the 
nuclear agreement and suspend the transfer of technology to 
Brazil. 
  The Senate today will only vote on the proposal by Senator 
Dirceu Carneiro (PMDB-SC [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party-Santa Catarina]) in favor of the approval of one of the 
nuclear safeguard agreements. According to the agreement, 
Brazil, Argentina, the Abacc (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for 
Accounting and Control), and the AIEA agree to supervise the 
production of nuclear material restricting technological 
development to peaceful purposes, safeguard nuclear secrets, and 
authorize the Navy to build a nuclear submarine. Brazil does 
not have to reveal its technological secrets. Should an 
inspection be carried out, Brazil will not be forced to reveal 
how it enriches uranium. 
  The possibility of overcoming the impasse affecting the 
ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty that bans nuclear weapons 
in Latin America seems difficult. Carneiro, coordinator of the 
legislative decree on the treaty, has imposed a new condition: 
the elimination of an article allowing special inspections at 
nuclear plants at the request of a third country. But, at 
Itamaraty's request, Senate President Humberto Lucena has put 
the agreement on the list of issues to be voted on today without 
being submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Contrary to Lucena's decision, Carneiro has requested that 
the agreement be eliminated from the list of issues to be voted 
on. He wants the four-party agreement to be given priority 
treatment. Carneiro said reports that Germany intends to break 
the nuclear agreement due to the Senate's delay in approving the 
nuclear safeguards are "illogical and untrue." According to 
him, "the Tlatelolco Treaty is a regional treaty to ban nuclear 
weapons from Latin America, and it has nothing to do with the 
agreement with Germany that contemplated the construction of 
eight nuclear plants. None of which were built."

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Alonso] </F>
  [Text] San Jose, 7 Feb (PL) -- Shortly after his election 
victory was confirmed, Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres Olsen pledged to work to improve the situation of his 
country's poor sector. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, the National 
Liberation Party [PLN] winner of the presidential elections 
reiterated the social democratic administration, which will come 
to power on 8 May, will work for the eradication of poverty in 
Costa Rica. 
  "Just as we promised during the election campaign, the 
central part of our program will be the creation of 
opportunities for all Costa Ricans, especially for the poorest 
sectors," according to Figueres Olsen, son of three-time 
President Jose Figueres. 
  "The social policy of the next PLN government will not be 
based on the giving of alms. Our social policy will be an 
instrument of change to facilitate everyone having access to 
education, health, and a worthy home," according to the 
president-elect, who promised to explain the phases of his plan 
within the next few weeks. 
  After saying the social programs implemented by the 
government of President Rafael Angel Calderon left many negative 
consequences for the population, the president-elect promised to 
change them so as to avoid paternalism and the manipulation of 
the needs of large segments of the population. 
  "The improvement of the country's living conditions and the 
fight to eradicate dengue, malaria, and other diseases that have 
emerged in the last few months as a result of the abandonment of 
health practices will also be a priority," the president-elect 
said. 
  Concerning the economic duties his government will perform, 
the president-elect said one of the priorities will be the 
strengthening of economic stability as a result of handling 
properly the country's public finances to prevent the state bank 
from running into debt. 
  "In addition," he said, "we must take a step forward in the 
development of Costa Rica by increasing productivity and 
efficiency to improve the quality of life and facilitate the 
unity of the economic policy with social matters." 
  Asked about the next government's foreign policy, Figueres 
Olsen spoke in favor of strengthening ties with Central America 
and the Caribbean, including Cuba, to promote regional 
development. 
  Concerning international financial organizations, Figueres 
Olsen said Costa Rica will have a more active participation in 
these forums so that the policies that are promoted in these 
organizations are more in touch with the needs and interests of 
the developing countries. 
  The president-elect, a 39-year-old industrial engineer who 
was graduated in the United States, defeated Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez of the Christian Social Unity Party in his first 
attempt by getting 49.7 percent of the votes out of 1.881 
million eligible voters. 
  Criticized by certain sectors of his party, Figueres Olsen 
described his election as a victory over the neoliberal policies 
of Miguel Angel Rodriguez, who, after accepting defeat, wished 
success to the president-elect for the 1994 to 1998 term.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Forteza: "Cuban Leader Says United </F>
States Is Isolated in Blockade against Cuba"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Feb (PL) -- Today, Carlos Lage, 
vice president of the Cuban Council of State, said the United 
States is increasingly more isolated in its blockade policy 
against Cuba. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA at the end of his 
official 
six-day visit to Brazil, which concluded in Rio, Lage said an 
example of this isolation is the UN General Assembly's approval 
of resolutions against the U.S. embargo for two consecutive 
years. 
  He noted that the second time, more countries supported the 
resolution. 
  The 44-year-old Cuban vice president indicated this is the 
result of Cuba's refusal to renounce its socialist principals 
and the admiration this position produces in the world. 
  Regarding Washington's lifting of the embargo against 
Vietnam, Lage said this is the result of "the heroic Vietnamese 
struggle and victory," and makes it even more evident to 
international public opinion that "the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba is unjust and cruel." 
  In Brazil, the Cuban leader and the delegation accompanying 
him visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia -- the capital of the country -- 
and Rio de Janeiro. They met with President Itamar Franco, 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo. 
  Shortly before ending his visit, Lage said he found, in the 
aforementioned officials, a great understanding and a firm 
attitude against unilateral measures, like the blockade against 
Cuba and the so-called Torricelli Law, which seeks to influence 
third countries with the objective of attacking Cuba. 
  Carlos Lage, one of the Cuban Government's officials in 
charge of the economy, said the objectives of his official visit 
to Brazil were to contribute to the development of bilateral 
political, trade, and economic relations in general, to promote 
important scientific cooperation agreements in the field of 
agricultural, and discuss issues of interest to Latin America. 
  Brazil, he underscored, is an exporter of food and 
industrial 
products that Cuba needs, but he clarified that he wants trade 
with the South American giant to be balanced. 
  He indicated that the increasing amount of exports to the 
Brazilian pharmaceutical market will contribute to that 
stabilization. A $30 million contract for Cuban sales of those 
products was signed this year. 
  He emphasized that Cuba owes Brazil $48 million and it is a 
debt that still needs to be completely paid, but it will be 
eliminated through the growth of bilateral trade. 
  Regarding the vaccine against type B meningoccic meningitis, 
which Cuba manufactures and which Rio authorities requested to 
fight an outbreak here, he indicated a Brazilian national 
commission is still examining it in order to approve it being 
imported. 
  He added Cuba can wait for those results because its health 
authorities are convinced the vaccine is effective, given its 
parameters comply with all international regulations and was 
successfully used in Cuba during a mass immunization campaign. 
  In the area of general Brazilian-Cuban cooperation, he said 
Brazilian firms provide specific services to companies with 
concessions for petroleum-producing studies in Cuba, but he 
stated there were no talks on petroleum during this visit. 
  In the agricultural field, he expressed Cuba's interest in 
intensively studying Brazil's experience with alternating sugar 
cane and soybeans crops in the same soil. 
  Regarding Cuba's situation, he said it is expected that in 
1994, along with economic growth in tourism and the production 
of domestic petroleum, there will be an upsurge in other 
economic sectors that have been in decline. 
  This will depend, he clarified, on various factors, 
including 
the fluctuation of prices on the international market, and, 
because of the complexity of that situation, he suggested 
caution in making predictions. 
  Finally, regarding Cuban predictions for economic relations 
with the United States if that country lifts the blockade, Lage 
said that in the last few months the Clinton administration has 
intensified the blockade and approved the Torricelli Law. 
  "At this time, we are not yet in a condition to anticipate 
that situation with the United States," he stressed.

  [Text] Caracas, 8 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage today reaffirmed Cuba's interest in promoting Latin 
American capital investments in the island, which is adopting 
measures to accommodate its economy to current world conditions. 
  Lage, who met with Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister 
Miguel 
Angel Burelli and other authorities, stopped in Caracas for a 
short visit. He arrived from Brazil and will visit Colombia 
tomorrow. 
  At a news conference, the Cuban leader said his country 
welcomes foreign capital investments, preferably from the 
region, with which Cuba hopes to strengthen political ties and 
take steps toward integration. 
  In his meeting with Burelli, who is also Venezuela's 
candidate for OAS secretary general, Lage explained his 
country's situation, as well as the consequences of the U.S. 
economic blockade against the island. Lage emphasized that the 
so-called Torricelli Amendment, which tightens the blockade 
through extraterritorial measures, is not only illegal but also 
criminal because of its impact on the population. 
  Lage added that the accusations against Havana of human 
rights violations are unjustified and just a part of 
Washington's harassment policy. 
  Lage said Cuba has every right to participate in all aspects 
of the Latin American integration process and that regional 
organizations must accept all countries and respect the right of 
each people to choose its own path. 
  As for the changes taking place in Cuba, Lage said that the 
Caribbean nation does not intend to become a capitalist nation 
but to adjust to current world conditions and to improve the 
socialist model. 
  He added that it is very difficult to predict whether 
conditions will improve next year due to the U.S. blockade, but 
he did say that if the blockade tightens and creates even more 
difficult conditions, Cuba will face them. 
  Lage also met with Abdon Vivas Teran, president of the 
Venezuelan Investment Fund, and with Cesar Quintini Rosales, 
transport and communications minister.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the Cuban Council of State, described reports of 
Raul Castro's alleged ties to the Medellin drug-trafficking 
cartel as infamous and offensive. 
  Lage, who is on an official visit to Colombia, was 
interviewed by RCN Radio Network and the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR 
regarding reports that a videocassette showed an alleged member 
of the Cartel appearing before Pablo Escobar -- who was killed 
recently -- requesting his aid to contact Raul Castro, minister 
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba. 
  The morals and ethics of the Cuban revolution have been 
tested throughout its history. Neither narcotics nor corruption 
have stained it. We, therefore, do not have the slightest 
concern about that, the Cuban leader told EL ESPECTADOR. 
  He noted that Raul Castro "enjoys great prestige and the 
love 
of our people." Lage did not rule out the possibility that this 
accusation is part of "a manipulation by the enemies of the 
revolution" who have tried incessantly to involve the island in 
drug trafficking. 
  Lage told RCN that Cuba has the fewest drug problems of any 
country in the world because there is no consumption, 
corruption, or organized crime.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Feb (PL) -- Today, JORNAL DO BRASILIA 
newspaper divulged that Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
has criticized the U.S. embargo against Cuba during a meeting 
with Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, who is in Brazil on an 
official visit. 
  According to the newspaper, which is published in this 
capital, Foreign Minister Amorim referred indirectly to the U.S. 
embargo against Cuba at a lunch with Lage on 3 February when he 
condemned some countries' adoption of unilateral measures, 
disregarding international law. 
  According to this publication, Amorim kept reiterating such 
actions undermine both Brazil and Cuba's development. 
  Commenting on this, Amorim said his country rejects the 
imposition of extraterritorial law (Torricelli Law) on third 
countries, although he did not specifically mention the 
Torricelli Law, also known as the law for democracy in Cuba. 
  Amorim discussed his expectations regarding political 
changes 
in Cuba, and expressed his support for Cuba's reintegration in 
the hemisphere. 
  He pointed out that Brazil and Cuba can join forces to 
overcome their weaknesses, and cited as an example the benefits 
that should result from a recent bilateral agreement, by which 
the Brazilian market will obtain Cuban medicines. 
  Amorim said the Federal Government will distribute the 
medicines to the poorest people of this country for free. 
  Amorim also referred to cooperation with Cuba in sugar, 
science, and technical areas. 
  Meanwhile, in an interview by a Brazil news agency, Lage 
emphasized that the U.S. blockade against his country has caused 
many problems, and he said Latin American rejection of this 
aggression is important. 
  According to the news agency, Lage told Amorim that Cuba is 
interested in paying off a $30-million debt with Brazil, making 
the medicines' agreement possible. The value of the medicine is 
greater than the debt. 
  Lage noted that the medicines' agreement will also promote 
Cuban-Brazilian economic relations, and added that Brazilian 
businessmen are interested in investing in Cuba, especially in 
tourism, health, agriculture, and biotechnology. 
  According to JORNAL DO BRASILIA and the Brazil news agency, 
Cuba has placed special emphasis on tourism and oil. The 
newspaper says Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum], a state oil 
company, invested in oil exploration in Cuba, but stopped its 
operations. The publication stresses that the Cuban Government 
wants Petrobras to resume those activities. 
  According to the sources, Lage believes his visit to Brazil 
will help achieve an increase in bilateral trade. 
  JORNAL DO BRASILIA says that, according to Lage, in 1992, 
Cuban cash purchases to Brazil totaled $47 million, and 
consisted mainly of food, spare parts, chemical products, and so 
on. 
  On the third day of his visit to Brazil, Lage will lunch 
with 
Health Minister Henrique Santillo, then later he will meet with 
the vice president of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Associations. 
The itinerary will conclude with a news conference. 
  On Saturday, Lage and his delegation will arrive in Rio de 
Janeiro for a 48-hour stay. Lage's official visit will conclude 
on Monday with his departure to Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Feb (PL) -- The possible lifting of 
restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba is being 
classified by local analysts as something which the blockade 
prohibits and as a minor alleviation to the systematic violation 
of the constitutional rights of all U.S. citizens. 
  In expressing an opinion with respect to the extent of a 
measure, which, according to THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper has been 
approved by the U.S. Department of State and is currently being 
evaluated by President Bill Clinton, Graciella Chailloux from 
the U.S. Studies Center told PRENSA LATINA that Washington's 
blockade against Cuba will never change. 
  For the past 35 years, she recalled, the White House has 
attempted to economically suffocate Cuba, and what the newspaper 
reported in no way provides solutions leading in that direction. 
  Lifting some travel restrictions to Cuba and easing the way 
to information exchange is merely part of a plan they intend to 
implement in order to influence Cuban civilian society and 
encourage real political intervention which the Americans, she 
indicated, would consider given the excellent results in Eastern 
Europe. 
  The real intention, according to the researcher's personal 
opinion, is to encourage implementation of the Torricelli Bill, 
as this instrument relates to interfering in Cuba's internal 
issues. 
  Likewise, Nicanor Leon Cotayo, Cuban journalist, writer, and 
researcher, believes that lifting restrictions to Americans 
traveling to Havana will only be a minor alleviation to the 
official violation of U.S. citizens' constitutional rights. 
  Leon emphasized the highly selective nature of the 
authorizations granted -- mostly to U.S. officials. In this 
respect, he pointed out that more than an opening headed toward 
encouraging an improvement in bilateral relations, there would 
seem to be a more general intent aimed at less contructive 
objectives. 
  In this respect, he added, it is important to point out that 
those persons who would be allowed to travel to Cuba do not 
include individuals who would cooperate with the country's 
economic or scientific development. 
  Leon, author of several books on the blockade against Cuba, 
emphasizes that the eventual U.S. Government measures constitute 
a small favorable step within the context of American-Cuban 
relations.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Feb (PL) -- Today, Cuba reasserted the 
United States is responsible for the problems encountered by 
people who wish to leave Cuba in the normal manner, thereby 
sponsoring illegal actions which endanger their lives. 
  An article published by the newspaper TRABAJADORES explains 
local authorities allow all temporary trips abroad with a 
minimum of procedures and this has resulted in the issuance of 
100,000 of these authorizations in 1993. 
  Only 30,000 people, however, were able to fulfill their 
wishes because the others were denied the corresponding visa, 
mainly by the U.S. interests office in Havana. 
  Regarding citizens who definitely wish to settle abroad, all 
the Cuban Immigration Directorate demands is a visa from the 
country to which the applicant is going, enough funds to pay for 
the ticket, and, in the case of males between 16 and 27 years of 
age, completion of their military service. 
  The paper explains that thousands of Cubans who live abroad 
also received, in recent months, permission to visit the island 
following a simple procedure taken care of at the Cuban 
consulate in the country of their residency. 
  The newspaper adds: Contrary to Cuba's attitude, Washington 
does everything it can to make the immigration issue another 
thorn in the extremely difficult bilateral relations, opening 
its doors to all kinds of enemies of the revolutionary process 
and encouraging the desertion of professionals as part of a 
preconceived policy. 
  The newspaper states that no boundary whatsoever has been 
respected in this undertaking, and adds the fact that the 
normalization of immigration relations has always been a goal of 
the Cuban Government is rejected. 
  For example, it mentions the failure to comply with an 
agreement signed in 1984 in which the United States accepted the 
figure of 20,000 visas per year for Cuban applicants who wished 
to travel to U.S. territory and an additional 3,000 visas for 
people who were punished for counterrevolutionary crimes. 
  Also, it condemns the fact that the White House facilitates, 
without exception or numerical limit, risky illegal departures 
from Cuba, which extract a high price in lives of victims who 
are instruments of a destabilizing action which violates 
international laws.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Feb (PL) -- Cubans consider the U.S. call 
for a regional summit, which naturally excludes Cuba, as a new 
example of U.S. hegemonic eagerness in Latin America. 
  Washington recently announced that it wants to gather Latin 
American and Caribbean heads of state and government in the 
second half of 1994. However, it has already suggested that 
political considerations will be applied regarding who will 
participate in this summit. 
  The conditions and the agenda for the meeting are still 
unknown, although various spokespersons for the Clinton 
Administration rushed to deny that Cuba was on the list of 
participants which is being drafted by the State Department. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro was the first one to criticize 
this attitude during the closing recently of the Fourth Latin 
American and Caribbean Conference. Many organizations and 
prominent persons from Latin America and the Caribbean came to 
Havana to attend this conference. They expressed their 
solidarity with Cuba and rejected the U.S. blockade against this 
nation. 
  Castro downplayed the validity of a meeting of this type 
called by an outside power, which not only wants to decide the 
details of the agenda but also veto the attendance of those 
nations whose governments it dislikes. 
  Actually, according to local analysts, calling for a new 
presidential summit appears increasingly as a plan to counter 
the recognition obtained by Havana within the framework of the 
meetings with Latin American heads of state and government held 
during the past years and the obvious broadening of Cuban 
relations with many countries in the region. 
  By trying to exclude Cuba, it is ignoring recognition 
received by the island, improved relations between Cuba and 
members of the Caribbean Common Market, and important votes 
obtained in the United Nations against the isolation measures 
promoted by the United States for the last 35 years. 
  Summarizing local criticisms, the newspaper GRANMA, which is 
the official publication of the Cuban Communist Party Central 
Committee, emphasized that Washington plans to hold the 
so-called summit in Miami, home to the most aggressive 
anti-Cuban organizations. 
  GRANMA says that if at this point the Yankees want to use 
their "summit" against Cuba, they are too late and in bad shape. 
All the unipolarity in the world could not achieve such a big 
goal, one that is anachronistic as well as embarrassing. 
  In conclusion, the U.S. invitation remains the object of 
rejection and criticism by those who view it as an attempt to 
basically thwart the regional integration trend, which has made 
serious progress in the current decade.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Feb (PL) -- A group of French private 
businessmen and Cuban business executives will start meeting in 
Havana on 7 February to study business prospects for both 
countries in different sectors of the Cuban economy. 
  The visitors will be headed by Jean Pierre Desgeorges, vice 
president of the French National Sponsorship Council [Consejo 
Nacional de Patronato Frances] (CNPF), which is a collective 
that includes 225 organizations in the industrial, financial, 
and services sectors. 
  Cuban business sources consider this first CNPF visit as 
very 
important, because the collective represents approximately 1 
million French businessmen, including chiefs of state, 
ministers, and private and public leaders, and has 43 committees 
in several countries that operate under the management of 
important world business personalities. 
  At the meeting, which will continue until 10 February, the 
32 
members of the visiting delegation will hold talks and meet with 
Cuban executives who work in various economic sectors, such as 
construction material, tourism, transportation, electricity, and 
banks, among others. 
  Likewise, it is expected the French delegation will meet 
with 
top Cuban officials, including Carlos Lage, vice president of 
the Council of State; Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the 
Council of Ministers; and Roberto Robaina, the Cuban foreign 
minister.

various measures and multiplying their initiatives in assemblies 
held in their workplaces to identify their productive reserves 
and help resolve the country's difficult economic situation. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) has convened nearly 
80,000 
meetings until 15 March so workers can analyze how to reduce 
expenses, increase revenue, achieve profitability, and in this 
way contribute to the economic efficiency of their enterprises 
and the reorganization of the national finances. 
  This process is known in Cuba as the workers' parliament, 
because the ideas and proposals that emerge will enrich the 
debate of the People's Government National Assembly (parliament) 
during a special session called to adopt measures to improve the 
country's economic situation. 
  According to experts, the principal problems affecting the 
economy are excess money in circulation, swollen payrolls with 
more workers than necessary, and a drop in labor productivity. 
  Cuba entered a period of severe shortages after the collapse 
of the European socialist bloc, which provided the island with 
almost all the fuel it used and more that 85 percent of its raw 
materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed. 
  Deputies, provincial and rank and file delegates are 
participating in the workplace meetings, offering extensive 
information on national and regional problems while at the same 
time receiving the proposals and initiatives, enriching the 
debate and identifying them with their constituents, according 
to repeated evaluations by Cuban authorities. 
  Repeated proposals in the assemblies held throughout the 
country include charges for certain sports and cultural events, 
price increases for nonessential articles such as rum and 
cigarettes, and the elimination of subsidies as well as more 
strict control over state property. 
  Many workers have advocated a gradual application of these 
measures and are against streamlining payrolls without union 
participation. 
  The workers debates began in January with approximately 200 
assemblies of union leaders as an initial organizational step 
and resumed 31 January with the massive participation of all 
workers. 
  In a labor meeting at the Foreign Ministry, it was learned 
the ministry cut its expenses by $4 million during 1992 to 1993, 
and several proposals emerged for the ministry to finance itself. 
  The proposals included: setting the price of consular 
services at the same average level of other Foreign Ministries; 
charging for services of the documentation center, data base, 
chronologies, and others as well as streamlining foreign 
communications. 
  A poll of the sociopolitical studies center based on a 
sample 
of 1,300 workers representative of the unions and all the 
provinces has revealed that 86 percent said the assemblies are 
worthwhile, and 75 percent believe very useful initiatives will 
be gathered in the debates.

<F P=106> [Article by Silvio J. Mendiandua: "Cuba: In Search of </F>
Economic Efficiency"] 
  [Text] Havana, [no date as received] (PL) -- National 
economy, efficiency, and profits are the topics most discussed 
in Cuban life on the occasion of the opening chapter of the 
Workers Assemblies, unprecedented in other democracies, to 
search for solutions to the island's economic problems. 
  These meetings consist of implementing an analysis of the 
economy, at all the country's work centers of the respective 
enterprises to contribute ideas and initiatives to making them 
more productive and efficient. 
  At these meetings, convened by the Cuban Workers Federation 
(CTC) since January, the workers also discussed serious 
problems, such as excess money in circulation, equal to more 
than $11 billion, and the excessive amount of personnel at a 
number of enterprises, a problem which some sources estimate 
affects approximately 60 percent of the State-owned enterprises. 
  Deputies to the National Assembly (parliament) participate 
in 
the meetings, contribute information to the work centers, and 
receive the workers' proposals and initiatives, which they must 
take into consideration during debates at the upcoming 
extraordinary Assembly session, aimed at adopting measures that 
will guide the nation's economic future. 
  According to CTC sources, this process is called the Workers 
Parliament and will be carried out at approximately 80,000 work 
centers through 15 March. 
  The principles that serve as the basis for this measure, 
which has no precedent anywhere in the world according to 
official Cuban sources, are participative democracy and the 
enormous potential of the multiple intelligences involved. 
  The Cuban economy entered a period of harsh difficulties 
following the disappearance of the European socialist bloc and 
the disintegration of the Soviet Union, with whom Cuba had 
commercial relations that were very beneficial for the island. 
  The Soviet petroleum supply, amounting to almost all of the 
island's consumption, abruptly dropped from 13 million tons per 
year to less than 50 percent and the country had to restructure 
its foreign trade, which provided 85 percent of the raw 
materials to industry and agriculture. 
  At the end of 1992, another obstacle hampered Havana's 
economic plans. The Torricelli Law, ratified in October 1992, 
prohibited subsidiaries of U.S. enterprises' in third countries 
to trade with the island. 
  According to studies conducted by specialized U.S. agencies, 
trade with Cuba, which reached $500 million with these firms at 
one time, was left futureless and the trade embargo tightened. 
On 26 July 1993, Cuban authorities announced the adoption of a 
series of measures to reactivate the national economy and 
reinsert the country into the world economy. 
  The plan included new incentives for foreign investments to 
attract capital, markets, technology, and raw materials. 
Additional incentives were granted for visits and the remittance 
of funds by Cubans living abroad. 
  As for the structural aspect of the economy, important 
decisions were made, such as the creation of the basic 
cooperative production units, which decentralized the national 
agriculture sector, and the self-employed workers law, which 
encouraged the production of certain goods which the state 
cannot provide. 
  The new offensive is aimed at improving the financial 
situation in 1994, eliminate excess personnel, increase work 
productivity, and seek new production incentives. 
  Participants in the majority of the work meetings held this 
week have proposed increasing the price of nonessential 
articles, such as rum and cigarettes, charging admission to 
sports and cultural events, and eliminating subsidies to 
unprofitable enterprises. 
  According to local media, the participants also spoke about 
the need to establish greater control mechanisms to prevent the 
illegal diversion of state property assets. 
  Other agreements deal with the labor unions' request to 
participate in future processes to account for personnel. They 
also requested the measures be adopted in a gradual manner.

  [Text] Havana, 3 Feb [date as received] (PL) -- The Cuban 
parliament has refused to treat CIA-backed emigrant groups, who 
are supposedly interested in talking with Cuban authorities, as 
valid interlocutors. 
  The Foreign Affairs Committee issued a statement saying, 
"Cuba has never been adverse to the possibility of reaching an 
understanding with the emigrant population," and Cuba has talked 
with sectors that disagree with the island's political project 
but have no ties with the CIA and do not favor the blockade or 
aggression. 
  The document, which was revealed at a Latin American and 
Caribbean solidarity meeting recently held here, specifically 
rejects the so-called "Democratic Platform" position, that, 
abroad, pretends to favor dialogue. 
  Cuban legislators have said this group has "no backing among 
the emigrants and represents one of the strategy trends that 
certain stubborn power circles in the United States have for 
Cuban counterrevolutionary groups." 
  The document notes that in its search for legitimacy, this 
group, which lacks political backing, claims it represents Cuban 
liberal trends, the Christian democracy, and the social 
democracy. 
  Expanding on this issue, the document points out that the 
Liberal Unity and the so-called Social Democratic Coordinating 
Board, members of the platform, have no more than 30 members 
combined and even less support in Cuba. 
  The document cautions that the platform's political position 
does not condemn "the criminal U.S. blockade against Cuba," but 
rather denies it, minimizing the extent of the conflict to 
"bickering among Cubans" in an effort to confuse and weaken 
international solidarity. 
  The document accuses the platform of not criticizing, at 
all, 
the aggressive U.S. policy against Cuba and of defending and 
praising the most important terrorist programs of the 
Cuban-American National Foundation, with its headquarters in 
Miami, Florida, the United States. 
  According to the parliament, the so-called Democratic 
Platform has received political and economic support from 
foundations and governments, and from the U.S. administration 
itself through the National Endowment for Democracy and the CIA 
to carry out its plans. 
  The 25-page document provided some biographical data on the 
main leaders of the pseudocoalition, including Jose Ignacio 
Rasco, one of the CIA's chosen, it said, to create the "Cuban 
Revolutionary Council" which served as a civilian front for the 
U.S. Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Regarding Enrique "Kike" 
Balyora, it said he belonged to several terrorist organizations 
in the service of the CIA, took specialized training courses at 
Fort Benning for elite, covert operations, and worked as an 
analyst for the Pentagon in such sensitive issues as El Salvador. 
  Carlos Alberto Montaner also belonged to a terrorist 
organization, and different sources have placed him on the CIA's 
payroll since the 1960's as a propaganda agent and specialist in 
ideological subversion. 
  It added that Montaner served two years in the U.S. Army, 
received training in covert operations, and recently has become 
the main organizer of campaigns in Washington against the Cuban 
Revolution. 
  "His syndicated press columns are marked by his pejorative 
attitude toward Latin America and the glorification of U.S. 
values as patterns to be imitated in the subcontinent," the 
document added. 
  Regarding Juan Alberto Suarez-Rivas, it noted he was also 
involved in different counterrevolutionary organizations, the 
same as Angel Del Cerro, whereas Emilio Martinez Venegas was 
recruited by the CIA in the 1960's and he now lives in Venezuela. 
  The list includes Pedro Alejandro Interian Garcia, a leader 
of terrorist organizations in and out of Cuba in the 1960's. 
  According to the document, after trying rapprochement and 
feigning a respectful attitude on a political level, in 1991, he 
reestablished and activated his ties with CIA agents and 
collaborators and represented their platform in Brazil. 
  "These men are incapable of playing a positive role in any 
real process of improving relations between Cuba and the United 
States, nor do they have the moral, political, and ethical 
legitimacy in Cuba's commitment to improving relations with 
regard to emigration," the parliament statement concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 4 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban 
immigrant organizations are interested in holding talks with the 
Cuban Government to review links between both sides without 
discussing matters related to the country's internal situation. 
  The Cuban-Americans have told PRENSA LATINA that whatever 
happens in Cuba only concerns Cubans who live there and that 
they would like to talk, preferably, about normalizing the 
relations between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad. 
  Subjects such as immigrations, communications, family 
reunification and aid, the need for cultural exchange, and ways 
to facilitate the lifting of the blockade could be the main 
points discussed during the meeting, which has created great 
expectations in the United States, where more than 1 million 
Cubans live. 
  Alicia Torres, a Cuban-American who arrived in the United 
States when she was four and today heads the Cuban-American 
Committee in Washington, has said it is time to discuss certain 
aspects that could contribute to normalizing the links between 
certain moderate political groups and authorities. 
  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced the dialogue at 
the end of 1993 in New York. The meeting is expected to take 
place during the second half of 1994. 
  The Cuban Government has not yet decided the date or the 
list 
of participants in the meeting in which, according to Torres, 
all sectors willing to participate in a respectful dialogue 
should participate. 
  The Cuban Parliament has rejected, however, the 
participation 
of groups of immigrants supposedly interested in talking with 
the authorities but which have the support of the CIA. 
  A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Commission has 
said 
Cuba "has never closed the possibility of reaching agreements 
with Cuban immigrants and has been talking with groups that 
oppose the Cuban political ideas, as long as those groups are 
not linked to the CIA or to positions that favor the blockade 
and aggression. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Foreign Minister Robaina said some time ago that individuals 
linked to Miami-based terrorist organizations or those who want 
to give away or sell the country (Cuba) will be excluded from 
the talks. 
  Robaina said the Cuban Government is willing to hold talks 
and establish fluent and normal relations with those segments of 
the community that maintain a respectful position and will not 
estrange themselves from their homeland. 
  Coincidentally, Andres Romero, president of the Organization 
of Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organization Cubanos-Americanos 
por la Dignidad] has agreed that representatives from terrorist 
groups should not be invited to the meeting, adding that his 
organization rejects any attitude of confrontation or violence 
that could lead to a bloodshed. 
  Extreme-right groups should not be invited to the meeting, 
because in Miami they oppose, in various ways, assistance to 
Cuba, even if it consists of medicines or powdered milk for 
children, he has said. 
  We are accused of being communists, which we are not... we 
simply act as decent Cubans who want to help. They, however, 
distort the truth, saying that our shipments are sent to the 
government, when they are really for hospitals, schools, and 
nursing homes, something which has already been confirmed. 
  Romero, one of the organizers of the fleet that on two 
occasions has brought humanitarian aid to Cuba from Key West, 
has said that during the meeting neither side should try to 
impose their ideas on the other, and he stressed the importance 
of reviewing the subject of immigration. 
  Regarding a similar dialogue held in 1978, during which 
Torres was the youngest participant, she said "there have been 
some advancements on the challenges we had at that time. 
Obviously, new subjects will emerge, as times have changed 
since then." 
  She recalled that under current circumstances there are more 
complex aspects, such as the economic situation in Cuba and the 
illegal departure from the country of Cuban citizens who receive 
the U.S. Government's protection when they arrive in U.S. waters. 
  Both Torres and Romero have agreed that whatever happens in 
Cuba only concerns Cubans who live on the island and that the 
Cuban community abroad has no right to decide what should be 
done. 
  It is a different situation, Torres said, when Cuban 
immigrants want to help their families, keep in touch with them, 
or return to their country of origin, among other things. 
  Meanwhile, Romero has said no one abroad has a right to 
impose changes in Cuba and that any proposal in that regard 
should be made respectful of the island's sovereignty.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Silvio J. Mendiandua: "Territorial </F>
Self-Sufficiency"] 
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Self-sufficiency in 
animal protein and increases in agricultural production in the 
municipalities are other alternatives that Cubans are testing to 
increase their consumption and improve the quality of the food 
supply. 
  The project's goal is to foster a broad self-sufficiency 
program in agricultural products in each administrative 
political unit. The programs will be under the supervision of 
the people's councils, the power organizations in each territory. 
  In the short term the goal is to achieve 24 grams of animal 
protein for each inhabitant as a complement to the nation's 
production system. This is in addition to developing agrarian 
exploitation in marginal areas, according to what Humberto 
Muniz, agriculture and fishing director of the Academy of 
Science, explained to PRENSA LATINA during an interview. 
  This level of protein, superior to those currently existing 
in most Latin American nations, should be obtained by mixing the 
natural resources available at each site. This is particularly 
true of those that serve as the basis for animal feed, added 
Muniz, identified as one of the program's organizers. 
  The search for territorial self-sufficiency arose as a 
strategic need of the nation in the event the island were 
militarily blocked during a war and the possibility of receiving 
supplies from abroad decreased to zero. 
  Given the sudden crumbling of the European socialist bloc, 
with which 85 percent of economic trade was carried out, Cubans 
were left without supplies of fertilizers, pesticides, and feed 
that originated from that area. This produced serious setbacks 
in local production and foreign trade. 
  Faced with this situation, the nation had to step up efforts 
and initiatives aimed at replacing foreign supplies and 
reactivate its production. This was particularly true of 
agricultural production as a source of food and industrial raw 
materials. 
  Territorial self-sufficiency, adapted to the current special 
period in peacetime, is an alternative to the nation's 
production system, and its results will directly benefit the 
people in the region where it is applied. 
  The project is based on the state-of-the-art use of the 
natural resources in each area of the nation and the use of idle 
areas. In the economic aspect it is based on applying incentives 
for work productivity, the agriculture engineer indicated. 
  There are places where self-sufficiency in milk is being 
achieved with the construction of small dairy farms 
(microvaquerias), while pisciculture is encouraged through the 
delicate reproduction of tilapia [African fresh water fish], 
"tecnas," or other river, lake, or dam species by making use of 
industrial residues. 
  This last alternative serves the productive goals and 
removes contamination from the environment. This benefits the 
area and strengthens the incentive system on which the project's 
success is based. 
  Each region draws up its own strategy in keeping with its 
possibilities, production potential, or eating traditions and 
only receives technical assistance from the state's central 
levels. 
  The project leaves room for individual or collective 
initiatives and for creativity in searching for ways to meet the 
food supply demand within the municipalities, allowing savings 
in transportation, fuel, and material resources in general. 
  This encompassing movement proposes to stimulate and include 
the self-sufficiency systems that exist in the schools, state 
enterprises, and with small producers. The goal is to make 
rational use of the natural resources available on a regional 
level. 
  To achieve this perfection, research is conducted on the 
current variables such as raising pigs outdoors, porcine 
enclosures, collective pig raising farms, raising chickens in 
backyards, and raising fish in ponds. 
  There is also work on the use of agricultural waste, food 
recycling, and using all sources of food available, together 
with a broad dissemination program. 
  Seed production and animal breeding are also part of the 
program in each region as a basic element to guarantee the whole 
system. Likewise, there is hard work to eliminate the 
traditional dependency on fuel by using animal transportation, 
renewable power, and non-conventional sources. 
  With regard to organization, the method consists of 
achieving 
an adequate balance between what is produced and what is for 
direct or social consumption by the people, thereby stimulating 
efforts made by each region in keeping with the increase in 
their levels of production. 
  Although the whole project is based on craftsmanship methods 
of production, many initiatives are encouraging incorporation in 
the scientific and technical fields to seek efficiency and 
better economic results, according to its organizers. 
  Currently, while the project's implementation progresses, 
the 
most diverse technical systems and the most adequate 
distribution methods are being studied, and the exchange of 
information among territories is encouraged. 
  Some of the most commonly asked questions are: How do we 
make 
popular and develop community farming? How do we get the maximum 
use out of various animal species? What organizational structure 
should be given to the self consumption activity in each 
municipal or people's council.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Feb (PL) -- Culture Ministry sources 
announced today that 355 Cuban artists and intellectuals, both 
in and out of the country, received awards for professional 
excellence in 1993. 
  According to Lecsy Tejeda, president of the National Stage 
Arts Council, a long and varied list of creators, including 
poets Dulce Maria Loynaz (winner of the Cervantes literature 
prize) and Eliseo Diego and the musicians Leo Brouwer and 
Gonzalo Rubalcaba received international awards last year. 
  Prima ballerina Alicia Alonso, theater playwright Abelardo 
Estorino, film directors Alfredo Guevara and Tomas Gutierrez 
Alea, and cartoonist Roberto Fabelo also received important 
distinctions. 
  Other artists in less mentioned fields such as applied arts 
and the circus also received awards. 
  Despite the difficult economic situation in the country, 
which has compelled the government to eliminate or drastically 
reduce budgets, Cuban culture has been particularly productive 
during the past 12 months. 
  If the international awards are categorized by field, Tejada 
said, the plastic arts are at the head (42), followed by film 
making (33), theater arts (19), music (12), and literature (10). 
  In Tejada's opinion, the National Art Education System 
deserves a special mention because 23 of the people awarded are 
still students at its specialized centers yet they stood out for 
their talent and solid education. 
  To honor all those personalities -- both those who are 
established professionals as well as the newcomers -- there will 
be an art gala at the National Theater in Havana on 11 February. 
A complete rundown of the 1993 awards will be presented at that 
event.

<F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The UN General Assembly today confirmed Ecuadoran UN 
Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso as the first UN high commissioner 
for human rights. His duties will involve the promotion and 
protection of human rights, including the right to development 
and the conception of suggestions to improve its implementation. 
  Upon expressing gratitude for the appointment, Ayala Lasso 
requested the support of all governments and invited them to a 
sincere dialogue. He also pledged to be objective and impartial 
in all situations and with all states. 
  The new high commissioner reaffirmed the universality, 
indivisibility, and interdependence of human rights, although he 
pledged to pay attention to national and regional 
characteristics and to historic, cultural, and religious 
traditions. Ayala Lasso also issued a warning to his own 
country, Ecuador. 
  [Begin Ayala Lasso recording] In the performance of my 
duties, I will be objective and impartial in all situations and 
with all states, but as an irrepressible expression of love for 
my people, which I will soon cease to represent at the United 
Nations, I will be particularly harsh in the execution of my 
duties, to ensure that Ecuador's conduct with regard to respect 
for human rights will be flawless. [end recording]

  [Text] The Brazilian Government is willing to comply with 
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines. In an 
official document, the government admitted that the 
implementation of the MTCR guidelines does not imply any sort of 
limitation on special national programs or harm international 
cooperation in such programs. In addition, the government 
commits itself to complying with export control rules compatible 
with the MTCR guidelines as soon as draft bill No. 2535/92 takes 
effect. 
  This decision, which was announced 11 February, befits the 
efforts made by the Brazilian Government in the last few weeks 
to show the international community that the country is 
contributing to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and that its nuclear and aerospace programs have 
strictly peaceful objectives. Thus, the government believes it 
has taken one more step toward obtaining sensitive technology.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio </F>
Oliveira, Liberal Front Party-Pernambuco State, by Joao Domingos 
in Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Domingos] Some of the 16 congressmen who will 
be stripped of their political rights by the budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee], like Ibsen Pinheiro, 
are your friends. Will you vote in favor of stripping him of his 
political rights? 
  [Oliveira] I will not have any misgivings in voting in favor 
of stripping anyone of his or her political rights. At this 
moment, not a single congressman can have this type of 
misgiving. A congressman must act according to his or her 
conscience, in keeping with the superior interests of the 
Brazilian nation. If the Constitution and Justice Committee 
decides a congressman is guilty, its judgment will be very 
important for the plenary's guidance. 
  [Domingos] Don't you fear that the Chamber of Deputies will 
take a corporatist attitude and save guilty congressmen from 
being stripped of their political rights? 
  [Oliveira] In my opinion, if the legislative branch's 
credibility is jeopardized we must take this jeopardy into 
account so that we vote in defense of the institution. I 
currently note that corporatism in the Chamber of Deputies, a 
weakness attributed to our branch to allegedly defend certain 
people, is not merely being aimed at a given congressman, but at 
our institution. 
  [Domingos] Concerning the approval of a pardon for the 
farmers who owe money to the Bank of Brazil, wasn't this a 
demonstration of corporatism, headed by the rural bloc? 
  [Oliveira] In my opinion, the pardon was an exceptional 
vote. When it was voted on, many voted without an in-depth 
discussion of this issue. Therefore, we took a position: Not a 
single bill scheduled for urgent discussion will be voted on 
during the same session, but within 24 hours so that all 
congressmen can become familiar with the issue they are 
discussing and voting on. Now it is up to the Senate to play 
its role, that is, to review the Chamber of Deputies' work. 
Therefore, we are calm because the legislative branch's work is 
not completed by merely voting. If any changes are made in the 
Senate, the bill will be returned to the Chamber of Deputies and 
then it will actually be discussed thoroughly. [passage omitted] 
  [Domingos] How would you describe the events experienced by 
the legislative branch in our country? 
  [Oliveira] I believe the legislative branch in Brazil is 
experiencing one of the most difficult periods in its history. 
Therefore, it is necessary to be aware that, at this moment, it 
is essential to place the institution's interests above party or 
personal interests or any other type of interests. We are 
making a huge effort to demonstrate to our fellow congressmen 
that this time requires everyone's sense of responsibility. The 
Chamber of Deputies president's or the Senate president's 
responsibility is even greater because, as branch heads, their 
contribution to democracy must be greater. 
  [Domingos] Why are you saying that this is the legislative 
branch's most difficult period? 
  [Oliveira] It is the most difficult period because the 
legislative branch, which is dissecting itself, investigating 
itself, and will punish itself, is a branch that is experiencing 
a huge trauma. The legislative branch may learn some lessons 
from this trauma and it may be strengthened in the end because 
it will become a branch with moral authority and credibility. 
During the three months of the budget CPI's operation the 
country was immobilized. Everything in this country revolves 
around the legislative branch. During the CPI's operation, the 
branch that discussed the major domestic problems was the branch 
that headed society's discussions. This branch cannot remain 
stagnant. We are acting in a different way than Italy, for 
example, where the Clean Hands Operation is being conducted by 
the Attorney General's Office and the judicial branch. In 
Brazil, this operation is being conducted by the legislative 
branch itself.

  [Text] The Workers Party [PT] national board has postponed 
until 17 February the meeting to debate the 15 controversial 
points of the party's government program. Presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and the party's bloc of 
federal deputies will also participate in the meeting. Here is 
a list of the issues on which Lula particularly disagrees with 
the PT program: 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  PT proposal: To end the National Privatization Program (PND) 
and review some sales already made. 
  Lula's proposal: To view the privatization of nonstrategic 
state- owned companies. To preserve current monopolies but open 
them to participation by the private sector through risk 
contracts and sale of shares. 
<H5>  Foreign Debt </H5>
  PT proposal: To adopt unilateral measures, such as 
suspending 
the foreign debt payment followed by an audit. In other words: 
Moratorium. 
  Lula's proposal: To renegotiate the foreign debt. He 
believes a government that wants to negotiate cannot declare a 
moratorium. Trade debts will be honored. The foreign debt will 
be handled from the political viewpoint and not from the 
economic and financial one. 
<H5>  Anti-Inflation Policy </H5>
  PT proposal: To postpone the choice of anti-inflation policy 
tools until the conjuncture of problems inherited from the 
previous administration is defined and identified. 
  Lula's proposal: To socially control inflation through 
negotiations by sectorial groups. To gradually reduce inflation 
instead of implementing shocks, seeking to suddenly reduce 
monthly rates from 40 percent to 0.9 percent. 
<H5>  Domestic Debt </H5>
  PT proposal: To convert the domestic debt into bonds, thus 
suspending the pact for automatic repurchase of public bonds. 
  Lula's proposal: To negotiate a rescheduling of the domestic 
debt. Contracts will not be unilaterally broken. 
<H5>  Foreign Trade </H5>
  PT proposal: To end the policy of mega-trade surpluses and 
to 
stimulate the domestic market growth by creating a market of the 
masses. 
  Lula's proposal: To concurrently export and create a market 
of the masses are not opposing models. The goal is to 
strengthen the domestic market, but without hindering the level 
of exports. This would become possible through an overall 
increase in production. 
<H5>  Foreign Investment </H5>
  PT proposal: To channel foreign capital into productive 
investments. 
  Lula's proposal: Foreign investment will return to the 
country as a result of economic stability. The government must 
be credible if it is to attract foreign investment to the 
productive sector. 
<H5>  Agrarian Reform </H5>
  PT proposal: To settle one million of families over the next 
five years. Sugar mill owners land will be negotiated in 
exchange for their debt to the government. 
  Lula's proposal: To implement an agrarian reform and settle 
one million families over the next five years. The process, 
however, will have to be accompanied by an agricultural policy 
aimed at stimulating small farmers and cooperatives.

<F P=106> [Article by Joao Domingos] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The beginning of the constitutional 
reform has caused a crisis in the PT [Workers Party] that hides 
a dispute for the control of the electoral campaign of virtual 
PT presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Since the 
Congressional Investigating Committee that was looking into 
irregular handling of the budget ended its work and the 
constitutional reform became the most important congressional 
activity, PT congressmen have been disputing with the PT 
national board that last year forbade the PT bloc to participate 
in the reform. 
  Deputy Paulo Delgado (MG) [Minas Gerais] said: "We represent 
the party and the people. To believe that our mandate is only 
granted by the party is a way of going against the will of the 
voters." Some of the PT congressmen interested in participating 
in the revision suspect that the national board's prohibition, 
which is strongly influenced by the radical faction, disguises 
interests about the October elections. 
  According to this suspicion, if the PT's moderate faction 
did 
not participate in the reform, they would lose votes among 
voters who do not belong to the PT. The prohibition, however, 
would not affect their rivals, who are habitually elected with 
the support of the orthodox groups. A manifesto against the 
board's decision was drafted by 19 of the 37 PT congressmen last 
week. The rebellious congressmen evaluated the possibility of 
breaking with the party leadership, but Deputy Jose Fortunatti 
(RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] who leads the PT bloc prevented this 
from happening. 
  After two weeks of negotiations, Fortunatti convinced the PT 
leaders on 8 February to allow the congressmen to participate, 
at least, in the session in which the Social Emergency Fund 
(FSE) had to be approved. A meeting has been scheduled for 17 
February. The PT moderate faction hopes that during this meeting 
the bloc will be definitively authorized to participate in the 
reform. 
  One of the objectives of the radical PT members seems to be 
to isolate Dep. Delgado and three other deputies: Jose Genoino 
(SP) [Sao Paulo], Eduardo Jorge (SP), and Joao Paulo (MG). These 
four deputies comprise the faction that is firmly engaged in 
negotiating PT alliances with several other parties for the 
October elections. 
  The radical faction tried to prove that the moderate faction 
was opposing the party's code of ethics, but they could not. 
Genoino refuted: "We have given the leadership a possibility of 
overcoming the situation. By preaching a thorough boycott of the 
reform, the PT leadership started a war without solution." 
  The moderate faction congressmen believe that if they had 
been allowed to participate in the reform from the beginning, 
they would have been able to ensure decisive support for their 
proposals in the plenary sessions. Genoino added: "We were so 
late in joining the battle that we handed the Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party and the Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party to the Liberal Front Party and the Progressive Renewal 
Party on a platter." 
  Some of the issues being debated in relation to the FSE, 
such 
as the article that ensured allocation of funds to education, 
were of interest to the PT. When the party decided to take an 
active part in the session in which the FSE was voted on, there 
was little to do because negotiations among parties had already 
concluded. "We were losing the game 10-1 and there was no more 
time to make a goal," Fortunatti said. 
<H5>  The Split </H5>
  The crisis between the PT and its bloc in Congress, which 
resulted from the constitutional reform, divided the party into 
three different groups: 
  Against -- Those who do not accept participating in the 
constitutional reform: 
  Adao Pretto (RS) 
  Agostinho Valente (MG) 
  Jacques Wagner (BA) [Bahia] 
  Jose Cicote (SP) 
  Luci Choinacki (SC) [Santa Catarina] 
  Maria Laura (DF) [Federal District] 
  Sandra Starling (MG) 
  Tilden Santiago (MG) 
  Undecided -- Those who criticize the party's position, but 
do 
not take sides: 
  Alcides Modesto (BA) 
  Aloizio Mercadante (SP) 
  Carlos Santana (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] 
  Florestan Fernandes (SP) 
  Haroldo Saboia (MA) [Maranhao] 
  Jose Dirceu (SP) 
  Paulo Rocha (PA) [Para] 
  Raul Pont (RS) 
  Valdir Ganzer (PA) 
  Vladimir Palmeira (RJ) 
  Support the Reform -- Those who criticize the authoritarian 
attitude of the party's leadership: 
  Benedita da Silva (RJ) 
  Chico Vigilante (DF) 
  Eden Pedroso (RS)

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ruy Fabiano: "PT Seeks out Military"] </F>
  [Text] The high command of the PT [Workers Party] is 
solidly mobilized in search of something it calls a "new power 
pact." The starting point for that pact is a genuine 
rapprochement with the Armed Forces (which still fear the 
party's leftist talk) and with businessmen of a more progressive 
bent. The party wants to break down its political isolation. 
  Dialogue with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
has 
helped the party move in that direction. The PT now has stable 
channels of communication with the FIESP [Sao Paulo State 
Federation of Industries] and the PNBE [National Board for 
Entrepreneurial Bases]. But that is still not much. Dialogue 
with the military is still arduous, distrustful, and 
unproductive. 
  Actually, the PT is faced with a dilemma: it needs the 
stigma 
of the accursed in order to win the election, especially among 
the working masses and young people, but it needs to free itself 
of that same stigma in order to take power and govern. How can 
it maintain the proper balance between those two needs? A little 
theater obviously helps--something for which the party's leaders 
have shown a fair amount of talent--but the party needs to 
establish channels of communication with the conservative world. 
The Armed Forces are part of that universe. And there is no 
possibility of governing without them. 
  Although it is more supportive on the pay issue than any 
other party in the country--and pay is currently a priority 
issue among the military--the PT continues to be seen as a 
potential enemy. The formulators of the party's policies--the 
intellectually most qualified cadres, who are in charge of 
thinking out strategies and recommending alliances--attribute 
that distrust to the ideological conditioning of the past. The 
Brazilian military, or at least a considerable number of their 
top leaders, still cling stubbornly to principles and 
fundamental ideas dating back to the days of the Cold War, when 
the ideological split between Left and Right guided and decided 
questions of power. 
  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of 
Brazil's automatic alignment with the United States, there was 
no longer any reason to view Brazilian leftists as enemies. The 
issues currently of concern to the Brazilian military are the 
exact opposite of those in which the United States is 
interested: the internationalization of the Amazon Region, for 
example, or the abolition of Armed Forces in the Third World 
countries by turning them into nothing more than antidrug police 
forces, while the United Nations (an agency under the command of 
the United States) takes responsibility for the security of 
those countries. 
  If it were up to the younger officers in the Army (and 
possibly those in the other two services: the Navy and the Air 
Force), a rapprochement with the PT would be easier. The younger 
officers, being less committed to the ideological commitments of 
the past, are more receptive to the PT's message, especially on 
the pay issue and the issue of cleaning up political morals. The 
military, most of whom are recruited from the middle class, have 
always been sensitive to moralistic rhetoric. 
  It was with the middle class that the old UDN [National 
Democratic Union] under Carlos Lacerda and Afonso Arinos 
mobilized the Armed Forces against Getulio Vargas in 1954 and 
against "Jango" [Joao Goulart] in 1964. And the current UDN, at 
least as far as its role as defender of morals and good 
political behavior is concerned, is undoubtedly the PT. It is 
true that there is less verbal brilliance and a substantially 
lower IQ, but the script is the same. With due allowance for 
talent and performance, Senator Suplicy is a PT version of 
Carlos Lacerda. 
  In short, the party is placing its bet: once ideological 
prejudice has been overcome, it will be possible theoretically 
to seal a power pact with the military.

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ruy Fabiano: "The Military and the PT"] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the article that appeared here the day 
before yesterday ("PT Seeks out Military"), an important Army 
officer who occupies a post at the top of the hierarchy but whom 
I prefer to keep incognito (let us therefore refer to him only 
as "the source") has made some enlightening remarks to this 
column. 
  The article mentioned the efforts of the PT--the party 
favored by the polls to win the presidential election--to draw 
closer to the military. And it said that the greatest resistance 
to the party was to be found in the upper echelons, where there 
was more ideological prejudice, whereas a fair amount of 
receptiveness existed among the younger officers (captains, 
majors, and so on). That is not the way things are, according to 
the source. 
  When the Cold War ended, the Armed Forces began to cultivate 
a new kind of behavior with regard to the ideological issue. It 
is obvious that such a change does not take place overnight. 
Complete assimilation takes time, and it is natural that within 
the military, the values that were a part of their training for 
decades should continue to exist for some time. Meaning, in this 
case, anticommunist ideology. 
  But, the source says, the essential point is that for all 
intents and purposes, the ideological issue among the military 
is no longer an institutional issue or, much less, a national 
security issue. It is an individual matter to be decided by the 
soldier and his own conscience as a citizen. Everyone has his 
own opinion regardless of his professional duties. The 
point--and this is something that the source considers important 
and in conflict with what we said in this column--is that 
resistance to breaking down deep-rooted ideological prejudices 
is in fact greater among the younger officers. 
  The older officers are the ones who have shown the greatest 
flexibility and understanding regarding the need for political 
coexistence with pluralism. And in any case, that split between 
younger and more mature officers does not in fact lead to any 
duality in thinking and/or behavior. Within the military, as is 
natural in any institution governed by a rigid hierarchical 
system, the feeling of unity and cohesion is what prevails. 
  The directive from above, and it is not being challenged at 
any level, is simply this: the winner of the election in 
October, be it the PT, the PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil], or 
any other party, will take power and govern normally. According 
to the source, that bias toward legality dates back a long way 
in the Armed Forces. The source says that even the Movement of 
1964 was not exclusively military. He points out that "Jango" 
was deposed by Congress, which supported all of the initial 
actions (including the revocation of political rights) leading 
up to the election--also by the congressmen--of Castello Branco. 
  According to the source, the break with the process did not 
come about until 1968, and then it occurred in a radicalized 
context of urban guerrilla warfare. But that is another story. 
Let us get back to the PT. The party today is preparing to take 
power, being confident that it will win the election. The source 
says that the initial dialogue has been taking place through the 
more mature officers. Lula's first contact with the officer 
class occurred at the start of the redemocratization process, 
when he spoke to students at the Army Command and Staff School. 
  The source recalls that his speech was arranged by generals, 
but that the generals encountered resistance precisely among the 
students (majors, lieutenants, and so on). Dialogue is 
continuing today, and it is not by chance that the PT is 
advocating changes in the constitutional area that are pleasing 
to the military. And it is prepared to quadruple the Armed 
Forces budget if it wins the election. It should be emphasized 
that the military have been very reserved in that dialogue.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guests Eloy Concepcion and Renato Recio of TRABAJADORES 
newspaper -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Garcia] As you know, some 80,000 meetings must be 
held throughout the country, but the main points that prevail in 
all these meetings are the people's willingness to work and the 
desire to solve many problems, namely at the grassroots level. 
  [Recio] The subject we are to discuss today is very 
important, and people are talking about it on the streets. It is 
a topic on the streets because it refers to crucial problems, 
problems that people are experiencing on a day-to-day basis. 
These problems are also reflected in the workers' parliaments. 
And, of course, there are people on the street who ask whether 
these meetings are useful, important, or necessary. 
  Some people would answer, no. Many feel that the parliaments 
are too formal, that they will not solve current problems, that 
this is a matter to be dealt with by economists. There are 
people who think that economic problems are technical, 
scientific problems, and listening to the people's opinions has 
no practical value. Of course, I do not agree with those ideas. 
  [Garcia] What do you think, Eloy Concepcion? 
  [Concepcion] I think these meetings are extremely useful. I 
think these meetings are unique; they are not held anywhere else 
in the world. And I say this is unique because the workers' 
parliaments represent an opportunity for the workers to express 
their opinions on important issues in the country, but mainly 
because they are an opportunity to put the house in order. I 
think the parliaments at the work places must have as the first 
point on their agenda -- I remember attending one parliament and 
it did have this on the agenda -- the analysis of problems 
specific to that area, such as productivity, use of work time, 
theft of products, use of resources, etc. Workers must meet to 
discuss their local problems, that is, to become aware of 
existing problems and of those they can solve without waiting 
for national measures. I think this is sufficient reason to hold 
the parliaments. 
  [Garcia] What conditions are necessary for the development 
of 
these parliaments, to be what people really want them to be? 
  [Recio] The first desire is to discuss internal problems, 
and 
this perhaps is the most important aspect of the meetings. The 
other aspect is that the assessment of problems of the economy 
by the workers in general is extremely important. Not only to 
fulfill a formal obligation, and not to comply with a compulsory 
practice, a theoretical practice by inexpert people dealing 
wilth a complex matter, but because they must be protagonists of 
any change. 
  The problems of a country such as Cuba, within a society of 
workers, will not be solved by three, four, five, or six 
formulas, or even by 10 technical formulas. That is to say, the 
Cuban problem will not be solved by economists alone, although 
they should be solved by economists. We cannot underestimate the 
role of economic science, nor can we can overestimate it to a 
point of taking it as the only view. The problem consists of 
achieving a balance between the economy and politics, because 
our system will never be an exclusively efficient system. 
Efficiency must be combined with justice -- efficiency with 
equity -- and to achieve justice, the workers must be present, 
not only for the distribution of wealth but also for an exchange 
of ideas. 
  [Concepcion] I agree with Recio on the first point: The 
parliaments are to discuss internal problems. I recently 
attended a parliament on Plan Six, referring to citrus fruits. I 
thought then that these meetings should be better organized and 
structured, because the administration's report is important. 
That is, these parliaments constitute essential economic 
training schools for workers. I would call them that. I think 
that the administrative report must be structured in such a 
manner that all the workers have in their hands the elements 
they have never before had. In this parliament I attended, the 
workers learned that last year there was a loss of 200 [words 
indistinct]. Well then, the analysis should focus on the loss. 
An important element broght to the workers' attention was that 
in 1993 some 10,000 quintales of oranges, tangerines, and lemons 
were stolen and taken to the black market. The workers, 
themselves, said: In Havana, or in this or that town, tangerines 
were lost because they were stolen. The other important issue is 
that not only the administration is to blame for this. 
  I think there are three main factors that must be analyzed. 
With a certain degree of complacence, I noted that there are 
three factors: the administration, the union, and the workers. 
We often talk about the lack of organization at work, or about 
inefficiency, or misuse of labor hours, or even theft. The 
workers, the union organizations, and the administration 
officials are aware of what is going on; but they often just 
acknowledge and try to coexist with indiscipline. 
  [Garcia] Concepcion, you mentioned an experience you had 
when 
you attended a parliament. I believe Recio also attended some 
parliaments; he might also like to tell us his experience or 
some anecdotes. 
  [Recio] I also agree with Concepcion when he says that this 
is a good economic training school for workers. I fully agree 
with that and I would add, not only for workers but for the 
workers' leaders, for economic and political leaders, and for 
everyone. As you said, there are three factors: the 
administration, the union, and the workers. They often see 
negative things but they do not change the course of events, 
perhaps because of a total lack of action or because of 
ignorance, because people cannot see the significance of all 
this, because the economic process is very complex. 
  We decided on a given economy for reasons I cannot outline 
now because it would take too long. This economy is based on 
material production, but it does not take into account the 
financial aspect, that is, that which has to do with costs, 
prices, profit possibilities, the budget, money circulation, 
etc. We have been practically negative in this aspect. We have 
practically overlooked it. We have failed to train the people. 
Then what happens? The first to take economic classes, in 
addition to workers, are the administrative board members 
because it is important for them to take these classes. The 
administration must have an objective, and that objective must 
be not only to produce, but to produce at the lowest possible 
cost. That is basic. But it is not done. For instance, when 
products are stolen, it affects the cost and production. If 
expenditures are not well accounted for, how can you find out 
the costs? 
  [Garcia] We are looking for points of agreement on the need 
for these parliamants, but we also wonder what the parliaments 
offer in the end. 
  [Concepcion] I think the parliaments must first adopt a plan 
of concrete and not general measures. I attended a parliament 
where I repeatedly heard worn out, obsolete words like 
eliminating this or that, organizing work, reducing subsidy, 
increasing production, promoting this or that, etc. These words 
in practice do not say anything. I think the plan of measures 
must be concrete, realistic, and with names. That is, 
productivity must be increased and to increase production we 
must do this and that, and Mr. So-and-so will do this and this, 
and John Doe will do this and that, because when the clock 
strikes five in the afternoon the workers leave, no matter what. 
In this case, the brigade that has not yet completed its task 
must remain until it finishes. These are concrete measures that 
must be adopted because, otherwise, the parliament will remain 
with its generalizations and theories, without achieving 
anything concrete. I do not know whether Recio agrees with me, 
but the country's economy will be saved to the extent that we 
save it in each worker's center. 
  [Garcia] Motivation is good. I think these meetings can 
motivate workers, create an environment favorable to increase 
production, to solve the problems at the grassroots, so that the 
companies, as Recio said, will be more profitable, so that costs 
will be reflected in prices, and so that workers may also be 
aware of what their centers can contribute to the development of 
the nation. 
  [Recio] I want to insist on this point: Not only the workers 
must be motivated, but the workers' leaders, as well. We must 
talk straight here. There are leaders who do not care about 
these problems, who do not lead anyone, and who do not discuss 
anything. And the workers must also demand that their leaders 
become more demanding. Because if the Cuban economy fails, who 
will suffer the consequences? 
  [Garcia, Recio] The people, the workers. 
  [Recio] And if something must be done and is not done, who 
will suffer the consequences? The people, the workers. And we 
workers are the owners here. This society was created for us, 
and we must show this ownership. 
  [Garcia] A brief summary, please, Concepcion, because our 
time has ended. 
  [Concepcion] In sum, we can say that following these 
problems 
of leaders and workers, we all belong to the same human group. 
We are workers, although we play different roles. The essence is 
that workers who are directly working the land or driving their 
machines must discuss their roles as workers, and the leaders 
must guide them well, using rational and logical economic 
measures. This is the objective and the goal of the parliaments.

  [Text] The new year of training for the Western Army began 
here in the presence of Army General Raul Castro, Minister of 
the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces]. The ceremony took place at 
the Playa Giron Air Brigade located in San Antonio de los Banos. 
  The Western Army's main objectives during the current 
training period will be: maintaining a high level of training 
and readiness; increasing the troops' self-sufficiency, 
supported by an intensive nutrition program; continuing the 
weapons and techniques preparedness program; and continuing to 
refurbish the theater of military operations. 
  During the ceremony, the defenders of the western territory 
ratified their decision to fight resolutely to achieve the title 
of best FAR command in 1995.

  [Text] The attractiveness of a city -- Trinidad -- which 
holds the title of mankind's patrimony was observed first hand 
by Politburo member Osmani Cienfuegos Gorriaran. The importance 
of Trinidad's tourism hub increases each year, not only by the 
growth in its capacity but by the wealth and beauty of its 
facilities. 
  Osmani Cienfuegos was accompanied by Jorge Valdez Rodriguez, 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in the region, 
and other PCC and government officials. The Politburo member was 
briefed on prospects for tourism development in Trinidad and 
asked about the thoroughness of studies conducted to guarantee 
the success of the new investments. 
  Osmani Cienfuegos also participated in the inauguration of 
the Santa Ana Foundation multipurpose center, built from a 
150-year-old former prison by a specialized brigade of the 
People's Government. The facility, which will be used for 
international tourism in a effort to develop the economy, has a 
restaurant, cafeteria, two bars, Comintur stores, and facilities 
for pottery and handicraft sales. Folk shows and other 
activities will be held at the main square, which can hold 150 
persons.

<F P=106> [Report by Susana del Calvo; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Havana workers' parliament has just been held 
and we will now speak with Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister 
president of the State Committee for Finance, who refers to the 
budget deficit. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] Generally speaking, the country, 
as well as Havana Province, should substantially reduce its 
budget deficit -- particularly at the national level -- this 
year. However, a certain level of deficit will nevertheless 
prevail because we cannot possibly reduce last year's figure, 
meaning $4.2 billion, to zero in a single year. The government 
has yet to approve the budget but we will have a deficit. 
  Generally speaking, the measures adopted in the assembly to 
reduce the deficit have a lot in common with what is being done 
in the rest of the country. The measures are mainly aimed at 
reducing subsidies to the enterprises, which is one of the 
essential elements of the country's deficit, and seeking a 
greater effectiveness in the production sector. This is a 
short-term element on which work can be readily carried out to 
cut losses, increase reliability, and achieve profits -- as much 
as possible -- in enterprises that are currently unprofitable. 
[end recording] 
  Workers propose measures during the parliaments. Some of the 
measures will be popular but others will not. Jose Luis 
Rodriguez refers to these measures: 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] Certainly, as we have explained, 
the National Assembly of the People's Government is trying to 
adopt a series of measures that, although they will strive not 
to leave unprotected any citizen in the country, certain 
measures imply -- as our commander in chief explained -- 
sacrifices for the population. The people should rest assured 
the measures will be implemented with the greatest criteria of 
social justice possible and they will bear in mind the working 
people's interests. They will also include measures against 
those who violate the working people's interests. [end recording] 
  The consultation with the Cuban workers, called the workers' 
parliament, will end on 15 March.

<F P=106> ["Report" by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Given a situation where shortages are widespread and 
increasing the level of efficiency in all economic sectors is 
urgent, Cubans support the immediate implementation of measures 
agreed upon in each workplace in order to reduce costs, be more 
cost-efficient, and better manage resources to increase 
production. 
  Over 3 million Cubans are currently participating in 
discussions promoted by the unions in an attempt to find 
solutions to various problems that hinder the efficiency of each 
workplace and affect the country's financial reorganization. 
  According to the Center for Social-Political Studies and 
Research [Centro de Estudios Socio-Politicos y de Opinion], 
which conducted a poll among 1,300 workers, the leading topic 
discussed in the meetings held thus far is labor efficiency. In 
response to a call by the union leadership, the main concern of 
Cuban workers has been to find a formula to produce more 
efficiently given the availability of enough raw materials, 
fuels, and production equipment. 
  During the meetings on economic issues called by the unions, 
the participants have contributed many ideas, recommendations, 
and useful reflections on how to face the management problem. 
According to official figures, only 31 percent of Cuban 
enterprises are profitable due to primarily external factors 
linked to the loss of Cuba's traditional partners in the 
vanished socialist sphere and the intensification of the U.S. 
blockade. 
  However, other factors are involved in this situation, 
namely 
an inefficiency accumulated over many years, a lack of concern 
regarding costs, expenditures, and the balance between earnings 
and expenditures as well as a poor resource-management. The 
Cuban economy needs to place greater emphasis on all these 
aspects and to that effect, the current meetings come in very 
handy. In these meetings, both workers and administrative 
leaders examine thoroughly the best ways to eradicate 
inefficiency. What constitutes one of the most pressing tasks 
is to implement the agreements fully in order to eradicate 
inefficiency, without waiting for the measures that will soon be 
approved by the Cuban Parliament to reorganize the country's 
finances.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 15 
February. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 12 February reports that the 
Cienfuegos spring sugarcane plan calls for planting 66 
caballerias in February. The radio also says that the weeding of 
cane lands needs to be increased at Cienfuegos' 12 
agroindustrial complexes, because "at the end of January, only 
48 percent of the planned weeding had been accomplished." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 12 February reports that the 
order placed with the 20th Anniversary of the Triumph of the 
Revolution factory for 75,000 batteries for use during the 
current sugar harvest has been met. "This factory, the only one 
of its kind in the nation, is located in Manzanillo." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 12 February reports that Cubana 
de Aviacion serves Cuba's nine tourist hubs. "The Cuban Civil 
Aeronautics Institute, IACC, is cooperating in the nation's 
effort to receive 1 million foreign vacationers in the short 
term, and have its aircraft and installations offer these 
visitors quality service," announced Division General Rogelio 
Acevedo, president of the IACC, upon inaugurating the remodeled 
Maximo Gomez terminal in Ciego de Avila Province, which was 
expanded at a cost of 10 million pesos and services several 
international routes by which tourists arrive at hotels and 
villas on the cays along Cuba's north coast. 
  Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 13 February notes that Cuba and 
Jamaica have established a maritime link "for trade and tourist 
purposes. The cities of Port Antonio and Santiago de Cuba, 
separated by 77 km, are linked by a trip of just seven hours. 
This will allow a greater number of vacationers to travel 
between the two islands. This link is also aimed at developing 
multidestination programs aimed at meeting the needs of the 
European, Canadian, and Latin American markets, and making a 
reality the Cuban and Jamaican desire to consolidate economic 
and tourism relations." This link was begun with the ferry 
Caribbean Queen [Reina del Caribe], operated by the 
Inter-Caribbean [Inter-Caribe] company, "whose basic activity is 
related to cruises, in conjunction with hotel enterprises. The 
ship carries 128 passengers, and the fact that it is 
first-class, economically advantageous, and has reasonable 
prices and onboard services satisfies the traveler's 
requirements. The tourist package is broader, however. Santiago 
de Cuba offers the enchantment of its history, hospitality, sun, 
culture, and autocthonous folklore, that mix of ethnicities and 
races that have merged into a particular idiosyncrasy. Options 
range from hotels, beaches, and nightclubs under the stars to 
trips to other Cuban cities. There are also prospects cropping 
up for achieving a greater presence of Cuban products in Jamaica 
and vice versa, which creates a favorable atmosphere for 
developing cooperative investments based on the potential the 
industry of the biggest island of the Antilles offers the 
market. Geographical proximity, cultural affinity, and good will 
nourish the interest in consolidating the tourist industry by 
connecting these Caribbean islands." 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 14 
February report that the latex factory in Las Tunas is 
manufacturing gloves for use in the sugar harvest. During the 
first stage that will end in April, the factory will produce 
225,000 pairs of acid-proof gloves. This factory, which belongs 
to the Las Tunas Ceramics Enterprise, also produces vaginas for 
artificial insemination, and will soon begin manufacturing 
protective gloves for work with laboratory animals. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 14 
February add that three new generators were installed at the 
Camaguey sugar mill to increase the supply of power to the 
country and the production centers. 
  Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 15 February reports that the 26 
de 
Julio cane cooperative in Havana is stressing cane recovery and 
that "only 20 of the 90 caballerias of cane available will be 
cut this year." Leonardo Gonzalez, the cooperative's president, 
said the disease that stunts growth has been reduced to a 
minimum in the group's fields through intense fertilization with 
ammonia and thorough weeding.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Sergio Corrieri, the president of the Cuban Institute of 
Friendship With the People, has announced that Cuba has received 
approximately $50 million in donations through his organization. 
Donations were mainly in the form of powdered milk, school 
supplies, and medicine. Aid came from 72 countries, but more 
than the value of the merchandise itself, Corrieri stressed that 
it is the aid's "symbolism" that matters. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
2146 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  The Central Drilling and Extraction Enterprise has reported 
record production for the month of January. The company pumped 
113,346 tons of crude oil of its annual goal of 888,000 tons. 
The year's total nationwide projection is for the production of 
1.2 million tons of crude, 100,000 tons greater than last year. 
Meanwhile, the government has opened bidding in Great Britain 
and Canada to allocate drilling rights for several offshore and 
inland sights. The British Premier Corp. will explore 2,990 km 
and the French Geopetrol company will explore 1,600 km.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  The Honduran Government announced a new lempira devaluation 
today, two weeks after President Carlos Roberto Reina's 
inauguration. Finance Minister Juan Ferrera disclosed the 
official exchange rate will go from 6.20 to 7.27 lempiras per 
dollar, effective 15 February. The name the Honduran Government 
is giving the monetary changes is the customs compensation 
factor [Factor de Valoracion Aduanera] for the implementation of 
duties within import and export tariffs and other tax schedules. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1753 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  Central Bank President Hugo Noe Pino disclosed today the 
Rafael Callejas administration, which ended on 27 January, left 
a "dreadful" 10.6-percent fiscal deficit. Pino told the media 
it is untrue the Callejas administration left a deficit of 
between 7 and 8 percent, as he announced prior to leaving 
office. President Carlos Roberto Reina and four IMF experts 
began to analyze the country's economic situation this week. 
Honduras pays between $400 million and $450 million for its 
foreign debt per year, a total that amounts to 40 percent of the 
budget. Pino said the country's deficit amounts to 
approximately 2.3 billion lempiras (about $371 million), adding 
such a figure "is dreadful and unmanageable" (Panama City ACAN 
in Spanish 1833 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  The Economic Cabinet, consisting of Guillermo Bueso, Central 
Bank President Hugo Noe Pino, and Finance Minister Juan Ferrera, 
warned this weekend the people should brace themselves, because 
there will be currency devaluations every month. This is within 
a plan by macroeconomic strategists who seek to close the fiscal 
gap. (Tegucigalpa EL HERALDO in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p3) 
  According to the Honduran Central Bank Economic Studies 
Department, the wholesalers price index registered a 1.9-percent 
growth during the last quarter of 1993. It adds during all of 
1993 the wholesalers price index increased an average of 12.7 
percent more than the 10.1 percent of 1992. (San Pedro Sula LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p3) 
  According to the National Plan for Human Development, there 
is a deficit in the housing sector in view of the increasing 
demand and high housing costs. Statistics supplied by the 
Honduran Chamber of the Construction Industry show the housing 
sector reached 11.3 percent in December 1993. (San Pedro Sula 
TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Feb 94 p2) 
  The Economic Cabinet, headed by Central Bank President Hugo 
Noe Pino, met with a delegation of the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) On 14 February to assess IDB projects and 
learn about the new government's priorities. IDB representative 
Federico Alvarez explained this delegation will not establish 
investment or support programs, but that it is a job the 
Programming Commission will do. For his part, Planning Secretary 
Guillermo Molina said the projects portfolio is being reviewed 
to redefine the new government's priorities and aim them at the 
social sector, particularly the effort to fight poverty.

  [Text] Roberto Escobar Garcia, presidential candidate for 
the PCN [National Conciliation Party], warned Salvadorans of a 
possible Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) attack 
on the electoral system. "I am definitely warning the Salvadoran 
people because we cannot trust the left-wing," asserted the 
presidential candidate. 
  At the same time, Escobar Garcia also denounced the 
left-wing's pressures on the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], 
both internally and externally. He mentioned that the Electoral 
Code was reformed because of those left-wing pressures to allow 
them to enter Departmental and Municipal Electoral Boards in a 
proportion that does not correspond to them. Furthermore, 
because of those same left-wing pressures, other provisions and 
mechanisms of the Electoral Code have been revised. 
  According to the candidate, that is a form of blocking and 
disparaging the electoral process "with easily discernible 
intentions." According to the politician, the TSE "prefers to 
please the leftists in an effort to maintain the prestige of the 
Salvadoran electoral process." 
  He advised, however, that as the left-wing begins to feel 
defeated and realizes it has no support, it will attack the 
electoral system for any reason, real or imagined. He added that 
the pressures "are fabricated here and bolstered abroad. Later, 
the conditions, specially from the United States and Europe, 
come to El Salvador." He regretted this fact, and reiterated 
that the left-wing immediately goes abroad to complain to the 
U.S. Government or the Europeans about any little thing that 
could be solved here. In this regard, Escobar Garcia asked the 
left-wing to show "more loyalty for the electoral process, for 
democracy, and for the Salvadoran people. This is no way to 
collaborate with democracy, but it is a way to destroy it," he 
said. 
  In spite of everything, he continued, "the people must not 
be 
skeptical or pessimistic because the Salvadoran right-wing 
clearly understands the FMLN's strategy." Furthermore, he 
asserted that "the PCN is willing to defend the system and fight 
within the law so our rights and those of the citizens are 
guaranteed." 
  Colonel Escobar Garcia stated this shortly after receiving 
the general secretariat of the PCN from Hernan Contreras, whom 
he said had done "an excellent job." He used the same general 
terms to describe the work of the TSE, whose work has been 
recognized nationally and abroad, and also "by Augusto Ramirez 
Ocampo, chief of ONUSAL [UN Observers for El Salvador] himself." 
  He also said other organizations have claimed that the TSE 
has a very reliable electoral process, something which other 
countries that claim their democratic system is more advanced 
wished they had.

  [Text] Managua, 15 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Tuesday, 
Nicaraguan Police arrested a young man identified as Giovanni 
Alejandro Gonzalez. He is the main suspect in the murder of 
Perfecto Gutierrez, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party (PSD), which occurred in Managua last night. According to 
police, the suspect, also known by the nickname "Gasparin," is 
approximately 16 years old and has a criminal record. 
  Up to now, neither the government nor the main political 
parties in the country, including the Sandinists, have condemned 
the murder of Gutierrez, who was 36 years old, married, and had 
three children. The politician, who was also an alternate PSD 
deputy -- one of the seven parties in the National Opposition 
Union -- was hit by two bullets and killed when, while 
accompanied by a young woman, he was parking his vehicle near a 
school in the center of Managua. 
  Nicaraguan Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar told 
reporters "the crime is being investigated," and advanced the 
theory that "everything seems to indicate" it was a common 
crime. "It seems the reason for the crime was theft," Deputy 
Minister Cesar stated. Cesar also belongs to the PSD, where 
Gutierrez was the secretary general. 
  At noon today, the National Assembly paid posthumous homage 
to the alternate legislator who was murdered last night, and 
demanded that authorities solve the case. Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, 
PSD president and deputy, stated: "We have not dismissed the 
possibility that Gutierrez was murdered for political reasons." 
  Jarquin and Gutierrez assumed the PSD presidency and 
secretary general's positions, respectively, after a PSD 
disciplinary court suspended Guillermo Potoy and Alfredo Cesar, 
respectively, from those posts. 
  Adolfo Jarquin heads the social democrat sector that favors 
constitutional reforms in the parliament. Potoy and Cesar head 
the faction that demands a constituent assembly. These 
differences in the PSD caused a schism between Nicaraguan social 
democrats. Leaflets have even appeared in Managua and other 
Nicaraguan cities recently wherein alleged "recontras" (rearmed 
former contras) accuse Jarquin's sector of being traitors.

<F P=106> [Article by Roberto Orozco B. and Roger Suarez M.] </F>
  [Text] The 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80] is demanding the 
presence of poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra [LA PRENSA director] and 
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, or one of his representatives, 
in the demobilization talks to be held with the government, 
"Chacalin" [Salvador Talavera], who leads the armed men, told LA 
PRENSA today. 
  A meeting has been scheduled for today between FN 3-80 
members and CIAV [International Support and Verification 
Commission]-OAS representatives. The meeting site and time will 
be agreed upon this morning. 
  Certain media versions are indicating the peace talks could 
be held in El Naranjo, Nueva Segovia Department. 
  The rebel leader know as "Martin Negro" [not further 
identified] has said they will present a nine-point document to 
be broached during the upcoming talks with the government. 
  He disclosed discreetly that among the petitions are the 
withdrawal of Army forces, the presence of Pablo Antonio Cuadra 
and Cardinal Obando y Bravo in the talks, and the delimitation 
of areas that could serve as enclaves. 
  Sergio Caramagna, CIAV-OAS chief in Managua, has said the 
presence of Army troops near the facility in which the 
negotiations are to be held could hinder the talks. 
  There is a tense calm particularly in the northern part of 
the country due to the deployment of Army troops since last 
weekend after an armed group led by "El Gato" [Francisco Rivera] 
ambushed a Land Cruiser belonging to Marcial Sevilla Garcia, a 
coffee producer. Police Officers Raul Palacio Navarrete, Rene 
Antonio Garcia, Holman Zelaya, and Denis Gutierrez were also 
riding in the vehicle. 
  One of the police officers died on 11 February, and Marcial 
Sevilla died the night of 13 February at Manolo Morales Aviles 
Hospital. 
  An FN 3-80 version says the police officers opened fire 
first 
against "El Gato's" men, who were in a house in the hamlet of 
Buena Vista, Somoto Municipality. 
  Despite what occurred, the FN 3-80 leaders appeared willing 
to negotiate their disarmament, citing their personal security 
as the main condition.

<F P=106> [Report by special AFP correspondent Lidia Hunter] </F>
  [Text] El Rosario, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Rebel leaders and 
members of a mission of international observers and the Catholic 
Church have stressed the success of a meeting held Tuesday to 
begin the disarmament process of the 3-80 Northern Front, 
Nicaragua's principal armed group. 
  The meeting between guerrilla leaders and representatives of 
the peace mission, which consists of representatives of the 
International Support and Verification Commission of the OAS 
(CIAV-OAS) and the Catholic Church, took place in El Rosario, a 
village in Nueva Segovia Department in the northern part of the 
country, 2 km south of the Nicaraguan-Honduran border. 
  Both parties confirmed Army chief Humberto Ortega sent the 
rebels a message that presumably established the terms for their 
demobilization and subsequent integration into civilian life. 
The content of the document was not revealed to the press, 
however. 
  For its part, the 3-80 Northern Front gave the CIAV a 
document with its demands which consists basically of guarantees 
for physical security for the disarmament process. 
  The Peace Commission will give the document to the 
government. A new meeting will then be called on an as yet 
unspecified date, CIAV representative Sergio Caramanga has 
explained. 
  Both the Army and rebels have maintained a unilateral truce 
since last week to pave the way for the disarmament talks. 
  Caramagna said at the end of the meeting the objective of 
"exchanging proposals" had been achieved. 
  Esteban Talavera, one of the rebel leaders, said the 
participation in the talks of the 3-80 Northern Front's foremost 
leader, his brother Jose Angel Talavera, alias Chacal, was 
impeded by the strong presence of military troops in the region. 
  According to him, approximately 120 special Army troops were 
deployed to the region in the past few hours. This prevented 
Chacal from reaching the area. It is believed Chacal is in a 
region bordering Honduran territory. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front leaders reiterated their readiness 
to 
disarm without the political conditions they had established 
several months ago, including the resignation of Army chief 
Humberto Ortega and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo. 
  "We will insist on these demands in a civic struggle, 
because 
the political climate has improved in Nicaragua," Esteban 
Talavera said. As a goodwill gesture, Talavera released a 
soldier who was captured several days ago in fighting with the 
Army.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  The Augusto Cesar Sandino Foundation (FACS) has announced 
the 
establishment of an $18 million revolving fund to promote 
development, create employment, and help the extremely poor 
become self-sufficient. The announcement was made by FACS 
President Edwin Zablah. Zablah added that 75 percent of the 
funds will be used to help Nicaraguan rural sectors. The 
programs promoted by the FACS are supported by organizations in 
Belgium, Canada, Norway, Australian, the UK, Denmark, New 
Zealand, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United States. 
(Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 4) 
  The Central American Bank of Economic Integration has made 
22 
million cordobas available to the Nicaraguan coffee growers to 
bolster the coffee industry. (Managua Radio Nicaragua Network in 
Spanish 1100 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  National Coffee Commission President David Robleto Lang has 
told BARRICADA that the nation's coffee growers will fall short 
of their goal of producing 1.1 million quintals of coffee in 
1994. Lack of funding and the situation in the northern region 
of the country will be contributing factors. Agricultural and 
Livestock Minister Roberto Rondon primarily blames the drop in 
coffee production on heavy rains; however, he does admit that a 
lack of funding is also a contributing factor. (Managua 
BARRICADA in Spanish 19 Feb 94 pp 1, 10) 
  The Nicaraguan Government's payroll will be reduced 
considerably in 1994. This was announced by Deputy Finance 
Minister Mirna Somarriba. The government plans to cut back jobs 
in areas such as public services. The cutbacks will affect 
approximately 9,000 workers. Several trade unions are opposing 
the reductions. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1540 GMT 13 Feb 94) 
  The Nicaraguan Government has defended the indefinite 
closure 
of its commercial borders to Costa Rican milk products because 
of Costa Rica's delay in granting sale permits for Nicaraguan 
rice. The decision was announced by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Jose Pallais. The closure of the commercial borders occurred on 
27 January. Nicaragua buys approximately $400,000 a month in 
Costa Rican milk products. Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Trade 
Minister Roberto Rojas said that the granting of permits for the 
import of Nicaraguan rice is the responsibility of the Costa 
Rican private sector. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0007 GMT

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Panama Stock Market Manager Roberto Brenes has disclosed to 
LA PRENSA that transactions on the domestic stock market 
amounted to approximately $203 million in 1993. Brenes 
explained that this figure surpassed expectations by more than 
$50 million. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 11A) 
  In its preliminary assessment of regional economies, the 
Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) reported that 
during 1993, Panama maintained its trend toward growth (5.5 
percent) but at a slower pace than in the previous two years. 
According to the report, Panama's economic expansion was 
attributed to active investments and, to a lesser extent, on 
consumption which showed a moderate increase. The construction 
sector registered a growth of nearly 40 percent. Farm 
production dropped because of a reduction in the harvest of 
plantains, sugar, and tobacco. The ECLA report added that 
unemployment dropped from 13.6 percent in 1992 to 12.4 in 1993. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 11A) 
  Agricultural Development Minister Cesar Pereira Burgos has 
reiterated that the closing of silos to the Melo, Fidanque, and 
Toledano poultry firms for an indefinite period of time is due 
to their alleged illegal import of 50,000 quintals of corn from 
the United States. Last Monday, President Guillermo Endara 
expressed disagreement with this corn import, ordered the 
closing of the silos, and banned the unloading of soy beans from 
a ship that docked at Balboa port. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 2A) 
  A Canadian-Panamanian mining consortium will invest more 
than 
$300 million in the exploitation of a "polymetallic" mine whose 
reserves are estimated at $20 billion. Such a project will 
generate more than 3,200 direct jobs during its full period of 
activity. The Cerro Petaquillaa project, located in Colon 
Province, is in the exploration process and is being carried out 
by Minamerica Corp. jointly with Adrian Resources Ltd. of 
Ontario, Canada. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1548 GMT 13 Feb

  [Text] San Jose, 14 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican President 
Rafael Angel Calderon said today that his government is still 
standing firmly behind Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus' candidacy 
for the OAS secretary generalship. 
  He concurrently warned that Washington may eventually exert 
pressure on the small countries that support Costa Rica's top 
diplomat. "My government will not withdraw or change Niehaus' 
candidacy under any circumstance," added Calderon, recalling 
that he had rejected a request from Mexico that he seek the 
position. 
  Calderon said he has not received any information to the 
effect that the United States, which supports Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, is exerting pressure on small countries 
to force them to withdraw their support for Niehaus, a 
52-year-old expert in international relations. "If pressure was 
exerted we would denounce it and all the countries on the 
continent would regret it," Calderon said. 
  The president made these remarks in response to questions 
concerning reports of an alleged weakening of Niehaus' candidacy 
in light of the emergence of Gaviria, whose nomination is not 
official as yet. Meanwhile, Fernando Naranjo, a ranking 
spokesman for the social democratic National Liberation Party 
(PLN), who has been mentioned as the next foreign minister, 
spoke today in favor of Niehaus' nomination. 
  Local newspapers have suggested over the past few days that 
support for the Costa Rican foreign minister is deteriorating. 
Within the framework of these rumors, several names were 
mentioned, including that of Oscar Arias, a former president and 
Nobel Peace Prize winner; Sonia Picado, a judge at the 
Inter-American Human Rights Court; Gonzalo Facio, the Costa 
Rican ambassador to Washington; and former Foreign Minister 
Rodrigo Madrigal as possible alternatives for Costa Rica in the 
event of Niehaus' withdrawal. 
  Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said shortly 
before the 6 February elections that his government would 
support the current foreign minister. 
  Meanwhile, President Calderon announced that Niehaus today 
initiated a tour of Caribbean nations to confirm the support 
offered to him by 13 nations in that region. The foreign 
minister claims to have 23 votes, five more than are needed to 
win the position in the first round, which is scheduled for 27 
March. Niehaus asserts that he is the leader of a Central 
American candidacy and believes that it would only be fair for 
this area to have an OAS secretary general because thus far all 
of the secretaries have been from large South American 
countries. The principle of rotation must be observed, he 
recently asserted during an interview granted to DPA.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin revealed today that Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria has enough support to obtain the OAS 
secretary general position if the president decides to run for 
it. 
  During an informal talk with reporters following her meeting 
with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is on a two-day 
official visit to Colombia, Sanin said she had no doubts that 
Gaviria would win if he decided to present his candidacy to head 
the continental forum right now. 
  The minister, who, with this objective, has been carrying 
out 
intensive contacts with the Caribbean countries and at the OAS 
headquarters itself, asserted that Gaviria's possible candidacy 
is seen with approval and has received the backing of several 
governments. Sanin did not specify the countries that would 
support the possible candidacy of the Colombian president, whose 
government ends on 7 August. 
  The foreign minister's disclosure is not an official 
announcement of President Gaviria's candidacy for the OAS 
secretary generalship. According to an official communique, 
which was issued on Sunday, the Colombian president has still 
not decided if he will run for this position and will announce 
his decision in the forthcoming days. 
  If Gaviria decides to run, he must confront Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Neihaus, who is the strongest candidate 
for the position up to now. Furthermore, Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has also presented his name for 
consideration by the 34 OAS member states. 
  The U.S. Government is a proponent of the Colombian 
president's possible candidacy and, according to reports, 
Argentina, Peru, and Mexico also back Gaviria. Precisely, the 
Peruvian president admitted his support for the Colombian 
president to reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota.

  [Text] San Jose, 15 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus is visiting St. Lucia, Guyana, and 
Grenada in the Caribbean to confirm the support these nations 
have given to his candidacy as the new OAS secretary general. 
  Official sources reported today on the "unexpected" visit 
and 
noted Niehaus was already on the island of St. Lucia and is 
currently in Guyana from where he will fly to Grenada. 
According to some news reports, Niehaus' visit is related to 
the pressure the United States is exerting on some Caribbean 
countries to withdraw their pledge to support the Costa Rican 
foreign minister. 
  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon said today "it 
would be regrettable" if the United States were trying to 
pressure the countries of Central America and the Caribbean to 
withdraw their support for Niehaus. The head of state added 
that Niehaus is most likely going to have to vie for this post 
with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, "who has the backing of 
the United States." Calderon reiterated his government's 
endorsement of Niehaus, who is ready to go "to the end" on this 
matter, he stressed. 
  Bernd Niehaus has been saying for some weeks he has the 
majority of votes needed to win the post of secretary general on 
28 March and replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares, since he has 
the backing of all the countries of the Caribbean and Central 
America, and some South American countries. 
  Cesar Gaviria's candidacy, which the Colombian president has 
not officially announced, has the backing of the United States, 
Mexico, and Brazil, among other big countries, according to news 
reports. 
  Before returning to Costa Rica, Foreign Minister Niehaus 
will 
go to Mexico to participate in a seminar on poverty in Latin 
America sponsored by the OAS.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 15 Feb (DPA) -- 
In the past few hours, Chiapas peasants have occupied several 
ranches and a municipal mayor's office, within the framework of 
growing social unrest which is shaking this state of 
southeastern Mexico, the locale of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] guerrilla revolt since 1 January. 
  Members of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization 
(Organizacion Campesina Emiliano Zapata--OCEZ), who belong to 
the pro-government Ayala Plan National Coordinating Board 
(OCEZ/CNPA), occupied the mayor's office in Chanal Municipality, 
and demanded the dismissal of local authorities who they claim 
are corrupt. 
  Peasants and town residents have occupied another eight 
mayor 
offices in Chiapas for over a week. They are demanding the 
construction of public works or the dismissal of municipal 
authorities. 
  In Chilon, another Chiapas municipality, some 600 peasants 
peacefully occupied 18 farms encompassing 3,000 hectares. They 
are claiming property rights to the land, while the National 
Coordinating Board of Indian Peoples (Coordinadora Nacional de 
Pueblos Indios--CNPI) did the same thing on 11 farms 
encompassing 14,000 hectares in Bachajon. 
  Oscar Romeo Perez Cordova, a member of the Chilono Attorney 
General's Office, said he has received at least 18 complaints of 
land occupations from the land owners daily. 
  The CNPI declared, for its part, that the lands occupied in 
Bachajon belong to its members, who were stripped of their land 
by ranchers and cattlemen of the region. 
  The social unrest in Chiapas lies within the framework of 
the 
armed revolt of the EZLN, which in a recent communique urged the 
people to oust all the municipality mayors claiming they are 
illegitimate.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 15 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- 
Manuel Camacho Solis, the commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, announced today that the armed group 
in this southeastern Mexican state will suspend "charging a war 
tax" Thursday. 
  The self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army's decision 
to stop charging this "tax" where they are present, improves the 
climate for the first peace meeting with this group, Camacho 
Solis stated. The commissioner observed that this measure and 
the group's previous decision to release former Chiapas Governor 
Absalon Castellanos on Wednesday morning, indicates that the 
channels for dialogue remain open. "We are witnessing a new 
demonstration of their political will in favor of a true 
dialogue," said Camacho Solis, who has maintained communication 
with the armed groups through public and confidential messages 
since the second week of January. 
  On 2 January, the armed group kidnapped Castellanos 
Dominguez, forcing the Mexican Army to intervene one day after 
the conflict began in north central Chiapas, where the armed 
group violently seized several communities to present Indian 
demands. The clashes between the armed group and the Army were 
virtually suspended on 12 January, when President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari ordered a cease-fire and initiated efforts to further 
pacification and reconciliation. 
  In a communique distributed to the Chiapas residents in San 
Cristobal -- 1,200 km southeast of Mexico city -- the 
commissioner indicated that the suspension of the "tax" is an 
additional step in favor of the peace meeting. 
  Military authorities asserted on 11 February, that area 
residents, who were dislodged by the conflict, have charged that 
the rebels took all their animals, crops, and properties, and 
constantly harassed them, "because they refused to join" the 
armed group. 
  Camacho Solis said on Monday that the delegates appointed by 
the armed group for the direct dialogue are on their way to a 
meeting area from where they will be transferred by the 
International Red Cross to the center where the peace meeting 
will be held. 
  Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is the liaison between the 
commissioner and the armed group, said on Monday that the date 
and place of the first peace meeting will be announced Thursday.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On the evening of 10 February, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari replied to coffee growers' proposals, 
requests, and demands during a meeting to assess the 1993-94 
coffee harvest season and analyze proposals for the 1994-95 
season. After listening for an hour in the Carranza Room in Los 
Pinos Presidential Residence to the serious crisis coffee 
growers face because of drops in international coffee prices, 
Salinas announced 10 guidelines to help coffee growers: First, 
36 million new pesos will be earmarked to help low production 
zones; second, the National Solidarity Program [Pronasol] will 
transfer Inmecafe [Mexican Coffee Institute] facilities to 
coffee growers organizations; third, savings banks, guarantee 
funds, and credit unions will be revamped to increase their 
financing capacity; and fourth, all Inmecafe facilities 
transferred to coffee organizations will be registered within a 
month. President Salinas details the fifth measure: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Both the Pronasol Enterprise Fund 
and the National Finance Bank are ready. We are going to back 
up all projects if they are economically viable. [end recording] 
  The other measures are as follows: sixth, the National Rural 
Credit Bank will receive 100 million new pesos to grant farming 
credits and to restructure expired portfolios; seventh, the 
National Foreign Trade Bank will receive $200 million to help 
coffee exports; eighth, the Mexican Coffee Council [Consejo 
Mexicano del Cafe] will boost portfolio restructuring with 
private banks; ninth, coffee growers will be incorporated into 
the IMSS-Pronasol [Mexican Social Security Institute-Pronasol] 
program to improve their health conditions; and 10th, Salinas 
announced an additional non-budgetary offer: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We started out with 140 million 
new 
pesos. We are now ready to more than double these funds, which 
will amount to 333 million new pesos, to help coffee growers. 
[applause] [end recording] 
  President Salinas said that the solution to coffee growers' 
problems will be laid in a slow, yet different and profound 
process. 
  Arturo Jimenez from La Selva de Las Margaritas, Chiapas 
State; Jorge Aguilar from La Sierra Madre de Motozintla; Marcelo 
Herrera of the Independent Central Organization of Agricultural 
Workers and Peasants [Central Independiente de Obreros Agricolas 
y Campesinos]; Fernando Celiz of the Coordinating Board of 
Coffee Organizations [Coordinadora de Organizaciones de Cafe]; 
and Rafael Arellanes of the National Coffee Producers Union 
[Union Nacional de Productores de Cafe] were among the speakers.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Luis German Carcoba Garcia, the president of the Business 
Coordinating Council, has noted that "excessive surveillance 
along the border by U.S. immigration officials is a bothersome 
and delicate issue that violates human rights." He added, 
however, that the situation will not affect trade relations 
between the two countries. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  In an address to the Business Opportunities Seminar in 
Guadalajara, Gilberto Jimenez Garcia de Alba, the president of 
the National Council for Foreign Trade, said that exports of 
Mexico's nonpetroleum products increased 17 percent during 1993. 
He added that higher nonpetroleum exports, $15 billion in 
foreign investments, and overall price stability "confirm that 
we are on the right track." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0112 
GMT 11 Feb 94) 
  In a speech to the Business Opportunities Seminar in 
Guadalajara, Eugenio Carrion, the under secretary of commerce 
and industrial development, said Mexico has one of the most 
attractive markets in the world. He said proof of this was the 
record growth of many companies on the Mexican Stock Market. 
Companies such as Cifra, Gigante, and Comercial Mexicana 
registered growth of 14-24 percent. Mexico offers a stable 
economy, low inflation, and virtually no foreign debt, all of 
which attract investment. Carrion also said "Mexico can supply 
the U.S. Hispanic market," which spends about $230 billion a 
year, which is equivalent to 75 percent of Mexico's overall GNP. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2231 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Jaime Serra Puche, the secretary of commerce and industrial 
development, has said foreign investment surpassed $40 billion 
over the past five years. He met in Guadalajara with local and 
foreign business leaders and announced that investments meant an 
influx of capital totaling $15.6 billion during 1993 -- an 87 
percent increase over 1992. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Mexican crude oil prices increased in January, according to 
a 
report issued be Mexican Petroleum (Pemex). The report quotes 
Isthmian Light Crude at $12.95 a barrel, Maya Heavy at $10.15, 
and Olmeca Extra Light at $14.20. These three types showed 
export levels of 213,300, 807,600, and 313,800 barrels per day, 
respectively. Exports went mostly to the United States, while 
14.1 percent went to Spain and 4.4 percent went to the Middle 
East. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0026 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  Pedro Aspe Armella, the secretary of finance and public 
credit, says interest rates are continuing to fall. He called 
this a "memorable event, because rates on the money market have 
reached a single digit figure -- 9.75 percent." Meanwhile, 
consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in January. This is the 
smallest increase in 22 years. Officials pointed out that this 
is the first time the inflation rate fell below 1 percent for 
this time of year. The annual projection for consumer prices is 
set at 7.5 percent. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94)

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 February (NA) -- The national 
government will again seek to convince Cordoba Province Governor 
Eduardo Angeloz to sign the fiscal pact. The government will 
offer him the possibility of reactivating Cordoba's Military 
Aircraft Factory (FMA) through a substantial investment. 
  Apparently, the idea that Angeloz will finally agree to sign 
the pact became of paramount importance at the moment of 
defining which enterprise will be chosen within the framework of 
the bid opened by the Defense Ministry to modernize the 36 
Skyhawk A4M planes. 
  Although the Smith Industries company had signed a letter of 
intent (and already charged $3 million to replace hoses and 
repaint the 36 planes that had been idle in the Arizona desert), 
the U.S. Lockheed company was chosen. 
  The government chose this company in view of the financing 
it 
offered for the payment of the loan, which include two years 
grace and the possibility of having Argentine and U.S. experts 
repair 18 of the 36 planes at the factory in Cordoba. 
  As a result of this important investment at the Cordoba 
plant, Argentina will have more possibilities of winning the bid 
opened by the Vought company in the United States for the 
manufacture of the Pampa 2000 planes. 
  This is not improbable because the Vought lobby [preceding 
word in English] in Washington represents the interests of the 
U.S. Pratt and Whitney companies, as well as the well-known 
Allis Signal company. 
  AMBITO FINANCIERO published on 14 February that the Bell 
company is also interested in manufacturing helicopters in the 
facilities of Cordoba's FMA. Thus, a civilian-military 
aeronautic center of strategic importance for Latin America 
would be created in Cordoba. 
  The Air Force will not object to the participation of the 
Lockheed Aircraft company in the project because it will attract 
large benefits for the FMA. Initially, however, the Air Force 
favored the Smith Industries company in view of its work in New 
Zealand and Kuwait. 
  Furthermore, this will give the Argentine Government an 
excellent tool to convince Angeloz of the "advantages" that 
signing the fiscal pact would represent for Cordoba.

  [Excerpt] Cordoba, 14 Feb (NA) -- Cordoba Governor Eduardo 
Angeloz today confirmed that he wants to become a presidential 
candidate for the Radical Civic Union [UCR] in 1995 "if the 
party accepts it and if all the instrumental steps that I want 
to impose are accepted by the party." 
  Angeloz denied press reports in which he allegedly conveyed 
to President Carlos Menem his decision to give up his 
presidential candidacy. Angeloz explained: "This confusion is 
not good for our country or anyone. I am the one who, depending 
on my mood, will have to decide in due time if I feel like 
becoming a candidate." 
  Concerning the possibility that Senator Fernando de la Rua 
might actually become the UCR candidate, the governor said: "In 
due time we will see who is in a better position to represent 
the UCR." 
  Angeloz later stressed: "There will not be any internal rift 
within the UCR," although he admitted "the existence of acute, 
hard, and hostile disagreements. The party will remain 
unchanged." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 15 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez today reasserted his 
rejection of the creation of a Truth Commission to investigate 
human rights violations in the country, because it would seek 
"vengeance." 
  The chief of the Guatemalan Armed Forces (FAG) said in a 
news 
conference that, if an investigation is conducted on events that 
occurred throughout the armed conflict which lasted three 
decades, this would increase "social polarization" and divide 
society. The Army cannot accept that option "because it would 
not seek conciliation, nor would it be fair, because no 
sanctions would be imposed on guerrilla fighters involved in 
human rights violations," Enriquez added. He recalled that 
countries such as El Salvador and Argentina, where civilian 
groups sponsored the creation of Truth Commissions, are now 
paying a high cost. "People are being killed in the former even 
though the whole truth was not learned," he said. 
  The Mutual Support Group (GAM), made up of relatives of 
missing persons, said on Tuesday the most repressed groups in 
our society have the right to demand the creation of that 
commission. The GAM issued a communique stating this is a 
demand from 45,000 families whose loved ones were violently 
taken away. The communique said no Guatemalan should question 
the creation of a Truth Commission by arguing that no one is 
"free of sin" to demand an end to impunity and injustice. 
  Relatives of Guatemalan Detainees and Missing Persons 
(Famdegua) rejected the National Congress' intentions of 
sponsoring an amnesty decree because "it would favor impunity 
and protect criminals and corrupt persons." Guatemalan 
legislators insisted on the need to establish a pardon for the 
perpetration of common political crimes. According to Famdegua, 
two amnesty bills were sponsored in June -- shortly before 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was sworn in -- to prevent the 
enforcement of justice against former President Jorge Serrano. 
  The former president, who sought asylum in Panama, tried to 
dissolve Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice on 25 May 
1993. 
  Another decree would favor members and collaborators of 
subversive factions, and all those who had participated in acts 
of repression or persecution. 
  In October Congress tried to modify Article 183 (Paragraph 
U), which authorizes the president of the Republic to "commute a 
death sentence for the next highest sentence, and to grant a 
pardon in connection with common political crimes and related 
crimes." 
  According to Famdegua, it is evident that pressure is being 
exerted by groups which, "like the Army," are involved in human 
rights violations, to decree an amnesty that would also favor 
politicians and former officials. To establish an amnesty would 
be tantamount to leaving "black pages of an authoritarian, 
terrorist, and corrupt era" unpunished and shelved, it was added 
by the organization, which struggles for the return of 45,000 
persons.

  [Text] San Jose, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Guatemalan news agency 
CERIGUA, closely connected with the Guatemalan guerrillas, 
announced Tuesday that the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity (URNG) has accused the government of President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio of waging a "dirty war" to undermine the peace 
negotiations, which are scheduled to begin the second half of 
February. 
  According to the Mexico City datelined dispatch, Miguel 
Angel 
Sandoval, one of the guerrilla spokespersons, accused the 
government and the Guatemalan Army of opposing the "Truth 
Commission," which is investigating crimes committed during the 
war-torn years in that Central American country. According to 
Sandoval, government negotiators will also block the 
international verification of the agreements to be signed by the 
parties on human rights, which is the first point of the 
negotiations, . 
  CERIGUA also attributed statements to Defense Minister Mario 
Enriquez rejecting the creation of the Truth Commission. He 
thinks its purposes are "vengeful" and therefore, "instead of 
having a conciliatory nature, it tends to divide." 
  According to the URNG, President Ramiro de Leon "lacks 
autonomy, and he limits himself to doing what the Army says," 
which is why his intent is to hinder the dialogue. 
  In January the United Nations called on the government and 
the URNG to resume the peace talks, which had been suspended 
since May 1993 in the wake of discrepancies between the parties 
on points relating to human rights. The meeting will be held the 
second half of February on an as yet unspecified date. 
  The Guatemalan Catholic Church, however, has expressed 
doubts 
regarding the seriousness of both of government and the 
guerrillas to begin this new phase of the process.

  [Text] Brigadier General Victor Augusto Vasquez Echeverria, 
commander of the military base in Quiche Department, said: "We 
will give Galil assault rifles to those who legally organize 
themselves to protect their properties." 
  Following the attack carried out by guerrillas on the 
morning 
of 13 February, the majority of the store owners are furious 
because the insurgents' actions have only caused them losses, he 
said. "They have stated they intend to join the Civilian 
Self-Defense Patrols to oppose the instability caused by the 
insurgents. The Constitution allows civilians form groups to 
protect themselves from foreign forces," he pointed out. 
  On the morning of 13 February, members of the Poor People's 
Guerrilla Army (EGP) used explosive charges to topple nine 
electric posts in Chichicastenango and Solola. According to Gen. 
Vasquez, the operation was carried out simultaneously by groups 
of four rebels, and authorities found propaganda at the sites 
from the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the 
EGP alluding to the anniversaries of the two organizations. 
  He said: "We have sent more than 200 soldiers to patrol the 
area as the inhabitants of the three affected departments have 
requested." The URNG operation was executed at a strategic 
point, since the posts that were blown down interconnected the 
electricity network between Quiche Department, Chichicastenango 
Municipality, and Solola Department. 
  Up to yesterday, electrical power had not been restored in 
any of these places. Businesses opened as usual even though some 
products that required refrigeration were lost. Gasoline service 
stations used manual pumps, which caused a certain backlog of 
vehicles. Nothing like this has been experienced in this area 
since the beginning of the 1980's when guerrillas destroyed an 
electric power generator in the outskirts of Quiche. 
<H5>  Unhappiness In the Area </H5>
  Quiche Governor Alfonso de Paz rejected these types of 
actions, which only serve to stop development. "It is 
regrettable that these acts are repeated in our department, 
which has suffered plenty of damage due to the domestic 
conflict," the governor said. Quiche belongs to Region No. 7, 
which is classified as one of the country's poorest. Extreme 
poverty is experienced in 95 percent of its 21 municipalities. 
Also, according to what the residents say, this area suffered 
constant Army bombings during the 1980's. 
  Quiche Mayor Juan Jose Garzona also condemned the attack 
saying that these actions affect all residents of the 
department. "Market vendors and hotel owners have been affected. 
Several tourists left on Sunday morning because they were afraid 
of renewed guerrilla attacks," the mayor said. Up to now, the 
URNG has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has 
not denied it either.

Branches have made the first move toward rapprochement after 
several months of dispute -- provoked by the 25 May coup d'etat 
and worsened by the purge sponsored by Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
  Congress President Oscar Vinicio Villar yesterday reported 
that the first action of rapprochement occurred during the 
inauguration of the "Fuertes Caminos" project, when he invited 
the Executive Branch to find solutions to national problems 
through a dialogue and reconciliation. Even though the action 
of rapprochement was fortuitous, it grants an opportunity to end 
the confrontation between the two branches, based on the 
understanding that we will respect our independence and jointly 
seek solutions to the most important social problems, he added. 
Villar said it is never too late to improve things when there 
is a political will, particularly now that the democratic 
process, and the country's own stability, are at stake. 
  Referring to the Great National Agreement, the congress 
president said if everyone has faith and works hard to solve the 
crisis, and if there is a political will to find solutions 
without negatively affecting the masses, we can all overcome the 
problems that have provoked national instability. This project 
supports the congress position that all the groups which 
comprise our society should participate in a dialogue. We are 
willing to participate, as an organization, and support the 
appeal issued by the Executive Branch because we believe this 
will allow us to find a solution to our differences, Villar said. 
  The official said the current problem is that each group 
that 
wants to participate in the dialogue has the idea it will gain 
something, but if we want to find a solution to our current 
crisis we must first make contributions without expecting 
benefits. "Referring to this, the groups that have remained in 
power in the country must realize it is important that we find 
solutions to prevent a grave crisis, because this would return 
the country to the obscurantist decades" which prevailed in the 
past. 
  Given this situation, in my role as Legislative Branch 
president, I consider positive a rapprochement between the two 
state branches because we are aware that a dialogue will allow 
us to find solutions to the problems that worry us nowadays, he 
emphasized.

  [Text] According to a CERIGUA report datelined Mexico City, 
the Mexican newspaper EL DIA has said that the Guatemalan 
Government and Army have played a "dark role" in the Chiapas 
conflict by offering military aid to fight the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army. 
  EL DIA said the Guatemalan Government and Army think 
security 
in the area should be maintained by the two armies, a purpose 
for which the Guatemalan Armed Forces have "offered their help." 
  The Mexican newspaper described the Guatemalan military's 
offer as "unacceptable meddling" and recalled that the Mexican 
Army rejected the offer because it was a local problem that the 
Mexicans themselves would solve. 
  Following the offer of assistance, a joint U.S.-Guatemalan 
military contingent conducted operations under the guise of 
social projects on the border with Mexico, CERIGUA reported. EL 
DIA commented that such operations obscure matters and that "at 
the very least, it can be said that the Guatemalan Government's 
position is openly unfriendly, a stance that should not be 
surprising in view of historical realities," CERIGUA concluded. 
  Army spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin rejected EL 
DIA's 
charges that the Guatemalan Army had offered assistance to fight 
the Zapatists. She added that the Mexican Government and Army 
are capable of solving their sad, delicate problem and have 
requested no help from the Guatemalan Armed Forces.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and U.S. Ambassador 
Marilyn McAfee inaugurated the Fuertes Caminos 94 campaign at 
the municipal stadium in Salama, Baja Verapaz yesterday. The 
purpose of this project is to provice humanitarian aid and real 
opportunities to the communities in the region and to establish 
ties of cooperation. The campaign will also provide training for 
some 300 U.S. National Guard Reserve troops. 
  The U.S. soldiers will work with personnel from the 
Communications, Public Health, and Education Ministries for six 
months. The work will include constructing bridges, buildings, 
and rural roads, digging wells, and carrying out medical and 
educational campaigns. 
  Also present for the inaugural ceremonies were the ministers 
involved in the project, Congress President Vinicio Villar 
Anteu, and several deputies. De Leon Carpio thanked the United 
States for their assistance and asked for support in his fight 
against poverty.

  [Text] Jorge Asencio, director of the Guatemalan Banana 
Producers Association, said yesterday Guatemala is standing firm 
on its proposal to find a fair solution to the banana war with 
the European Union (EU), more so now that Europe has withdrawn 
its December offer and that GATT reiterated its ruling in favor 
of Latin America. 
  Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico won a 
second 
victory when the EU withdrew the offer it was secretly 
negotiating with Colombia in December 1993 and which had 
received support from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The 
offer was to increase the banana import quota by 200,000 tons. 
  These five countries presented a new proposal this week to 
the EU based on Guatemala's plan, which consists of increasing 
the import quota to 3.2 million tons, out of which 2.5 million 
tons would be for Latin America and 700,000 for Africa, 
Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. 
  The EU said initially the new Latin American proposal was 
unrealistic, but in the face of the firm persistence by the 
proposing countries and the surprising Costa Rican withdrawal 
from another group that backed the EU proposal, the EU decided 
to withdraw its December proposal. 
  With the EU withdrawing its proposal, the 4-04 rule becomes 
effective, the EU allowed to import only 2 million tons of 
bananas, which must be shared with ACP countries. 
  Nevertheless, GATT officially informed its 117 member 
countries yesterday of the report by the experts committee 
(panel), which ruled the EU import regime, in effect since July 
1993, violates international trade standards.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 15 
September. 
  Guatemalan Institute of Tourism Director Jose Miguel Gaitan 
has told reporters that last year 562,000 tourists visited the 
country and spent $265.4 million. Gaitan indicated tourism is 
the country's second best source of foreign currency. (Panama 
City ACAN in Spanish 1834 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  The government's austerity plan went into effect yesterday 
in 
accordance with Government Agreement 40-94. Consequently, the 
agencies of the executive branch, as well as the decentralized 
and autonomous entities participating in the agreement, must 
implement measures to rationalize public spending. Among the 
provisions contemplated in the aforementioned agreement is a ban 
during the current fiscal year on the purchase of automobiles, 
with the exception of ambulances, patrol cars, and similar 
public services equipment, provided that the corresponding 
budget appropriations have been made. (Guatemala City PRENSA 
LIBRE in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 115) 
  The Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE) and 
the Banco de la Construccion have signed an agreement to provide 
an additional 5,810,570 quetzals to finance loans for small and 
medium-sized industries within the PAPIC [expansion unknown] 
program. To date, the BCIE has provided a total of 55 million 
quetzales in loans to finance programs for small and 
medium-sized businesses. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish

  [Text] Lima, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Peru will join the GATT, it 
was officially reported this Tuesday. A Foreign Ministry 
resolution authorized the Peruvian ambassador to this 
organization to sign the document. 
  According to the National Customs Superintendency, GATT 
membership will not adversely affect the nation's tariff 
collection because there are special provisions for developing 
nations. 
  An expert on the issue noted that initially the application 
of the agreement could generate certain reductions in tariff 
collection, but he clarified that Peru is only obliged to comply 
with the first three of the seven principles set out in the 
agreement. 
  Several days ago, Carmen Higaona, director of the 
Superintendency, expressed her support for joining GATT. 
  GATT members met last week in Geneva, where they analyzed 
Peruvian trade policy and agreed to encourage the Lima 
government to continue its liberalization reforms, highlighting 
its "positive effects."

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Ricardo Marquez Flores, head of </F>
the National Industries Association (SNI); place and date not 
given: "Ways of Creating Jobs in Peru"--first paragraph is EL 
COMERCIO introduction] 
  [Text] The most recent population and housing census, which 
was conducted in July, estimates that Peru's population grew by 
30 percent over the past 12 years. When we compare this 
percentage to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product over the 
last five years, which was a negative 28.3 percent, we reach the 
conclusion that there is not enough output to feed these new 
mouths: there is more poverty, fewer businesses, and 
consequently fewer jobs. In this regard, in an interview with EL 
COMERCIO the president of the National Industries Association, 
Ricardo Marquez Flores, calls for a series of measures to 
improve standards for the population by creating jobs and 
bettering living conditions. The following is a summary of the 
interview: 
  [EL COMERCIO] Mr. Marquez, how do we create more jobs? 
  [Marquez] The National Industries Association is working on 
proposals to create new jobs in the country. We have seen that 
our industrial plants are operating at just slightly over half 
their capacity. So, one way to create jobs in Peru is to export 
and to continue promoting the programs for one million shoes, 
one million jogging suits, and the desks program. This will 
unquestionably further the development of microbusiness, which 
will create thousands and thousands of jobs, often involving 
entire families. Subcontracting is another way to create jobs. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed any ways of cutting costs in 
industry? 
  [Marquez] Studies conducted by the SNI indicate two ways to 
cut costs. Techniques of total quality control, timely delivery, 
and business re-engineering involve companies proper. In 
addition, though, costs can be reduced by reducing the cost of 
port operations and others, and this is something that is now 
starting to be felt. But when we talk about cutting costs, we 
are also talking about fiscal overpayments, antitechnology 
taxes, and ways of making tax reimbursements simple, timely, and 
transparent. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Could you tell us about some alternatives to 
what you call the antitechnology taxes? 
  [Marquez] In connection with the minimum income tax, we are 
proposing, to the extent that this tax is temporary, a tax 
credit equivalent to the difference between the 2 percent tax on 
the value of the net assets paid out by companies the year 
before and 30 percent of profits that year. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What would the credit be used for? 
  [Marquez] The credit would be used to pay the tax in the 
current year, and whatever balance there is would go to pay the 
income tax or other taxes that furnish revenue to the Treasury. 
  [EL COMERCIO] As for negotiable credit memorandums, we know 
that $360 million has been returned in general sales taxes. Does 
this help you in any way? 
  [Marquez] Although it is true that $360 million in general 
sales taxes has been returned this year, the new arrangement of 
negotiable credit memorandums would complicate the return of the 
tax. In spite of the two changes that have been made, we still 
feel that a third is needed to make them viable. It is becoming 
harder and harder every day to obtain credit, not only for small 
and midsized business but for big business as well. This 
mechanism makes financing exports more expensive, because no 
exporter buys raw materials for just one month's shipments. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What proposals have you looked into for this 
tax? 
  [Marquez] We ought to amend the system set up by Article 3 
of 
Decree Law 25748. We should also extend the life of the system 
of documents with cancellation power (Legislative Decree 190) 
and make it applicable to the entire export sector. While 
continuing to cut costs at the denominator without emphasizing a 
higher exchange rate, inasmuch as this would alter the entire 
economic program, we believe that the tax credit for the 
selective consumers tax on oil purchases ought to be regulated. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Does the industrial union that you head agree 
with the current economic program? 
  [Marquez] We realize that the economic program has to 
maintain the iron discipline of expanding the tax base. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed alternatives for expanding 
the tax base? 
  [Marquez] Individuals should be allowed to deduct from their 
income tax the general sales tax they pay when making a 
purchase. Businesses can check the invoices and the RUC [Single 
Taxpayer Registry]. Lowering the selective consumers tax on 
whiskey and cigarettes has raised revenues from $12,000 to 
$220,000 a month. Therefore, we think that if the simplified 
system is cut from 5 to 2 percent, it would further formalize 
the economy. If we review the numbers under this simplified 
system, we will see that they are not significant today, because 
of the standard system. We ought to go back to the Receipts 
Lottery, but with greater incentives to bring more people in. 
SUNAT [National Tax Administration Superintendency] has 
increased the tax burden from 4.5 to 10 percent of the GDP. 
Today we have 9,000 main taxpayers, and there are 852,000 
registered in the RUC, but we need to have SUNAT and Customs 
conducting investigations and cracking down on smuggling and 
undervaluation. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What is the commercial outlook in 1994 for the 
industrial union that you head? 
  [Marquez] We hope that exports expand by much more than the 
4 
percent a year that is anticipated. Peru needs to increase its 
exports by at least 10 percent a year as of 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] Communiques signed by the "Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Peru" (Shining Path) [PCP-SL] are similar to 
the contents of the document published by LA REPUBLICA on 25 
January in which Abimael Guzman Reinoso [President Gonzalo] 
asserts that the peace agreement is a "strategic retreat," that 
is "complex, difficult, but necessary," and that the objective 
continues being to continue with the war "until we conquer 
power." 
  The first communique is entitled "Hail Maoism!" It 
transcribes the "resolution" of the Central Committee about the 
commemorations of Mao Zedong's 100th birthday, stressing the 
SL's support "for the leadership of President Gonzalo." 
  According to the document, "President Gonzalo" will make the 
New State flourish with the help of the People's Liberation 
Army, which through hard combat will eventually achieve the 
immediate goal: To conquer power in the whole country and to 
install the People's Republic of Peru." [no opening quotation 
marks published] 
  The SL "resolution," which is just a party agreement at its 
highest leadership levels, also envisages an increase in armed 
actions against the Peruvian State. 
  "It is our duty to aim all our actions (....) and mainly to 
develop the people's war with increasingly ambitious plans and 
greater war actions, using all our forces to the maximum; 
totally and strictly complying with the task established by 
President Gonzalo." 
  Another SL communique, which includes the "speech" Guzman 
gave when he was presented to the media in a striped prisoner's 
uniform following his arrest in September 1992, states that "the 
international, national, and party situation marks the arrest 
(of Guzman) as an historical event and places on alert all 
forces to comply with the IV Strategic Development Plan and the 
VI Military Plan, according to what was established by the III 
Plenum of the PCP-SL Central Committee." 
  Between Abimael Guzman's arrest until September 1993, the SL 
has carried out the first guerrilla campaign called "Defend the 
life of President Gonzalo!," and from November 1993 until the 
present it is carrying out the second campaign called "In 
Defense of the Leadership Against the Genocide Dictator!" 
  The two campaigns are part of the so-called Sixth Great 
Military Plan to which the subversives refer. 
  This latter document includes the most recent decisions of 
the leadership connected with the strategy and objectives of the 
organization led by Guzman. 
  As for strategy, the Maoists state: "We reassert the three 
strategies established by President Gonzalo: political strategy: 
conquest of power; military strategy: the people's war, to 
develop preparations for insurrection; strategy of construction, 
to build the conquer of power amid the people's war." 
  Among the objectives of the SL -- which totally opposes the 
contents of the letters Guzman sent to President Fujimori 
praising the policies of his regime -- we find: "To combat the 
treacherous genocide of the dictatorship of Fujimori, to defeat 
his counterrevolutionary plan (and) to upgrade the people's war 
by developing a strategic balance to conquer power in the whole 
country." 
  Guzman's statements in his letters are not at all in keeping 
with his strategies and objectives expressed in the SL 
communiques or in the document published by LA REPUBLICA. On 
the contrary, they show that Abimael Guzman is playing a double 
game to "gain time" and to recompose his organization's 
apparatus and thus guarantee the continuity of the peoples war 
that he unleashed in May 1980. 
  In another PCP-SL bulletin entitled "Declaration" the SL 
again stresses its decision to continue to combat the regime 
"headed by the genocidal traitor puppet Fujimori, the most loyal 
lackey of Yankee imperialism," whioch clearly contradicts 
Guzman's statements that the government "has made real 
accomplishments." 
  The document minimizes the efforts for pacification and 
specifically refers to the "capitulation of the SL" to dialogue 
which is labelled as "another lie which the reactionary 
government periodically releases (....), a ridiculous and clumsy 
lie that no one with even the smallest brain can consider 
serious and which will evaporate, like the ones that came before 
it, prior to an endless turmoil of the people's war." 
  Contrary to the spirit of the letters written by Guzman and 
the unveiling of the real motive for his apparent willingness to 
lay down his weapons, the PCP-SL Central Committee states: "The 
people's war will triumph inevitably, marking an event that will 
decisively contribute to the development of the international 
proletarian revolution; the People's Republic of Peru will 
become true thanks to the support and the combat trench of the 
working class." 
  As for Guzman, the declaration states: "With his everlasting 
light (....) he is leading us to the golden and shining 
Communism with a firm and sure hand," which clearly shows that 
the leadership of the self-proclaimed "President Gonzalo" is not 
questioned and that his followers support his determination to 
hold talks with the representatives of the regime, but only to 
distract their attention because "we are sure and convinced of 
the triumph of the revolution." 
  The most recent issue of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, the SL 
mouthpiece that Luis Arce Borja, who is at large, publishes in 
Brussels, reveals the real sense of the negotiations between 
Abimael Guzman and the government. 
  The declaration states: "The people's war is not negotiable 
and there is no room for talks with this reactionary and 
criminal government. The revolutionaries have decided to 
destroy the old state, and to finish with the police and armed 
forces. We will definitively end this oppressive system and 
imperialistic domination, " adding: "These objectives cannot be 
conquered through agreements or `peace conversations.' The 
struggle of the masses cannot be auctioned." 
  The viewpoint of EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL is based on the 
attacks committed by the Shining Path in the last four months: 
"The military attack that the Maoist guerrilla has been 
promoting since last September and which brilliantly continued 
in October, November, and December, is the argument against all 
those who, based on the lies of the government, have tried to 
discredit President Gonzalo and the war of liberation in Peru." 
  Arce Borja supports the "leadership" of Guzman and 
acknowledges that he is the irrefutable leader of the PCP-SL, 
therefore his criticisms of the peace talks are not aimed at 
"President Gonzalo" but at demonstrating the existence of a SL 
strategy to take advantage of the dialogue to "gain strength." 
  "It is clear as daylight that the PCP-SL is as compact and 
strong organization as steel. It has been proven that its top 
central, regional, and local leadership cadres are active and 
healthy," states EL DIARIO. 
  Regarding the negotiations, the SL mouthpiece states: "It is 
naive to consider the possibility of peacefully maintaining the 
old state and the system of oppression." 
  Arce Borja asks: "What will a peace agreement serve for in 
Peru?, and answers: "The only ones to benefit from any `peace 
agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people, 
especially the imperialistic forces." 
  The document published by LA REPUBLICA on 25 January clearly 
states that the SL people's war will carry on until 2060, 
stressing that it will be a "long" war. Arce Borja states that 
"time is not a problem for the people's war but it is for the 
Peruvian state." 
  Arce Borja concludes: "To acknowledge the letters of 
Fujimori 
is to disapprove the general political line of the revolution 
established by Abimael Guzman and to deny the validity of the 
program of the party whose strategic objectives aim to conquer 
power in the whole country and to build the people's republic of 
Peru."

  [Text] Lima, 12 Feb (EFE) -- The police reported today 
that a printing shop of the terrorist Shining Path [SL], where 
its clandestine newspaper EL DIARIO is printed, has been raided 
in Lima. 
  According to the source, National Counterterrorism 
Directorate (Dincote) agents carried out an operation on 6 
February and captured 20 SL activists. 
  The detainees were involved in publishing the clandestine 
newspaper and in the SL's political propaganda. The SL is still 
active in Peru. 
  The police did not report the printing shop's location in 
Lima. 
  The authorities believe its discovery and dismantling 
represents a harsh blow against the SL because the printing shop 
belongs to the SL group that has not obeyed the orders of 
Abimael Guzman, the terrorist organization's leader and founder, 
to reach a "peace accord" with the Peruvian Government. 
  Guzman was detained on 12 September 1992 in Lima and 
sentenced to life imprisonment by an unidentified military 
court. He asked for a peace accord in October in various 
letters he sent to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  Those imprisoned -- including most SL leaders -- have obeyed 
Guzman's order, but the activists who remain free emphasize that 
the man who is allegedly the Abimael Guzman who wrote the 
letters, and spoke on television to confirm the contents of the 
letters, is an unidentified person who was trained for one year 
to impersonate the real Guzman. 
  The raided printing shop was under the orders of the free SL 
Central Committee, which, according to the police, is headed by 
[words indistinct] Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," 
the new leader of the terrorist gang. 
  The SL's hard-line faction seems to be headed by Catalina 
Adriansen, the wife of SL ideologist Antonio Diaz who was killed 
during the penitentiaries massacre in 1986; "Feliciano;" Margie 
Clavo Peralta; and Isabel Rengifo; among others. 
  Martha Huatay, Laura Zambrano, and Teresa Durand Araujo, the 
wife of Osman Morote, who was also detained and is another top 
Shining Path leader, are among the imprisoned SL leaders who 
support the "Feliciano" faction. 
  This faction, which pursues the violent actions of the SL, 
is 
responsible for the latest attacks in Lima against the Air Force 
headquarters and the "Barbones" barracks during which two people 
were killed, many were injured, and there was extensive property 
damage. 
  SL experts believe there is an irrevocable division within 
the SL between those who approve and those who reject Guzman's 
position. 
  The newspaper EL COMERCIO today says that SL leader Martha 
Huatay managed to take from the prison a message by Guzman when 
she visited the Navy prison where the Shining Path leader is 
being held. 
  The message reportedly said: "My detention represents a turn 
along the way, join the masses, the people shall win." 
  In 1992, Dincote agents raided another Shining Path printing 
shop in Lima that was managed by Jorge Durand Araujo, who is in 
prison. 
  Durand Araujo is the brother of Maximiliano and Teresa, who 
are being described as founder members of the SL.

  [Text] Gustavo Gabaldon, president of the Venezuelan 
Institute of Social Security [IVSS], stated in an end of the 
year message to workers that the new draft law on social 
security to replace the present law and the regulations issued 
under it has been favorably received by the president, who has 
promised to consider it at a cabinet meeting during the next few 
days. 
  The draft bill has also been discussed with senior 
representatives of the president elect, who also received it 
favorably. 
  Gabaldon said in his report that it will not be possible to 
administer the IVSS properly with a financial deficit of almost 
one billion bolivares monthly, due to inadequate income to cover 
the basic expenditures of the institute. 
  The president of the IVSS proposed six urgently needed 
measures to the president: 
  1) Seek passage of a Law on Public Credit, under which the 
national government will cancel its debt to the IVSS of more 
than 8.5 billion bolivares. 
  2) Pass appropriate legislation to restore the technical 
reserves of the IVSS which are more than 300 billion bolivares 
short, due to mistakes made in the past. 
  3) Provide by decree for total coverage of all employees of 
the national government. 
  4) Seek a harmonious agreement between employers and workers 
to raise social security contributions within the next 30 days 
in such a way that this increase will be insignificant for those 
with the least resources. 
  5) Raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 
55 
to 60 for women. 
  6) Make changes in the percentages relating to each social 
security fund to make them adequate under present circumstances 
and separate the various funds, with different administrations 
and accounting systems. 
  Gabaldon said that when he became president of the IVSS, the 
institute was in a state of total collapse in the areas of 
administration, operations, and finance, notwithstanding the 
intense effort made by the Committee on Restructuring, which was 
established under special legislation. 
  He said that the results of this work became known through a 
draft social security bill which has still not been introduced 
in Congress for debate. He pointed out that, notwithstanding the 
advances made in terms of decentralization, through harmonious 
cooperation with several state governments, the financial 
deficit will continue and become intolerable if significant 
action is not taken. 
  The president of the IVSS said that the following actions 
have already been taken recently: 

  -  Improvements in the quality of IVSS 
employees. 
  -  Introduction of strict controls over bidding, 
purchasing, and payments. 
  -  Revision of general 
procedures. 
  -  Introduction of a system of automatic payments 
through the banks. 
  -  A total change in the system and control of 
surveillance of property belonging to the IVSS. 
  -  A substantial 
improvement in the processes of daily collections and 
receipts. 
  -  A substantial reduction in debts owed to suppliers and 
a considerable improvement in the system of 
payments. 
  -  Elimination of the use of blank payrolls. 
  -  Payment of 
pensions to workers. 
  -  A substantial improvement in making 
payments to hospitals and centers of ambulatory health 
care. 
  -  Raising the minimum IVSS pension to 9,000 
bolivares. 
  -  Making up one year of arrearages of unemployment 
payments; these obligations are now being paid on time. 
  -  Study of 
an independent social security management system to improve the 
Pension Fund. 
  -  Elimination of per diem allowances, unnecessary 
travel within and outside the country, and unjustified overtime 
payments, including the elimination of chauffeurs and escorts 
for the president of the IVSS, members of the Board of 
Directors, and directors of the institute. 
  -  Beginning the process 
of appraisal and sale of unnecessary IVSS assets. 
  -  Beginning the 
system of self-administration of hospitals under which they will 
present their own bills and collect contributions from workers 
not insured and from private persons or groups holding insurance 
policies. 

    Gabaldon pointed out that there is still a long way to go, 
but we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel through 
which we have been traveling.

  [Text] The economic team of the administration of President 
Rafael Caldera is making the final adjustments aimed at reducing 
the national budget for 1994 by 150 billion bolivares. 
  It is estimated that as soon as the president enters office, 
the administration will request an amendment to the Budget Law 
for 1994 to reduce appropriations and allocations which it 
considers superfluous and unnecessary. 
  Abdon Vivas Teran, economic adviser of the next 
administration and member of the transition team, has pointed 
out that one of the priorities is to deal with the problem of 
the budget deficit. That will require carefully adjusting the 
balance between government income and expenditure. 
  Public spending is one of the variables which have the most 
decisive influence on the level of aggregate demand. 
Consequently, he commented, it has a significant impact on the 
maintenance of adequate rates of growth of Gross Domestic 
Product. At the same time, by carefully managing that element it 
will be possible to have a decisive impact which will lead to a 
decline in the level of inflation and interest rates and the 
small scale devaluations through which until the exchange rate 
between the U. S. dollar and the bolivar has been set. 
  He stated that the traditional policy of expanding demand 
tends to limit the scope for reconsidering public spending. 
Reducing the level of spending to a reasonable extent and, at 
the same time, reexamining the rest of the budget is another way 
of saying that we have to reform the Budget Law of 1994. 
  Vivas Teran said that, "The study conducted by the technical 
team of the new government indicates that a reduction on the 
order of 150 billion bolivares of public spending is an 
objective which can be achieved over the very short term. These 
adjustments," which are rather limited, "will not be oriented 
toward the investment area nor toward the socially productive 
area (education, health, and public security)." He indicated 
that cuts will be made in appropriations and allocations which 
have continued to reflect exaggerated levels of spending, such 
as for automobiles, travel, highways, aircraft, celebrations, 
and publicity, among other things. 
  Vivas Teran stated that the president elect has announced a 
30 percent reduction in spending on the security of the 
Presidency and on the secret appropriation of the Ministry of 
Internal Relations. He rejected the allocation of 60 million 
bolivares for expenditures related to his inauguration. 
  Vivas Teran was asked, "Will the bureaucracy be pruned?" He 
answered: "Yes. Within the goal of reducing the budget by 150 
billion bolivares consideration is being given to the 
elimination of some unnecessary services which probably are 
duplicated elsewhere. Hence the urgent need for restructuring 
existing institutions." 
  He added that action to reduce spending should be 
accompanied 
by a series of measures to increase public receipts. These 
increases should complement the program of reforms aimed at 
modernizing and placing income tax collection on a better 
technical basis, as well as other, ordinary tax receipts, 
including the collection of duties by the customs service of the 
country. Specifically, these involve the following: 

  -  The adequate management of the whole income tax system 
(without as yet introducing changes in the law which must be 
approved by Congress), creating an autonomous income tax system 
and strictly controlling tax collections. This would make it 
possible for the Ministry of Finance to collect about 260 
billion bolivares in 1994 in this category, as compared to the 
131 billion bolivares collected up to the end of 1993. 
  -  The next 
administration should, as a matter of preference, concern itself 
with tariff collections made by customs offices. It will be 
necessary to bring up to date a technical cooperation agreement 
which Venezuela has already signed with the United Nations for 
trade and development (UNTAC) to modernize the tariff system. 
Unfortunately, the most intractable focus of corruption in the 
whole system of government tax collection is in the customs 
offices. It is essential to wipe out this system of corruption 
and make changes in management personnel. 
  In his opinion the efforts which have been made in this 
direction have been very limited. He stated that receipts by the 
Treasury from tariffs amounted to 115 billion bolivares in 1993. 
It is estimated that, with the changes to be made, customs 
receipts could rise to 350 billion bolivares. In this way the 
new government, through the application of ethical and 
administrative principles, will be able to obtain from income 
tax and customs receipts sufficient resources (about 610 billion 
bolivares) to resolve the budget deficit to a large 
extent.%Urgent action should be taken on taxes which are owed 
but not yet collected and on any tax measure which the 
government may approve, including those tax cases which have 
already been decided favorably in the appropriate courts. 
According to a report from the Hacienda Publica Nacional 
[National Treasury] for 1992, the cumulative total of all of the 
potential receipts by the Treasury under this heading amounted 
to 400 billion bolivares. The most worrisome aspect of this 
situation is that there has been no will to collect these taxes. 
Corruption is of such magnitude that frequently obligations to 
pay are allowed to lapse. 
  The state can and should begin a healthy and sensible tax 
collection policy, using law firms and entrusting them with 
handling this task. Their services would be paid for by a 
negotiable percentage of the tax collections which they 
make.%Presenting to Congress as soon as possible changes in 
income tax legislation, including: (a) eliminating or 
substantially reducing authorized legal exemptions, especially 
those which protect the financial sector; (b) slightly 
increasing the taxes due on corporations. The maximum now is 30 
percent. It could be raised to 32.5 percent; (c) reducing the 
impact of direct taxation by enacting income tax legislation 
before providing for some other type of tax to replace the 
burden of indirect taxes on the people. Vivas Teran warned that 
the collection of income taxes in Venezuela amounts at most to 
2.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product. In 1993 it did not amount 
even to that much. In the United States, for example, income tax 
collections amount to 10.8 percent of total government income; 
(d) immediate substitution of the Value Added Tax by a tax on 
the consumption of luxury articles which would exempt from 
payment all products of common use by the people and which could 
start from a given unit value and rise higher. 

    Abdon Vivas Teran, expected to replace Julian Villalba as 
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, considers that the 
policy of privatization should be used more as an instrument 
aimed at correcting structural deficiencies in the distribution 
of income and property, in the provision of services, and in the 
level of government efficiency by helping to relieve the 
excessive burden of the external public debt, rather than as an 
automatic instrument to compensate for the budget deficit. 
  Therefore, he added, these processes should guarantee access 
to property, both by those who work for companies which will be 
subject to these transactions as well as by persons turning out 
production inputs, as in the case of the agricultural sector. 
  He was asked: "At present does the program for participation 
by the workers provide for the sale of between 10 and 20 percent 
of the shares in a company to the workers?" 
  He replied: "I am inclined to review and broaden this 
program, without suggesting that what has been done so far is 
not good. It could be better. Furthermore, privatization tends 
to reduce the portfolio of shares owned by the state. The most 
advisable action is for a substantial part of those assets to be 
earmarked to pay debts owed by the nation over the long term. In 
this way the balance sheet of the Treasury would be protected 
under optimum conditions. 
  Vivas stated: "It is clear that our task cannot be to 
privatize in part and to open another portfolio of unprofitable 
assets in the hands of the nation. On the other hand everything 
which adds significantly to the burdens of the state and which 
could be better handled by the private sector, by mixed private 
and state companies, or by associations, would be perfectly 
viable. In the case of companies owned by the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana, not all of them, in my view, are 
strategic. Initially, these companies could have a different 
form of management through mixed private and state firms." 
  He recalled that the administration of Carlos Andres Perez 
emphasized to the public the view that state-owned companies are 
not viable and that they are a useless and costly burden. 
  Vivas Teran said: "That is a picture which may be true in 
part, but it is not the whole truth. In some cases the condition 
of state-owned companies has been deliberately worsened to make 
the process of privatization easier, taking into account the 
fact that public opinion was going to react angrily against 
companies which were not providing the service expected. That is 
totally correct and, of course, that cannot be the philosophy of 
the new government." 
  Vivas Teran stated that, "We are not going to ruin state 
companies just to sell them for bargain basement prices. We are 
going to move them into the private sector at a good price, 
because they are productive and efficient and not because they 
have been deliberately bankrupted by state administrators."

  [Text] In 1993, 149,994,761,000 bolivares in ordinary 
domestic taxes were collected, according to a report prepared by 
the Incomes Sector of the Directorate General of Taxes of the 
Ministry of Finance concerning activity by that office in 1993. 
  This figure includes collections of income tax and taxes on 
liquor, cigarettes, matches, inheritances, and fees, as well as 
collections on tax stamps. It indicates an increase of 45.17 
percent over tax revenues collected in 1992. 
  Broken down in detail, tax collections were as follows: 

  -  Income Tax: 103,511.0 million bolivares, compared to 
63,486.0 million bolivares collected in 1992, an increase of 
63.04 percent. The 1994 budget has set out an income tax 
collection goal of 136,275.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Alcoholic 
beverages: In this category the difference between 1993 and 1992 
was not so pronounced. In 1992 13,754.0 million bolivares in 
taxes were collected, a figure which was 7.93 percent higher in 
1993, when 14,845.0 million bolivares were collected. The tax 
collection goal for 1994 is 18,250.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Tax 
stamps: in 1993 13,368.0 million bolivares were collected, or 24 
percent more than in 1992 (when 10,771.0 million bolivares were 
collected). With the reform of the law on tax stamps it is hoped 
to collect at least 27 billion bolivares in 1994, due to the 
increase in tax rates. 
  -  Cigarettes: tax collections in 1993 
amounted to 17,104 million bolivares, against almost 14,000 
million bolivares in 1992, which was 22.26 percent more in 
comparative terms. 
  -  Taxes on matches: tax income was 40,147.0 
million bolivares in 1993, or 11.26 percent more than in 1992. 
The report on tax collections states that the goal set by the 
Directorate General of Taxes was not completely attained, due to 
the effects of smuggling matches, which resulted in a decline in 
production. 
  -  Taxes collected on inheritances, donations, and 
other, related taxes brought in 966.0 million bolivares in 1993, 
a decline of 17.8 percent, compared to the 1,176.0 million 
bolivares collected under this category in 1992. According to 
the report, this is the only tax collection area which declined 
due to temporary circumstances. The projection for 1994 shows a 
decline to 650.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Finally, 159.0 million 
bolivares were collected in fees, or 49.6 percent more than the 
106.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992. 
The 1994 budget anticipates collection of 128.0 million 
bolivares in this category of taxes. 
  With the exception of income tax, the other, internal taxes 
showed a growth of only 16.69 percent in 1993, compared to 1992. 
  The report on tax collection activity in 1993 also showed 
that the activities of the Directorate of Tax Control in Caracas 
brought in 55,965.0 million bolivares in income tax. A special 
plan was set up for tax collections at the regional level. 
  Another 35,525.0 million bolivares were collected as a 
result 
of opening tax cases against 850 taxpayers. This figure broke 
down to 14,126.0 million bolivares from taxes, 14,396.0 million 
bolivares from fines, and the remaining 7.0 billion bolivares 
from interest collections. 
  Investigations carried out by the Directorate of Tax 
Collection on financial, industrial, and commercial companies, 
as well as service companies, had the following results. 
Reserves set aside amounted to 10,470.0 bolivares, and taxes 
plus contingencies resulting from reserves set aside amounted to 
8.0 billion bolivares. 
  Investigations carried out in the petroleum sector brought 
the following results: reserves set aside of 21,207.0 million 
bolivares and taxes plus contingencies amounting to 29,239.0 
million bolivares. 
  In the mining sector reserves set aside amounted to 643 
million bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies amounted to 455 
million bolivares. 
  In 1994, the report states, it is anticipated that a 
strategy 
will be followed which will extend until 1996 for increasing tax 
collection, tax pressure, and a range of tax contingencies, thus 
reducing tax evasion, delays in tax payments, and requests for 
resource set aside for litigation.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Convergence Deputy Leonardo Montiel reports the Central Bank 
of Venezuela used approximately $1 billion to assist banks 
experiencing difficulties due to "very probable irregular 
management." The Central Bank president will be summoned 
tomorrow before the Finance Commission to explain why funds were 
used to help certain banks instead of depositors. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2049 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  Venzuelan Petroleum subsidiary Lagoven Inc. dispatched a 
total of 119 million barrels during 1993 from its La Salina 
Terminal, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, to export 
markets and local petrochemical- and petroleum-processing 
centers. A total of 237 oil tankers were used, of which 168 
went to the United States, 35 to Germany, 12 to Canada, eight to 
Jamaica, six to Chile, three to Africa, two to Norway, and three 
to the Amuay Refinery in Falcon State. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 17) 
  The National Venezuelan Telephone Company grossed 120 
billion 
bolivares during 1993, twice the amount for 1992. The company 
president said that at the end of the month the company will pay 
the National Treasury 6 billion bolivares for concessions 
granted by the government. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 9 
Feb 94 p 12) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum subsidiary Maraven increased its level 
of production and generated significant savings of 10 billion 
bolivares in 1993, in addition to increasing services for 
customers via its quality management program. (Caracas EL DIARIO 
DE CARACAS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 19) 
  The state group Venezuelan Petroleum, via its president, 
Gustavo Roosen, explains that the fall in petroleum prices on 
the international markets has forced a review of the 1994 budget 
and the implementation of appropriate adjustments. As a result, 
the government will have a much lower tax revenue. 
Conservatives place the national deficit at approximately $3.5 
billion, while pessimists estimate the same at approximately $6 
billion, 50 percent of the budget. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0041

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala] </F>
  [Text] Two marine infantrymen have accused Army Colonel 
Rodrigo Quinones of being the head of an intelligence group that 
murdered at least 100 union leaders in the central Magdalena 
region, mainly in Barrancabermeja. 
  One of the marines has served for eight a half years in the 
Navy and as a result of his duties was responsible for a 
logistics office where hired killers were paid. 
  Everything was uncovered when Col. Rodrigo Quinones gave the 
order to execute several subordinates in order to conceal what 
was taking place. In addition, the two marines indicated that 
the U.S. Government is seeking to establish a military base in 
the Colombian pacific coast through the region of Bahia Solana 
in Choco Department. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified marine] The Venezuelan case 
is clear evidence that there is an intention to destabilize the 
region with the objective of increasing an arms buildup in the 
region because of its location and because the Americans have 
always been interested in the bay area. 
  [Ayala] How did the Army intelligence network in the middle 
Magdalena region operate? 
  [Marine] The only thing the network did was to channel all 
information and leave everything on Rodrigo Quinones' desk. He 
in turn would determine who would be eliminated as he did with 
journalist (Ibal Jaime). Quinones said that Jaime was making 
too many inquiries and there was need to silence him or get rid 
of him. (Ibal Jaime) was followed until he was finally killed. 
The same thing happened to some union members and human rights 
activists. 
  [Ayala] As an Armed Forces serviceman, were you ever a 
member 
of a group that became involved in illegal activities? 
  [Marine] I was part of a special forces group in 1986 and 
1987 that operated in the central Magdalena region and was 
involved in several murders in the Antioquia sierra. 
  [Ayala] At that time, whom did the group attack? 
  [Marine] During that period we executed several union 
members 
of the petroleum [words indistinct]. 
  [Ayala] The same group to which you belonged? 
  [Marine] Yes, the special forces group. In addition, the 
central Magdalena authorities cooperated with us and [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Ayala] Did the group become involved in anything illegal in 
Bahia Solano? 
  [Marine] I was ordered to eliminate two persons in Bahia 
Solana. I was instructed to organize as well as to plan 
everything and that several persons would be sent to assist me 
in eliminating someone in Bahia Solano. I refused to do it 
because it was against my principles. However, when I returned 
I found out I had earned Mr. Rodrigo Quinones' enmity. 
  [Ayala] Who ordered the execution of those persons? 
  [Marine] We received the order from Mr. Rodrigo Quinones, 
but 
through Major Jairo Osorio and Captain Rafael Colon. 
  [Ayala] Whom where you ordered to execute? 
  [Marine] Well, local investors and businessmen. 
  [Ayala] What was the reason for wanting to eliminate them? 
  [Marine] For the simple reason that they were the most 
visible persons in the community. It is not the same thing to 
kill a tramp as it is to kill someone who is investing in the 
region. This would prompt massive protests as well as unrest 
and would allow military intervention which is what we were 
seeking. [end recording] 
  At this time the former marines are under the protection of 
a 
human rights organization and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo 
Arrieta is personally conducting the investigation.

  [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose 
Sintura was forced to remove his private secretary from office 
after an elite investigative team working directly under the 
authority of Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greff found evidence 
justifying an investigation of the official for alleged "bribes." 
  As Sintura's private secretary, Orlando Caceres Henao had 
succeeded in making himself indispensable in the office. Taking 
advantage of that position, he apparently hinted that he wielded 
some influence in the processing of documents and demanded sums 
of money in return for his "services." 
  Complaints from several citizens--said to be contractors and 
suppliers for the Prosecutor General's Office--led the 
prosecutor general's elite investigative team to begin its 
respective inquiries. Only hours ago, a prosecutor made the 
decision to take Caceres Henao into custody. 
  Once the investigators had informed Sintura of the result of 
their preliminary investigations and of the decision made by the 
prosecutor handling the case, the deputy prosecutor general 
removed the official from his post. 
  Reliable sources told EL TIEMPO that "Caceres was demanding 
commissions allegedly ranging from 300,000 to 700,000 pesos, 
assuring the potential blackmail victims that he could speed up 
the obtention of signatures needed on contracts. 
  The source stressed that "what was most unusual about this 
case is that Caceres was not in a position to influence any 
decision because his responsibility amounted to no more than 
verifying whether documents required by the Prosecutor General's 
Office were complete and in order." 
  Nor did the official have access to confidential reports 
that 
form part of the records in cases involving drug trafficking or 
plea bargaining. 
  Even as EL TIEMPO continued its efforts to get in touch with 
Sintura yesterday, no more than a brief bulletin was released by 
the Press Office. In it, the deputy prosecutor general deplored 
the events and noted that routine internal inspections had led 
to the "discovery of conduct that might constitute a violation 
of criminal law." 
  Sources consulted by EL TIEMPO indicated that the alleged 
crime of extortion was based on the original report said to have 
been given to the elite team. 
  Impeccable sources report that Caceres, who is to be 
questioned in the hours ahead, once worked for the Office of 
International Affairs, another department under the Office of 
the Deputy Prosecutor General. 
  However, those same sources refrained from giving out any 
details about the period under investigation or other rumored 
irregularities that the Prosecutor General's Office may have 
discovered. The bulletin from the Press Office reads as follows: 
  "The deputy prosecutor general regrets to inform the public 
that routine internal inspection procedures established by the 
institution some time ago have led to the discovery of conduct 
that might constitute a violation of criminal law. Because of 
the investigation being conducted by the Office of Prosecutor 
General, Orlando Caceres Henao was taken into custody following 
his removal from the post he held as private secretary to the 
deputy prosecutor general."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "If the Salt Loses Its Flavor...."] </F>
  [Text] Corruption and crime have existed from time 
immemorial. Ever since man set foot on this earth, homo 
sapiens has had to be watched over and punished. Not only 
are the Ten Commandments a guide, but also a form of prevention 
and a warning to those who do not follow them. National laws, 
those set forth by man, are in a sense a modern replica, ever 
harsher but, unfortunately, apparently increasingly ineffective. 
All of them, starting with those handed down during the time of 
Moses, have pursued a single purpose: to protect morals. 
  In this struggle, violators fall almost daily, while others 
escape. And yet--nor is this a purely Colombian 
phenomenon--immorality continues to spread and it is very 
frequently the high-ranking officials who are involved in cases 
of corruption. In our country, the list is long. However, the 
most disturbing fact is that these cases occur in the very 
institutions responsible for ensuring that justice is served 
and, furthermore, that justice is done. We have recently been 
surprised by cases such as the one involving the prosecutor 
responsible for overseeing the Judicial Police, Guillermo Villa 
Alzate. Now, the deputy prosecutor general's private secretary, 
Orlando Caceres Henao, is accused of extortion, apparently on 
the basis of conclusive evidence. All of which makes the average 
citizen think of the old saying to the effect that "when even 
salt loses its taste," we face the danger that bad examples are 
spreading. That is why we believe that cases of high-level 
corruption must be investigated most rigorously and, when the 
crime is proven, harshly punished. 
  We said yesterday that the sex education so essential in our 
schools should be accompanied by healthy information provided to 
children by their parents at home. The same is true of morals 
and ethics. It is likewise the responsibility of fathers and 
mothers to teach the necessary notions so that, as adults, those 
children will base their conduct on the strictest standards of 
morality.

<F P=106> [EL TIEMPO editorial: "Hot Money"] </F>
  [Text] There has been rather frequent mention in recent 
times of the alleged link between money of dubious origin, 
generally called "hot money," and the conduct of political 
campaigns. The issue has taken on particular relevance in view 
of the fact that there will be a series of elections this year 
and the campaigns of candidates of all persuasions are in full 
swing. 
  Naturally, to prevent the use of funds and resources of 
illicit origin, provisions have been made for campaigns to be 
financed according to very explicit standards and controls. But 
the infusion of hefty sums of money into these campaigns, money 
whose origin has not really been established, has given rise to 
complaints about its use. Two specific cases have already been 
reported in the departments of Cauca and Atlantico. 
  There is no question of accepting the accusations at face 
value without conducting the necessary investigation. But it is 
appropriate, indeed imperative, that the Office of the Treasury 
Inspector, which has such a propensity to become distracted by 
other matters that appear to be an abuse of authority, devote 
its energies to the rigorous oversight that is incumbent upon it 
in these cases, as many have urged it to do. 
  Any possibility that election campaigns, and political 
campaigns in general, may be using resources of illicit 
provenance should be confronted, investigated, and stopped at 
the earliest opportunity. Radical action must be taken; there is 
no excuse for any delay whatsoever. If there are any signs 
pointing to this possibility, the situation must be clarified 
immediately to ensure that campaigns are absolutely clean. The 
Office of the Prosecutor General, for its part, should be 
equally vigilant to make sure the appropriate legal standards 
are strictly upheld, and that penalties for violations are 
imposed without leniency. 
  We understand how difficult it is to pinpoint hot money. But 
it is easy to smell it, to feel it: an excessively lavish 
campaign carried out by someone who is not that wealthy, someone 
who just manages to live on his salary or his inheritance, 
someone who is in no position to afford to spend fabulous sums 
to get elected. When that happens, "something is rotten in the 
state of Denmark." The voters can, should, and must grasp these 
subtle nuances in politics, because if the initial election is 
corrupt, what happens afterwards will definitely be harmful. The 
watchword of democracies in the world today should be to defeat 
corrupt or hot money, whatever you want to call it. Otherwise, 
democracy will have a hard time surviving.

<F P=106> [Report by Vanessa Rios from Santa Fe de Bogota; from the </F>
"Global TV News" newscast] 
  [Text] Upon arrival at Catam Air Force Base in Santa Fe de 
Bogota, President Alberto Fujimori was greeted at Narino Palace 
by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. The welcome ceremony was 
held in the main courtyard of the presidential palace. 
Fujimori's accompanying delegation is headed by Alfonso 
Bustamante, president of the Council of Ministers and industry, 
foreign trade, tourism, and integration minister, three 
additional ministers, and members of the Democratic Constituent 
Congress. During a news conference held after the welcoming 
ceremony, Fujimori answered questions for Colombian reporters on 
the antidrug-trafficking struggle, violence, and human rights in 
Peru. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We are waging a battle against 
terrorism from which we cannot withdraw. Despite certain 
isolated incidents--as a matter of fact, very condemnable 
incidents in which members of the Armed Forces are involved--we 
cannot risk our antiterrorist strategy or Armed Forces; that is 
basic. Furthermore, those who have expressed their differences 
or disagreement with this law are those who have participated in 
former governments in which flagrant cases were also handled by 
military courts. The best example of this would be the killings 
in the jails when approximately 300 prisoners were shot in the 
temple and killed. This matter was handled by a military court. 
  There were also cases involving the killing of peasants 
during the early eighties; a military court also handled these 
cases. One of the few cases handled by a civilian court was the 
case of General Noel [not further identified]. It took 10 years 
for the civilian court to hand down a sentence in this case--10 
years. I am sure the deep-rooted goal is to punish those 
responsible for this horrible crime, and I know they will be 
punished. The people want this, and this will happen in a few 
weeks. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Your justice minister has said in 
Geneva 95 percent of the terrorist leaders are in jail. Is it 
true the other 5 percent want to sit down and talk to you to end 
terrorism in your country? What would you tell former Peruvian 
President Alan Garcia if you were to meet him here in Colombia? 
What would you tell him on behalf of the people and government 
of Peru? 
  [Fujimori] There has been no contact with that 5 percent of 
the terrorist leaders who are at large. Our intelligence 
organizations will make these contacts, which will be aimed at 
capturing them, not talking with them. 
  Regarding your second question, I will refrain from 
answering. I am more concerned about helping Peru out of its 
situation of underdevelopment and economic crisis. 
  [Reporter] How does it feel to be the initiator, at the 
world 
level, of the word Fujimori-style coup [Fujimorazo] as an 
unconventional procedure to defend democracy? 
  [Fujimori] I do not know [chuckles] what I feel, but I am 
sure I did something that was necessary for Peru and for 
regional security. Perhaps the process is not called a 
Fujimori-style coup, of Fujimorifazo, as the Brazilians say, but 
it is a process in which the people express their discontent for 
the inefficiency of the political systems that have led most of 
the people to poverty, underdevelopment, and misery. [end 
recording] 
  During the afternoon, President Fujimori was greeted by the 
diplomatic corps at the Foreign Ministry, located in the San 
Carlos Palace, which once had been Simon Bolivar's home. 
Fujimori also placed a wreath at Simon Bolivar's monument and 
received the keys to the city from the mayor of Santa Fe de 
Bogota.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (DPA) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori said today in Santa Fe de Bogota he 
expects military justice in his country will enforce drastic 
sanctions against those responsible for the disappearance and 
assassination of a professor and nine students at La Cantuta 
University. 
  Fujimori held a news conference at the end of his two-day 
visit to Colombia and said this case "must be fully 
investigated," adding he does not endorse debates on what he 
called "form" issues, for example, the controversy unleashed in 
his country due to the case being turned over to military 
jurisdiction. 
  The president explained Congress issued a law (that allowed 
a 
changing of the venue from a civilian court to a military court) 
which "must be respected." He added the case, considered one of 
the most critical human rights violations in Peru, must be 
investigated to locate the culprits. 
  The disappearance of a university professor and nine 
students 
occurred in mid-1992, when unidentified individuals, presumably 
military, kidnapped the victims. According to journalists' 
investigations, the 10 were tortured and buried in a common 
grave.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori said in Santa Fe de Bogota today that 
the U.S. counternarcotics struggle has proved useless although 
"billions of dollars were spent." "The change in the U.S. 
counternarcotics policy confirms that this policy did not yield 
the expected results." Although "billions of dollars were 
spent, nothing was attained," he said. 
  Fujimori made the remark in a news conference at the Narino 
Presidential Palace at the end of a two-day official visit. 
Fujimori said that, in view of the failure of the U.S. 
counternarcotics policy, the governments of the coca-producing 
countries, including Peru and Colombia, should outline joint 
strategies and insist that consumption is the reason for the 
persistence of drug trafficking. 
  According to Fujimori, "it is necessary to reassess" the 
alleged reduction in drug use, a crime "that has distorted our 
economies." He insisted that the problem "should be tackled by 
everyone involved" and that "imaginative solutions" should be 
sought. He said the war on drugs as it has been waged, "should 
not continue this way without offering alternatives to coca 
planters." He also said that his country cannot repress "200,000 
poor coca planters" without offering them other ways out. 
  He pointed out that drug trafficking must be attacked by 
"hitting the big ones, not the poor ones." He insisted that 
drug trafficking could end "when there is economic development." 
  The end of drug trafficking, without setting any deadlines, 
"does not depend on us, but on consumers," Fujimori concluded.

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori today concluded a two-day 
official visit to Colombia, where he signed with President Cesar 
Gaviria a document to create the Binational Neighborhood 
Commission in a ceremony at the Narino Presidential Palace. The 
commission will be in charge of reinforcing and improving 
bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries. 
Gaviria and Fujimori also signed a joint statement to 
strengthen the relations between the two countries, and 
contribute to the peaceful solution of regional and 
international problems. The two presidents advocated the 
defense of participatory democracy in the hemisphere. 
  The last day of Fujimori's official visit began with a 
meeting with Colombian businessmen at the Tequendama Hotel, 
where Fujimori is lodged. The Peruvian ministers and delegates 
that accompanied Fujimori also attended the meeting. The 
meeting's main topic was Peru's reincorporation into the Andean 
Pact and the problems caused by the differences in tariffs in 
the two countries. 
  Although not anticipated in the official agenda, Gaviria and 
his wife, Milena, invited Fujimori to walk through Ciudad 
Bolivar, Santa Fe de Bogota's largest human settlement, to 
observe up close the government's education and food programs. 
The local residents welcomed the visitors with great 
excitement. Stopping on his walk through the area, Gaviria 
thanked Fujimori for reaffirming his support for Gaviria's 
candidacy for the position of OAS secretary general. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] How did you 
receive 
President Fujimori's announced support for your candidacy for 
OAS secretary general? 
  [Gaviria] I am grateful for this support for an aspiration 
that has not yet crystallized. I thank President Fujimori and 
the Peruvian people for this gesture of trust in me. 
  [Reporter] What does this meeting with the Colombian 
president mean to you, Mr. Fujimori? 
  [Fujimori] It is very fruitful in terms of experience and 
cooperation. As you can see for yourselves, the similarities 
between the peoples of Colombia and Peru are interesting and 
must be taken advantage of. 
  [Reporter] Will you invite the Colombian president to Peru 
so 
he can see the Peruvian people's struggles? 
  [Fujimori] I hope he will be able to visit Peru in the 
remaining five or six months of his term. [end recording]

sentence Juan David Ochoa Vasquez to a six and a half year 
prison term. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Juan Ortiz] Today, the 
Prosecutor 
General's office sentenced Medellin cartel drug trafficker Juan 
David Ochoa Vasquez to six and a half years in prison, within 
the anticipated sentencing framework for the crimes of illicit 
enrichment, drug trafficking, and collusion. At the hearing, 
which lasted approximately four hours, Deputy Prosecutor General 
Francisco Jose Sintura defined the terms of the negotiation, 
which includes the sentence handed down and the payment of a 
multimillion bond. 
  [Sintura] The Prosecutor General's Office decided to impose 
a 
sentence, after granting the reductions allowed by law for 
confessing, voluntarily surrendering to justice, and reaching an 
agreement with us. 
  [Ortiz] With this sentence, Juan David Ochoa could request 
parole in a little more than a year, since by then he will have 
served 75 percent of his sentence, which started on 16 February 
1991. Today's agreement with Juan David Ochoa Vasquez concludes 
the proceedings against the Ochoa familiy, the first one to 
accept surrendering to the law. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the Gonzalo Jimenez de </F>
Quesada Convention Center] 
  [Text] Good evening. Six months before the end of 
President Cesar Gaviria's term, 12 candidates are seeking to 
replace him. At this very moment, the array of candidates is 
being completed with the announcement of Andres Pastrana's 
candidacy at the Convention Center. Pastrana is being nominated 
by a national movement that heads the Conservative Party. Six 
years ago, 40-year-old Pastrana created the New Democratic Force 
[NFD]. The NFD is represented in Congress and the current 
administration. After resigning his seat in Congress six months 
ago, Pastrana began his campaign without talking or acting like 
a candidate. This upset some of his rivals in the conservative 
and liberal parties. The polls always show Pastrana ahead. The 
most recent poll shows Pastrana with 40 percent of the votes and 
Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper with 38 percent. 
  Today, during the event to nominate him, Pastrana is talking 
about his government plan. The plan stresses providing drinking 
water for 10 million Colombians; a revolution in education; and 
a plan for women, youths, and the family.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential hopeful Andres </F>
Pastrana by Dario Arizmendi and unidentified reporters in Santa 
Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] We are greeting the new presidential 
candidate Dr. Andres Pastrana Arango, who last night staged a 
spectacular event in Santa Fe de Bogota worthy of the best 
campaign rally in the United States or Europe -- one that 
featured truly extraordinary organization and the participation 
of more than 3,000 people who packed the Gonzalo Jimenez de 
Quezada Convention Center. Good morning, Dr. Pastrana. 
  [Pastrana] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you satisfied with yesterday's event? 
  [Pastrana] I am very happy, but it is more important that 
Colombians be satisfied, not me. Also, the truth is that we 
succeeded in unveiling most of our platform. The truth is we 
are very happy. 
  [Arizmendi] What do you think are the highlights of your 
platform? 
  [Pastrana] I think it is the whole area of social 
investment, 
something I think has been missing in our country, and all the 
opportunities now arising in Colombia. That is why I think 
most... [pauses] I think this recaps most of what we wanted 
[word indistinct] the time for Colombia has come. I think that 
through the efforts and hard work of all Colombians we are going 
to move ahead. 
  [Arizmendi] Some analysts feel that in last night's speech, 
in some of your promises and chiefly in your slogans, you evoked 
Jose Maria Aznar and his presidential campaign in Spain. His 
slogan was: Spain now. As I understand it, you concluded your 
speech by saying: Do not be mistaken, we are going to win; we 
are going to win. That is how Aznar always concluded his 
speeches. Is your friendship with Aznar responsible for this 
similarity? 
  [Pastrana] [laughs] We did not do it with that in mind, 
despite my friendship with Jose Maria Aznar. I think yesterday 
we tried to create a different style of presenting politics by 
way of a much more direct speech. As you could see, it 
contained examples. The language of the speech appealed to the 
people much more. I tried to explain most of our platform. I 
think the time for Colombia has indeed come, and this is why we 
must begin to work soon to begin to resolve the country's 
problems. 
  [Arizmendi] Are you still a Conservative? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, of course, I am still a Conservative, as I 
said yesterday. I think I was a little repetitive in outlining 
the campaign. Sometimes campaigns center on the wrong things. 
I think the topic of whether or not I am Conservative.... 
[pauses] this was defined a long time ago. I am and will remain 
a Conservative, but I am bringing to the attention of the 
Colombian people an eminently nationwide, suprapartisan 
[suprapartidista] candidacy. As I said yesterday, the campaign 
cannot be centered on whether or not I am Misael Pastrana's son. 
I am the son of Misael Pastrana, whom I love, admire, and 
respect, but as I said yesterday, we have led different lives 
and have been active in politics at different times. I also said 
yesterday that I will not shave my moustache. I said I was not 
going to shave it, and we were going to keep it throughout the 
electoral process. 
  [Arizmendi] Do not worry, I will not shave mine either. 
[laughs] Dr. Pastrana, what role will your father -- former 
President Misael Pastrana Borrero -- play in your political 
campaign? 
  [Pastrana] No, Dario, I believe that.... [pauses] in 
preparing for our campaign we have made great efforts to 
consolidate a significant group that will support us and work 
with us. I believe this was evident yesterday, when our 
candidacy was proclaimed. Naturally, Dario, my father has always 
been close to me. He is an excellent adviser, but naturally we 
are maintaining our organization, and we have clear proposals. 
I believe this is the first time a candidate has presented such 
a complete plan. Not only are we saying what we will do, but 
how we will do it, which in my opinion is the most important 
aspect of our government platform. 
  [Arizmendi] By accepting a suprapartisan Conservative 
candidacy, we imagine your running mate as vice presidential 
candidate will be a Liberal candidate? 
  [Pastrana] That is possible, Dario. You know that from the 
Senate I was possibly the one senator who was most opposed to a 
constitutional amendment by which the vice presidential 
candidate had to be of the same political affiliation as the 
presidential candidate. We won that battle in the Senate, and 
now that door remains open. I believe, Dario, that we must 
wait. The process is just beginning, the parliamentarian 
elections will be in March, and I believe later on in the 
elections process we will elect -- at least in my case -- our 
running mate. 
  [Arizmendi] What profile will that person have, Dr. 
Pastrana? 
  [Pastrana] First, he must be someone who is identified fully 
with our government plan, and logically a person the president 
of the Republic can trust. Those are two conditions I feel the 
vice president should have. 
  [Arizmendi] What are your views regarding the presence of 
foreign troops in our country? Give us your views. 
  [Pastrana] Dario, I believe that troops in Colombia based on 
cooperation agreements that deal with technical aspects or 
aspects related to drug trafficking and terrorism must be 
welcomed here. I believe Colombians should not reject any help 
that will enable us to eradicate drug trafficking and terrorism 
from our country. In facing that situation, I believe we must 
clearly say that the signing of various agreements has been very 
important for our country and that it will continue to be 
important in the future to maintain foreign troops and advisers 
in those fields. I believe this should be clear. 
  What possibly has happened in the Juanchaco case -- and even 
the government has admitted this -- is that there has not been 
enough clarity on the subject. Colombians are demanding 
clarity. In that sense, I believe Colombians have always 
reacted [word indistinct] with regard to the participation of 
foreign troops or advisers in matters important to the country. 
I believe we must support and maintain their presence. 
  [Arizmendi] What is your opinion of the way in which 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo reacted to the decision and 
statement issued by the State Council on how the government 
handled the presence of foreign troops in Juanchaco? 
  [Pastrana]) I believe all positions should be respected. 
What we are having now is a debate with regard to whether the 
Constitution was properly applied or not. The State Council has 
clearly stated its juridical position, and the president of the 
Republic has replied to this position. I believe it is 
important to mention -- and I said this in a news release -- 
that we are talking about the implementation of international 
treaties that are current [words indistinct] and I feel it is 
important and still possible to convoke the Foreign Relations 
Advisory Commission to clear up any doubts that might exist with 
regard to the implementation of current international treaties 
Colombia has signed. 
  [Arizmendi] Will you extend a friendly hand to the five 
members of the Conservative Party who will run against you? 
  [Pastrana] Not only to them, but friends from various 
sectors. We want Conservatives, Liberals, and independents to 
support our presidential candidacy. 
  [Arizmendi] You have identified with President Gaviria's 
economic policy. Some sectors have criticized that policy, 
which has been described as neoliberal and having a high social 
cost. Will you continue the same policy as Gaviria? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, definitely. I believe I said this clearly 
yesterday. On the subject of economic opening, I have said we 
must consolidate the process. President Gaviria has laid the 
foundations for a policy; now we must start building it. Some 
adjustments must be made to the foundations. In our speech 
yesterday we noted that today the government is seeking 
efficiency from the industrialists, but we are not giving them 
the tools to do this. As I said yesterday, I believe if we 
create a good infrastructure to project our country abroad, and 
if we make the necessary adjustments, our country will move 
ahead in the opening process. I also believe -- and I have been 
serious about this -- that we must consolidate all the necessary 
conditions to help the country in the area of social 
investments. We must make great efforts to obtain funds to 
conduct a revolution in education and to consolidate and develop 
rural areas once and for all, as well as consolidate peace and 
tranquility, which is what all Colombians want. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, you have said you will not 
receive any contribution or aid from the Santo Domingo Group for 
the election campaign. Will you adopt the same position with 
regard to other economic groups? 
  [Pastrana] I did not say that. What I have said publicly, as 
you know, is that issue is behind me. I have adopted a clear 
position regarding Colombia's privatization process. I have 
expressed the hope that Colombia's privatization process will 
not constitute a transition from a state monopoly to a private 
sector monopoly. What is at issue is the democratization of our 
institutions and our ability to plan for the future as other 
countries have done under similar circumstances. In Chile and 
other Latin American countries, privatization processes were 
employed to democratize institutions instead of creating 
monopolies. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Andres Pastrana, if you have not said 
publicly that you will not receive economic contributions from 
the Santo Domingo Group, what is your position regarding 
contributions made by various economic groups to your political 
campaign? 
  [Pastrana] You are well aware of the Santo Domingo Group 
case, Dario. The position I have adopted has nothing to do with 
public opinion; it is a personal position. I believe it is 
important to establish rules that will preclude concentrating 
power in the hands of a few and instead truly foster the 
decentralization and democratization of institutions, especially 
those that belong to the state. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, forgive me for insisting, but 
perhaps I did not understand your position. Does this mean you 
will not accept economic aid for your campaign from the Santo 
Domingo Group? 
  [Pastrana] You have asked that question three times, and I 
understood you each time. If the decision were mine to make I 
would say no, but it is a political decision. 
  [Arizmendi] What about other economic groups? Will you 
accept aid from the Ardila Group, Sarmiento Group, or Chavarria 
Group? 
  [Pastrana] Dario, what matters is the management of campaign 
finances, which will not be done directly by Andres Pastrana. 
For that I have appointed Hernan Bell, who is very capable, and 
I have a large group of friends who are helping us amass 
resources to consolidate the upcoming political process. 
  I believe, Dario, that it is important and fortunate that 
democracy exists in Colombia and that the state is largely 
financing the elections. Today the state, through the Electoral 
Law, is supplying funds to congressional, senatorial, council, 
assembly and presidential candidates, depending on the number of 
votes they receive. I believe this is a very significant aspect 
of the Colombian political process, because without that aid 
many people would be unable to campaign. Because of it, 
however, the political process is much more transparent. 
  [Arizmendi] As for transparency, Dr. Pastrana, it would be 
nice to have an explanation of what happened between you and the 
Santo Domingo Group. What did the group do to you or what 
happened to create this situation and to prompt the remarks you 
have made? 
  [Pastrana] I believe this is an internal issue; it is not an 
electoral campaign issue. The fact is that the Santo Domingo 
Group and I know what happened and I do not believe this is an 
issue in the campaign. 
  [Arizmendi] Dr. Pastrana, during your speech last night at 
the Convention Center you referred to a reduction in beer taxes. 
Would you briefly explain your position? 
  [Pastrana] Yes. It is largely an effort to defend the 
incomes of municipalities and departments. I believe we should 
ensure that they maintain a large part of their income from 
taxes on beer, which has been essential to certain municipal and 
departmental projects. 
  [Arizmendi] You have spoken of complete, irreversible 
openness. Do you believe it is equitable for the national beer 
industry to compete with contraband beer on which taxes are not 
paid? 
  [Pastrana] I would not put it that way, Dario. I do not like 
to analyze politics [word indistinct] the way you are doing it. 
I believe you should listen again to the speech I delivered 
yesterday. If I came down hard on anything it was on contraband 
in Colombia. I even made a statement I would characterize as 
very harsh but which truly represents the feelings of the 
Colombian people. I said I believe Colombia's Customs Service 
is an embarrassment and we cannot allow contraband to compete 
against the industrial sector in our national markets. While 
industry is paying manufacturing costs and the VAT [value-added 
tax], contraband is invading our markets. Because of this very 
situation, I have said we must consolidate customs in Colombia 
because the country must try to compete in international markets 
under fair conditions. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Pastrana, in the past Belisario Betancur, 
also a Conservative, made the same call you are making today. 
The Liberals who backed him later paid a high political price 
and lost the elections. Do you believe that they learned their 
lesson and will not support you? Or do you really believe that 
your call on sectors other than the Conservatives will be 
answered? 
  [Pastrana] I believe the call will be heeded, and we know 
that the call has already been heeded in other important 
sectors, Liberal Party friends are accompanying us in this 
campaign. Independent sectors are accompanying us in this 
campaign. I think the country believes in something more than 
the simple political programs of one party or another. What we 
need to present is a true government program, with national 
coverage, which will allow us -- everyone in Colombia -- to 
begin working on a political program in search of the 
development we desire so much in Colombia. This is the 
invitation we have extended to Conservatives, Liberals, and 
independents, and we are certain that with all of their help and 
effort we will consolidate the political program we started 
yesterday. 
  [Arizmendi] What have you calculated to be the cost of your 
political campaign, Dr. Pastrana? 
  [Pastrana] The truth is that I am not familiar with the 
issue. This information is known by those who handle the 
financial aspects of the campaign. I think this is a very good 
question for (Dr. Kelskey), who is in charge of this. I believe 
that as a candidate my job is to go out and tour the country and 
continue to talk with the people. This is what I began doing 
today with my trip to Medellin and Antioquia. 
  [Reporter] Within eight days the Conservative Party 
convention will be held, summoned by the directorates that came 
together after remaining apart right up until a few months ago. 
This convention will probably proclaim you as the official 
Conservative Party presidential candidate. What will be your 
attitude in light of this proclamation? 
  [Pastrana] We truly hope to receive the support of the 
Conservative Party. At the October convention we were asked to 
run as a national candidate. On 18 February, the party will 
decide which candidate it will back in the next elections. The 
truth is that I hope the Conservative Party gives me its 
support, and not only the Conservative Party, but also my 
Liberal Party friends and the independents. I insist that we 
can consolidate the political program I officially presented 
yesterday. 
  [Arizmendi] Will you allow the Conservative Party to exploit 
your image and candidacy? 
  [Pastrana] No, no, the truth is that today the country, if 
it 
has anything clear, Dario, is that we are presenting a national 
candidacy. Logically, I want and trust I will receive my 
party's support, but we will continue with the political program 
-- a national program and plan that goes beyond the party. 
  [Reporter] Are you willing to engage in a dialogue with 
rebel 
candidates such as Rodrigo Marin, Gabriel Melo, and the others 
who have said they will put up a fight to the very end? 
  [Pastrana] If they have said they will put up a fight to the 
very end it will be difficult. Given such circumstances, it is 
important that next Friday -- when the Conservative Party, 
through the method it has chosen, elects a candidate or 
candidates by [words indistinct] -- I gain the Conservative 
Party's support. I believe this is important; my goal is to 
obtain the support of the Conservative Party. 
  [Arizmendi] What is your position on the process that is 
beginning to unfold in the country? This is in reference to the 
surrender to justice and negotiations with members of the Cali 
cartel. 
  [Pastrana] Dario, I hope that this endeavor will be 
realized. 
Nevertheless, I believe that we Colombians are waiting to be 
told what the final goal of this process is. At least from what 
we have heard in the media, the goal is peace, and, therefore, I 
believe it is positive. The truth of the matter is that I have 
been very clear in this regard. I believe the policy of 
surrendering to justice is sound and good as long as it is the 
criminals who surrender to justice and not justice that 
surrenders to the criminals. 
  [Arizmendi] In the Juanchaco case, do you believe that the 
president of the Republic and the defense minister have told the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to the 
Colombia people? 
  [Pastrana] The president of the Republic has said that the 
information on the issue was scant, and this is why I believe it 
was important to accept this and clarify the matter. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Pastrana, thank you very much for your 
discussion with Emisoras Caracol. Our microphones are at your 
disposal, as the Colombians have the right to information. Will 
there be equal opportunity for the various media in covering 
your political campaign? 
  [Pastrana] We expect the opposite will be true. We hope 
there will be balanced coverage in the media of our activities. 
In this way, we will be able to engage in a good electoral 
struggle awaited by all Colombians. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you believe that up until now the media has 
been fair in handling your political activity and your campaign? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, Yes, Dario, I believe that to a great extent 
they have been fair. This is why we hope that now that the 
process has been initiated [words indistinct] our name, we will 
have the opportunity, not only through Emisoras Caracol, but 
also through the various other media, to present to the 
Colombian people what we think and how we expect to resolve the 
nation's problems. 
  [Arizmendi] When I asked what happened to you with the Santo 
Domingo Group, it was to give you an opportunity to clarify this 
incident on the airwaves, directly to the nation. I understand 
it is not a serious incident and it does not have significant 
repercussions. But when matters are not explained, as happened 
in Juanchaco, when the whole truth is not told, then the people 
start speculating. They think: What could have happened? What 
could have they told each other? How did they hurt each other? 
  I understand that a serious incident did not take place, 
regardless of whether the dispute is ongoing, and regardless of 
any type of decision you may have made. Nevertheless, as a 
reporter, I believe it would be good for the nation to know why 
the Santo Domingo Group and Andres Pastrana had a falling out. 
What happened? What is behind the group's attitudes, which have 
started to give way to other attitudes? 
  [Pastrana] What attitudes are you talking about? 
  [Arizmendi] For example, it has been said that you want 
nothing to do with the Santo Domingo Group, that nothing will be 
demanded from the Santo Domingo Group, but that, eventually, 
requests will be made to other sectors. 
  [Pastrana] I am surprised by your question. If I am not 
mistaken, I believe it was through Caracol that I heard a 
communique from the group's president with regard to the issue 
that you are presenting. Theoretically, in that communique 
maybe everything that happened was not explained, but perhaps 
the president of the Santo Domingo Group wanted to give his side 
of the story. 
  [Arizmendi] Very well, Mr. Pastrana, I hope the campaign 
will 
be conducted in a respectful manner, respecting the rules of the 
game for the good of democracy and the good of the nation.

<F P=106> [Paid advertisement by presidential candidate Andres </F>
Pastrana: "Colombia's Time Has Come"] 
  [Text] Here are the seven key points that Andres Pastrana 
pledges to implement during his administration. 
<H5>  1. Economy </H5>
  We are going to consolidate an economic, expeditious, 
and sustainable economic development model. The time for social 
equality and productive efficiency has come. 
  We are going to consolidate the bases for achieving growth 
rates above 8 percent, which requires the broadening of economic 
opportunities and an increase in the productivity of our workers 
at large and small companies. Development will be sustainable. 
Its objective is to benefit the people, chiefly the weak, 
within a policy of conserving the environment. 
  I pledge to expand and consolidate economic openness, 
guarantee macroeconomic stability, strengthen the productive 
capacity of the private sector, and make our government honest, 
humane, and efficient. 
  To conquer foreign markets and make exports one of the 
pillars of our economic growth, we are going to diminish our 
disadvantages in the labor force, technology, and infrastructure. 
  We are going to eliminate the barriers to our 
competitiveness 
first by continuing the reorganization of our customs service. 
  My government will not favor any particular sector or group, 
nor will it make the interests of a segment of society the 
engine of economic growth. 
<H5>  2. Education </H5>
  We are going to make education the foundation of the 
new Colombian man. The time has come to guarantee equality of 
opportunity and to raise the quality of life for Colombians. 
  Millions of children are unable to enroll in school. We are 
going to ensure that at the end of the decade not a single 
Colombian between the ages of 5 and 15 will be without basic 
education. 
  We are going to improve the quality of our education, 
thinking of our development needs, training teachers, offering 
children and young people school supplies, and adjusting higher 
and technological education to the demands of our economy. 
  We are going to raise public spending on science and 
technology from the current .4 percent to 1.5 percent of gross 
domestic product. To handle modernization needs, we will train 
the current labor force and provide advice to our businessmen. 
  Education is more than desks and blackboards. Schools will 
be the heart of our family and community development policy. 
  We will eliminate the double shifts so students spend less 
time on the streets. We are going to stimulate the healthy use 
of free time in our children and young people. 
<H5>  3. Water and Environment </H5>
  We are going to guarantee the preservation of our 
environment. The time has come to make adequate use of our 
natural resources, in particular, our water and forests. 
  At the conclusion of the four-year period, 90 percent of the 
people will have drinking water and at least 80 percent will 
have excellent sewage service. We are going to stimulate the 
use of unconventional technologies in treating sewage to 
preserve our natural resources. 
  We are going to curb the deterioration of hydric resources 
due to improper use. 
  To preserve our soils, we are going to promote irrigation 
and 
drainage policies that will also incorporate 520,00 new hectares 
into agriculture. 
  We are going to implement a plan to preserve our forestry 
resources and conserve hydrographic basins and minibasins. It 
will become necessary to involve the business sector in a 
program of reforestation and adequate development of 
silviculture and timber industry. 
  We will support scientific research and conduct an inventory 
of our natural resources. 
  We are going to promote environmental education, recreation, 
and tourism so all Colombians will be the defenders of our most 
precious natural resources. 
<H5>  4. Agriculture and Industry </H5>
  We are going to impose an active policy of support for 
agriculture. The time has come for the structural adjustment of 
the livestock sector and agroindustry. 
  Openness has exposed the weaknesses of our agricultural and 
livestock sectors. Farmers are not solely responsible for this 
crisis. It is now up to the government to remove the obstacles 
to raising our productive efficiency and being more competitive 
on the international market. 
  Our goal is to increase exports and improve their quality, 
not to lock ourselves into the domestic market. 
  We are going to reinforce technological development in rural 
areas and build an irrigation infrastructure in places where it 
is most needed. 
  We are going to improve our marketing mechanisms. 
  We are going to develop information and administration 
systems to expedite decisions so farmers can be safe from 
unnecessary risks. 
  It will become indispensable to stress planning and 
orientation so farmers know what, when, and how to plant. We 
are going to turn our peasants into rural businessmen. 
<H5>  5. Infrastructure </H5>
  We are going to modernize and overcome deficiencies in 
the physical infrastructure. The time has come for 
international competitiveness and Colombia's true regional 
integration. 
  Deficiencies in communications, roads, and energy raise the 
cost of production for businessmen and society and make us less 
competitive. It is time modernize our infrastructure. 
  We are going to build the first 750 km of high specification 
freeways, improve 9,000 km of the ones that already exist, and 
provide adequate maintenance to 70,000 km of roads. 
  We are going to repair 1,600 km of railroad. 
  Through a policy of reliability and efficiency, the 
country's 
energy consumption will be balanced. Colombia remains 
vulnerable in electric energy and fuels. 
  We are going to modernize our communications technology. 
  We are going to invest all necessary resources in the 
Atlantic Coast to turn it into the most attractive destination 
of the Caribbean. 
<H5>  6. Security and Justice </H5>
  We are going to restore the rule of law to make our 
country more just. The time has come to guarantee citizens a 
more secure existence. 
  We will be inflexible in crushing and punishing all forms of 
crime. We are going to be ruthless with those who insist on 
destroying the country. We are going to strengthen the Armed 
Forces and the Police and emphasize intelligence mechanisms. 
  We do not endorse the decriminalization of the production, 
trafficking, or consumption of drugs. We are going to support 
programs to substitute crops, control the marketing of chemical 
precursors, and crush drug trafficking without hesitation. 
  We are going to decisively combat kidnapping and guarantee 
that the perpetrators of this horrendous crime are severely 
punished. 
  We are going to stimulate the support of citizens to combat 
this crime. Cynicism, complacency, individualism 
[individualismo], and negligence are Colombia's chief enemies. 
  We are going to defend the human rights of all Colombians. 
  We are going expedite Colombians' access to justice and 
establish mechanisms to reconcile and solve conflicts among 
those involved without the need to appeal to the courts. 
<H5>  7. Modernization of the State </H5>
  We are going to take a step forward in modernizing our 
institutions and government-private sector relations. The time 
has come for a humane, honest, and efficient state. 
  To have a more prosperous country, it is fundamental to have 
a state that is more efficient, modern, and responsible in its 
obligations. We are going to combat without hesitation any 
form of corruption in either the government or private sector by 
strengthening the Attorney General's Office and advancing all 
legal and administrative measures to attain that goal. 
  We are going to further administrative and fiscal 
decentralization so territorial entities can have true autonomy 
and there can be an efficient allocation of jurisdiction and 
resources. We are going to orient public spending toward a 
search for greater efficiency and equality in public 
administration. 
  We are going to introduce in the public sector modern 
methods 
of organization and management to provide better service. 
  We are going to give dignity to public functions to 
extricate 
them from political interests so they can be at the service of 
all.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez and Azucena Lievano; from the "24 </F>
Hours" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Alvaro Gomez [leader of the National Salvation 
Movement, MSN] replied to Andres Pastrana today and in so doing 
made the political news of the year: The MSN backs fully the New 
Democratic Force [NFD] leader. 
  [Gomez] "We know if we free politics from its current 
commitments, Colombians will be able to change those hopes into 
national goals. We have seen in your presidential campaign, in 
your independence, in the clear style you have given it, and in 
your sensible proposals an opportunity to again effect these 
tasks in which we have believed all along." 
  The day before, Pastrana had sent Gomez a letter in which 
Pastrana pledged to carry out a deep political renewal, 
beginning with a moral recovery as a proposal for the 
consolidation of democracy. 
  [Gomez] "You have the intelligence and knowledge to carry 
out 
all of this and what is even more valuable, the aptitude to 
instill credibility." 
  Gomez then replied to all types of questions. He said on no 
account will he run for president, that the choice of vice 
president will be entirely up to Pastrana. 
  [Gutierrez] "Is it an adherence, a support, an alignment 
from 
the political point of view?" 
  [Gomez] "It is support; naturally, it is an attempt to 
fulfill a dream, because the MSN has always wanted to have a 
proposal for Colombians. Our desire to always have a proposal 
was made possible via Dr. Pastrana." 
  The decision to back Pastrana is not an act against the 
Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, or the government; it is 
for a change, Gomez concluded. 
  Alvaro Gomez Hurtado's support for the Pastrana campaign is 
of immense political and personal value, according to Andres 
Pastrana Arango. He said this support strengthens the party's 
union for the presidential elections. 
  [Pastrana] "It is especially meaningful, because we agree on 
the program. Just as Alvaro Gomez himself said in his message 
and as I have said, this is a flight plan; there are important 
points of agreements regarding the program we have presented for 
Colombians to examine." 
  According to Pastrana, this is the consolidation of a 
political process, but more than a victory, Pastrana says 
politics have changed: 
  [Pastrana] "We have clearly demonstrated one can leave 
behind 
old feelings of resentment and situations that arose between the 
Pastrana and Gomez families." 
  The presidential candidate said he is pleased with the entry 
of the MSN party, and the doors are open for other groups. He 
said contacts with leader Alvaro Gomez started the day his 
candidacy was launched, and campaign coordinator Luis Alberto 
Moreno handled the contacts.

<F P=106> [EL ESPECTADOR editorial: "Traumas of the `Apertura' </F>
Program"] 
  [Text] In our editorials, with some reservations in cases 
of disagreement, we have noted Colombia's gains to date through 
the "apertura" [economic liberalization program] and its 
execution. That is fair and appropriate for an objective 
analysis of the facts, since without an effective application of 
the model--so different from what we had before--Colombia could 
not have overcome the economic challenges that have emerged 
because of a transformation imposed not only by official 
government policies, but also by market dynamics. Events in the 
last decade have created a 360-degree change in the course of 
the entire world, forcing old powers to accede to a new 
international reality. 
  Even so, the nation, not just the government, failed to 
anticipate many factors that should have been considered 
earlier. Apart from the hasty implementation of an "apertura" 
that should have been gradual (as the former minister of 
development and now presidential candidate Ernesto Samper 
proposed), other factors creating maladjustments have come into 
play, sometimes as a consequence of the government's action, and 
at other times as a corollary of the business strategy designed 
to suffer as little as possible from the traumas of the change 
in economic model. So the "apertura" has produced different 
reactions in each economic sector, even in the same sector, 
depending on the subsectors' level of development. 
  If our memory is correct, on various occasions we strongly 
suggested that greater administrative efficiency was needed in 
government agencies handling imports, exports, and foreign trade 
in general. Without that efficiency--let there be no mistake 
about this--the goals pursued would be weakened by failures and 
omissions that would impair both competitiveness and the 
economic policy itself. We knew, of course, that the ideal of an 
efficient Colombia is a remote aspiration, but even so, the 
obvious successes of a transition to which almost all the 
countries of the world have committed themselves show that 
improvements are possible in a process that entails a period of 
experiments and learning. 
  To take one example, the situation in the import sector at 
the start of a year that was expected to be active is hard to 
comprehend. The possibility that the arrival and acceptance of 
imported goods might be impeded because there are no forms for 
the required procedures did not occur to anyone. The standards 
for the new valuation code were approved three months ago, 
sufficient time to prepare such an essential instrument. All of 
us, both those involved in this sector and those who are simply 
onlookers, were surprised by the government's failure to take a 
basic but valuable step to protect both importers and the state. 
  No less damaging for the "apertura" and the current 
privatizations policy is the situation concerning the transfer 
of ports to the private companies that will manage and operate 
them, especially as it has arisen just a few hours before the 
disappearance of Colpuertos [Colombian Port Enterprise] from the 
national administrative map. These are two strikes against the 
external sector that will definitely hurt both its structure and 
the pace of its normal operations. A few more requirements 
placed upon the public officials responsible for satisfying such 
urgent needs, even severe penalties if warranted, would be no 
bad thing if we truly want to become internationalized along 
with our partners and competitors in a complex market. 
  We are offering the preceding comments because a government 
nearing the end of its term in office is obliged to preserve the 
prestige of the policy it has adopted, and to exercise the 
controls required so that procedural matters will not dissipate 
the vigor of that policy. Furthermore, we believe the 
presidential candidates should pay attention to what is 
happening, so that whoever wins the election will be well aware 
of the problems he may face in an area that is crucial for the 
economy and for the stability of the nation in general. We hope 
these maladjustments will be reviewed and suitable correctives 
applied.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Urdinola: "Industry Is Weakening"] </F>
  [Text] Last week, in looking at the country's economic 
prospects for 1994, we saw how the increasing revaluation of the 
peso has created two very different groups. On the one hand, we 
have construction and services, both public and private, which 
are expanding rapidly and reporting high profits; and, on the 
other hand, we have most of agriculture, mining, and industry, 
as well as some internationally negotiable services, such as 
tourism and big business credit, where profits are declining, as 
are growth and job creation. 
  It is very likely that the economy will continue to be 
spurred on by construction and services in 1994, especially in 
the country's principal cities, where overt unemployment has 
fallen below 8 percent for the first time in many years. But 
these rosy statistics on urban unemployment and GDP [gross 
domestic product] conceal another story, one whose impact the 
next administration will have to grapple with. 
  The composition of production and employment is changing at 
a 
dizzying pace. The uncontrolled opening of the economy and the 
revaluation of the peso are leading to the deindustrialization 
of the country and a decline in the proportion of stable, 
well-paying jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
  Construction and services do create jobs, but the jobs are 
less secure and pay less than those in industry. The labor 
reform measures, which did a great deal to make this market more 
flexible, have had the opposite result of what was expected: The 
proportion of workers in the informal sector has gone up as a 
result of the payroll cutbacks and the expansion of services. 
  The development model that the next government will inherit 
is thus much more like Spain's than like Taiwan's. The 
hypertrophy of construction and services, derived from a 
revalued currency and short-term foreign capital movements, is 
something very different from what the Asian Tigers have done to 
create economies based on the export of increasingly 
sophisticated manufactured goods. Our case is more similar to 
that of Spain before the peseta collapsed and the construction 
boom subsided while the flow of foreign capital stopped in a 
fearful response to the growing balance of trade deficit.

  [Text] Some 30,000 rural residents have joined the ranks of 
the unemployed in the last year. In September 1992, there were 
246,101 people without jobs, and in the same month last year, 
that number had swelled to 276,081. 
  This was revealed in the National Administrative Department 
of Statistics (DANE) National Household Survey, which polled 
7,000 households in 148 municipal jurisdictions in the Atlantic, 
Eastern, Central, and Pacific Regions. The former National 
Territories were not included. 
  Rural unemployment rose by 0.5 percent between September 
1992 
and the same month of last year, from 4.4 to 4.9 percent. In 
addition, the number of people who are able to work increased by 
only 0.2 percent. 
  The number of employed people in the rural population 
dropped 
by 0.4 percent, from 5,382,837 to 5,362,768, between 1992 and 
1993. The number of jobless workers climbed by 12.2 percent, 
from 246,101 to 276,081 during the period studied by the DANE. 
  The working-age rural population grew by 2.3 percent, from 
10,282,199 to 10,519,668. 
<H5>  No Work on the Coast </H5>
  The Atlantic Coast Region, made up of the departments of 
Bolivar, Cesar, Magdalena, Cordoba, Sucre, Guajira, and 
Atlantico, has the highest rural unemployment rate, 5.5 percent 
of all working-age persons. 
  According to the DANE study, the number of jobless workers 
in 
this region of the country went from 64,499 to 70,049, out of a 
total rural population of 3,317,941 as of September of last year. 
  The second-highest unemployment rate was found in the 
Pacific 
Region (Choco, Cauca, Narino, and Valle), although it was down 
from 1992. According to the DANE, the jobless rate was 5 percent 
in this region as of September 1993, while the rate had been 5.3 
percent in the same month of 1992. 
  The unemployment figure for the Eastern Region (Boyaca, 
Cundinamarca, Meta, and Santander) is still one of the lowest in 
the country at 4.7 percent, although it has increased in the 
last year. 
  The region with the least unemployment is the middle of the 
country, comprising the departments of Antioquia, Caldas, 
Risaralda, Quindio, Tolima, Huila, and Caqueta. 
  According to the DANE, the total population in the Central 
Region grew by 52,000 people during the year, while the number 
of working-age peasants rose 2.8 percent.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments through 15 February: 
  Foreign Trade Minister Juan Santos has said the Group of 
Three's (G-3) agreement to create a free trade zone -- the 
Agreement of Economic Cooperation -- has not been stalled by 
tariff issues. According to Santos, the members of the G-3 -- 
Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico -- fully agree on tariffs, and 
he added that only small details are pending. He also said that 
if everything goes according to plan, the agreement will be 
signed within 30 days. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1955 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  The multinational oil firm Dutch Shell has asked the 
Colombian Government for a 10-year extension of its concession 
for the exploitation of an oil field in the southern department 
of Huila. The oil field, which is scheduled to revert to the 
state on 18 November, yields 18,000 barrels of crude a day. 
Shell said that if the extension is granted, it will comply 
with the terms established by the government and will pay 
corresponding royalties. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2035 GMT 9 Feb 
94) 
  Official sources said today that Colombia was able to 
increase its banana exports by 10.8 percent during the past year 
despite the difficulties this Latin American export is facing in 
the European market. In 1993, banana exports yielded $400 
million in revenues. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1833 GMT 10 
Feb 94) 
  The expected revenues Colombia will receive from the Cusiana 
oil bonanza have prompted the government to request $400 million 
less in new loans than the planned amount for 1994. This 
measure seeks to avoid a greater increase in international 
reserves, which could interfere with exchange and monetary 
policies. In addition, the government seeks to reduce the 
foreign public debt from $15 billion to $10 billion from now 
until the year 2,000. The Executive Branch has already notified 
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank of the 
move. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 pp 1A, 
1B, 3B)

<F P=106> [Relay from Concepcion by Manuela Robles] </F>
  [Text] The key points of the speech by President Patricio 
Aylwin during a luncheon at the Araucano Hotel, in Concepcion, 
following the dedication of the oil pipeline between Neuquen 
[Argentina] and Concepcion [Chile] dealt with strengthening the 
historic friendship between the two countries and solving 
controversies through agreements and the law. The inauguration 
of this new project is highly significant from the integration 
and economic viewpoint. 
  On this occasion the Chilean chief of state said: 
  We may have differences because brothers and friends are not 
obliged to always share the same interests or think alike. But 
we know how to overcome our disagreements by searching for 
agreements or through procedures established by law for peaceful 
solutions that will be mutually beneficial. 
  President Aylwin said that this is the path we have always 
taken. 
  Argentine President Carlos Menem, in turn, thanked God for 
allowing him to participate in this event. He praised Aylwin 
and said that the Chilean people were marvelous. He also 
referred to the Argentine bible, the gaucho bible, saying: As I 
was telling Patricio, in Argentina we have another bible, the 
gaucho bible entitled Martin Fierro by author Jose Hernandez 
that in one of its paragraphs, probably paraphrasing God, says: 
one of the first rules is that brothers should remain united 
because if they fight among themselves they will be devoured by 
others. 
  President Menem also voiced his hope that this climate of 
understanding and unity shared by Chile and Argentina will 
continue during the next Chilean administration, which will be 
Peaded by Eduardo Frei. He noted that history has been very 
generous with the two countries that this is the challenge they 
face in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Tuesday the director of the Investigations 
Police, Nelson Mery, announced the formation of the National 
Financial Crimes Office. The reasons the police chief cited are 
quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received 
3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered 
818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders 
issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But 
over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge 
amounts stolen through fraud had multipled by a factor of at 
least three. 
  Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and 
the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and 
instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported 
cases of computer fraud. 
  In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic 
Crimes Brigade] "is a unit that has shown a great increase in 
efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with 
intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much 
greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals 
cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects 
that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of 
fraud and swindling." [passage omitted] 
  A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it 
has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a 
high-ranking police official said, of "the difficult changes in 
the Chilean economy." 
  Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it 
is an eminently economic crime, for this "black" money comes not 
only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking, 
and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that 
needs to be laundered. 
  To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to 
enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it 
a year ago. 
  Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who 
will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys 
from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade 
their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy. 
  Six officers, including police officers with accounting 
degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are 
experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct 
support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well 
as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. 
  Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem 
favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their 
base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery 
said, "No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail."

  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 28 Jan, CANA -- Dominica's trade 
minister, Charles Maynard, says he is more interested in having 
better Caribbean trade than in boosting trade among the wider 
developing nations. For example, he said, over any "South/South" 
trade, he would welcome an opportunity for "shipping things into 
Barbados." 
  "Let us look at more trade with our neighbours. Let us look 
at more trade in Caricom (the Caribbean Community). Let us look 
at more trade with Guadeloupe and Martinique," Maynard 
suggested. He was reacting to agronomist Arthie Martin's 
suggestion that Caribbean countries should engage in more 
South/South trade. 
  Martin said that traditional trading arrangement which small 
countries like Dominica have with the industrialised world might 
take a beating from international trade arrangements like the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  Maynard said: "We have engaged in a programme of moving into 
trade with Venezuela... Despite that, this has been on for more 
than a year ... We have not seen any breakthrough." He also 
pointed to trade-related matters with Colombia and other Latin 
American countries, which "have remained merely at the level of 
discussions." He urged local manufacturers here to try to expand 
their exports in and out of the region.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the "Notes and Information" page: "A </F>
Longstanding Misunderstanding"] 
  [Text] This will be an important week for Brazil to get a 
clear idea as to how its relations with developed countries, 
especially the United States and Germany, will go. It is true 
that for many in Brasilia there are other issues of greater 
strategic significance, such as the community of 
Portuguese-speaking countries. This idea, which was conceived 
by Ambassador Jose Aparecido, was put into motion on the evening 
of 10 February at a dinner hosted by President Itamar Franco and 
attended by representatives of Portuguese-speaking countries 
from this continent and abroad. Similarly, the Workers Party 
[PT] does not consider Foreign Minister Celso Amorim's trips to 
Washington and Bonn to be important. The hints given by PT 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Lula to Japanese businessmen about 
his foreign policy lead one to believe that he is going to seek 
to replace trade and economic relations with the United States 
with stronger ties with Andean Pact member countries. The 
prevailing idea in other parties is that foreign policy is for 
experts! These are strategic options, although strange ones! 
  It is within this backdrop of "circumstances" that Amorim 
will be telling the Americans that Brazil is neither engaging in 
unfair trade practices nor failing to protect intellectual 
property rights, and the Germans that Brazil is not planning to 
tread the path of nuclear proliferation. In Bonn, Amorim's task 
will be easier in light of the Senate's approval of the 
agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
which will allow him to ask for "time" for the Brazilian Senate 
to approve the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty. In 
Washington, however, his task will be tough -- and the public 
must be prepared for a possible failure of his mission that will 
affect the steel, paper, cellulose, and orange juice industries. 
  In his negotiations with the U.S. trade representatives, 
Amorim will certainly try to undo some old knots stemming from 
mutual misunderstandings, misinterpretations, unwarranted 
jingoism, missionary concepts dating back to the time of the 
gunboats, and dollar diplomacy. The U.S. administration must 
tell the U.S. Congress whether U.S. commercial interests are 
being respected in Brazil, while the Brazilian foreign minister 
will seek to persuade his U.S. counterparts that the Brazilian 
Government has adopted a foreign policy that in many cases 
displeases the White House and the State Department because it 
also has national interests to protect. For a government that 
administers a GDP totaling trillions of dollars, it should not 
be hard to understand that in a country administering a GDP that 
amounts to a few hundred billion dollars, the concepts of 
"commercial" and "industrial" are often confused with the 
concept of "national." In fact, last week President Clinton was 
able to note that this confusion exists even in Japan. All 
things considered, however, the U.S. pressure stems primarily 
from the fact that in Washington there is also confusion about 
what is national and what is related to the private economic 
sector. Looking at things coolly, Amorim may have been able to 
succeed in his efforts had it not been for the many years of 
frequent misunderstandings we have mentioned earlier. 
  In addition to other issues that are rather delicate but not 
relevant, the Brazilian-U.S. dispute today revolves around the 
patent draft law being studied in the Senate. We have time and 
again said that had it been voted on on time, many of the U.S. 
complaints would have been avoided. The irony of the whole 
story is that the government of Itamar Franco will have to 
endure the consequences of something for which it cannot be held 
responsible (except for the laxity that has become its 
trademark): It was during the tenure of Senator Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso as foreign minister that the executive branch 
made every possible effort to make the Chamber of Deputies pass 
the patent law. The law includes points upholding Brazilian 
interests that are unacceptable to U.S. pharmaceutical lobbying 
groups. Amorim and Mickey Kantor, the U.S. trade 
representative, will have their hands tied by that intangible 
thing known as "national interest," which is always present in 
diplomatic and commercial negotiations. An understanding would 
be in the best interests of security in the hemisphere, but 
unfortunately this is not the way things are seen in Washington 
and Brasilia. We should thus prepare for a courteous but tough 
dialogue that might yield predictable but undesirable 
consequences.

<F P=106> [Communique on text of Note D.M. No. 158/94 dated 11 </F>
February signed by Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
and addressed to U.S. Ambassador Deane R. Hinton] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Communique </H5>
  Regarding publications by local and international news media 
on statements issued by a State Department official pronouncing 
the national government has not made efforts to fight the 
laundering of drug-trafficking money, the Foreign Ministry would 
like to make public the note sent to the U.S. ambassador by 
Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino, as follows: 
  "Note D.M. No. 158/94 
  11 February 1994 
  Mr. Ambassador: 
  I have the honor of addressing Your Excellency in reference 
to public statements by a State Department official named Robert 
Gelbard to the effect that our government has not made any 
efforts to fight the laundering of drug-trafficking money. Our 
government rejects strongly these statements in view that 
serious and decided actions to fight these crimes have been 
taken since 1990. 
  I list hereunder the main actions our government has taken 
regarding the fight against drug trafficking. 
  1. The Executive Branch on 23 September 1993 presented to 
the Republic of Panama's Legislative Assembly the draft bill to 
approve the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 28 
December 1988, which was approved as Law No. 20 dated 7 December 
1993 and was published in Official Publication No. 22,429, dated 
9 December 1993. 
  2. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty on Drug Trafficking 
signed between the Republic of Panama and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 1 March 1993 was discussed 
by the Legislative Assembly's Foreign Relations Commission 
during a first debate. It is pending approval in the next 
session that is due to begin on 1 March. 
  3. On the occasion of the 14th Meeting of Central American 
Presidents held in Guatemala City between 28 to 29 October 1993, 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty for Penal Affairs between 
Central American countries and Panama was signed. In addition, 
the Constitutive Agreement of the Permanent Central American 
Commission for the Eradication of the Production, Traffic, 
Consumption, and Illicit Use of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances was also signed. 
  4. The Republic of Panama and the Republic of Colombia 
signed the following bilateral agreements on 19 November 1993. 
  4.1 Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance and Judicial 
Cooperation. 
  4.2 Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance With Relation to 
the Illegal Trafficking of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. 
  4.3 Agreement on Measures to Prevent Diversion of Chemical 
Precursors and Essential Substances. 
  5. From 31 January to 4 February, Panamanian and Canadian 
delegations held talks on the projected mutual legal assistance 
treaties on drug trafficking and related crimes, treaties that 
are to be signed between the two countries. 
  6. Now that the Governments of Panama and Mexico have 
expressed their intent to conclude a mutual legal assistance 
treaty, it remains for the two governments to set a date for 
opening negotiations leading to the signing of such a treaty. 
  7. As part of the actions and goals that the Panamanian 
Government has outlined to combat drug trafficking and related 
crimes, strategies have been devised to reduce the risk of our 
economy and banking center being used for money laundering. 
National strategies have been devised for general prevention 
policies through the community, specifically, through the mass 
training of primary, secondary, and university students. In 
addition, a National Documentation Center, attached to the 
Attorney General's Office, has been created to coordinate 
general meetings on the rate and prevention of drug use. 
Specialized training programs aimed at government employees, 
civic club members, and private enterprise personnel have also 
been developed. 
  8. More and more prevention programs have been developed 
through the National Commission for the Study and Prevention of 
Drug-Related Crimes, Conapred, an interinstitutional commission 
created by Law No. 23, dated 20 December 1986. This law, better 
known as the Drug Law, also provides the necessary juridical 
structure to punish anyone who one way or another participates 
in money laundering. 
  Of a similar nature is Decree No. 41 of 1990, which 
stipulates the banks' duty to properly identify their clients 
and require that they make any necessary statements to certify 
the origin of their deposits or the destination of cash 
withdrawals exceeding $10,000. This decree has been augmented by 
National Banking Commission rulings aimed at checking the use of 
our banking center for activities related to drug trafficking. 
Furthermore, important meetings with high-level representatives 
of your government were held in our country in 1993 to devise 
joint strategies that make it possible to expand our working 
capability in this important sphere of our economic activities. 
High-level officials of the Panamanian Government have 
participated in these meetings as evidenced by our willingness 
and interest as a government. 
  9. The Attorney General's Office, in an effort to 
strengthen actions executed by the Specialized Secretariat for 
Drug Related Crimes, investigation agencies, and the Technical 
Judicial Police (PTJ), has established an office specializing in 
drug related crimes in every district. The assistant secretariat 
offices carry out raids and other proceedings as part of 
investigating drug related crimes. Their work is evident from 
one end of the country to the other. 
  10. The Attorney General's Office has also organized an 
Information and Audiovisual Resource Center for drug related 
problems; it operates under the Attorney General's Office. The 
center has the latest information on drug addiction, which 
negatively affects elementary, high school, and university 
students throughout the country. The center also offers aid and 
support, with specialized audiovisual and technical material, to 
the Catholic Church and other churches established in the 
Republic of Panama that have plans for the prevention and 
eradication of drugs in our country. 
  11. Within the policy to strengthen the fight against drugs 
and drug trafficking, the Attorney General has submitted a bill 
with reforms to current legislation on drugs to the Legislative 
Assembly. The Attorney General has said the bill reorganizes 
crimes dealing with international drug trafficking; incoporates 
aggravating circumstances concerning the purchase, sale, or 
transfer of drugs; regulates surveillance procedures during drug 
deliveries and covert operations; and creates two district 
attorney's offices specialized in drug related crimes, with 
authority and jurisdiction throughout the country. 
  12. The actions carried out by government authorities in 
charge of preventing drug related crimes have resulted in the 
seizure of many thousands of kilograms of cocaine, marijuana, 
methamphetamines, and bazuko, and over $7 million in cash, 
presumably for laundering through our banking center. As a 
result of these actions, more than 400 persons of different 
nationalities have been arrested and legal action has been taken 
against them. 
  In addition, our government has agreed to continue working 
with Your Excellency's government in everything relating to 
cooperation by U.S. Government agencies to our national 
authorities so that, based on Panamanian legal procedures, the 
latter can successfully carry out operations to confiscate drugs 
in different sectors of our country. We also hope to strengthen 
our National Air Service so it can work to destroy alleged coca 
plantations in the Darien area -- a necessary effort to prevent 
cocaine production in our territory. 
  I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay which 
your country's Senate has suffered in ratifying the Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty for Criminal Affairs signed by the two 
countries in April 1991 and approved by our Legislative Assembly 
in Law 20 on 22 June 1991. All these years of delay by the U.S. 
Senate in ratifying this important legal instrument, undermines 
the authority of your government officials to criticize the 
collaboration that the Government of the Republic of Panama 
undertakes with your and other countries to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The fact that the limitations we face in fighting this 
deadly 
scourge are real and, oftentimes, affect the results surely does 
not escape Your Excellency's enlightened criteria. It is 
unacceptable, however, for U.S. officials to express criticisms 
that do not seriously reflect the real attitude and will of the 
Panamanian Government in fighting this powerful, international 
criminal network. Not even in the United States, despite all its 
resources, has the enormous consumption of drugs been 
effectively controlled; however, this real impossibility is not 
an excuse for merrily saying that the U.S. Government is not 
tirelessly working to fight the consumption and traffic of 
narcotics. 
  I hope and trust, Mr. Ambassador, that the entire contents 
of 
this letter will be conveyed to the corresponding authorities of 
your country with the aim of clarifying our position and 
expressing our strong rejection of such irresponsible statements 
which undermine the good name of our country. 
  I take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate to Your 
Excellency my highest esteem. 
  [Signed] Jose Raul Mulino, foreign relations minister 
  To Your Excellency Deane R. Hinton, ambassador of the United 
States of America.

  [Text] The Peace Commission [Copaz] has decided not to 
include the subject of the Truth Commission with international 
verification in the dialogue with the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] due to resume within the next few days. 
  Copaz President Hector Rosada Granados has explained 
publicly 
the opposition among various sectors within the Army to include 
this topic in the talks; therefore, it will be left pending for 
a future opportunity. Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez, a retired 
military officer, stated this comment this morning. 
  [Begin Domiguez recording] The Truth Commission is a 
commission that, if it were to be formed, should be more within 
the legal framework rather than a political framework. The 
political framework will only serve to stir things up and seek 
confrontation between the various political trends and sectors; 
thus, none of the sectors or the Guatemalan people have anything 
to gain from such a strong confrontation, as was seen in the 
past in Argentina and more recently in El Salvador. 
  If the Truth Commission really serves to heal wounds and 
identify, within the framework of the law, those who in the past 
have harmed the country, then the commission is correct. If 
what is sought instead are ways to reopen wounds and cause the 
Guatemalan people to shed blood again, we must be very careful.

  [Text] Congressmen Osvaldo Sandoval and Lourdes Flores 
Nano, as well as retired General Sivencio Jarama, today 
disagreed with both the law dealing with jurisdiction for 
handling the La Cantuta case and the U.S. Government 
pronouncement on this issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Flores Nano] The opposition has filed an 
amparo recourse, which will have to go through the normal 
proceedings and even be taken to international courts. The 
opposition has filed a reconsideration recourse, which still 
must be ruled on. The opposition will demand that the 
Constitutional Court Law be enacted and, with the people's 
support, will take the appropriate legal action to challenge the 
decision's constitutionality. 
  [Sandoval] I would say this communique has been released too 
hastily, without first assessing the context of the 
circumstances under discussion in the past few days. 
  [Reporter] According to the communique, the subject is 
particularly sensitive regarding the international environment, 
which demands a clear investigation. What would you say about 
these two words? 
  [Jarama] I would say we all demand clarity in the 
investigation. I think we all agree on the communique's final 
remarks. We must reach the conclusion that the current 
government's officials are unwilling to create the necessary 
mechanisms to consolidate the groundwork for a true democratic 
system in the country. I am concerned over how little is being 
done on the positive side and how much is being done to destroy 
the country's institutionality. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Darcy Queen; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] When the country thought the controversy between 
President Cesar Gaviria and the State Council had ended, the 
president sent a letter to the council members, offering them 
his respect. The council members decided to answer with silence 
and to abstain from answering any message. They will wait for 
the results of an investigation being conducted by the Attorney 
General's Office and Congress. This is President Gaviria's 
answer to the State Council: 
  Given the declaration approved by you yesterday I want to 
address, through you, all the council members to reassert, as a 
citizen and president of Colombia, that that high-ranking 
organization deserves my greatest respect; and, by defending the 
government's views in connection with the cooperation given by 
foreign military members in our country, I did not seek to 
insult that important organization. Instead, I wanted to 
clearly state our views on matters that are extremely important 
for the country. 
  I fully share your views, meaning you would rather wait 
until 
a debate is held in Congress to carefully analyze the two sides' 
position. In the end, allow me to tell you I do not consider 
this disparity of viewpoints to be a confrontation between 
branches. Instead, it is a characteristic of a democracy.

  [Text] Santiago, 13 Feb (EFE) -- The Senate and the Chamber 
of Deputies, during a joint session, today approved a 
constitutional reform reducing the presidential term in Chile 
from eight to six years. 
  The uneventful approval of this reform by 120 votes to six, 
with one abstention, allows President-elect Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle to take his oath for a six-year term on 11 March. 
Chile thus returns to the traditional six-year presidential 
terms that was applied until the coup d'etat of 11 September 
1973. 
  The Constitution promulgated by the military junta in 1980 
approved an eight-year term, which Frei described as "too long." 
  A four-year term without reelection was approved for 
President Patricio Aylwin, but an agreement was finally reached 
to reinstate the traditional six-year terms. 
  To approve this constitutional reform, the opposition and 
the 
ruling party had to vote together to comply with the high 
quorums required to introduce any change in the Constitution 
that was bequeathed by the military regime. 
  The session of the so-called Plenary Congress began shortly 
before noon after a brief two-minute delay, even though most 
legislators are on their summer vacations. The minimum quorum 
required was met with 114 of the 166 legislators in attendance. 
  Those who voted against the reform were three conservative 
National Renewal Party deputies, one Independent Democratic 
Union deputy, dissident Socialist Party legislator Mario 
Palestro, and Senator Ronald McIntyre, who represents the Navy's 
stance and was not elected but appointed by former dictatorial 
President General Augusto Pinochet.

  [Editorial Report] The Central Bank of Costa Rica has 
issued a report saying that for the past three years Costa Rica 
has been one the of the "Latin American countries with the 
greatest increases in the price of its foreign debt on the 
international market." In 1990, the face value of the country's 
foreign debt was 30 percent; in 1993 it surpassed 82 percent. 
Between 1991 and 1993 Costa Rica paid $1.525 billion in 
principal and interest on its foreign debt, thereby lowering the 
burden of its foreign debt. Central Bank President Jorge 
Corrales believes this is the result of appropriate 
macroeconomic policies. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 1 Feb 94

  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said yesterday that 
the U.S. Government is willing to initiate -- during the second 
half of this year -- talks with Argentina on its participation 
in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) comprising 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  The foreign minister indicated that during a meeting in 
Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told him 
about "the willingness for an opening and that countries which 
have implemented economic reforms take precedence." 
  Di Tella stressed that the United States has sold the 
Skyhawk 
fighter planes to Argentina, despite British opposition, because 
"it has admitted that our country is a reliable country, even 
from a military viewpoint." He encouraged the United Kingdom 
"to review this new event." 
  The minister denied that the sale of Skyhawk planes 
satisfied 
the British. He pointed out that, quite the contrary, the 
British authorities "staged a stubborn and systematic opposition 
because, from a military viewpoint, Argentina did not seem to be 
reliable." 
  During an interview with Radio Mitre, Di Tella said the 
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands "represents an issue that 
is systematically discussed" with the British. He stressed that 
before making any decision, the British should consider the 
islanders' will.

Guillermo Lopez as new Supreme Court justices. 
  The Senate unanimously approved the decision made in the 
morning by the members of the Appointments Committee, chaired by 
Justicialist Party Senator Deolindo Bittel. The Appointments 
Committee passed judgment on the proposals submitted by the 
executive branch. 
  The committee rejected an objection to the Lopez record that 
was formally raised by trustees of a faction of the National 
Railway Union. 
  The objection alleged that when Lopez served as a judge of 
the labor court, he passed a biased judgment, favoring [National 
Railway Union leader] Jose Pedraza in an electoral conflict in 
his labor union. 
  The new justices will replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano 
Cavagna Martinez, who resigned their posts in the Supreme Court 
in order to meet the terms established in a pact between 
President Carlos Menem and [Radical Civic Union president] Raul 
Alfonsin on constitutional reform. 
  During the session, the Senate also approved the promotion 
of 
Army Colonel Enrique Alberto Grazzini. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Claudia Boragni: "Another Italian Firm Invests </F>
in the Country"] 
  [Text] Shake in your boots, competitors. The king of 
laundry has landed in Argentina. 
  With $40 million tucked under its arm, the Italian firm 
Antonio Merloni SPA, a world leader in the production of 
household appliances, has just entered a joint venture with the 
local company Adzen SA in order to establish itself in the 
country. 
  The company has two plants in Italy: one in Ancona and 
another in Peruggia, where 1.5 million washing machines and 
700,000 refrigerators are produced. And now Merloni has decided 
to establish itself in Moreno, Buenos Aires, where it will build 
a 40,000-square-meter plant on a 13-hectare lot. 
  Indeed, the Merloni Company has no small ambitions. It plans 
to produce 450,000 washing machines annually, which, according 
to market studies, would exceed the annual national demand. 
  Here are the facts for a business which moves more than $150 
million annually. In 1992, there were 280,000 washing machines 
sold throughout the country, a volume surpassed in 1993 by the 
sale of 340,000 units.

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanbish on 10 
January 1994 publishes on page 15 an 800-word report on an 
interview with French economist Philippe Revault d'Allonney by 
Ernesto De Paola and Cristian Mira. The report notes that the 
Northern Electricity Company (Edenor) will invest $100 million 
in 1994 to upgrade networks and service. According to 
d'Allonney, president of Argentine Electricity (EASA), the 
private consortium that took over Edenor, the company will show 
a profit in 1994 if things go as planned. "We knew we would have 
losses in the first two or three years," explains d'Allonney."We 
are very close to breaking even and are certain that we will 
show our first month of profit before the middle of the year." 
The quality of service, he predicts, will "gradually" reach the 
same level as in France.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The inappropriate behavior of President 
Itamar Franco and Justice Minister Mauricio Correa at dawn on 12 
February at the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de 
Janeiro] has created a climate of uncertainty regarding the 
government's credibility. In the opinion of former ministers, 
jurists, and deputies, President Itamar Franco debased the 
dignity of his mandate and the institution of the Presidency of 
the Republic by allowing himself to be kissed and embraced by 
model Lilian Ramos, who was wearing nothing but a short T-shirt. 
Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party-Federal District]) was the only person to openly admit 
that Itamar's attitude may justify an impeachment process based 
on Law 1079/50, the same one that removed Fernando Collor from 
the presidency. 
  Outstanding politicians and jurists who worked hard in 1992 
to maintain political stability during the impeachment of 
Fernando Collor de Mello, who was president at that time, agree 
with Sigmaringa. A former minister linked to the judicial field 
angrily commented: "A president cannot debase the institution 
and country's image." They explained that the impeachment law 
is quite clear in stating that the president of the Republic and 
state ministers commit crimes against probity in administration 
when "they behave in a manner that is incompatible with the 
dignity, distinction, and decency of the post" (Clause 7 of 
Article 7 of the law). 
<H5>  The Balcony of the Numbers Game Kingpin </H5>
  Sigmaringa asserted: "The president of the Republic must 
behave in accordance with the post he holds and cannot appear 
hugging and kissing a woman who is exhibiting her genitals." 
"He (Itamar) does not consider the consequences of his actions. 
He goes in his capacity as president and not as an ordinary 
citizen to the balcony of the numbers game kingpins and makes 
passes at all those near him," commented a senator friend of the 
president. A retired member of the Federal Supreme Court, who 
fears the consequences of a "thoughtless action" by Itamar, 
indignantly commented: "Why is it that he, in addition to the 
photographs that were taken, used a vehicle of the Presidency of 
the Republic to take that girl home?" 
  Justice Minister Mauricio Correa, may be judged under the 
same article of the impeachment law, and may even be tried for 
seduction and sexual harassment. In addition to drunkenness and 
having told his bodyguards to carry him to his hotel room, a few 
whiskeys earlier Correa tried to grab some journalists, 
according to the account of one of them, in the balcony at the 
Sambodromo. A deputy who participated in the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] in the PC [Paulo Cesar] Farias case, 
but who wants to remain anonymous so as not to contribute to the 
unleashing of a crisis, commented that "journalists have the 
right and duty to bring charges against individuals who do not 
respect this symbolically important ministry." 
  Those who have reacted negatively to Itamar's behavior have 
been very cautious. Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA 
[Progressive Renewal Party-Para State]) said: "I would rather 
make no comment." He said that any comment "now" may be used 
ill-intentionally. Celio Borja, the justice minister under 
Collor's administration, said: "I hope the people will bear the 
country in mind." Deputy Roberto Magalhaes (PFL-PE [Liberal 
Front Party-Pernambuco], coordinator of the Budget CPI, tried to 
avoid commenting, but could not resist the temptation: "He 
(Itamar) chose a very unorthodox way for a president of the 
Republic to celebrate Carnival."

<F P=106> [Article by Silvia de Souza Costa] </F>
  [Text] Brazil is proposing that ALADI [Latin American 
Integration Association] be transformed into a regional 
negotiation forum similar to GATT to promote the creation of a 
South American Free Trade Area [Area de Livre Comercio 
Sul-Americana -- ALCSA]. According to Ambassador Paulo Nogueira 
Batista, the idea, presented by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim on 
11 February during the ALADI meeting in Montevideo, was well 
received by the other 10 countries that are members of the 
organization. 
  "The foreign ministers were very comprehensive and now we 
intend to strengthen contacts so as to prepare a concrete 
proposal as soon as possible. We hope this will be possible 
during the first half of the year in order to begin the free 
trade process on 1 January 1995," Nogueira Batista said. 
  Minister Amorim explained in Montevideo the details of ALCSA 
which was presented by President Itamar Franco to the Rio Group 
at the end of last year. During informal meetings with his 
colleagues, Franco discussed the Brazilian initiative whose 
objective is "to favor economic and social development through 
accelerated free trade" among the South American countries 
within a maximum period of 10 years. The beginning of this 
agreement would be the existing structures of Mercosur and the 
Andean Pact. "We understand that the free trade negotiations 
should be limited to goods and tariffs and nontariffs, through 
which we could simplify and make possible the faster approval of 
these agreements," the foreign minister said. 
  Minister Amorim said that the creation of ALCSA "will 
reinforce the action capability of Latin America in a 
hemispheric and international scope." Ambassador Nogueira 
Batista said that any eventual negotiation with NAFTA (North 
American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada, 
and Mexico) should take place only on a second stage. 
  According to the ambassador, the summit meeting summoned by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton for the second half of the year will 
be political and will not deal with trade matters. An indication 
of the good reception given to the Brazilian proposal was the 
decision of the 11 ALADI members (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, 
Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and Uruguay, 
besides Brazil) to strengthen the association.

  [Text] Brasilia -- During a three-day meeting, the 
Brazilian Government submitted preliminary data on the handling 
of the public accounts during 1994 to the visiting IMF 
delegation. The Finance Ministry is having difficulty accepting 
the 1993 and 1994 accounts of the state governments. 
Additionally, state enterprises are not submitting the results 
of their 1993 activities nor are they submitting their programs 
for 1994. The government does not know the volume of the 
surplus of 1993 accounts that will be disbursed by the Treasury 
in 1994. Jose Cechin, the Finance Ministry deputy secretary for 
economic policy, told the IMF that in 1994 Brazil's public 
accounts will have an operational deficit (excluding monetary 
correction) equivalent to zero. In other words, neither a 
surplus nor a deficit. 
  Jose Fajgenbaun, head of the IMF delegation, who on 10 
February held a brief meeting with Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, termed the congressional approval of the 
Social Emergency Fund during the first round of voting as "an 
important stage toward attacking the imbalance in the public 
accounts." He emphasized that the government needs to implement 
more measures to maintain the economic plan.

  [Text] Uncertainty about the date when Real Value Unit 
(URV) will go into force is favoring oligopolies and causing 
large margins of profit to be placed on prices. Sao Paulo 
businessman Marcio Goldfarb, who is a retailer and who deals in 
ready-made clothes, gave this signal of alert. He said 
manufacturers hiked compact disk prices by 90 percent in 
January. To replace products as they are sold, supermarkets are 
paying 50 percent more for them and contracts are being written 
with safeguard clauses. Exporters seek to move up the dates for 
closing exchange contracts and thus have less dollars in cash 
when the day to convert them comes. 
  Pouring his heart out, Ivan Botelho, president of the 
Cataguazes-Leopoldina Group, said: "There is an atmosphere of 
unpatriotic speculation." The inflation rate calculated on 
basis of the IGP-DI [General Prices Index-Domestic Availability] 
totalled 42.19 percent in January. This is the highest since 
March 1990. The IPCA [Expanded Consumer Price Index] rose to 
41.31 percent and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index] to 
41.32 percent. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has 
asserted that he will not subordinate the economic calendar to 
the political one.

  [Text] Industrial production in 1993 will probably prove to 
have risen by 9.5 percent over 1992, its best performance since 
1986. That year, during the consumption boom caused by the 
Cruzado Plan freeze, Brazilian industry grew by 10.5 percent. 
The projection was made by the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistics (IBGE) on the basis of results obtained for the 
month of November, when production climbed by 2.4 percent. 
  That percentage, which was higher than expected by IBGE's 
experts in the Department of Industry (Deind), means there has 
been a 4.3 percent growth in only two months. To Silvio Sales de 
Oliveira, manager of Deind's Data Analysis Group, the 
explanation may lie in the uncertainty generated by the 
acceleration in the inflation rate, which caused retailers to 
postpone their purchasing decisions until the end of the year. 
It is for the same reason, in his opinion, that December 
production will probably attain at least this same level. 
  What is more complicated to understand is how, in a year 
when 
the inflation rate exceeded 2,500 percent, production rose 
almost as much as under the Cruzado Plan. Here is where two 
important actors come in. The leading role was played by the 
far-reaching adjustment made by industry, which achieved 
significant gains in productivity. Playing a secondary role was 
the surge in demand that started in September 1992, initially 
motivated by uncertainty regarding the behavior of inflation, 
and later by the change in wage policy, which gave workers some 
measure of real gains that were of special benefit to the 
consumer durables industry. 
  From January to November, production of those goods--notably 
automobiles and home appliances), grew by 40 percent, followed 
by capital goods for agriculture (tractors and other inputs), at 
37.4 percent. 
  There are questions about the early months of 1994. Silvio 
Sales believes production may hold up for two months, but with 
some tendency to decelerate. The projection made by the 11 
economists who participate in the qualified information system 
set up by the Regional Council of Economics (Corecon) is that 
January production will be 3.4 percent above that of January 
1993. This would be a modest growth, compared with what happened 
last year. But it all depends, largely, on what happens to 
inflation, and Corecon's projections are that the rate will be 
39.5 percent this month and 39.6 percent in February.

  [Text] Brasilia--Brazil broke four records in its 1993 
foreign trade: total exports, valued at $38.783 billion; exports 
of manufactured goods, at $23.613 billion; imports, at $25.711 
billion; and trade flow (sum of exports plus imports), which 
totalled $64.494 billion. These figures were released yesterday 
by acting Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ailton 
Barcelos Fernandes at an awards ceremony for representatives of 
the sectors that figured most prominently in last year's 
exports. The balance of trade position stood at $13.072 billion, 
lower than in 1992, which was $15.308 billion. 
  The minister minimized the fact that the goal of $40 billion 
in exports set by former Minister Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira 
had not been achieved. "That was a very ambitious goal and we 
are happy to have come close to it," he commented. 
<H5>  Predictions </H5>
  For 1994, Fernandes predicts that even higher levels will be 
reached, in an effort to break new records. He wants to see $44 
billion in exports (growth of 13.4 percent), $29 billion in 
imports (12.8 percent more), a $15 billion trade balance (up 
14.6 percent), and a trade flow of $73 billion (plus 13.2 
percent). According to the acting minister, these goals were set 
in light of the expectation that 1993's pace will be maintained. 
In consultations with the sectoral chambers from the most 
representative segments of the export economy, he found this to 
be feasible. 
  The minister said the growth in exports, especially of 
machinery and raw materials, is a positive development. He 
commented that imports of luxury items were minor. "Two thirds 
of the 65,000 automobiles imported, for example, came from 
Argentina in fulfillment of trade agreements." 
<H5>  Highlights </H5>
  The minister gave awards to five sectors for 1993 
performance: auto parts, with exports of $1.242 billion (a 22.5 
percent growth); footwear, at $1.945 billion (rose 32.0 
percent); fresh fruit, at $132.2 million (up 27.3 percent); 
furniture, at $239.4 million (90.5 percent higher); and wine, at 
$15.0 million (increased by 96.6 percent). Exports of industrial 
products gained more than one percentage point from last year's 
level and accounted for 75 percent of foreign sales. 
  In December, the trade balance recorded the following 
results: exports at $3.413 billion (less than the $3.484 billion 
of the same month of 1992); imports of $2.809 billion (more than 
the $2.223 billion from the previous year); and a trade balance 
of $604 million (less than 1992's $1.261 billion).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Magnifying Glass"] </F>
  [Text] Lula [Workers Party, PT, Chairman Luis Inacio da 
Silva] usually says that disagreements within the PT are seen 
like under a magnifying glass. He contends: "The problems are 
not as serious as they are presented to be." 
  Lula believes that the fuss over the [PT] government program 
stemmed from the disclosure of a draft program that had not even 
been assessed by the party's Executive Board. The latter is 
scheduled to meet on 17 February to approve the government 
program. 
  The program then will be publicized so party members can 
debate it at length until the PT national convention on 30 April 
and 1 May, at which Lula will be officially nominated as 
candidate for the presidency. Lula wants, at the same time, to 
debate the program with other parties. 
  With regard to the disagreements with the PT bloc in 
Congress, Lula said the party's Executive Board has not been so 
hard on it as is being said. He recalled that the Executive 
Board authorized the PT bloc to vote on the Social Emergency 
Fund, which was badly needed by [Finance Minister] Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. 
  Lula notes: "The problem is that summary methods are being 
used for the constitutional revision. There are important 
issues in which our bloc should participate, but conservatives 
have created a steamroller to pass everything they wish. There 
is no way in which our bloc can endorse that, feigning it is 
democratic."

  [Text] Brasilia--Ambassador Rubens Ricupero, minister of 
the environment and the Legal Amazon, will ask Senate President 
Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party--Paraiba State] to act on an urgent basis to examine the 
biodiversity and climate change conventions that were approved 
by the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday. The minister has already 
begun contacts with Pedro Simon (PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul), the 
administration's leader in the Senate, hoping to speed up the 
process of ratifying the two agreements. 
  The government thinks these can be approved by the end of 
February, if Senate leaders concur. Advisers to Ricupero and 
Senator Pedro Simon are considering whether they might send the 
biodiversity and climate change conventions to the full Senate 
for passage without first submitting them to review by 
committees. 
  In defending the idea of rapid handling of the international 
treaties, government experts argue that both agreements were 
exhaustively discussed in the Chamber of Deputies. Advisers from 
the Ministry of the Environment note that the conventions cannot 
be amended as if they were legislative proposals. An alternative 
way of handling them would be to send the texts to the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense. The members 
of this committee would have 25 days in which to examine the 
agreements before sending them directly to the floor for a vote. 
  "Here in the Senate there is no reason why those accords 
could not be handled speedily," commented Senator Jose Richa, 
(PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party--Parana State], a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. "As far as I know, 
there is no resistance among the senators to take up the 
matter," Richa added. If it is confirmed that the accords will 
pass through the committee, it will be up to its chairman, 
Senator Alfredo Campos (PMDB, Minas Gerais), to appoint a 
rapporteur on the subject. "The chairman has asked that the 
examination of international accords be handled expeditiously, 
and these two will certainly get the same treatment," said an 
adviser to Alfredo Campos. 
  As soon as the Senate approves the accords, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs will send the UN secretary general a communique 
reporting that the conventions have been ratified by Brazil. 
From then on, the Brazilian Government will be able to enjoy the 
international financial mechanisms created by the convention. 
The Ministry of the Environment has been negotiating for the 
release of $30 million from the World Bank's Global Environment 
Fund in order to implement the National Biodiversity Program. 
  Also in the second half of this year, the countries that 
ratified the Biodiversity convention--now there are 36 of 
them--will meet to discuss additional mechanisms for the accord. 
On the agenda will be new rules for technology transfers and 
financing of environmental protection and conservation projects.

<F P=106> [Column: "Political Things," by Dora Kramer] </F>
  [Text] Not even a potential runoff election contest between 
Maluf and Lula promises to generate as much confusion as the 
fight already being picked between the PT [Workers Party] and 
the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] during these pre-election 
months. Things came to the boiling point during the Budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] and it looks like the 
first hot sparks will be thrown off during the constitutional 
revision. Then, after April, when the list of candidates will be 
virtually finalized, we might see some tall flames. The charge 
by Luiz Salomao (PDT, Rio de Janeiro) that an agreement was 
worked out between the PT delegation and [former President] 
Sarney's contingent in the Congress to keep [Sarney's daughter] 
Roseana, on the one hand, and Miguel Arraes, on the other, out 
of the hands of the CPI exposed a dispute for space on the Left 
that, until then, had been taking shape behind the scenes. 
  The PT reacted immediately. One of the party 
leaders--someone 
with real influence within the delegation--added to the official 
denials an argument to demolish the theory behind the agreement 
when he said: "If we were to make any arrangement with the PFL 
[Liberal Front Party], it would not be with the Sarney group; we 
would deal directly with Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, the party's 
leader in the Chamber, who has authority over the party's 
representatives on the CPI. He would be our authorized 
interlocutor." 
  That is true, although no one from the PT or any other party 
that helped to erect the obvious cordon around Roseana and 
Arraes has offered a convincing explanation for the successive, 
and successful, ploys that kept both of them far away from the 
hearing room. In the case of Arraes, we must not forget that the 
PDT also has some stake in the matter, since Brizola has not yet 
lost hope of seeing the former Pernambuco's name on his slate as 
his vice presidential running mate. Given Lula's standing in the 
polls, however, even the most loyal brizolistas now 
acknowledge the difficulties with this plan. 
  In an attempt to discredit Salomao--who is being accused in 
private conversations of trying to counter the effects of some 
unsuccessful actions in the CPI (the testimony by Joao Alves's 
former chauffeur, for example)--the PT is thinking about naming 
representatives from the party to serve on the CPI that would 
investigate the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. Once the appointments 
are made, the party would simply let matters take their course. 
Probably the effort would not get anywhere, since if a CPI were 
set up to investigate the CUT, there would be no way to prevent 
CPI's on election campaigns and on contractors, a development 
not in the interest of the other parties. That would ruin 
everyone's election campaigns. 
  PT-Sarney agreement aside, the fact is that Lula's and 
Brizola's parties are once again getting ready to tussle with 
each other because of the presidential succession. For the time 
being, the line of attack is almost totally occupied by the PDT. 
Old resentments are popping up again. For example, Deputy 
Vivaldo Barbosa (PDT-RJ) backs the theory, which he argues 
vehemently, that "the PT is handing over the constitutional 
revision" in exchange for a 60-day postponement of the CPI on 
CUT. Vivaldo says the petistas "have bowed in the 
face of the wind gusts of liberalism." 
  He cites as example past votes on which Lula's party, as the 
brizolistas see it, preferred to ally with the enemy. 
These include: the laws on patents, information technology, 
ports, and the role of foreign capital in privatizations. And 
now the PDT is convinced that the PT will ultimately participate 
in the revision which, according to the same rationale, will 
make changes in the Constitution similar to those proposed by 
then-President Fernando Collor in the "super-amendment" that 
never got through the Congress. The real danger the 
brizolistas run with this approach is that they might 
end up attracting more voters to the PT. And it is precisely 
among the middle class where Lula has the most difficulty. 
  But that is a problem of PDT strategy, where what counts 
most 
is precisely that--pushing the PT toward the Right so as not to 
have to share the banners of the Left with it. Of course Brizola 
is not stupid; he would not pretend to isolate himself by these 
means in some infantile leftist philosophy. In fact, he has 
already embarked on a schedule of political consultations and 
conversations in a fertile field for harvesting dissidents--the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. 
  The pedetistas are falling all over themselves to 
praise the "nationalist" faction of the PMDB, comprised of such 
men as Tarcisio Delgado from Minas Gerais, the PMDB leader in 
the Chamber, and Rondonia Senator Amir Lando, who was the 
rapporteur on the CPI that investigated PC Farias. They are 
also, albeit somewhat timidly, casting sidelong glances in the 
direction of Pedro Simon (Rio Grande do Sul). But so far, the 
support group the PDT believes it can count on is comprised of 
the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], General Antonio Carlos 
de Andrada Serpa, Celso Brandt, Aureliano Chaves, and Barbosa 
Lima Sobrinho. In terms of votes, this cannot be called very 
encouraging.

  [Text] Havana, 12 Feb (PL) -- Cuban police have 
supplemented their constant operations of protecting the U.S. 
Interests Section in this capital with additional measures in an 
effort to keep away people who have headed to the office outside 
regular business hours to demand U.S. visas. 
  According to local authorities, this decision was adopted 
because on 10 and 11 February several groups of people -- less 
than 100 in all -- approached the office with the intention of 
entering the office. 
  These people said they heard U.S. radio stations 
broadcasting 
to Cuba report that U.S. visas were going to be issued to 
everyone who wanted to travel to the United States and that the 
protection to diplomatic installations would be lifted [que 
retiraria la proteccion de las instalaciones diplomaticas]. 
  Regarding these rumors, PRENSA LATINA has learned that an 
official of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has officially 
stated to a Cuban Foreign Ministry representative that such 
reports are completely false. 
  An official communique issued by the diplomatic office today 
said the office will continue to operate normally and that only 
people with previous appointments will be interviewed. 
  The situation around the office was quiet this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Article published in the 13 February Sunday edition of </F>
JUVENTUD REBELDE: "What Happened at the U.S. Interests Section?] 
  [Text] Havana -- The following is a chronology and analysis 
of the incidents promoted in the vicinity of the U.S. Interests 
Section in Cuba over the past three days, after the 
counterrevolution launched a wave of speculation and rumors 
about an alleged withdrawal of Cuban guards. 
  Counterrevolutionary organizations in Miami and the special 
services of imperialism are totally responsible for the 
incidents near the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba 
on 10 and 11 February 1994. 
  With the intention of denigrating the revolution and 
provoking an incident that could hinder -- and hinder more than 
one could imagine -- the nonexistent relations between the two 
countries, they tried to promote a massive incursion of citizens 
into the offices of the U.S. Interests Section. 
  In their attempt, they used a strategy of rumors. They 
circulated false reports that claimed the Cuban Government was 
interested in encouraging an action of this nature, that the 
guards had been withdrawn, that the U.S. Government would 
benefit from this, and that visas were expeditiously being 
issued to anyone who entered the diplomatic mission. 
  It did not matter to them that encouraging actions of this 
nature not only could hinder the normal activities at the 
diplomatic mission, but that such actions might even endanger 
the lives of the officials who work there. 
  With regard to the incidents, some international press 
agencies have reported their versions to the world. This is our 
version. We have nothing to hide. We have never had to hide 
anything. 
  In addition to observing absolute honesty in performing its 
functions, the Cuban Government has invariably and 
systematically practiced -- from the historical days of Moncada 
-- a policy of principles, part of which is absolute and 
unconditional respect for truth. 
  These are the facts: 
<H5>  10 February </H5>
  From the morning hours and throughout the day, a rumor 
begins 
to spread in Havana that all of the guard posts have been 
removed from the U.S. Interests Section and that visas are being 
issued to all those who present themselves at the offices. 
  1700: Twelve citizens who live in Cojimar publicly express 
their intention to go to the U.S. Interests Section. Party 
officials explain to them that the rumors are false. They give 
up on the idea. 
  1940: The rumor spreads among several groups in Centro 
Havana 
Municipality. Some residents head for the area where the U.S. 
Interests Section is located. 
  2045: Guards at the Embassy ask 25 people approaching the 
area with the clear intention of entering the U.S. Interests 
Section to turn back. Most of these people are residents of 
Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. Several of them are accompanied by 
their children and are carrying small bundles of clothes. 
<H5>  11 February </H5>
  0100: Interior Ministry forces use police barriers to cordon 
off all access to the U.S. Interests Section in an attempt to 
keep the groups from getting near the offices. 
  0230: Thirty-six people, including six children, express 
their intention of entering the U.S. Interests Section. They 
are informed about the rumors spread by unscrupulous people. 
Following several discussions, they leave the area. 
  By this time, these small groups begin mixing with those who 
have appointments at the U.S. Interests Section to complete 
their visa paperwork. 
  Up until this time, those who have gone to the U.S. 
Interests 
Section are mostly parents, some with their children, many who 
have been denied a visas in the past or who have been waiting 
for a long time for an answer. They do not create any problems 
when they are told they have been fooled. 
  0900: The police cordon is removed. 
  1130: Several bicyclists, in an openly hostile manner, begin 
to gather at the intersection of the highway and 11th Street 
only a few meters from the U.S. Interests Section. They are 
ordered to withdraw. 
  At this time, the type of people approaching the area begins 
to change. The absence of confused people is noted and the 
presence of lumpen becomes obvious, once again demonstrating 
that this is the kind of situation the counterrevolution takes 
advantage of. One of the bicyclists is spotted with a knife 
hidden under his shirt. 
  1430: At Calzada and N Streets, a group of about 80 of 
these cyclists are ordered to disperse. They withdraw. At 
1500, they return to the same place. They are again told to 
disperse. 
  1730: A group of 60-70 people, including some agitators, 
walk 
by the city's seawall toward the mission with the intention of 
breaking in. Revolutionaries stationed in that same area foil 
the attempt. The alleged leaders are arrested. 
  1800: The police cordon goes up to prevent access to the 
area 
near the building. 
  1830-1900: The worst incident so far takes place when a 
group 
of 80-90 people try to forcibly break through the human cordon. 
They do no achieve their objective. The people who incited 
this action are arrested. 
  2130: A group that planned to carry out a similar action is 
dispersed near La Piragua Pizza Parlor. 
  2345: Summoned by the Foreign Ministry, Messrs. Joseph 
Sullivan and Vincent Mayer, principal officer and deputy 
principal officer of the U.S. Interests Section, go there and 
meet with Comrade Bienvenido Garcia, the North America affairs 
director. 
  They are informed of the Cuban Government's viewpoint on the 
events that took place and the measures taken to prevent acts of 
violence against the mission. They are also told it would be 
advisable for the said mission to contribute to dispelling the 
confusion that has arisen regarding its policy and procedures on 
granting visas. 
<H5>  12 February </H5>
  No incidents take place. The police cordon is lifted in the 
early morning hours. 
  During the course of these events, 82 people were identified 
and briefly detained. Some citizens are still under arrest, and 
an appropriate investigation is being conducted to locate the 
instigators of these incidents. 
  Several of the participants indicated having heard from 
radio 
stations that broadcast to Cuba from the United States that 
visas would be freely granted. 
  The masterminds are at large. This is how the 
counterrevolutionary and imperialist mechanisms work; they are 
based on deceit and cynicism. 
  This is how they manipulate the feelings of those who are 
incapable of enduring the living conditions imposed by the 
blockade promoted by the United States and, in turn, are eager 
to migrate north. 
  Why are they promoting this now? What is it that hurts them? 
  Could it be that they, in their 35 years of frustration, 
cannot stand to see a Cuba capable of resisting and, in its 
benevolence, taking steps to reunite Cuban families? 
  Could it be that they want to create incidents to hamper the 
meeting called by Cuba? 
  Are they trying to compile a dossier with this incident to 
justify their false accusations against our country before the 
UN Human Rights Commission, which is currently meeting in 
Geneva?" 
  Did they want to taint the activities in favor of Cuba they 
knew were to take place on 12 February in New York or the 
presentation of a proposal by Charles Rangel before the U.S. 
Congress to lift the blockade? 
  Is it, perhaps, that they in their arrogance cannot take so 
many consecutive blows, such as Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina's successful tour of Africa; the recent statements about 
Fidel Castro by the great Jewish rabbi of Israel; Assembly 
President Alarcon's trip to several European nations; the 
agreements Cuba has signed with businessmen from several 
developed nations -- businessmen who have publicly expressed the 
viability of their Cuban projects; or the outstanding success of 
economist Carlos Lage's trip to three countries on the continent? 
  The imperialists, the counterrevolutionaries in Miami, and 
the agitators disguised as dissidents are entirely and 
exclusively responsible for what happened. 
  Cuba does not conduct policy by way of force, it has no 
military bases in any other country, it does not finance 
television or radio broadcasts aimed at any other government, 
and it does not offer its territory as a refuge for terrorist 
organizations which have the necessary materials and the radio 
broadcast capabilities to promote incidents such as this. 
  Cuba's political strength is in its proverbial fairness, its 
striking clarity, and its faithfulness to the principles it 
proclaims. 
  Embassies in Cuba will always have the necessary protection 
and the facilities to allow them to conduct their day-to-day 
activities and to provide security for their members, who, in 
turn, have the moral obligation not to promote activities other 
than their proper diplomatic functions. 
  The attempt to blame the Cuban media for this incident 
because of the recent publication of a series of works on the 
subject of immigration is merely a maneuver by some U.S. sectors 
bidding to hide the true roots of the problem. It is childish 
to try to blame a situation on those who condemn and denounce it. 
  Once again, it has been demonstrated that the streets of 
this 
country belong to revolutionaries now and forever. No one, 
under any pretext, will be able to attempt impunity when acting 
against the independence of the motherland. The Cuban economy 
might be enduring a special period, but this is not the case for 
the dignity and decency of a nation that proves its heroism 
everyday. 
  Today we must be more vigilant than ever. What imperialism 
has been unable to achieve by way of the Bay of Pigs and during 
all of these years, it is now trying to achieve -- as in the 
sixties -- by way of spreading lies and rumors to provoke 
incidents that favor their schemes. 
  The Cuban Government is not the one that must offer 
explanations to the people going to the U.S. Interests Section; 
rather, it is the U.S. officials themselves. It is true that 
the U.S. officials have disclosed the proper procedures to 
obtain visas, which has contributed to expelling the rumors and 
baseless myths some people have fabricated. Our actions and 
duties, as irrefutably shown throughout the course of events, 
are strictly within the framework of our obligations as a host 
country, and our actions and duties have been fulfilled fairly 
and efficiently. As far as Cuba is concerned, it will continue 
providing every facility to those granted visas to travel or 
immigrate to the United States. 
  Nothing happened at the U.S. Interests Section. There are no 
Cuban citizens inside the building. No one was hurt or injured. 
  Once the rumors were denied, everything returned to normal. 
Incidents of this type and irresponsible actions can trigger 
more serious consequences, and those who encourage such actions 
will be entirely responsible. 
  Let this incident be a lesson to the unscrupulous authors of 
the adventure. No country will ever be able to trample on the 
revolution because, in order to do so, it would have to trample 
on the courage and determination of millions of Cubans who do 
not believe lies or rumors when it comes to defending their 
motherland.

<F P=106> [Article signed ARS: "Group of Cubans at Residence of </F>
Belgian Ambassador in Havana"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 15 Feb (BELGA) -- On Monday evening, the 
Foreign Ministry announced that on 26 January last a group of 
eight Cubans, comprising five men, two women, and one child aged 
two years, forced their way into the residence of the Belgian 
ambassador in Havana and immediately sought political asylum. 
  One of the persons concerned has since left the residence of 
his own accord. 
  While awaiting a solution, the ambassador has given his 
permission to the persons involved to remain in the Belgian 
residence, which enjoys diplomatic immunity. 
  In the contacts that were immediately established with the 
Cuban authorities, the Belgian Government firmly insisted that 
the requests of the persons concerned be met, including their 
wish to leave the country. 
  Despite efforts, it appears the Cuban authorities hold only 
a 
faint hope of seeing the interested parties being authorized to 
leave the country directly from the residence. 
  The Belgian Government will, in any event, continue to 
demand 
that a humane solution be found to the situation, including the 
provision of the necessary guarantees regarding the fate of 
those involved in the future. 
  In particular, the Belgian Government will not accept these 
persons being punished for the simple reason that they forced 
their way into the Belgian residence, concluded the press 
release issued by the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (PL) -- Cuba today announced its 
decision to work toward a normalization of ties with immigrants 
without waiting for changes in its tense relations with the U.S. 
Government. 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina addressed numerous 
local and foreign journalists after officially announcing "The 
Nation and the Immigrants" conference, scheduled for April in 
this capital, and he outlined the characteristics of this 
meeting. 
  The foreign minister recalled that contacts between Cubans 
who live abroad and their country of origin have been 
systematically undermined following the victory of the 
revolution by Washington's hostile policy toward the Caribbean 
island. 
  Cuba cannot continue to wait until relations with the United 
States improve before attending to immigrant problems in a 
civilized, coherent, and correct manner, because they do not 
depend on current differences with the White House, he said. 
  Robaina said the event, scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April, 
will gather in Havana approximately 200 representatives of 
Cubans who live in numerous countries throughout the world. 
  Although the largest delegation will come from the United 
States, where the largest number of immigrants have settled, the 
foreign minister said delegations will also arrive from Spain, 
Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, Slovakia, Mozambique, Namibia, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and the Czech Republic, among others. 
  Four Cuban Government officials will be in charge of 
outlining essential issues during the meeting, and this will 
serve as the basis for debates. 
  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government, will discuss the immigration issue in a 
general context; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers, will deal with conditions within the current economic 
period, as well as the country's possibilities in the future. 
  Moreover, Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of 
Cuban Writers and Artists, will talk about Cuban culture and 
immigrant intellectuals' contributions; and Robaina will 
personally talk about the tasks which correspond to Cubans 
living inside the country and abroad to sponsor relations with 
other countries. 
  Robaina emphasized: Even though all pending issues will not 
be solved within three days, the goal is to start a discussion 
on topics of interest, including procedures to be carried out 
for trips, immigration permits, ways to help relatives, cultural 
exchange, and nationality problems. 
  A gap must be filled, a hand must be offered to many 
immigrants who seek to maintain a normal relationship with their 
country, and the number of people who want to do this tends to 
increase, he said. 
  He said: The conference will be held with absolute respect 
for everyone's opinion and without provisions, which is how Cuba 
would be willing to talk with Washington concerning any 
improvement of relations. 
  The foreign minister recalled that, as far as immigration 
affairs are concerned, the U.S. Government has always failed to 
implement the agreements reached with Cuba. In reply to another 
question, he said those who endorse an anti-Cuban hysteria would 
not be allowed to attend the conference. 
  In reply to another question, he said the announcement of 
this conference does not represent a concession, or a sign of 
weakness, because everyone knows Cuba would never choose that 
option.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicanor Leon Cotayo for PRENSA LATINA] </F>
  [Excerpt] Havana [No date or news agency attribution as 
received] -- New information would seem to corroborate that 
small isolated groups acting in Havana on behalf of human rights 
are being financed from abroad and, whenever necessary, work in 
harmony with individuals who promote terrorism. 
  International news agencies reported on Wednesday [9 
February] that specific groups, made up of persons of Cuban 
descent and operating in Miami, asked the U.S. Government to 
provide $500,000 to the island's "dissident movement." 
  According to a spokesman for these groups, quoted by the 
sources, the request was made officially to Alexander Watson, 
the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American 
affairs, during a meeting they held in Miami last month. 
  The "dissidents" would use the money, the spokesperson 
noted, 
to acquire equipment to receive information and guidance from 
abroad. Such equipment could include fax machines and satellite 
reception dishes. 
  The spokesman concluded by saying that they had not received 
any official answer from the State Department, at least as of 
the time of the meeting. [sentence as received] 
  A spokeswoman for the State Department did not want to 
comment on the issue, nor did she confirm if in fact Watson had 
accepted the request. 
  The Spanish news agency EFE recalled that these small groups 
moving in Havana, under the Reagan and Bush administrations, 
received funds from an agency whose budget is approved by the 
U.S. Congress: The National Endowment for Democracy [previous 
name in English]. 
  Toward the end of January, 1992, other news sources reported 
that this same organization "aided in bringing about the end of 
communism in Eastern Europe." The group later sponsored seven 
projects related to Cuba and allocated $500,000 of its overall 
budget to activities directed at the island. That figure is 
almost double the amount approved in 1990. 
  Now, just 48 hours before a spokesperson reported the 
aforementioned request, U.S. authorities discovered a ship off 
the coast of Florida carrying a large amount of weapons and 
money, presumably headed for the island's so called "internal 
opposition." According to THE MIAMI HERALD, the vessel, and its 
seven passengers, were carrying 50 rifles and pistols, about 
25,000 rounds of ammunition, and "a few thousand dollars in 
cash." The HERALD states that Rodolfo Frometa, a member of the 
terrorist Alpha 66 organization, was the mission's leader. The 
mission's target was to land a commando team on Cuban soil. 
  Some recalled that the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted another 
group of Cuban subversives in the area last Spring. The Coast 
Guard follows a government order issued by the Clinton 
administration rejecting this type of illegal activity. 
  On 29 December, 1991, Cuban authorities captured three 
heavily armed men carrying explosives, whose mission was to 
contact the leaders of these small groups -- who call themselves 
defenders of human rights -- as well as carrying out terrorist 
operations. 
  More recently, during the third Ibero-American summit in 
Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, the Brazilian police 
reported the possibility of a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. 
Personalities who openly and systematically encourage 
"dissident" activities in Cuba were reportedly linked to the 
plot. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (PL) -- The government took an 
important step toward normalizing relations with immigrants and 
strengthening its national identity by calling a meeting with 
representatives of the Cuban community abroad. 
  The conference will be held during the last week of April in 
Havana and will include an exchange of opinions on a wide 
variety of topics, including the prospective participation of 
Cubans abroad in the country's public and economic spheres, the 
weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL has just announced. 
  Observers and political analysts of the Cuban situation 
cannot but notice the importance of an event of this nature if 
they take into account the large number of Cuban immigrants 
residing in other countries due to economic, family-related, and 
other reasons. 
  This sector of the Cuban population has traditionally seen 
their relations with the island hindered because of the U.S. 
Government's permanent hostility toward Havana as well as 
because of the direct, and many times violent, actions carried 
out by several anti-Cuban organizations that are against any 
kind of dialogue. 
  Cuba's call, which was initially outlined by Foreign 
Minister 
Roberto Robaina during his recent visit to the United Nations, 
was received with interest by many immigrant sectors, especially 
in the United States. However, the sectors who oppose the talks 
excluded themselves when they tried to impose conditions to 
obstruct the dialogue. 
  The significance of the Cuban Government's call is even 
greater considering that the meeting will take place in the same 
year that the island's administration picked to implement a long 
line of measures geared to stabilize and reinvigorate its 
economy. 
  The attempts to get closer to Cubans abroad have precedents 
in the process of the Cuban revolution's history. In 1978 
efforts of this nature resulted in an increase in the family 
reunification movement, mainly between Miami and Havana. 
  On that occasion, and as evidence of good will, the local 
government initially released approximately 3,000 
counterrevolutionary prisoners and allowed them to join their 
relatives abroad. 
  In the more recent past, Havana made it possible to multiply 
the air ties between the United States and Cuba and, much to the 
displeasure of the sworn enemies of the revolution, the number 
of visits to Cuba by U.S. residents increased significantly. 
  Despite the obstacles to any type of exchange by the 
existence and intensification of the U.S. blockade, more members 
of the Cuban community in the United States are increasingly 
rejecting this measure and disregarding regulations that 
negatively affect their relations with their place of origin. 
  Now, the meeting called has a wide horizon and those who 
come 
to Havana will be able to give their opinions and discuss 
something of great importance: How to consolidate the sense of 
an independent country that Cubans have traditionally defended 
and the future of their ties with their country of origin.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, 
vice president of the Council of State and executive secretary 
of the Council of Ministers, said the presidents of Brazil, 
Venezuela, and Colombia have taken a very strong stance against 
the economic blockade imposed by the United States against his 
country. 
  Talking to PRENSA LATINA at the conclusion of the first day 
of his official visit to Colombia, which followed his stay in 
Brazil and Venezuela, Lage said the general balance of his 
visits is positive. 
  Relations are at a high point in these three countries, and 
we have found great receptivity in those governments, great 
interest in joint ventures, and many opportunities for 
cooperation and economic development, Lage affirmed. Lage said 
he felt that the most important aspect of his long afternoon 
meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was the frankness 
of the in-depth analysis of bilateral relations and problems 
between Colombia and Cuba. He indicated that Cuba's ties with 
Colombia have made important and significant advances since 
Presidents Gaviria and Fidel Castro met last August in 
Cartagena. Lage disclosed that he and his host discussed 
prospects for strengthening relations, Cuba's opening to foreign 
capital, and possibilities for having Colombian businessmen 
participate in that process. 
  He also brought up the subject of furthering commercial 
relations through an increase of Cuba's direct purchases of 
Colombian oil and exports of Cuban medicines to Colombia. 
  The Cuban leader felt that as the exchange increases, his 
country may find solutions to resolving its debts with Colombia, 
which will in turn pave the way for increasing commercial 
relations. 
  Lage indicated that he analyzed specific cooperation in each 
sector with the ministers of foreign commerce and agriculture 
and livestock and with the planning chief. He will continue 
such discussions with the public health, mines and energy, and 
economic development ministers and with the management of Banco 
de la Republic and the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise. 
  The Cuban official begins today's schedule with a meeting 
with the top leaders of Colombia's major business groups. He 
will conclude his visit in the afternoon.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the Council of State and executive secretary of the 
Council of Ministers, said today his country is satisfied with 
the level of relations established with the government of Cesar 
Gaviria, who -- Lage disclosed -- was invited to visit Cuba. 
  Interviewed by the Colombian radio network RCN, Lage noted 
that the decision when and if to visit Cuba is up to Gaviria. 
Lage also stressed the open dialogue between the countries that 
began during President Fidel Castro's visit to Cartagena last 
August. 
  He added that the fundamental purpose of his visit, as was 
that of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in December, is to 
further dialogue and the exploration of possibilities to 
increase economic, commercial, and political ties that began 
when diplomatic relations were resumed in October. 
  Lage has met with the ministers of foreign commerce and 
agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He also 
held a long meeting with President Gaviria, the most important 
aspect of which, in Lage's opinion, was the frankness of the 
analysis of bilateral relations, the current situation, and 
problems between the two countries. 
  In his conversation with RCN and statements published today 
by the daily EL ESPECTADOR, the Cuban leader recapped the 
different economic measures his government has adopted, 
including opening to foreign investment, and said all measures 
necessary to defend socialism will be adopted. 
  Lage said tourism and the pharmaceutical industry have 
prompted great interest on the part of Colombian businessmen, 
with whom he held broad discussions today during a meeting 
organized by the Industrialists Association and attended by the 
major economic groups. 
  When asked about the illegal departure of Cubans from the 
island, Lage replied that his country's policy is to allow 
emigration and that anyone who wishes to leave can obtain a 
visa. The United States, on the other hand, denies visas but 
then accepts and grants immediate residence to anyone who 
arrives illegally in that country. 
  Lage also noted that the majority of people support the 
revolutionary system, which could not continue without this 
support. In replying to another question, he said that Cuba is 
the most drug-free country in the world, since it has no 
narcotics, corruption, or organized crime. Lage will conclude 
his visit today as the last leg of a tour that included Brazil 
and Venezuelan.

  [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (PL) -- Today, Cuban businessmen 
stressed the need to reinforce commercial information, both to 
and from the island, because it is a decisive factor in knowing 
what business possibilities exist. 
  The Cuban Chamber of Commerce members studied their 1994 
projections at the annual general assembly meeting held at the 
Havana Convention Center today. 
  The members, which include firms from all sectors of the 
national economy, are involved in exporting their products and 
expanding the island's trade horizon within the framework of 
new, commercial laws which allows and promotes the participation 
of foreign firms in the country's economic activities. 
  A report, which was distributed at the general assembly, 
noted that the need to provide more information has prompted the 
creation and implementation of a business support service, which 
gives advice on issues related to business organization, 
legislation, and techniques in other countries. 
  A member of a firm, who requested that his name not be 
revealed, told PRENSA LATINA that the commercial activities in 
1993 yielded positive financial results. He also emphasized the 
growing number of requests to operate joint companies by many 
foreign firms from all over the world. 
  The report highlighted the importance of strengthening ties 
with Caribbean countries, keeping in mind the ties established 
by Havana with the capital cities of those countries. 
  In this sense, Milda Picos Rivers, director of the 
Cubaexport 
firm, stated there are more exchanges between the five eastern 
provinces of Cuba with Caribbean countries. 
  Picos reported that this firm promotes exports to Trinidad 
and Tobago, Guadalupe, Martinique, and other neighboring 
islands, of, among other products, citrus, fish and seafood, 
mineral water, construction material, and salt. 
  In this framework, there is also noteworthy interest in the 
tourist industry in which Santiago de Cuba, the third largest 
city in the country, will host at least three important events 
next summer: Carifiesta, Expocaribe, and the sixth Cuban Nurses 
Congress. 
  The assembly of associate members was headed by Chamber of 
Commerce President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, and was attended 
by high-level Cuban foreign commerce and finance officials.

  [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (PL) -- Cuban organizations in the 
United States warned today the U.S. Government's office in 
charge of broadcasting propaganda against Cuba is virtually in 
the hands of extremist groups created in that community during 
the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan. [sentence as 
received] 
  The government of President Bill Clinton this week appointed 
Richard Lobo to head the so-called Radio and TV Marti stations. 
Lobo is said to be an ally of the groups that are hostile to the 
Cuban revolutionary system. 
  "This individual does not have a critical point of view, 
much 
less an objective one, regarding those media sources.... He is 
an extremist, because he would not have received support to be 
appointed to that position if this were not the case," said 
Andres Gomez, leader of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in Miami, 
during a telephone conversation with PRENSA LATINA. 
  The extreme rightist Cuban-American Foundation immediately 
expressed its support for Lobo and stated the Cuban community 
should be very proud of Washington's appointment. 
  "No. There is no way the majority in our community approves 
of this appointment, because we do not even approve of Radio and 
TV Marti," Gomez added. His organization is part of a moderate 
current among Cuban immigrants in the United States that 
promotes a rapprochement with Havana 
  Gomez said he was almost sure Lobo was "a foundation man." 
This organization was created during the years of the Reagan 
administration, when the largest aggression against the Cuban 
revolutionary government was carried out. 
  "Nothing that comes from that stock can elicit my admiration 
or pride," said Andres Romero of the Cuban-Americans for Dignity 
Organization, during a telephone conversation from Miami. 
  According to Romero, Lobo's appointment responds to the 
efforts of political sectors in Washington that are interested 
in obtaining an "extremist-styled" solution to continue making 
money with the broadcast of hostile propaganda against Cuba. 
  Since it was first aired in March 1990, TV Marti's 
broadcasts 
have been unable to reach Cuban television viewers, but the U.S. 
Congress approved a budget of almost $22 million to continue the 
operations of the Radio and TV Marti stations for one more year. 
Havana authorities have charged those media sources are part of 
a coercive program to subvert Cuba's internal order.

  [Text] Havana, 15 Feb (PL) -- General Raul Castro, the 
Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] minister, said today that 
this institution is heading toward financial independence and 
stressed that its unity will guarantee its victory over the 
enemy. 
  Gen. Castro, who is also the second secretary of the Cuban 
Communist Party, indicated that in 1993 the FAR cut its budget 
by 50 percent, supplied themselves with natural medicines by 70 
percent, and were able to maintain their high technical 
readiness and combat morale. 
  Today Raul Castro inaugurated a new training year for the 
Western Army, which, he noted, signifies the improvement of 
defense structures in this region of the country. The western 
region comprises the Provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana 
City, and the special municipality of the Isle of Youth. 
  Castro pointed out that the transfer of units from the Air 
Force and the Navy to the Western Army, which have been already 
implemented in the Central and Eastern Armies, increases 
significantly the combat potential and the operational autonomy 
of the commands. 
  Castro stressed that in a recent visit to units of the 
Central and Eastern Armies, he was able to verify the efforts 
made to adjust the FAR to the current economic difficulties 
leaving its combat capacity intact. 
  He added that the FAR's most significant achievements for 
the 
past three years include maintaining high morale and combat 
readiness, preserving the tactics, and contributing to the food 
program for the population. 
  In addition, Raul Castro emphasized the work carried out by 
the Youth Labor Army in harvesting sugar, tobacco, tubers, and 
vegetables in Havana Province, to which it supplies 49 percent 
of its production. 
  Gen. Castro announced that in 1994, the system to prepare 
chiefs, officers, and mid-level officers must be strengthened, 
and stressed that the enemy must realize that the fight will be 
to the death. 
  Gen. Castro concluded that there will be no mass desertions 
or generalized collapses because a monolithic unity and absolute 
loyalty to the revolution and its highest leader, Fidel Castro, 
prevail in the FAR.

  [Text] Havana, 11 Feb (PL) -- The Cuban Armed Forces are 
engaged in an operation to support the local agriculture sector 
by assuming the task of maintaining thousands pieces of 
agriculture equipment. 
  Approximately 22,000 tractors and light trucks, as well as 
other work equipment used in the fields, will be maintained by 
the soldiers as direct cooperation with the productive sector, 
Radio Rebelde has reported. 
  Right now, the main objective is to remove corrosion and 
halt 
the deterioration of the equipment that is now available after 
converting a large number of former state-run farms to the 
cooperative system. 
  Until this equipment is distributed and used in other 
agriculture units or assigned to cooperatives, the Armed Forces 
will be charged with maintaining the tractors and mentioned 
vehicles. 
  Similar support operations for other sectors of the national 
economy have been implemented in the past, directly benefiting 
the Construction and Transportation Ministries, according to 
what could be learned.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Feb (PL) -- Today's editorial of the 
weekly TRABAJADORES stressed Cuban workers have to accomplish 
efficiency, economy, and effectiveness to be able to improve the 
country's economic situation, 
  The publication of the Cuban Workers Federation writes the 
country's main economic problem can be resolved with more 
production but that, contrary to previous years, it now has to 
be accomplished with low costs, meaning less spending. 
  As the new Workers Parliament Assemblies (approximately 
80,000 meetings in which workers study ways to reduce expenses, 
increase income, achieve profitability, and mend finances) are 
being held, the editorial writes, the workers who attend them 
learn about terms such as efficiency, economy, and effectiveness. 
  The editorial encourages workers not to look for 
macroeconomic solutions to national problems at those meetings, 
rather, to concentrate on the internal problems of each center, 
because this will allow for the reinstatement of the centers' 
productive capabilities and the achievement of optimal 
development. 
  "We need to produce more of everything with current 
resources 
to be able to produce the many products we lack," the article 
writes, adding it is vital for workers to concentrate on how to 
reduce costs, to take advantage of production potentials, to 
make the best use of raw materials, and to obtain quality 
products and services." 
  It is a matter of achieving economy, efficiency, and 
effectiveness in all business and budgeted activities, be it in 
the production of products or in services, it adds. 
  The Workers Parliament Assemblies are enhancing the 
country's 
true potential to overcome the severe economic crisis that 
developed after the downfall of the socialist bloc and the 
intensification of the U.S. blockade, the editorial stresses. 
  After attending those assemblies, Cubans know the 
significance of budgets, costs, subsidies, profitability, 
excessive circulation, income, expenses, prices, taxes, losses, 
and profits to the island's future. Thus, the assemblies are an 
excellent education mechanism for the union movement, it 
comments. 
  The Cuban economy is showing a growing gap between the 
monetary liquidity in the hands of the population and the offer 
of goods and services, and that is why we need to decrease 
substantially the budget deficit, the editorial emphasizes.

  [Text] Havana, 12 Feb (PL) -- The Cuban State urgently 
needs to reduce expenses and increase income, GRANMA, the 
official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, asserts today. 
  In an article, the newspaper reports that the subsidies 
given 
to national firms that have losses are the main contributing 
factor to the Cuban budget's imbalance. In 1993, the budget 
deficit amounted to $4 billion pesos (equal amount in dollars). 
  In our case -- the article adds -- this means that more 
money 
has to be issued and this, in turn, increases the currency in 
circulation without material support, reduces the value of local 
currency and its purchasing power, increases labor absenteeism, 
and severely decreases labor productivity. 
  GRANMA explains that the budget deficit and the printing of 
more money are not the only causes for the excess of liquidity 
as the fact that production and services have suffered a sharp 
fall in the past years must also be noted. However and 
undoubtedly, the former are key factors in the negative 
situation, it adds. 
  The newspaper warns that expenses must be reduced very 
carefully because it is a very sensitive issue and actions to 
reduce expenses must not negatively affect the principles of 
social justice existing in Cuban society. 
  Of course, it is indispensable that Cuban firms increase 
their economic efficiency, the article stresses. 
  GRANMA favors the establishment of new taxes, the increase 
of 
previously existing taxes, and the implementation of new methods 
and ways to collect taxes more effectively. 
  As always happens with controversial topics and advantages, 
issues that are so pressing and important to the country, 
logically, trigger debate and reflection, the article concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez: "The Island's Long-Standing </F>
War on Drugs"] 
  [Text] Havana, 10 Feb (PL) -- The recent burning of 2.5 
tons of cocaine by authorities is the latest chapter of an 
already long history of the nation's war on drug trafficking. 
On this occasion, the drug destroyed was part of shipments lost 
by international drug traffickers in their illegal operations 
near the Cuban archipelago. This situation has, on different 
occasions, even led to arrests, trials, and sanctions by local 
courts. 
  In fact, the Cuban Government's organization of the fight 
against drugs dates back many years and is even coordinated with 
international organizations and other countries interested in 
the topic. 
  Not even U.S. administrations, which Cuba has accused of 
politicizing the issue and using it as a weapon in its 
traditional conflict with the island, have been excluded from 
the cooperation Havana has proposed and is implementing to deal 
hard blows to drug traffickers. 
  A glance at the past reveals an interesting and important 
balance regarding Cuba's war on drugs. 
  In 1992, for example, Cubans seized 1,647.91 kg of cocaine 
and 2,000 kg of marijuana, captured three boats, and held 12 
drug traffickers, who were remanded to the courts. 
  In June of that same year, a national commission to combat 
drugs was created, comprised of representatives from the 
Justice, Interior, Foreign Relations, and Public Health 
Ministries, the Attorney General's Office, and General Customs. 
An earlier UN report cited Cuba among the top 10 countries of 
the continent in seizing cocaine and marijuana. An important 
thing about Cuba is that it does not produce or consume drugs. 
  In January 1993, the courts sentenced five U.S. drug 
traffickers for possession of drugs and illegal entry in Cuba, 
following contacts with U.S. authorities and the exchange of 
information on the matter. In May of last year, Cuban ovens 
incinerated almost 200 kg of cocaine found in bags that had 
drifted onto central Camaguey Province coasts as a result of 
illegal operations conducted in nearby waters. 
  In June 1993, authorities burned another 400 kg of drugs 
that 
had also drifted here through the northern keys in Camaguey and 
Ciego de Avila Provinces. In the same month, 2.5 tons 
confiscated from different points in Cuba were incinerated. 
  Last November, 10 foreigners and Cubans were tried and 
sentenced. They had been arrested when a specialized corps 
dismantled an entire network of drug traffickers, who used the 
island as a transshipment point for drugs sent from Colombia to 
Germany. 
  In a declaration by Gerd Merrem, director of the UN program 
for international control on drugs, the United Nations 
recognized Cuba's participation in the international effort 
against the drug scourge. 
  Merren praised the efficiency of Cuban authorities in 
combating drug trafficking, and he mentioned that the developed 
long-standing cooperation has left a deep mark because of the 
sincerity and professionalism of experts devoted to this task.

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The OAS asserted 
today that development models must result from the decisions and 
efforts of each state within a favorable foreign context and 
with the support of renewed international cooperation. "They 
must not be imposed from abroad or based on a sole paradigm," 
the OAS asserted in a preliminary document for the 
"Inter-American Cooperation for Development" meeting that will 
be inaugurated here next Thursday. The OAS stated that, for this 
reason, it is necessary to generate a new concept and form of 
cooperation solidarity for development within the organization; 
one that will allow it to overcome problems and respond to 
current situations more effectively. 
  Two documents were prepared for the meeting, which will be 
attended by foreign ministers and representatives of the 34 OAS 
member states and will end on Saturday. The documents will be 
the center of the Special OAS General Assembly deliberations. 
  The first document is an attempt to reach "agreements on 
strategies and systems that will further the achievement of 
integrated development, the struggle against extreme poverty, 
and the improvement of the basic levels of social and economic 
well-being in the hemisphere." The document emphasizes that "it 
is first necessary to strengthen the role of the OAS as a forum 
for inter-American dialogue as this will enable it to promote 
the development of the member states." It observes that 
activities should be geared to those areas in which the 
organization has comparative advantages, meaning where it can 
complement the actions of other organizations to boost the 
development of its member states. To further this end, -- the 
document asserts -- special attention will be given to efforts 
to coordinate development financing; to foster the creation of 
productive jobs; and to propitiate economic integration, 
commercial opening, and access to markets. Attention will also 
be given to the fight against the use, production, and 
trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as related crimes. The 
preservation, enrichment, and transmission of the countries' 
cultural identities and languages will also be furthered, as 
well as public administration strengthened. 
  The second document, which is called "Commitment To Promote 
Cooperation Solidarity and To Overcome Poverty," notes the 
effects of the economic crisis that jeopardized most of the 
countries in the region during the past decade. In this sense, 
the second document highlights the reforms made by the OAS to 
eliminate extreme poverty and foster integrated development in 
its member states. For example, the OAS created the 
Inter-American Council for Integrated Development that is aimed 
at promoting cooperation solidarity for development. 
  An OAS report indicates that democracy "has been 
revitalized" 
on the American continent as, perhaps, nowhere else in the 
world. The report on OAS activities, which was published in the 
OAS TODAY magazine, observes that representative democracy is 
the rule in the countries of the region. It highlights that 
many of the democratic changes experienced on the continent 
occurred prior to those that took place in Central and Eastern 
Europe. The report estimates that governments elected by the 
people have substituted de facto leaders in several countries 
and that other nations have gradually strengthened their 
democratic structures and institutions. It highlights the OAS 
commitment to the modernization of economic structures and to 
the achievement of social justice and adds that making democracy 
a sustainable system is "an essential task" at the OAS.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria officially announced on Wednesday [16 
February] his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general. 
In a brief statement read at the Narino Government Palace, 
Gaviria said his wish, if he is elected, is to strengthen the 
continent's political and economic integration. 
  Gaviria decided to run for the OAS post in view of the 
requests made to him by different world leaders since December. 
Gaviria's candidacy is sponsored by the United States and has 
received the official backing of Peru, Argentina, Mexico, and 
Bolivia. 
  In his speech, Gaviria said that "America is concerned about 
the future of the OAS." He added that "we all know that under 
the current circumstances, the self-same future of the 
inter-American system is at stake along with the election of the 
secretary general. This is where Colombia faces a big 
responsibility. If we have in our hands the tools, knowledge, 
and experience, we must place it at the service of the 
hemisphere." "I hope that my commitment can serve to unite at a 
time when the OAS faces the responsibility of outlining new 
paths within the context of a new, more just world order amid 
solidarity," he said. 
  He also said he has great respect for his rivals (Bernd 
Niehaus of Costa Rica and Miguel Angel Burelli of Venezuela). 
He invited both of them to share their respective views in such 
a way that, rather than reflect a race, which he considered 
futile, it will show the wish to contribute to a peaceful future 
for the continent. 
  The new OAS secretary general, who will succeed Brazilian 
Joao Baena Soares, will be designated on 27 March.

<F P=106> [From the "Noticiero CMI Television" newscast; passages </F>
within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria decided tonight to announce 
his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general. 
Immediately afterward, his main contender, Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus, said he regretted the president's 
anticipated defeat. The first vote will be held on 27 March. 
Gaviria must garner at least 18 votes. Otherwise, there will 
have to be a runoff election. 
  [Gaviria] "I will work to make a reality of the Bolivian 
dream of integration, reflected initially in the creation of a 
great free zone, which will link the vast territories from 
Alaska to the Patagonia and which will show the world the 
grandeur of America." 
  With that as his principal goal, President Gaviria announced 
his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general. The 
consultation phase to present his name for consideration by the 
countries of the hemisphere began early this year. After 
requests by countries such as Mexico, Canada, and the United 
States, Gaviria sent Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to Central 
America and the Caribbean to explore his possibilities. Today, 
he is certain of the support that he has and is therefore 
running in the race. 
  [Gaviria] "If by the decision of the countries who are part 
of the OAS the Colombian president is elected secretary general, 
I would like to see my fellow citizens regard it also as a 
triumph which undoubtedly belongs to all of us." 
  Gaviria invited his contenders to engage in a calm debate, 
devoid of rhetoric and without divisions between large and 
small, or poor and rich countries. 
  [Gaviria] "I have great respect for my contenders. I invite 
them to express our respective views in such a manner that 
rather than reflect a race, which would be futile, it will 
demonstrate our desire to contribute to a prosperous and 
peaceful future which we want for our peoples." 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus told CMI this 
evening that he has 20 votes for sure, as opposed to 12 for the 
president. The foreign minister had this to say: 
  [Niehaus] "The fact that the name of a president, a 
president 
as respected as President Gaviria, the president of such a dear 
and beloved country as Colombia, is naturally.... [pauses] it 
makes one think about how this process is evolving. How will it 
continue? Well it will continue with respect for the president, 
with love for Colombia, but with support for Costa Rica. I have 
no reason to object to the Colombian president's decisions. 
What I must do is respect them. I don't think he will do so. 
If he does, with all due respect, I don't give him any chance." 
  Tonight in Mexico City Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus 
reacted 
to the official announcement of the candidacy of President 
Gaviria. 
  [Niehaus] "I believe that President Gaviria may have 10 or 
12 
votes. I think that reality has probably been kept from him, 
otherwise he would not have announced his candidacy officially. 
We will see the end result five weeks from now." 
  [Unidentified Reporter] "How many votes do you have Mr. 
Foreign Minister?" 
  [Niehaus] "I have 23 votes at the present time." 
  According to Colombian Foreign Ministry estimates, President 
Gaviria has 20 votes for sure. That is two more than are needed 
to be elected on the first vote. Foreign Minister Niehaus today 
has only 14 votes. Colombian estimates indicate that the 
Colombian foreign minister's mission in Latin America was 
successful. President Gaviria has the certain votes of countries 
such as Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, the United States, Mexico, 
Peru, and Brazil -- the majority of influential countries in the 
international context. 
  Meanwhile, Niehaus has the support of Central American and 
Caribbean countries. Chile has also announced its intention to 
vote for the Costa Rican foreign minister, but President Frei's 
inauguration on 11 March could tilt the balance in Colombia's 
favor. These countries have signed a document of support. 
Countries that have announced they will change their vote have 
done so only privately. Publicly, Niehaus, who is on a 
Caribbean tour, appears to have the majority. There is 
certainty, however, that when voting time comes around, the name 
of a president will have more relevance. Today's official 
announcement was made based on the certainty of triumph. 
  Miguel Angel Burelli, Venezuelan foreign minister, has only 
the vote of his country and its neighbor, Suriname. With the 
launching of President Gaviria in the race, the Narino 
Government Palace believes that the numbers will lean toward 
Colombia. The results will be seen on 27 March.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F>
"special" correspondent Philippe Lamair; place and date not 
given; Karadzic speaks in English with superimposed French 
translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] For the first time in several days, a civilian in 
Sarajevo was killed by a sniper today. There were no other 
infringements of the cease-fire, however. Neither was there any 
sign from the Serbs, who are maintaining their position, 
although NATO has made it clear that the ultimatum would not be 
extended beyond the Sunday [20 February] midnight deadline. Our 
special correspondent in former Yugoslavia, Philippe Lamair, met 
with Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  [Lamair] [Question not heard] 
  [Karadzic] If all that NATO is trying to do is make us 
withdraw our artillery without also controlling the Muslim 
infantry, then there will be a strategic imbalance and the war 
will continue. I believe the threats should stop and diplomacy 
should go forth. If the international community treats both 
sides on equal footing, then there will be a peace accord. If 
the sanctions against Serbia are lifted, for example, then the 
Muslims will sign a peace [agreement], not before. 
  [Lamair] [Question not heard] 
  [Karadzic] I believe that the United States wants to flex 
its 
muscles, humiliate Russia, and scare other countries. NATO is 
just like a young man who has lost his job; he is flexing his 
muscles, he is showing that he can hit anyone. It is obvious 
that they can hit us. We are only 4.5 million people, so they 
can hit us very easily. But it will be a moral disaster for the 
NATO countries. You will see, in the event there are air 
strikes, many NATO countries will distance themselves 
immediately from this immoral move.

<F P=106> [Michel Rosten commentary: "Bosnia: The Ultimatum Is </F>
Running Out...."] 
  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin is in 
Sarajevo. He has just made a tour of the former Yugoslavia and 
thinks that this mission was "the most unfruitful" that he has 
made to the region. He blamed the Muslims who decided on 
Tuesday [15 February] to boycott the meeting between the 
commander in chief of the Serbian forces in Bosnia and the 
commander in chief of the government army, although this meeting 
was described as "crucial" by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. 
  This meeting was to make it possible to define the procedure 
for the withdrawal operations and the establishment of control 
over the heavy weapons, a process deadlocked on Monday by mutual 
distrust. The fact that Mr. Silajdzic said he knew nothing of 
this meeting to justify the absence of General Delic does not 
argue for the Bosnian prime minister's sense of responsibility, 
and it is not known what his motives might be. But can anything 
else be expected from somebody who had pledged -- even to 
President Clinton's special envoy to Sarajevo -- not to exploit 
the shelling truce to regain territory, although the UNPROFOR's 
observations on the ground proved the contrary. Mr. Silajdzic's 
attitude is lamentable; but that of the leader of the Serbian 
Forces, who has just stated that Serbian artillery will not pull 
back, is no less so. Nothing more is needed to prompt new 
tensions at a time when the NATO ultimatum is running out.... 
  In fact, there is nobody in diplomatic circles who wants the 
Atlantic alliance to carry out its threats. But everybody knows 
that NATO will not hesitate if the conditions it has put forward 
are not met. The situation being what it is, there is reason to 
fear that there are people in the two camps who do not fear air 
strikes at all, and who even imagine that they might serve their 
purpose. When you hear Mr. Karadzic stupidly counting on the 
collapse of the alliance if it launched air raids, you have to 
admit that the disaster met by Saddam Husayn -- who also 
believed that he could defy the international community with 
impunity -- has not served as a lesson. 
  All these signs suggest that reason is not triumphing this 
week. In this case, there is strong reason to think that the 
alliance will have to intervene and thus strike heavily -- with 
all the risks of collateral damage which this operation carries 
-- to secure the results it is seeking. That would not 
necessarily change the face of Europe....

<F P=106> [Interview with Rik Coolsaet, deputy chief of cabinet to </F>
Foreign Minister Claes, by Jorgen Oosterwaal; place and date not 
given: "The Eye of Moscow"--first two paragaphs are KNACK 
introduction] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rik Coolsaet is deputy chief 
of cabinet to Foreign Minister Willy Claes, of the Socialist 
Party [SP]. He has long been the SP's defense expert and was 
appointed recently lecturer in international relations at Ghent 
University. [passage omitted] 
  Coolsaet fully understands why the West is being cautious 
and 
why NATO, for the time being, is not offering East Europe more 
than the Partnership for Peace. A surprising view for a man who 
for more than a decade has been encouraging the Belgian 
Government to adopt a more active and daring Ostpolitik. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oosterwaal] East and West seem ready to tie the bond, but 
because Yeltsin is holding back, it seems we will first have to 
cohabit for a while yet? 
  [Coolsaet] Why should NATO be enlarged? Because we like the 
company of the East European countries? Because we share the 
same values and they belong with us? Or in order to ensure the 
stability of Central and East Europe? NATO is not a cultural 
organization, which means that only the latter reason is valid. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott assumes that 
stability in Europe will de determined by developments in 
Russia. I believe he is right in his assumption. We must take 
full account of Moscow. We must know what the Russians are 
thinking. Why is Russia so against the enlargement of NATO? 
Because it sees it as a move toward a dangerous isolation. 
Since 1917 that has been a permanent fear for the Russians. We 
must not fuel this paranoia. 
  We can draw a parallel with the Ostpolitik of the former 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt. He could only begin his detente 
efforts after he had assured the Russians of the status quo in 
Europe, and thus by acknowledging Russia's place in Europe. 
Another example is the Cuban crisis. U.S. President John 
Kennedy was able to resolve it successfully because he did not 
start bombing immediately but tried instead to understand how 
Nikita Khruschev saw the conflict. 
  [Oosterwaal] The West hopes to keep Yeltsin in place because 
it is horrified by his rival, Zhirinovskiy. But the West has 
little or no influence on Russia's domestic affairs. 
  [Coolsaet] The best guarantee for stability in Europe is a 
democratic Russia. Whatever it takes, we must not allow an 
authoritarian, despotic system to develop in the former Soviet 
Union which would be opposed to the West. But how? By 
supporting the forces for democracy. I also know that our 
impact is very limited. But however limited this influence may 
be, we must at least try. If we believe that Russia is 
automatically embarking on a new imperialist adventure, then we 
cannot hesitate. Then we must enlarge the alliance as quickly 
as possible. But I do not believe that this scenario is 
unavoidable. 
  Russian society consists of a Slavic, nationalist component 
and a Western-oriented component. It has been that way since 
Peter the Great. It is one of the keys to an understanding of 
Russia. Zhirinovskiy is the crystallization of a frustrated 
nation which is feeding off anti-Western Slavic sentiments. His 
success is not surprising. There is great unease in Russia. By 
immediately allowing NATO to extend right up to the borders of 
the former Soviet Union we would be lending force to this 
Slavophile and xenophobic nationalism. As long as the power 
play between the Slavophiles and those who look to the West has 
not been decided, we are right not to enlarge NATO. Because by 
doing so we would be undermining the stability of the continent 
and also of Central Europe. 
  [Oosterwaal] But in the recent past the West already counted 
for too long on a single Soviet leader. 
  [Coolsaet] It is not a question of a single leader, Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Yeltsin, or anyone else. Do not forget that Russia 
has no democratic tradition. Russia has always known autocratic 
government. This has usually been accompanied by a radical 
opposition. This is the second key which we need in order to 
understand anything about Russia. The opposition between 
Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy is a part of this tradition. The only 
real alternative comes from political parties which are born out 
of a pluralist democracy. 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  Coolsaet believes in the need for stability not just in 
Central Europe but throughout the continent. This was evident 
from his lecture at a recent colloquium at Ghent university. "A 
new world order is growing up gradually, leading to more 
pronounced economic regionalism around three major industrial 
poles : NAFTA in America, Tokyo and Peking in Southeast Asia, 
and Europe. West Europe is not in the best of positions at the 
moment. It is surrounded by turbulent regions which are running 
their economies badly. If Europe still wants to count for 
anything in the 21st century then we cannot remain blind to 
developments outside the borders of the Union. I am not only 
thinking of East Europe. In the long term, the stability of 
Africa is certainly equally important," he stated. 
  The situation is thus very clear to Coolsaet: The military 
alone provides for no stability. George Kennan, the father of 
the postwar policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, knew 
this. Stability has much more to do with economic factors and 
the functioning of institutions. The present power vacuum in 
Central Europe is in some ways comparable to the situation after 
the Second World War. The sense of insecurity was relieved by 
linking the economies, via the European Coal and Steel Community 
and later the European Community. This unification brought 
harmony, peace and prosperity. The European Union could thus 
serve East Europe far better than NATO.

<F P=106> [Article signed CA/TR: "Diplomatic Conflict in Havana"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Since the end of January seven (originally 
eight) Cubans seeking asylum have been staying in the Belgian 
ambassador's residence in Havana. Brussels and Havana have been 
holding talks on finding a solution to the matter. But 
meanwhile, given that both countries are not planning to give up 
their principles, the Cubans could well be staying with the 
ambassador for a long time. In the meantime, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina has announced that he will hold a 
conference with the Cuban community in exile. [passage omitted] 
  "But all Cubans may leave Cuba if they want to," the Cuban 
embassy spokesman in Belgium said yesterday by phone. "If they 
just follow the standard procedures. They can apply for a visa. 
But it cannot happen this way. Cuba must ensure that the 
immunity of the diplomatic premises in Havana is respected and 
the security of foreign diplomats is not threatened. Therefore, 
we cannot allow such actions." Observers emphasize that it is 
not customary for the host country to decide who visits the 
ambassador. 
  Both Cuban and Belgian diplomats stress that the talks are 
"firm but friendly." But it remains very doubtful whether a 
rapid solution can be found. Both countries have opposite 
opinions on the question and they will not abandon them quickly. 
Very cautious diplomatic action will probably be necessary to 
reach an agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Falter: "Diplomats Criticize Willy Claes </F>
Over Staes Affair"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- According to the Belgian ambassador 
to Pakistan, Ernest Staes, Foreign Minister Willy Claes has 
"caused moral damage that will be hard to repair." This is what 
Ambassador Jean De Ruyt, chairman of the circle of friends (the 
so-called Amicale) of Belgian diplomats wrote in a letter to the 
minister. Last week, De Ruyt published extracts from the letter 
in the Amicale's newsletter. 
  The Staes affair concerns the visit of Muslim leader 
Amanullah Khan from Kashmir to Brussels in October 1993. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his letter, De Ruyt adopts a particularly critical stance 
regarding Willy Claes. Among other things, he writes that in 
instances where the administrative responsibility of an 
ambassador is at issue, "this responsibility may not be 
personalized, nor may it lead to judgments relating to the 
individual involved." 
  "To the extent that various people (in Brussels) were 
involved in the incident, we believe that it would have been 
better to wait until the investigation had yielded the necessary 
elements, before making ambassador responsible for what 
happened." 
  "For someone who has devoted his entire career to the 
department, showing a professional commitment to which many of 
his colleagues could bear witness, these personal attacks (by 
Willy Claes -- DE STANDAARD editor's note), to which he was 
unable to respond, caused moral damage from which it will be 
difficult to recover." 
  De Ruyt went on to indicate that the Amicale was considering 
whether or not to write a letter to the director general of the 
chancellery, in order to point out the problems arising with 
regard to the issuing of the visa. These problems include: A 
"complex mass" of circulars on the affairs, which "in some cases 
seem barely compatible"; the "difficulty of accessing" the 
equipment that provides the "black list," and the fact that only 
alphabetical lists in Roman type are used; and finally, the fact 
that the responsibility is divided between the head of station 
and the chancellor. 
  Let us remember, in the chamber of deputies in recent 
months, 
Minister Claes has stated repeatedly that the instructions for 
issuing visas were "very clear," and "extremely precise."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iranian Ambassador Summoned"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Hague -- Iranian Ambassador Kazemi-Kamyab was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry today to hear a strong protest 
following the official statement released by the Iranian 
Government in Teheran that the death sentence against British 
writer Salman Rushdie must indeed be carried out. "The death 
sentence must be carried out, regardless of whether the renegade 
(Rushdie -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) is repentant," read 
the statement issued yesterday by the official Iranian press 
agency IRNA. The comment was made on the fifth anniversary of 
the death sentence against Rushdie declared by the late 
Ayatollah Khomeyni due to the supposedly blasphemous nature of 
his book The Satanic Verses. 
  Minister Kooijmans wants to push within the Council of 
Ministers for action to be taken against Iran. The Greek 
presidency, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, 
is considering approaching the Iranian Government on behalf of 
the 12 member states of the European Union, in order to show its 
disgust over the Rushdie affair. The Netherlands does not plan 
to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, said the 
spokesman. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fokker Cuts Back Primarily on </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- Fokker intends to cut its production 
capability by 1,400 jobs. Approximately 500 jobs will disappear 
at the level of administrative staff and management. 
  The total staff cuts affecting 1,900 jobs are necessary 
because the company's aircraft production is being reduced from 
56 to 40 machines. The measure is a result of the lingering, 
worldwide recession in the aviation sector. 
  According to the company's acting CEO [chief executive 
officer], R.J. van Duinen, the manufacturer probably will have 
to make even deeper cuts next year if the current rate of 
production is maintained. "Fokker is doing relatively well, 
because our market share is growing. However, the self-same 
market has almost totally collapsed," said van Duinen, in an 
attempt to explain the measures. 
  Yesterday morning the staff reacted indignantly, and yet 
stoically, to the announcement that further rationalization is 
in the pipeline. "First of all we want to see what Fokker's 
restructuring plan is based on, and how the management intends 
to limit the number of forced job losses," said P. van Bers and 
G. van den Heuvel, of the trade unions FNV [Netherlands Trade 
Unions Federation] and CNV [National Federation of Christian 
Workers]. G. Melchers, the secretary of the COR [Central 
Enterprise Council], reacted with shock: "We knew that 
something was in the cards, but we had not counted on such a 
high number." 
  According to the financial expert on the board of directors, 
R.F. Hendriksen, the company anticipates a turnaround that will 
drag it out of the red occurring only in 1996. However, this is 
by no means certain, he wisely let it be known. 
<H5>  Development </H5>
  According to van Duinen, the future for Fokker as a 
"self-creating aircraft industry" is not in danger. "The 
restructuring will have a tremendous draining effect. However, 
we shall be proceeding at full speed with product developments 
-- like the new Fokker 70 -- that we have already set in motion. 
Our excellent products have a future. That is why we are doing 
better than our competitors. However, the fact remains that, 
for a company of this size, we are not making enough sales."

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor by Defense Minister Jose Gallardo </F>
Roman] 
  [Text] From the minister of defense to the editor. 
  In the daily newspaper under your able direction, of today's 
date [date of the letter], the columnist Mr. Javier Ponce, in an 
article titled "Not That Way, Don Marcelo," says the following: 
"No sir. These deaths (of the soldiers and policemen killed on 
the Putumayo River) cause us as much sorrow as they cause you. 
But what we do not accept is that prisoners were taken without 
cause, just to allow the minister of defense to have the 
audacity to say that these captures prove that our borders are 
well defended. And there is nothing else to say. Nothing to 
prove. Nothing more to lie about...because the remains of lies 
are the truths of power." 
  Mr. Ponce's remarks are a gratuitous and unfair accusation 
against the honesty of the minister of defense and the acts of 
an institution that has earned the trust of the Ecuadoran people. 
  What basis does Mr. Ponce have to accuse the minister of 
defense of lying and of behaving with audacity? 
  We cannot believe that his conduct is due to an incredible 
ingenuousness, but rather to the sickness of the most benighted 
sectarianism. 
  Of the 11 prisoners taken in the Putumayo River sector, six 
admitted that they were guerrillas and that they had taken part 
in the massacre of 13 members of the security forces, who were 
doing their duty, trying to protect their fellow men from the 
scourge of drugs, and five admitted that they were collaborators 
of the narco-guerrillas. These 11 persons were not arrested by 
chance or on a whim, but on the basis of evidence verified by 
experienced professionals--for example, a watch belonging to one 
of the victims was found on one of the prisoners, and also after 
questioning hundreds of persons. In order to prevent subsequent 
malevolent charges, the military forces filmed the 
interrogations in which the captured guerrillas admitted the 
details of their participation in the ambush, including the 
coldblooded murder of four members of the security forces at the 
order of a certain Commander "Pedro," who required them to 
commit this crime or pay for their disobedience with their 
lives. I invite Mr. Ponce and the human rights defense 
organizations to verify with their own eyes what the video 
clearly shows. 
  Despite the fact that the Armed Forces, from generals to 
conscripts, feel sincere respect for individuals and are under 
strict orders to avoid committing any violations, the Armed 
Forces command from the very first moment of this action issued 
written and oral orders to avoid any brutality or cruelty. 
  As soon as the investigation was completed, which 
necessarily 
had to be carried out at the scene of the crime, the prisoners 
were transferred to Quito to be turned over to the police 
authorities. Not because the "minister of defense was going to 
shine by showing off prisoners within 48 hours," as Mr. Ponce 
irresponsibly says, but so that they could be tried by competent 
judges and have the opportunity to defend themselves. The 
civilized and law-abiding manner in which the Armed Forces have 
behaved, and that deserves the recognition of the Ecuadoran 
people, is shamefully denigrated by Mr. Ponce. 
  The unquestionable fact that the narco-guerrillas have not 
penetrated, and coca and marijuana cultivation has not 
proliferated in such a difficult geographic area, inhabited by 
many illegal immigrants and not a few drug traffickers and 
criminals, is the result of devoted and persevering military 
patrolling that honors the Armed Forces, although Mr. Ponce may 
say that the prisoners were taken so that the minister of 
defense could have the audacity to say that the borders are well 
defended. The ambush did not take place in the interior of 
Ecuador, but on the banks of a border river. 
  Credit cannot be denied the Armed Forces so arbitrarily, as 
Mr. Ponce so impudently does, while conferring it, also 
arbitrarily, on confessed malefactors. What is the aim of this 
type of behavior? Is it to destroy the credibility of the forces 
responsible for maintaining the law and security so that the 
Ecuadoran people will remain defenseless before the aggression 
of the narco-guerrillas? This is why the words of Mr. Ponce who 
says, referring to the murdered policemen and soldiers: "those 
deaths cause us as much sorrow as they cause you," sound 
completely insincere and false. 
  Anyone, not to mention someone who writes for an important 
newspaper, knows that a person accused of murder will resolutely 
deny committing a crime punishable by 16 years of imprisonment; 
and he also knows that the guerrillas, the bolder and more able 
they are, know how to conceal themselves among the people, in 
whose eyes they seem peaceful citizens. They dress in the 
clothing of simple peasants, they work just as other country 
people do, but one day they dig up their weapons and kill 
without pity. If the Armed Forces were so ingenuous and 
unprepared as to allow themselves to be fooled by these tricks, 
they would not deserve the trust of the people, but rather their 
repudiation and the most severe sanction. 
  The prisoners are in the hands of justice, before whom they 
will have to prove their innocence. Justice is not being denied 
them. The Armed Forces are in no way interested in incriminating 
innocent people, but neither can they become accomplices to such 
a horrendous crime. 
  I think it is necessary to emphasize that the prisoners were 
turned over by the Armed Forces to the appropriate authorities, 
in the presence of journalists, and with individual medical 
examinations. None of the prisoners was in poor health, so as to 
make one think that they had been subjected to brutal treatment. 
The impressions on their wrists are to be found on those who 
have been bound or handcuffed for long periods because they are 
dangerous; signs of chafing on their bodies are the effect of 
carrying heavy burdens or weapons for long periods, or they are 
caused by traveling through the forest. They are impressions 
found very often on the body of a soldier or a guerrilla, and 
they are indications of the activity that person has engaged in. 
  Even before these accusations against military personnel 
were 
made, the minister of defense and the Armed Forces command 
ordered a complete and impartial investigation of those events. 
Our institution has the most interest in seeing that it not 
contain sadists or criminals, since we well know that these are 
the seeds of self-destruction. 
  There is in the Armed Forces a sincere feeling of respect 
for 
the dignity of the Ecuadorans, and we feel that this dignity is 
the principal object of our efforts to protect security. For 
that reason, the agreement that the Armed Forces has with the 
Latin American Association for Human Rights, whose purpose is to 
encourage respect for those rights, and the agreement with the 
Ecuadoran Red Cross to foster international human rights, are 
evidence of the purest and most sincere desire to ensure that 
Ecuadorans live in complete dignity. 
  I believe that this letter also allows me to direct myself 
to 
my comrades in the Armed Forces, to ask them never to allow 
themselves to be led into criminal or abusive behavior, however 
brutal the narco-guerrillas and other criminals may be, because 
military commanders will take the necessary measures to ensure 
that the Armed Forces always keep their honor and credibility 
clean. 
  Mr. Editor, I believe that the minister of defense, chief of 
the military front, has every right to have this letter 
published on the same page on which the article by Mr. Javier 
Ponce appeared. 
  Confident in your sense of justice, I am pleased to 
reiterate 
to you my sincere consideration and respect. 
  Cordially, Jose Gallardo Roman General of the Army Minister 
of National Defense

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Ecuadoran economic developments monitored through on 
15 February. 
  The Agriculture Ministry announced on Wednesday, 9 February, 
that in January Ecuador surpassed its export record by selling 
239,130 tons of agricultural products in the international 
market. A ministry spokesman indicated that Ecuador was able to 
sell 58,403 tons more than in January of last year, despite 
restrictions imposed by the European Union. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 1633 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Figures released on 9 February by the Ecuadoran State 
Petroleum Enterprise (Petroecuador) indicate a barrel of 
Ecuadoran oil sold for an average of $12.50 during in the early 
part of February. Last December, the average price per barrel 
dropped to $9. An attempt by the government to fill the gap in 
revenues caused by this drop led to a crisis in the country. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 1759 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) has signed a one-year contract 
with 
Petroecuador to purchase 2.555 million gallons of fuel oil. 
Pemex indicated it will receive this oil in 13 shipments worth 
$2-3 million each. Petroecuador has already signed a similar 
agreement with the U.S. companies Clarendon and Vito. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX 1712 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  In January, Ecuador began to withhold 20 percent of its 
coffee exports, joining producer countries that are seeking to 
stabilize coffee prices with this measure. During this period, 
Ecuador withheld over 11,500 sacks of coffee. (Quito Voz de los 
Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Feb 94)

  [Text] Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera has 
asserted that, in his country, citizens of Cuban origin are not 
persecuted and that there are only controls to prevent illegal 
trips to the United States. 
  Danilo Garcia, president of the Association of Cubans in the 
Dominican Republic, said the attempts to leave that country in 
fragile boats are a result of the U.S. refusal to grant them a 
visa to travel to Florida to join their relatives. 
  Observers noted that the attempts by Cuban citizens to 
travel 
illegally to the United States are linked to the favorable 
greeting given to those who use those means, in spite of the 
serious risk to their lives.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jose Armas] </F>
  [Text] Last night, the Voice of America [VOA], an official 
institution of the U.S. Government, reported during their 
Spanish broadcasts on the meeting that the Cuban Government and 
the organizations of our country have just proposed for April, 
entitled: Cuba and the Exile Community. 
  In essence, the VOA stated that President Fidel Castro had 
extended an invitation to exiled Cubans throughout the world and 
that the only condition set on attending the conference was 
loyalty to the Revolution. 
  Even though the VOA transmissions are aimed at Latin America 
and the Caribbean and practically all the rest of the world, it 
is imperative to state the following: The VOA's report is 
flagrantly false. First: The summons was not made on behalf of 
Comrade Fidel but on behalf of the Revolutionary government and 
the Cuban organizations. Second: Nowhere in the text of the call 
are Cuban exiles mentioned, but persons and organizations who 
are representative of Cuban emigration. Third: It is a flagrant 
and miserable lie to state that the only condition demanded by 
the Cuban authorities to attend the conference was loyalty to 
our Revolution. 
  The summons states the determination of the Cuban 
authorities 
and people to advance toward normalization of relations with 
those residents abroad who, constituting a majority of emigres, 
are not relinquishing their ties with the country. They do not 
condition them on personal and political aspirations or group 
interests. That is something very different from what the VOA 
stated. 
  Cuba is not making a call for a political dialogue, even 
though the summons has, of course, a certain political 
connotation. The Cuban proposal is based on humanist principles. 
As for the rest, the VOA can be sure that the conference will be 
held and that it will not be a dialogue of the deaf, but a 
dialogue between men and women of good will.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and Guests Osvaldo Rodriguez of the weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE and 
Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Roque] Today we would like to discuss the 
invitation for a conference between Cubans and the exile 
community. Where do we begin? 
  [Sexto] Well, Rodriguez just pointed out to me, so I will 
begin, that an invitation has been extended for a dialogue. I 
take this invitation as an effort by our country to build a 
bridge for the Cuban community abroad. This is not the first 
time that our country has tried to build a bridge. We recall 
that Cuba also tried to establish a bridge for Cuban exiles in 
1978. Cuba tried to maturely understand their situation. It 
tried to give to that community its value and role within our 
history, within our set of problems, and within our then current 
situation. 
  [Roque] And that strengthens the idea of a family reunion. 
  [Sexto] Indeed. Cuba has also tried to reunite the Cuban 
family. It has sought a reunion, which is one of the essential 
causes for maintenance of the migration level in our country. 
That is, since the first years of the Revolution, there has been 
a migratory chain of relatives. This has been one of the causes 
of a continuous emigration over the past years. The Revolution 
has tried to resolve this problem of distance and separation of 
family members. Everyone must remember that this was attempted 
in 1978, and if not premature, I believe there were neither 
objective or subjective conditions to make this dream come true. 
  [Roque] What we are certain about is that the Cuban 
Government has always favored reunion of the Cuban family. It 
has always been said that there were not the conditions here for 
receiving many of those people who wished to be reunited with 
their relatives. But the willingness, the idea that this 
existed, has always been on the negotiating table. At least I 
think willingness existed in 1978. 
  [Rodriguez] I also think that in a way, the Cuban family has 
always been a hostage of the Cuban-U.S. conflict and policy. 
  [Roque] Well, that is another subject we are going to 
discuss 
later. 
  [Rodriguez] Well, yes, it is another problem, but this idea 
of being hostage to a policy, namely the U.S. hostile policy 
toward Cuba, represents a wall, a curtain, a barrier against 
family reunion, because the United States has used the migration 
issue as a spearhead against the Revolution. Undoubtedly, when a 
relative of yours is on the opposite side of the idea you 
defend, or the cause you defend, a disruption takes place within 
the family. But today I think we are reuniting many families 
divided for political reasons, families that have adopted 
different political stances after being separated. But this is 
not happening for the first time now, during this revolutionary 
period. It also happened during the Spanish period. There were 
families, well, Creoles of Spanish descent, who broke from one 
another because they defended different positions. 
  Later, during the era of the Republic -- or during the 
pseudo- republic as we call that period of successive 
governments of representative democracy -- many families were 
also broken up for political reasons. I think the time has come 
to end this political disruption in family relations because 
with greater respect within families, with greater respect for 
the ideas each might hold, without humiliation or offense, the 
families with varying points of view can be reunited. 
  [Sexto] I believe, Osvaldo, that except for the people who 
could have left the country for true political reasons, the rest 
of our exiled people have misinterpreted that policy or have had 
a mistaken idea about it. That is, Cuban exile is eminently 
economic. The Cuban exile who goes to the United States, the 
principal immigration center of America and the world, obviously 
seeks to improve his well-being. But to migrate to that country, 
he is forced to adopt a different stance, because as you have 
just said, the emigrants have been hostages of the U.S. policy 
against the Cuban Revolution. The United States has politicized 
immigration because right now the best means of going to the 
United States is by assuming a political stance against the 
Cuban Revolution. For instance, today it is very difficult to 
obtain a legal visa to enter the United States from Cuba. It is 
very difficult for you to be granted a visa to legally settle 
down in the United States. However, if you get there on a 
bicycle, on a raft, or a barge, you are immediately and 
automatically admitted into the United States because you are 
considered a political refugee. 
  [Rodriguez] I would like to give you a little example of 
this. Not long ago I heard a casette tape, sent by a boy who had 
to migrate from one country to another until he reached the 
United States. But in the United States he had to make remarks 
against Cuba to be admitted. He sent this casette to his 
relatives, expressing regret that he made those remarks. He 
said: If my friends who know my way of thinking had heard my 
remarks, they would definitely think that I am a dishonest man. 
  [Roque] Friends, we are discussing the invitation for a 
dialogue with the exile community from 22 to 24 April in Havana. 
I think we can discuss the ideas currently prevalent among 
Cubans and the exile community on this conference. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe there are some who think this step is 
being taken because of a crisis situation in the country. I have 
heard some clear statements in this regard: that this decision 
was made because the country is in crisis. I do not believe the 
crisis has anything to do with the reunion, with the 
normalization of relations. In fact, the possibility of 
normalization had been much discussed before the crisis. 
  Moreover, as Sexto just said, talks with the community in 
the 
United States, and with the entire community abroad, began in 
1978. These talks were aborted because of the enemy's 
activities. My opinion is that we should not expect this 
community to help us economically, although it could happen. But 
the objective is not for it to help us economically. I think the 
normalization of relations with Cuban exiles is a human right, a 
right of the family. If I am a Cuban who decided for any reason 
to migrate to another country, I must be respected as a Cuban, 
just as I must respect my country's government and the decision 
of the majority of the people. It is that respect that is being 
sought. But I think the invitation read by the foreign minister 
is very clear. There will be no talks about this or another 
political system. The discussion will deal with the civilian and 
legal situation of the exiles. This must be made very clear 
because the invitation itself is clear in this respect. I think 
it will be broadly discussed soon. 
  [Sexto] I do not think Cuba will be talking with the 
political exile community. Cuba will speak to the economic exile 
community. The economic exile community is a world phenomenon. 
This is what we are talking about. We must clearly note the 
difference between a political and an economic exile. Of course 
the political exiles will not be present at that conference 
because the political community is an organization which leaves 
the country with the intention of returning to impose the 
reestablishment of its party and its class, to restore the 
government or the power it had lost. That is what characterizes 
the political exiles. This can be clearly seen within the Miami 
community. There is a political community, which fights day 
after day -- fights, talks, kicks, and moans. It cries in the 
hope of returning to reimpose its idea, to reassume the 
government. They do not care about the interests of Cuba or of 
the Cuban people. They only care for their political interests. 
  Those who will come in April are economic exiles who left 
the 
country to improve their well-being, to find ways to fulfill 
their aspirations and talents, but who wish to maintain a link 
with their people. The Cuban by tradition is patriotic. It is 
appropriate that this community maintains its language, its 
traditions, its culture. They must be respected for this, and 
given consideration. A link must be built between them and us. 
No political matters will be discussed. These people will not 
demand power. They will not come to ask the working class for 
power. They are not coming to ask the Communist Party for power. 
They are not coming to ask Cuba to sacrifice its national 
interests. They are coming to ask for what we can give them: 
understanding, ties with their relatives, ties with their 
country, and ties with their culture. 
  [Roque] We are getting to the end of the program, and we 
must 
reach a conclusion on this invitation to the conference. But are 
the Cubans, the Cubans who are here, aware of the times that are 
coming, of this exchange of ideas, of this rapprochement with 
the community that lives not only in the United States but 
throughout the world? 
  [Rodriguez] I think our people have been politicized. They 
have a fine understanding of what could happen. They are aware 
of the possible outcome. When you speak with a worker who has a 
lower cultural level -- the lowest level for us is the ninth 
grade -- speaking with workers, we realize that they are aware 
of what is happening. They are also aware of the fact that the 
policy on migration has changed because we know one another 
better. The idea we have on migration has also changed. 
  [Roque] Do you not think that changing the idea of those who 
are on the other side might also change the U.S. policy imposed 
all along concerning the Cuban economic and political situation? 
  [Sexto] It is possible. It is possible, but this is not the 
time to prophesy anything. It could be a pressure element 
forcing the United States to reconsider its policy. I think we 
Cubans who are on this side must be aware that many Cubans who 
are on the other side are also changing their ideas on the 
situation. They are becoming aware of the false idea they had 
that forced their migration. We must also admit and recognize 
that we cannot continue ignoring the U.S. policy toward Cuba, 
which has taken the migration issue as a pressure and propaganda 
element against our country and its interests. We must admit 
that, except for that political sector of the exile community 
that is fighting to return to this country as a conqueror, the 
rest are true Cubans who by right deserve to have an affective 
link with their people. 
  [Rodiguez] Well, answering Roque's question on the nation 
and 
migration, and what could be said about it, I think we Cubans 
comprise a single nation. We will always be a single nation 
regardless of where our citizens live. This has been 
demonstrated by that community in Miami that has not allowed 
itself to be affected by another society. 
  [Roque] I wish to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto for 
their participation in this discussion on the invitation for 
dialogue with the exile community that will be held in Cuba in 
April, 1994.

  [Text] The development of a 12.7-mm caliber assault rifle, 
the "Mambi," is among the most outstanding contributions of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] weapons specialists during 
1993. The assault rifle was developed by Lieutenant Colonel 
Armando Gutierrez Mesa. Margarita Torres has more detials: 
  [Torres] The "Mambi" is designed to fire on assault 
helicopters, which were used by the Yankees in their aggressions 
in Panama and the Gulf War. We will learn more of the rifle's 
combat capability from the coauthor of the project, Lieutenant 
Colonel Giraldo Perez Banos. 
  [Perez] We have the capability of hitting a target at 2 km 
with very high accuracy. In tests, we verified that this assault 
rifle can hit a target measuring 2 meters by 2 meters at a 
distance of 2 km. That is more than enough to counter this 
technique by the enemy. 
  [Torres] How much does it weigh? 
  [Perez] This assault rifle weighs approximately 14 kg and 
can 
be readily handled by any combatant. It is 1.4 meters in length 
and its center of gravity has been designed to rest on the 
shoulder of the marksman, which makes the weapon very easy to 
use. 
  [Torres] Are we talking about an authentically Cuban assault 
rifle? 
  [Perez] That is one of its main characteristics. Despite the 
special period, Cuba has been able to design a weapon with these 
characteristics that is effective against such means of 
aggression as enemy helicopters. We have used Soviet 12.7-mm 
caliber ammunition in it. We have designed a system by which one 
man can fire an assault rifle of such size by himself. 
  [Torres] The Cuban Science Academy named this portable 
12.7-mm caliber assault rifle one of the outstanding scientific 
projects of the country in 1993.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in 
Spanish between 7 and 16 February. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 7 February reports that after 
two senior citizens were killed on 31 December in Centro Habana 
Municipality, rumors creating a distorted view of the events 
began to circulate. Foreign radio stations directed towards 
Cuba, discrediting the international image of the Revolution, 
claimed that in Cuba there is no security for citizens who 
receive dollars from relatives in the United States; they are 
vulnerable to attack and even murder by criminals trying to rob 
them. 
  To clarify events, Radio Progreso interviews First 
Lieutenant 
Alberto Molina Perez of the homicide department of the 
provincial unit of police operations in Havana City who was in 
charge of the investigation. 
  Molina Perez states that on the evening to 31 December, the 
Havana City homicide department received word that a double 
murder had been committed. The victims were Santiago Martinez 
Hernandez, 85 years old, and Eliodora Josefina Suarez Ramos, 83. 
Clues, including fingerprints, led to the identification of 
persons suspected of this crime which, according to the 
announcer, is uncommon and caused great consternation among the 
people. During the investigation, one of the suspects confessed. 
  According to Molina Perez, the prompt response of the police 
allowed the case to be solved quickly. The two suspects, Elmis 
Barbaro Villaluz and Rolando Raul Diaz Vina, are unemployed and 
have criminal records. They are being held and in the near 
future will be tried for murder. Under the penal code, sentences 
can range from 15 to 20 years' imprisonment to the death penalty. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 on 9 February reports that Cuba plays 
an active role in the fight against drug trafficking. Several 
foreigners have been arrested transporting drugs within Cuban 
territorial waters attempting to smuggle drugs into U.S. 
territory, which were later incinerated under official 
supervision. 
  An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary 
Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana 
City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his back yard. 
According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes 
Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62 
marijuana plants in his back yard and for the possession of ten 
packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes 
confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption. 
Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this 
activity for several years and had been previously arrested for 
the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with 
the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence 
of from three to eight years in prison. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 16 February reports that 
police 
charged Cesar Carrerano Ramil, head of the wholesale food 
distribution department in Havana, and Angel Gustavo Landin 
Otero, a driver, with stealing 64 sacks of rice for resale at 
profitable prices. Carrerano Ramil and Landin Otero were 
sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, while their five 
accomplices were sentenced to five years' imprisonment. They 
will pay the Cuban state 1,280 pesos for the rice not recovered.

<F P=106> [From the "Vecto 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, former 
constitutional governor of Chiapas State has been released. It 
was shortly before 1800. It was becoming dark in Chiapas State 
and in the rest of Mexico. 
  Absalon stepped onto a rural road escorted by four or five 
members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. He was 
received by an International Red Cross [IRC] official who then 
led him to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation; and to Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in this 
conflict. 
  This has been the first step that sets the basis for what 
could become a dialogue for reconciliation and peace in Chiapas, 
for a dialogue in Chiapas. 
  Absalon Castellanos has been in contact with the media. More 
than 250 journalists left early from San Cristobal Las Casas to 
be at a point on the door step of the Lacandon jungle. This is 
what Castellanos said: 
  [Begin recording] [Castellanos] The IRC has just given me a 
medical examination. I want to say that I wish to see Chiapas 
in peace and calm, with everybody working for progress. 
  [Ruiz] Several persons were unable to see the sequence of 
events here. Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis came earlier and the Red 
Cross preceded us adequately. Both of us, Camacho Solis and 
myself, witnessed the thorough examination that the IRC 
conducted on General Castellanos, whom we have found to be in 
better health than ourselves. 
  General Castellanos himself has affirmed that he was treated 
well and that he is in good health, and we have verified that. 
The Zapatist Army delivered the general to Dr. Meyer, of the 
IRC. Dr. Meyer then delivered the general to me, and I 
delivered General Castellanos to Camacho Solis who now will take 
the general to his family, if this is what is decided. 
  I have proposed administering the ashes now since today is 
Ash Wednesday and it is also the day this event has taken place. 
We will do it in a symbolic fashion. [end recording] 
  This is what happened a few minutes ago in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, 
Chiapas State. 
  The general has been delivered to his relatives. Some of his 
closest relatives were present for this undoubtedly moving 
ceremony. The general and his wife, Elsy Herreria, embraced each 
other. Their children, Absalon and Oscar, who is an 
Institutional Revolutionary Party delegate in Quintana Roo 
State, received the former state governor with tears in their 
eyes. 
  Camacho Solis and Bishop Ruiz will go with Castellanos to a 
military post where a helicopter is waiting to take them to a 
hospital. 
[Paris AFP in Spanish at 0051 on 17 February reports that the 
guerrillas announced that as of Thursday they will stop 
collecting the war tax "in the locations where it has been 
implemented" in the State of Chiapas, as "an additional action 
to create an appropriate climate" for the dialogue.]

  I want to state my opinion on this important moment in 
Guadalupe Tepeyac. We are confirming that policies based on 
principles are the best road for resolving conflicts and 
problems. 
  This result would not have been achieved through violence. 
Reason and the search for peace and reconciliation are stronger. 
This is only one step, but it is a firm step on the road for 
peace and reconciliation. I think we all here today have 
learned much; both sides have. The main significance is we all 
want an honorable peace for the men, women, and children of 
Chiapas and Mexico. Viva Mexico!

<F P=106> [Report by Susana Solis from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A confrontation between members of the National 
Action Party [PAN] and the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI] resulted in some 40 people injured in Copainala, Chiapas. 
Four persons had to be hospitalized. 
  The incident occurred when PRI supporters tried to dislodge 
PAN members who had seized the municipal palace to demand the 
removal of Mayor Maurilo Cortazar Aguilar from the municipal 
presidency. The PRI members organized a march through several 
streets of Copainala to express their support for Cortazar. 
Once they reached the municipal building, they tried to 
dislodge the PAN members. The PAN members repelled the 
aggression and left the building following the squabble. 
  The state government has appointed deputy commissions to 
conduct audits in municipalities such as Tuzantan, Huehuetan, 
and Teopisca, where conflicts exist and where municipal palaces 
have already been vacated. 
  The Chanal municipal palace was seized by people demanding 
the mayor's removal. In Cacahoatan, there was a sit-down strike 
in front of the municipal palace today. In addition, peasant 
organizations have taken over at least 100 farms in several 
municipalities.

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Feb (EFE) -- Foreign Secretary 
Manuel Tello said today the Mexican Government will ask the 
United States to suspend or modify the new immigration measures 
which are expected to harden the actions against illegal Mexican 
immigrants. 
  Tello underscored that Mexico wants an end to the U.S. 
Border 
Patrol's xenophobia against illegal Mexicans and it wants 
respect for the human rights of immigrants, regardless of 
whether they are legal or illegal. 
  The U.S. Government on 3 February released a new immigration 
program to control the crossing of illegal Mexicans through the 
border between the cities of Tijuana, in northwestern Mexico, 
and its neighbor, San Diego, in the United States. The measures 
include the incorporation of 1,010 Border Patrol officers, 
construction of double walls along the dividing line, the 
installation of sophisticated equipment to detect illegals, and 
the deportation of illegal criminals. 
  "The Mexican Government remains concerned about the 
hardening 
of the measures against immigrants in the border area, because 
the problem will only be resolved in the long term and with 
specific rather than police measures," the foreign secretary 
said. 
  On 8 February, Tello met with U.S. Attorney General Janet 
Reno, who informed him of the measures her government has 
decided to take. Tello indicated that the Mexican Government is 
analyzing the measures announced by its neighbor and those 
already implemented along the 3,000-km border because they cause 
"permanent irritation in bilateral relations." 
  The request for the modification or suspension of the 
measures will be presented during a bilateral Mexican-U.S. 
meeting to be held in Neuvo Laredo, Mexico, on 7 March. 
  According to researchers of the Northern Border College 
[Colegio de la Frontera Norte], at least 150,000 illegal 
Mexicans annually cross the border into the United States in 
search of better job opportunities. The researchers said the 
city of Tijuana, Baja California, is the area through which 80 
percent of the Mexican illegals cross, although they are 
generally arrested and deported to Mexico in their initial 
attempts.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Angel Salaverria said yesterday 
U.S. Major Ismael Lopez, accused of murdering his bodyguard, 
will face a court martial in the United States within 60 days. 
  The Foreign Minister explained: "They have invited the 
Salvadoran Attorney General's Office to be present at the trial 
and have asked our investigating units to participate with their 
U.S. counterparts." 
  The foreign minister said the U.S. Embassy is aiding the 
relatives of Jose Crescencio Diaz, the bodyguard murdered on 21 
January in Soyapango. 
  The U.S. officer left El Salvador almost immediately after 
Diaz' death. This moved the Salvadoran Government to send a 
protest note to the U.S. Government asking for penalties for 
whoever was responsible of violating Salvadoran immigration laws. 
  On another issue, the foreign minister said it is expected 
El 
Salvador will be taken off the list of countries that violate 
human rights by the end of February or the beginning of March. 
  Reportedly the UN Human Rights Committee, which is meeting 
in 
Switzerland, will be adopting this decision. 
  The official said a group of Salvadoran experts is 
participating in that meeting and, if necessary, he would return 
to Switzerland to be present for the voting. 
  Salaverria said: "As a result of the signing of the peace 
agreements, human rights violations that were a product of the 
war dropped considerably, and the country's situation looks 
different." 
  Foreign Minister Salaverria said he has sent letters to the 
countries that are members of the commission to help in taking 
El Salvador off a list "on which we should not be listed."

<F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora; from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A number of congressmen have expressed opposing 
views concerning the speech delivered by Dr. Bryan Atwood, 
[special envoy for the U.S. secretary of state and worldwide 
administrator of AID]. While opposition deputies view the U.S. 
warning as a wake-up call for the government to adopt a firm 
stand against the promoters of violence, Arena [Nationalist 
Republican Alliance] Deputy Gloria Salguero Gross says the 
violence has its origins in the past. 
  During his speech to the congress, Atwood said that friendly 
countries are concerned about the escalation of violence 
reported over the past few days in El Salvador. Nevertheless, 
Salguero Gross said that incidents reported thus far have been 
isolated cases that should not be sources of concern. 
  [Begin Salguero recording] I believe the irrational events 
that have taken place lately are normal following the violence 
our country has experienced. However, each and every Salvadoran 
should take an interest in putting at a distance those 
individuals who still have sick minds and destructive thoughts. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the opposition takes a different view. In their 
opinion, Atwood's warning exposes the government's lack of 
interest in resolving the violence issue and in severely 
punishing the perpetrators of violent acts which, in the opinion 
of many deputies, may block economic aid to El Salvador if it is 
not resolved in a timely manner. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The 
government has shown a lack of interest in resolving the 
problem. There are such cases as the National Civilian Police 
and the violence that prevails among political party members. 
It is obvious that the government has much to do in this area. 
  [Second unidentified congressman] It is up to the government 
to pay attention to this issue and to attempt to counteract any 
form of violence, regardless of where the perpetrators may be or 
the level of influence they may have in the decisionmaking 
process. [end recording] 
  Over the past few days there have been attacks on members of 
political parties, which have heightened fears of an escalation 
of violence that could hamper the political campaigns which, up 
until early February, remained normal.

  [Text] The prevailing tension that borders on economic 
warfare between the United States and Japan places our country 
in an extremely delicate situation that prompts us to conduct 
ourselves with the utmost caution lest we harm the ties that 
bind us to the two nations that are now at odds. 
  Indeed, the long-standing ties that bind us to the United 
States must be carefully maintained and advanced, mostly because 
the treaties that will make the Panama Canal entirely our 
responsibility will soon go into effect. Now would not be the 
most appropriate time for any cooling of the relations we have 
maintained from the birth of our Republic to date. In addition, 
any shift on our part against the northern nation would prompt 
an immediate reaction from the U.S. side that could only bring 
negative consequences for us. On the other hand, Japan is a 
major canal user, not to mention the fact that we are linked to 
them by a treaty on alternatives to the Canal, whether it leans 
toward the construction of a sea level canal or a third set of 
locks. A cooling of our many ties with such an important ally 
that also maintains immense commercial relations with our 
country would not be advisable for us, either. Circumstances 
such as those mentioned above demand from our government, mainly 
our Foreign Ministry, a cautious, intelligent, and evenhanded 
attitude to conduct our relations with the two nations as if on 
a razor's edge. Otherwise we would run the risk of leaning too 
heavily on one side to the detriment of the other, which would 
really mean acting against ourselves.

  [Text] State workers leader Armando Sanchez said on 14 
February that state workers staged a peaceful demonstration to 
demand that the government give them a 40-percent salary 
increase, and reiterated their decision to call for a general 
strike on 18 February. Sanchez added that the union members 
pointed out that their demands are fair and necessary in light 
of the Guatemalan economy's inflation rate. 
  Workers noted that in the past weeks, the prices of basic 
necessities have experienced a significant increase to the 
detriment of family finances. Price increases for basic 
necessities combined with the increase in rural transportation 
fares and fuel have affected the poorest families. With the 
increased prices for widely used products, in addition to higher 
interurban transportation rates and fuel prices, the hardest hit 
are Guatemalan families who do not have and are unable to obtain 
the necessary funds to survive. 
  The government employees march began at 1000 and covered the 
main streets and avenues of Guatemala City. The demonstrators 
carried banners and posters with antigovernment slogans. 
Standing across from the National Palace, the state employees 
chanted: "Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle; 
Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle," and they 
subsequently took up positions at the building's main entrance. 
The guards closed the doors to prevent any incidents. 
  The demonstrators eventually withdrew voluntarily but gave 
assurances that their activities and demonstrations will 
continue until De Leon Carpio meets the state employees' demands.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza Rosales] </F>
  [Text] During a cabinet meeting held yesterday at the 
Presidential House, the head of state ordered all his ministers 
of state to begin pertinent proceedings so the respective 
documentation is prepared for those people who do not work. 
These documents will immediately follow the appropriate 
administrative procedures through the Attorney General's Office, 
according to each case. 
  The public sector's suspension of activities, and their 
negative repercussions for the population with less economic 
resources, was one of the leading issues reviewed during the 
meeting, according to statements made by government officials 
and presidency spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman. 
  Loarca Guzman said the Executive Branch is still 
particularly 
inclined toward a dialogue, which was the intention since the 
beginning, and the documents which certify workers have 
abandoned their jobs are simply part of the usual legal 
proceedings. 
  Meanwhile, labor leaders like Luis Lara, of the Health 
Workers' National Assembly [Asamblea Nacional de Trabajadores de 
Salud], maintain their position concerning the legality of their 
measures and the fairness of their requests; adding that the 
Executive Branch has yet to fulfill their demands although they 
participated in a dialogue. 
  Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency, 
reported that in the case of labor stoppages decreed without 
meeting the legal requirements, the Civil Service Law and Labor 
Code are applicable -- the latter in a supplementary manner -- 
aside from a specific decree which regulates the workers' right 
to go on strike.

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Feb (DPA) -- The Guatemalan Army is 
allegedly preparing to launch "strong military offensives" in 
the main conflict areas of that Central American country, 
according to statements made today in the Mexican capital by the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). 
  The coalition of guerrilla organizations did not provide 
details of the alleged military plans but said they are 
displaying "the absence of political will at the military staff" 
regarding the next round of peace negotiations scheduled for 
March. 
  While accusing the Army of seeking a "military solution" to 
the Guatemalan crisis, the URNG reiterated "only through 
negotiations can a firm and lasting peace with social justice be 
built in Guatemala."

  [Excerpts] Calm has returned following the strong pushing 
and pulling between the Defense Ministry and the Air Force over 
equipping and repairing the 36 Skyhawk planes. Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion proposed a consensus agreement. Military Affairs 
Secretary Jorge Baeza and Planning Secretary Guillermo 
Etchechouri are responsible for its implementation. Thus the 
confrontation between the U.S. Navy on one side, and Smiths 
Industries and Lockheed is resolved. 
  The two secretaries yesterday met with Brigadiers Ricardo 
Zini and Ricardo Coletti to discuss the participation of 
Lockheed in the deal without delaying the planes delivery 
schedule. This was the condition imposed by the Air Force, 
which considered recommending not purchasing the Skyhawks if the 
delivery of the planes was delayed for more than 24 months. 
[passage omitted] 
  Faced with those arguments Camilion managed to find the 
solution: He will not completely remove from the U.S. Navy the 
business of repairing the planes, he will give some 
participation to Lockheed. Smiths Industries and with the other 
companies in charge of the electronic equipment of the Skyhawks 
will also participate. This solution has the endorsement of 
U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. 
  Following the decision by the U.S. Navy and Smiths 
Industries 
to share part of their business, Lockheed finds itself 
participating in an operation worth about 250 million pesos. 
Camilion's idea is to support the participation of the Military 
Aircraft Factory in Cordoba, as planned by Lockheed. The 
brigadiers do not agree. They want the planes quickly.

  [Text] The Armed Forces yesterday conveyed to the 
government their "concern and uneasiness" about the arrival of 
Italian court officials who are conducting a trial against 
Argentine military officers on charges of having kidnapped, 
tortured, and disposed of 65 Italian citizens during the 
National Reorganization Process days. 
  The military unrest was more clearly expressed in the report 
Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief of the Armed Forces 
Joint Staff, handed yesterday to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion 
after consulting the heads of the three Armed Forces branches by 
phone. 
  Diaz reported to Camilion on a legal detail which, according 
to the military, nullifies the Italian court officials' 
procedures. 
  Military sources reported to CLARIN: "The situation has 
created intense uneasiness among military leaders, who are 
alarmed at the decision to reopen a process they believed to 
have been definitively closed. We reported this yesterday to 
the political branch." 
  Lawyers Marcelo Gentili and Giancarlo Maniga arrived in 
Argentina on 13 February. Judge Antonio Cappiello and attorney 
Antonio Marini are expected to arrive on 15 February. They will 
hear testimonies by 30 relatives of the missing Italians, while 
a trial of those who are allegedly responsible for their 
disappearance is being prepared in Rome. 
  If the Italian courts find the Argentine officers guilty, an 
international order for their arrest may be issued. Although 
such order is not applicable in Argentina, it will be complied 
with abroad. 
  According to the Convention for Legal Assistance on Penal 
Matters, which was signed by Argentina and Italy on 9 December 
1987 and ratified by Law 23707 on 13 September 1989, the Italian 
court officials cannot conduct investigation in Argentina, but 
can act under federal government supervision. In this case, 
Federal Court Judge Gustavo Adolfo Literas will hear the 
witnesses' testimony and decide on the extent of participation 
in the lawsuit. This evidence may be given to the Italian court 
officials. 
  The Argentine military believe the government should only 
assist the Italian courts when these are investigating crimes 
perpetrated in Italy and not those committed in Argentina, where 
the Law of Expiration, the Due Obedience Law, and the 
Presidential Pardon Law have been enforced.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria O'Donnell from the Falklands Islands] </F>
  [Text] The Argentine Government was able to obtain the 
results of seismic studies made around the Malvinas Islands, 
which is the first step in the search for oil. The results were 
obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston 
that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy 
the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government, 
YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million 
for the seismic maps. 
  Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing 
the 
Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the 
area. Argentina reacted by sending "letters of discomfort" 
[preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them 
that any activities carried out in the waters around the 
Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal 
conflict in the future. 
  Without taking the threat into account, the island's 
government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko 
Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the 
study results up for sale late last year. 
  This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the 
island's government that the first oil company interested in 
buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of 
before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey. 
This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of 
investigation into operation. 
  Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be 
very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that 
side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a 
British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the 
Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the 
purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But 
they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a 
telephone not listed in the Houston directory. 
  Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the 
seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real 
name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps, 
according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko 
Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government. 
  The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey 
result's sale. 
  There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: "It is 
the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and 
buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if 
there is something wrong with your stomach." This is why the 
news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants. 
  Adviser Wendy Teggart said: "It is a rumor but it seems that 
YPF bought the seismic studies." But she immediately said it was 
true by adding: "It is better for us because if YPF decides to 
buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the 
Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters." 
  When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands 
without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella 
said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the 
process on those terms because no oil company would risk 
millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed 
sovereignty. 
  The island's government members who were asked by this daily 
said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large 
quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not 
those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a 
juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is 
more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that 
the first company that bought the seismic studies was 
Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will 
help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on 
hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or 
early April in Buenos Aires. 
  The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that 
the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and 
the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since 
the British went ahead with the seismic survey without 
consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less 
costly step of the process. 
  The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain 
through probes was "optimistic." The survey said there may be 
oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead 
with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling 
in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain. 
  Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is 
going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration 
and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the 
investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses 
that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that 
guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20 
or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation. 
  The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the 
possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is 
that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological 
balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style 
of their small community. 
  To answer this type of question, the islands government has 
recently contracted the services of the company Environment 
Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will 
deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have 
on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and 
began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known 
oil tax expert. 
  The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina 
is 
not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of 
is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be 
absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between 
Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.

  [Excerpts] Neuquen, 16 Feb (NA) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem and his Chilean counterpart, Patricio Aylwin, have 
dedicated an oil pipeline of 425 km that will carry oil to 
Chile. This is the most important binational project between the 
two countries. 
  The oil pipeline will increase oil transportation to 120,000 
barrels daily, which will represent $500 million a year of 
Argentine oil exports. 
  Chile hopes to save $25 million through the reduction of oil 
import costs by buying directly from Argentina. 
  The financing of the oil pipeline involved YPF [Government 
Oil Deposits], which provided 57.75 percent of the capital, the 
Bank of Rio with 30 percent, and the Chilean National Petroleum 
Enterprise (Enap) with 12.25 percent. [passage omitted] 
  Argentine Mining Secretary Alejandro Hales said the oil 
pipeline was built in 15 months with an investment of $220 
million, and that "this is a clear example that borders are 
geographical divisions that should not separate but unite." 
  The pipeline will carry from 6,000 to 8,000 cubic meters of 
crude daily in the first stage and eventually will reach 17,000 
cubic meters, about 100,000 barrels daily, that will be refined 
in Chile. 
  YPF President Jose Estenssoro said this "is the largest" 
project built by the two countries and "an important day" for 
the two.

  [Text] UDI [Independent Democratic Union] Senator Eugenio 
Cantuarias has criticized the Foreign Ministry's position 
regarding the U.S. State Department report. 
  It should be recalled that U.S. Government officials have 
issued a report stating that during 1993 there were several 
cases of human rights violations in Chile. 
  The U.S. ambassador stated that the report is positive, and 
the Foreign Ministry under secretary said it was better than the 
past one and it acknowledges the efforts made by the current 
government. 
  Cantuarias rejected the report, which he said was 
unacceptable because it represents an intervention in a 
democratic country where the state of law prevails. 
  The UDI legislator said Chilean dignity is trampled on 
whenever U.S. Government officials feel they have the right to 
intervene in domestic affairs and voice their opinion on our 
behavior. 
  Cantuarias then said that the United States has many 
unsolved 
problems and its officials should be busy trying to solve them.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Carlos Azedo, from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] has been 
brought to a standstill awaiting a decision by Senator Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso; namely, whether he will run for the presidency 
or stay in office as finance minister until the end of Itamar 
Franco's administration. The party plans to field its own 
candidates in the country's leading states at the forthcoming 
general elections, but needs a decision to consolidate alliances 
in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, 
Bahia, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Para, Goias, and the Federal 
District. 
  The PSDB leadership is confident of the upward trend in its 
popularity at last elections. Meanwhile, compromise agreements 
to establish alliances are waiting for the cat to jump. Only 
Cardoso's decision is missing to complete the PSDB tickets, as 
the names of the running mates and of the two candidates for the 
Senate have already been chosen. 
  Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Parana] said the minister's 
decision is personal and will depend on circumstances. Now that 
the economic program has been approved, the economic situation 
and the management of the economic policy will decide Cardoso's 
position. 
  The former Parana Governor contends that if Cardoso chooses 
to stay in his post, the PSDB must seek an alliance with the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and field Antonio 
Britto [PMDB-RS] [Rio Grande do Sul] as its presidential 
candidate, even though Orestes Quercia has already launched his 
candidacy to head the PMDB ticket. Richa says the so-called 
PMDB ethical group may support a PSDB candidate. 
  Exercising more caution, former Sao Paulo Governor Franco 
Montoro argues that the success of the program to curb inflation 
is far more important for the country than a discussion about a 
candidacy. Montoro believes that deciding who will be candidate 
can come later, and may very well not be Cardoso. 
  He said: We must discuss a program as the basis for our 
alliances. The party has other candidates: [PSDB Chairman] 
Tarso Jereisati, [Deputy] Jose Serra [PSDB-Sao Paulo], [Ceara 
Governor] Ciro Gomes, Jose Richa. [Senator Mario] Covas [Sao 
Paulo] is not on this list because his candidacy for Sao Paulo 
governorship is decided. 
  Senator Covas, PSDB leader in the Senate, is of the opinion 
that pressures exerted by the opposition and even from allies to 
drop Cardoso's name from the list of possible candidates are 
unacceptable. 
  He said: It is the party that decides when to field its 
candidate. Cardoso has the right to be a candidate and I am 
going to endorse his candidacy at the appropriate time. 
  Covas dismisses charges that the extension of the deadline 
for resigning from office in order to campaign for election to 
another public office seeks to favor Cardoso's interests. He 
said: We are against the proposal of Deputy Nelson Jobim 
[PMDB-RS], the constitutional revision rapporteur, concerning 
the re-election of the president and ending the need to resign 
from one office in order to run for another public office. The 
proposal to shorten the deadline for resigning from office is 
just a move of PMDB and PFL [Liberal Front Party] governors, and 
I am against it. 
  Covas, leader in the race for the Sao Paulo governorship 
according to public opinion polls, is in favor of alliances. He 
nonetheless believes the grassroots will expect the party to 
field its own candidate. He thinks it will be difficult to 
enter into alliance with the PMDB on account of Quercia's 
candidacy and the race in Sao Paulo. Covas rules out the 
possibility of reaching an agreement with the PFL. 
  This agreement with the PFL, which some members of Cardoso's 
team and some congressmen from both parties wish would come 
true, is only a dream because of the dispute between PSDB 
members and "Carlists" -- followers of Bahia Governor Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes. 
  Salvador Mayor Lidice da Matta said: I do not believe in 
this 
alliance which goes against the PSDB platform and the tradition 
of its members. 
  The PSDB has registered the greatest expansion since the 
last 
elections. It moreover has a charm that enables us to compete 
in the elections at all levels and throughout the whole country, 
she stated, adding that instead of an alliance with the PFL, she 
considers the party is much closer to the PT [Workers Party].

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Luiz Longo] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Workers Party [PT] presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva wants to use the political 
influence of his federal congressional bloc to free his 
government plan from the orthodox faction that controls the 
party. After taking a neutral position in the conflict caused by 
the national board's decision to veto the bloc's participation 
in the constitutional review, Lula decided to support the 
congressmen. During the meeting to be held with the national 
board on 17 February, they will try to ensure their right to 
autonomously choose the tactics they will use in the sessions in 
which the constitutional reform will be discussed. 
  Since the congressional bloc is an important tool to 
neutralize the radical arguments, the PT leadership believes 
that by meeting the congressmen's demands in this regard it can 
display the image of a less intransigent party and open the path 
to a more flexible program. 
  One of Lula's friends said: "The leaders' inflexibility can 
ruin everything." 
  The program drafted by radical PT members favors a 
moratorium, or suspension of payments on the foreign debt; 
compulsory rescheduling of the domestic debt; the end of 
privatizations (and reviewing the situation of some companies 
already privatized); and reactivation of military programs and 
re-equipment of the Armed Forces. 
  Believing that it will be difficult to win a two-stage 
election with this program, Lula thinks that it is fundamental 
to strengthen the congressional bloc for the debates on the 
government program. Regarding this program, however, the bloc is 
not as united as it was during the impasse resulting from the 
prohibition to participate in the constitutional review works. 
Deputy Jose Dirceu (SP [Sao Paulo]), for example, supports the 
idea of using the moratorium as a persuasive tool. 
  Dirceu, who is a member of the Articulation faction that 
supports Lula, said: "I do not understand why the right is so 
scandalized. Even Delfim Netto failed to comply with the 
agreements signed with the IMF while he was [economy] minister 
in the military regime. He then said that letters of intent were 
written to be torn up afterward." 
  Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), who also is a Articulation 
faction member in addition to Lula's economic adviser, said a PT 
administration must exert pressure on creditors to renegotiate 
the debt, but he discarded the possibility of declaring a 
moratorium. 
  Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), however, asserts that the program 
proposals for the military cannot be supported by a party that 
claims to be democratic because they imply accepting an 
authoritarian concept "very typical of a leftist faction that 
still preaches dictatorial attitudes by parties." Jorge is a 
member of the Radical Democracy faction, known as the "PT right 
wing." 
  Dirceu retorted: "These proposals have civilian goals and 
cannot be mixed with the military regime programs. Only a person 
like Eduardo Jorge can oppose them." 
  Deputy Jose Genoino (SP) believes the PT program's economic 
nucleus is "too narrow." He also criticizes the program's 
concept of creating an administration with socialist prospects. 
  He said: "A leftist party must fight to have socialist 
values and ideals incorporated in the process and thus broaden 
the concept of citizenship."

<F P=106> [From the "Pomp Column" by Cristina Lobo] </F>
  [Text] After years of shifting (and disputes) among the 
various PT [Workers Party] factions, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 
has decided to pay more attention to his election campaign. He 
will attend a meeting of the National Executive and 
congressional party bloc members tomorrow when a final decision 
on the PT participation in the constitutional revision process 
will be made. 
  The results of the meeting are more important even than the 
votes of the PT during the work of the revision process. If 
those attending the meeting approve the proposal to participate, 
it will represent a defeat for the Shiites [fundamentalist PT 
followers], those who do not want the PT involved in broader 
alliances with the center-left, and those who want a radical 
government program. 
  The so-called "flexibility" sought by some PT factions, 
according to their proponents, will permit Lula to increase 
support for his candidacy above the present 30 percent level. 
  The PT candidate is being forced to change his opinion. 
After making a harsh speech against constitutional revision two 
months ago, in accordance with the position of the National 
Executive, Lula now wants a "political participation," which is 
more in accordance with the wishes of the party bloc in Congress. 
  Another meeting with the same agenda took place last week 
but 
results were inconclusive. Lula was touring northern states at 
that time. He could have attended, but preferred not to. Now 
he is being forced to take sides in the PT internal dispute.

  [Text] Constitutional revision work will continue until 15 
May. Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio Oliveira said he 
has reached an agreement with rapporteur Nelson Jobim to extend 
the deadline for 15 days. Oliveira wants Congress to vote on 17 
February on a resolution to extend the constitutional amendment 
works -- which are currently scheduled to conclude on 15 March 
-- including amendments to the social emergency fund and a 
reduction of the presidential mandate from five to four years. 
  On 22 February Oliveira will ask the party leaders to 
guarantee the presence of at least 20 percent of their 
congressmen in the plenary hall to guarantee a quorum for all 
constitutional amendment sessions. With the help of political 
parties and the definition of a minimum work agenda, Oliveira 
believes the constitutional amendment works may conclude on 1 
May, leaving 15 days of extra time. He is sure the elections 
will not harm the constitutional amendment process. On the 
contrary, he said, the parties will wait to conclude the 
constitutional reform before defining their campaign strategy. 
  Senate President Humberto Lucena said he will suggest that 
the constitutional revision process be extended until 30 May 
because he said this is the preference of most parties.

  [Text] The government is preparing a new economic plan. 
The idea is to implement it once the Real Value Unit [URV] is 
transformed into currency. This will only occur if the 
government can substantially reduce inflation. The goal of the 
new plan is to implement an income distribution policy during 
President Franco's term in office. 
  The economic team's main concern expressed during a meeting 
on 12 February was to ensure that none of the proposed measures 
modify the current income distribution. 
  For the time being, the economic team does not want to touch 
anyone's money. Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso wants 
it clearly understood that the income policy has been left for 
another stage of the plan, thus avoiding the difficulties that 
made previous plans fail. 
  The creation of the URV will not mean the workers will have 
more money in their pockets. The economic team does not want 
consumption to grow as this may entail problems of speculation 
with stocks and shortages. 
  If the workers do not have more money at their disposal, 
they 
will not lose it either. That is why, at the 12 February 
meeting, the economic team once again discussed the need to end 
excessive price hikes and anticipated mark-ups that have taken 
place in the last few months in some sectors. 
  The economic team believe by acting in this way they will 
give credibility to the economic program. Following the 
institution of the URV as currency -- which will take place 
during the first half of this year -- the problem will be 
preventing its "contamination" by the inflationary process 
occurring in real cruzeiros. Once this is achieved, the new 
program will speedily be implemented. 
  The centerpiece of this new program is, for the time being, 
a 
mandatory profit-sharing scheme. 
  Profit-sharing is contemplated in the Constitution and has 
already been implemented by many companies, especially the 
multinationals, and this may facilitate its acceptance by more 
conservative businessmen. 
  Brazil has one of the highest income concentration ratios. 
It has always been President Franco's objective to correct this 
distortion and he has repeatedly said so to the economic team. 
Franco believes the new economic program is of paramount 
importance and must be implemented soon so that it can yield 
results during his administration.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday evening, shortly before 
leaving for Washington, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim admitted 
that the controversy between Brazil and the United States 
regarding patents and industrial property has reached "a 
difficult point." As the Brazilian Government's final attempt 
to solve this problem, Amorim accepted U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor's invitation to meet at 1330 today. 
  According to the foreign minister, bilateral disagreements 
may be overcome through the joint effort of the interested 
parties. In Amorim's opinion, the controversial items -- the 
local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, the retroactive 
recognition of patents (pipeline) [preceding word in English], 
the parallel importation of medicines and microorganisms, gained 
strength given the interpretation by each country. These 
differences, said Amorim, became more obvious during the GATT's 
Uruguay Round. 
  One of the things Amorim intends to explain Kantor is that 
Brazil fully accepts the section related to industrial 
protection (TRIPS) [Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights]. 
Amorim added that he must explain that the Brazilian Congress 
does not intend to reject the TRIPS. The foreign minister went 
on to explain: "The problem is that Congress will only vote on 
the TRIPS after its text has been signed by all the countries 
that signed the agreement during the meeting in Morocco last 
April." Amorim added: "I am certain Congress will approve it." 
  The agreement that may be reached today will have a 
significant impact on the approval of the Brazilian Industrial 
Property Code (CBPI) that has been submitted to the Senate.

  [Text] Brasilia -- U.S. threats of retaliation, with the 
goal of speeding up approval of the Patents Law, have very 
little effect on the Brazilian Congress. 
  Most congressmen act as if they already are used to the U.S. 
reaction that began way before the government sent the bill 
governing the concession of patents in April 1991. 
  The bill has been handled for two years by the Chamber of 
Deputies, where it was changed by three amendments, and has been 
stuck in the Senate since it was received in July 1993. 
  Therefore, it is unlikely the bill will be approved by the 
end of this month despite the fact that it has become a habit 
for the Senate to approve issues -- in a plenary session and 
very urgent discussions -- before the permanent committees 
review them. 
<H5>  Sovereignty </H5>
  Senator Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA [Liberal Front Party-Bahia 
State]) noted: "It is an extremely complex and delicate issue 
to be voted on under pressure by foreigners." In the senator's 
opinion, civilized coexistence among nations does not allow 
threats even if one of the nations has a major interest in the 
handling of a bill. He said: "A nation may not impose 
solutions that depend on the sovereignty of another nation." 
  Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-CE [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement 
Party-Ceara]), who replaced Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL-ES 
[Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo State]) as the Patents Law 
rapporteur, is in the United States receiving medical care. 
Last week, Mariz finally received the amendments submitted by 
his colleagues for discussion by the Constitution and Justice 
Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee. 
<H5>  Protection </H5>
  This is the phase in which the handling of a bill largely 
depends on the national lobbies [preceding word in English]. 
The bill's text is under pressure from the church, which does 
not admit the patenting of microorganisms, and various 
industrial sectors, especially the pharmaceutical industry. 
  Itamaraty sources claim that the text approved by the 
deputies was subject to long discussions and negotiations 
between the government and entrepreneurs, thus making difficult 
the introduction of any radical changes to liberalize the text 
in the Senate. The bill approved in the Chamber of Deputies 
protects any product introduced, through a copy, into the 
domestic market before the new law.

  [Text] Washington -- The official responsible for 
international drug trafficking control policies at the U.S. 
State Department said last week that his government "is 
seriously and extraordinarily preoccupied with the narcotics 
situation in Brazil." During an interview on 10 February, the 
day after President Bill Clinton announced his National Drug 
Control Strategy, Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary for 
international narcotics matters, said that despite "the dramatic 
increase" of drug trafficking activities in Brazil in the past 
five years he "is not sure there is full consciousness in the 
country about the dangerous levels the problem has reached." 
  According to the diplomat, who was the U.S. ambassador to 
Bolivia in the 1980's, Brazil today is -- together with Germany, 
Switzerland, and China -- one of the biggest suppliers of the 
chemicals used for manufacturing cocaine. The country also has 
become "one of the main routes for the transit of drugs, 
particularly on its way to Africa and Europe." 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de 
Lima 
was informed during a recent conversation with another 
top-ranking U.S. official that the next annual report on drug 
trafficking the State Department will publish in a couple of 
months will say that during 1993 there was "a relaxation of 
controls" on drug trafficking in the country. Last week the 
ambassador asked the Foreign Ministry to supply him with 
information to reply to these allegations as well as Gelbard's 
public declarations. 
  In Brasilia, official sources recognized that the seizure of 
an increasing volume of cocaine confirms the increase in drug 
trafficking activities in Brazil. "The state's incapacity and 
corruption and the judicial system's inefficiency also have 
limited government actions," an official explained. 
  In any case, Gelbard's remarks were not well-received. 
"These remarks fail to recognize the country's continuous 
efforts to fight drug trafficking in very adverse 
circumstances," said one of the ministers' advisers interested 
in the problem. The official recalled, for instance, that the 
federal government recently created a Special Narcotics 
Secretariat to coordinate the fight on drug trafficking. 
  The Americans should know of the difficulties we are going 
through, another top-ranking official said. He added: "Today 
our Federal Police drug trafficking control programs are almost 
entirely financed by the U.S. Government, which is shameful for 
the country." During the past three years, Washington assigned 
Brazil a yearly amount of nearly $1 million (out of a total of 
$80 million allocated for international cooperation to fight 
drug trafficking). 
  Strictly speaking, Gelbard's remarks do not add anything new 
to what we already know. For the past few years Washington has 
been expressing concern about the expansion of drug-trafficking 
activities in the Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon regions. As 
Gelbard said last week: "Just as in other aspects of its 
economy, Brazil has the capacity to produce a large-scale drug 
trafficking economy." Besides, "it is the only Latin American 
country that manufactures all the products necessary to become 
self-sufficient in narcotics production, from precursors to 
epadu [Brazilian coca plant]." 
  The fight on drug trafficking is one of the issues 
Washington 
wants to discuss during the hemispheric heads of state summit 
the Clinton administration is preparing for September.

  [Text] Geneva -- During the annual meeting of the UN Human 
Rights Committee yesterday, the Brazilian Government protested 
over the draft text of the future Universal Declaration of 
Indian Rights prepared by the United Nations. The declaration, 
which was written by five UN experts, gives Indians worldwide 
the right to self determination. Based on the history of 
African countries, the Brazilian Government believes such a 
concept may give the Ianomami Indians, for example, the right to 
declare independence from Brazil. 
  The Brazilian concern is considered exaggerated by the 
Indian 
defense organizations present at the meeting. In a long speech 
Ambassador Gilberto Saboia clearly established that Brazil 
intends to oppose this or any other concept that places national 
sovereignty in jeopardy. 
  "The Declaration of Indian Rights must be simple, balanced, 
and realistic," the ambassador said. 
  Gilberto Saboia reminded the representatives at the meeting 
that such a declaration will have to be approved by consensus. 
That is, without the consent of Brazil the whole text will not 
be approved. 
  Saboia said Brazil does not accept the expression 
"indigenous 
peoples" in the draft declaration, for the same reason: The word 
"peoples" is historically linked with independence. 
  The ambassador said: "Statements like that in the draft 
declaration may prompt ambiguous interpretations that are out of 
keeping with international law, the principles and objectives of 
the UN Charter, and the basic principles of the sovereignty of 
state and territorial integrity," 
  Saboia wants UN experts to clarify the meaning and extent of 
the principles described in the draft declaration which 
guarantees the rights to autonomy and self government for 
Indians. The controversy continues because the process of 
preparing the declaration does not end there: Before approval, 
the declaration must go through a series of negotiating channels 
within the United Nations and cannot be approved by the UN 
General Assembly without the agreement of members like Brazil.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmem Cruz: "Poverty Threatens Survival of </F>
Guaranis"] 
  [Text] The survival of Brazil's largest Indian nation--the 
Guarani tribe--which once occupied almost all of Mato Grosso do 
Sul State and part of the southern part of the country, is being 
threatened physically and culturally. In Mato Grosso do Sul, 
where the Guarani-Caiova and Guarani-Nhandeva subgroups are 
concentrated, their lands have been taken over by large 
landowners. Upon being evicted, the Indians congregate in a few 
areas such as Dourados and Amambai, where they are left to 
endure growing poverty. Sometimes they submit to the semislavery 
of working in the alcohol factories that have been set up in the 
area. In other cases they wander around and get drunk. And the 
number of Guarani suicides remains a sad constant. 
  Between 1986 and now, 116 Indians of all ages, but most of 
them young, have sought death by throwing themselves into 
rivers, taking poison, hanging themselves from trees, or killing 
themselves with knives. In 1987, the leader of Sete Cerros, 
Silvano Valiente, wrote a letter to the authorities asking that 
land be demarcated for his people. And he hanged himself. The 
situation grew worse in 1990, when 20 Indians committed suicide 
in Dourados alone. A total of 34 suicides were recorded that 
year. A report by the Funai [National Indian Foundation] office 
in Amambai shows that the figure was 23 the following year. 
There were another 21 suicides in 1992, and 17 Caiova and 
Nhandeva Indians killed themselves last year. 
  The explanation for so many deaths can be found in the 
Guarani belief that land is a divine gift to certain communities 
and that it therefore must not be exchanged or transferred to 
others. According to anthropologist Celso Shitosshi Aoki of the 
Caiova/Nhandeva Project, which has now been merged with the 
Center for Indian Work (CTI), the Guarani religion is complex 
and very strong, giving its adherents a holistic view of the 
world. "They do not understand, for example, why the whites 
cause them so much trouble, since they believe that it is the 
Guaranis who sustain life on earth through their prayers," the 
anthropologist explained. 
  Celso Shitosshi believes that the compulsory integration of 
the Guarani communities into the village of Dourados and other 
villages may be one factor explaining the suicides, but that 
liquor and the Pentecostal churches existing in the area are not 
preponderant factors. "I believe that the suicides have to do 
with the very way in which the Guarani must look at life from 
the standpoint of his religiousness," says Shitosshi, who 
disagrees with Funai's psychologist, Maria Aparecida da Costa 
Pereira, who stated in a report in April 1991 that the Guaranis 
were experiencing an identity crisis or losing their identity 
and that that was why they were committing suicide. 
  In that report, Maria Aparecida points out that the 
situation 
of the Guarani-Caiovas--who constitute the largest of the 
Guarani subgroups--is disastrous. "It is a society experiencing 
economic, political, and social crisis--engendering in turn a 
moral crisis--with juxtapositions and contradictions." She says 
that the solutions to the Guaranis' problems are to be found 
primarily in the "magico-religious" field and that at present, 
being faced with the imposition of "a non-Indian ethic on their 
magico-religious universe, particularly by the Pentecostal 
sects," they have had two alternatives: either reinvent 
themselves to fit a Western Christian concept or commit suicide 
as an alternative to living. 
<H5>  Suicide a Way of Asking for Help </H5>
  For the Guaranis, according to psychologist Maria Aparecida 
da Costa, planting and religion go together. Because of that, 
leasing land to non-Indians is also a factor in 
self-destruction. In the village of Dourados, where more than 
7,000 Indians are rubbing elbows with no room to live or plant, 
the Pentecostal sects are finding what Maria Aparecida calls "an 
anchorage.... given the fragile state of collective and 
interpersonal relations existing there." According to her, the 
Indians themselves admit that they are sick and disoriented 
psychologically. She sees the suicides as "messages of extreme 
supplication" by young people who have no strength left. 
  Aparecida recalled that at one big meeting, a young Caiova 
man said: "If they are not going to do anything for us, it is 
better to turn off the sun"--a metaphorical reference, the 
psychologist feels, to collective suicide. She emphasized that 
in view of the entire atmosphere of suicide in Dourados, 
measures must be taken to guarantee the minimum conditions in 
which the Guaranis can exercise their right to collective life. 
Anthropologist Celso Aoki goes further, saying that the Guaranis 
will not be able to reestablish the sociopolitical pattern for 
maintaining their ethnic identity until their lands are returned 
to them. "It is in the space defined by place that Guaranis 
fulfill their way of being and living and their traditions and 
customs: their `tecoha.'" 
  Cases--Helio Bonito was 66 years old, Marcinei Souza only 
11. 
Last year, they and 15 other Guarani Indians found in suicide 
the solution to the pain they were feeling. Helio Bonito threw 
himself into the river and drowned, while the Caiova youngster, 
who also lived in the turbulent village of Dourados 4 kilometers 
from the town of the same name, hanged himself from a tree. Two 
other members of a single family also killed themselves. A young 
girl named Neide Peixoto hanged herself early in October, also 
in Dourados. On the following day, her father took poison. Still 
in October, Ramon Garcia, 48, and Aparecido Barbosa, 40, hanged 
themselves in Amambai. The attempts at suicide are many and 
frightening. 
  Of the 21 suicides recorded by the Native Missionary Council 
(Cimi) and Funai in 1992, 20 were Guaranis. The other was 
13-year-old Janevan Rosa of the Tereno tribe, who also lived in 
Dourados. She hanged herself. Besides those cases, three deaths 
by poisoning among the Yanomami Indians seem to have been 
intentional. In one of those cases, 10 Indians ate marine toad 
eggs, which are known to be poisonous. Two died. And 24-year-old 
Piaba, whose family was decimated, ate nettle spurge. 
  The hope of the Center for Indian Rights, the Public 
Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, and other 
institutions and agencies concerned with the problems of the 
Guaranis in Mato Grosso do Sul is that it will be possible to 
persuade the STF [Federal Supreme Court] to overturn the 
injunctions obtained by ranchers. If that happens, the 
ratification decrees will have more force. 
<H5>  Land Remains With Ranchers </H5>
  The struggle by the Guaranis for their land has ended up in 
court. Although most of the areas have already been demarcated 
and ratified, the big ranchers occupying them--with land titles 
to back them up--are not returning what has traditionally 
belonged to the Caiova and Nhandeva groups. The Constitution 
clearly states (Article 231, Paragraph 6) that acts having as 
their object the occupation, control, and possession of Indian 
lands are null and void, but the ranchers, claiming that the 
land in question does not belong to the Guaranis, are trying to 
invalidate even the decrees ratifying those areas and signed by 
the president of the republic. 
  The Center for Indian Rights (NDI), in an alliance with the 
Public Prosecutor's Office in Mato Grosso do Sul, is defending 
the Guaranis in at least 10 cases now before the courts. 
According to NDI attorney Ana Valeria Araujo, a few communities 
have been able to hold out and remain in their original areas, 
but other thousands of Indians have been crowded into Dourados, 
Amambai, Caarapo, Sassoro, Takoapiry, and other places, where 
they live in a situation of growing poverty and despair. "They 
cannot live on the land that the government has taken so long to 
demarcate, and now it appears that the courts do not want to 
acknowledge their title to that land," said Ana Valeria. 
  According to her, when Funai began its process of 
identifying 
areas, the ranchers went to court, claiming that the land was 
theirs. The Indians came to be considered invaders. Beginning in 
1992, Judge Susana Gomes of Federal Court No. 2 in Mato Grosso 
do Sul granted all the petitions by the ranchers to halt Funai's 
actions even though the Indian Statute stipulates that a 
preliminary injunction halting demarcation proceedings cannot be 
granted. 
<H5>  Judge Fears for Property Improvements </H5>
  The Center for Indian Rights appealed those rulings to the 
Regional Federal Court for the Third Region in Sao Paulo, but 
there again, "the judges invented a way out by upholding only 
part of the appeal," says Ana Valeria. "Funai could put the 
markers in place, but it could not put the Indians on that land." 
  According to Ana Valeria, the Sao Paulo judge felt that if 
the Indians returned to their land, they might damage the 
improvements which the ranchers had made there in good faith and 
which are governed by the right to indemnification. Other 
actions still pending before the Federal Supreme Court challenge 
the decrees ratifying Indian areas. "The tendency is to reject 
them, since complex cases like these should not be debated in 
the form of injunctions, which are temporary and prove nothing," 
Valeria points out. 
<H5>  Communities Stand Pat </H5>
  The process of demarcating Indian lands in Mato Grosso do 
Sul 
began with the establishment of the Indian Protection Service 
(SPI) at the beginning of this century. Areas totaling 19,845 
hectares had been demarcated by 1935. Despite that, ranches 
continued to be established there, the ranchers obtained title 
to the land, and the problem has grown worse over the past two 
decades because of the continuing intention to settle the 
Indians in villages. 
  Six communities are holding on to their land, while families 
in other areas have been evicted or moved. New areas have been 
demarcated over the past two years, but they are occupied by few 
Indians. 
  The Guaranis are traditionally farmers, but they also engage 
in mining to a lesser extent. They live in groups of 
approximately 100 individuals in an area that they call 
"tecoha." According to Cimi's report, which is based on 
Montoia's dictionary, "tecoha" means "the place where one can 
find a way to exist." 
<H5>  People at the Mercy of the Courts </H5>
  Until the situation is resolved by the withdrawal of the 
ranchers, the Indians will be living in desperation. One of the 
situations causing the most concern is that of the Jaguapire 
community in the municipality of Tacuru. The area in question, 
measuring 2,089 hectares, is now being used by two big ranchers: 
Jose Fuentes Romero and Otavio Junqueira de Morais. In 1984, the 
nearly 200 Indians living there were dispossessed by court 
order. In 1992, Minister Celio Borja recognized the land as 
belonging to the Indians, and the Guarani families who had been 
settled in Amambai decided to return, occupy a piece of land 
along the southern border of Romero's ranch, and resume their 
traditional activities. 
  They began planting the cleared land, sowed crops, and 
gradually reacquired their former autonomy. When their 
activities took them close to Otavio Junqueira's ranch, he 
obtained an order in the Iguatemi District Court prohibiting the 
Indians from occupying his part of it. The Military Police were 
called in. Meanwhile, rancher Romero, who was already involved 
in legal action in the federal courts in Campo Grande, asked for 
a restraining order to make the Indians withdraw. At the end of 
last November, the case was heard, and the judge upheld the 
rancher. The public prosecutor in Mato Grosso do Sul, Joao 
Heliofar de Jesus Villar, and the NDI attorney asked for a 
60-day delay. 
  "That time is about to expire--on 29 January--and we have 
now 
appealed to the Regional Federal Court in Sao Paulo, but the 
trouble is that Judge Pedro Rotta of Section 2 of that court is 
not hearing the case," the prosecutor said, pointing out that 
the problem in the Guarani areas will not be solved until the 
Union takes real responsibility for demarcation. "It demarcates 
the land and then turns the matter over to Funai, which is 
helpless because it lacks the resources for enforcing any ban; 
all it can do is play a bureaucratic role, without taking 
political responsibility for the decision." Heliofar feels that 
if the problem is left solely in the hands of the courts, it 
will be five years before there is a solution. 
<H5>  Indians Number Nearly 30,000 </H5>
  The Guarani Indians are subdivided into three groups: the 
Caiovas or Pai-Taviteraos (which is what they call themselves in 
Paraguay), the Nhandevas, who also live in Mato Grosso do Sul, 
and the Mbi'as, who live in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, 
Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. Funai data show an 
estimated population of 30,000, making the Guaranis the largest 
Indian nation in Brazil. In second place are the Ticunas in the 
Amazon Region, who number about 23,000. In Mato Grosso do Sul 
alone, where the Caiovas are the majority, there are 24,400 
Guarani Indians, according to a survey conducted in April of 
last year. That includes about 2,000 Indians scattered around in 
the various regions. 
  In an analysis made two years ago by the Native Missionary 
Council, experts collected historical data concerning the 
Guaranis, especially the Guarani-Caiovas, who descend from the 
Guarani-Itatims, to explain that group's current context of 
resistance and [word missing]. It is pointed out that their 
traditional territory was situated between the Paraguay, 
Mbotetei, and Pira'i Aquidaban Rivers and the Xerez lands and 
that at the end of the last century, they were living in the 
same region where they live now--the extreme southern part of 
the state from the Apa River to the Paraguayan border. 
  The etymological meaning of the name Caiova, according to 
Cimi's anthropologists, is "inhabitant of the jungle"--that is, 
the rain forest. They emphasize that this anthropological 
component of the Caiovas "needs to be thoroughly understood, 
since it is the establishment of ranches and the consequent 
deforestation that lead to the discovery of Caiova Indian 
villages." At the end of the last century, that group's 
territory was the scene of many battles in the Paraguayan War. 
The border divides the Caiova communities on the Brazilian side 
from those living on the Paraguayan side.

  [Text] The economic team of the administration of President 
Rafael Caldera is making the final adjustments aimed at reducing 
the national budget for 1994 by 150 billion bolivares. 
  It is estimated that as soon as the president enters office, 
the administration will request an amendment to the Budget Law 
for 1994 to reduce appropriations and allocations which it 
considers superfluous and unnecessary. 
  Abdon Vivas Teran, economic adviser of the next 
administration and member of the transition team, has pointed 
out that one of the priorities is to deal with the problem of 
the budget deficit. That will require carefully adjusting the 
balance between government income and expenditure. 
  Public spending is one of the variables which have the most 
decisive influence on the level of aggregate demand. 
Consequently, he commented, it has a significant impact on the 
maintenance of adequate rates of growth of Gross Domestic 
Product. At the same time, by carefully managing that element it 
will be possible to have a decisive impact which will lead to a 
decline in the level of inflation and interest rates and the 
small scale devaluations through which until the exchange rate 
between the U. S. dollar and the bolivar has been set. 
  He stated that the traditional policy of expanding demand 
tends to limit the scope for reconsidering public spending. 
Reducing the level of spending to a reasonable extent and, at 
the same time, reexamining the rest of the budget is another way 
of saying that we have to reform the Budget Law of 1994. 
  Vivas Teran said that, "The study conducted by the technical 
team of the new government indicates that a reduction on the 
order of 150 billion bolivares of public spending is an 
objective which can be achieved over the very short term. These 
adjustments," which are rather limited, "will not be oriented 
toward the investment area nor toward the socially productive 
area (education, health, and public security)." He indicated 
that cuts will be made in appropriations and allocations which 
have continued to reflect exaggerated levels of spending, such 
as for automobiles, travel, highways, aircraft, celebrations, 
and publicity, among other things. 
  Vivas Teran stated that the president elect has announced a 
30 percent reduction in spending on the security of the 
Presidency and on the secret appropriation of the Ministry of 
Internal Relations. He rejected the allocation of 60 million 
bolivares for expenditures related to his inauguration. 
  Vivas Teran was asked, "Will the bureaucracy be pruned?" He 
answered: "Yes. Within the goal of reducing the budget by 150 
billion bolivares consideration is being given to the 
elimination of some unnecessary services which probably are 
duplicated elsewhere. Hence the urgent need for restructuring 
existing institutions." 
  He added that action to reduce spending should be 
accompanied 
by a series of measures to increase public receipts. These 
increases should complement the program of reforms aimed at 
modernizing and placing income tax collection on a better 
technical basis, as well as other, ordinary tax receipts, 
including the collection of duties by the customs service of the 
country. Specifically, these involve the following: 

  -  The adequate management of the whole income tax system 
(without as yet introducing changes in the law which must be 
approved by Congress), creating an autonomous income tax system 
and strictly controlling tax collections. This would make it 
possible for the Ministry of Finance to collect about 260 
billion bolivares in 1994 in this category, as compared to the 
131 billion bolivares collected up to the end of 1993. 
  -  The next 
administration should, as a matter of preference, concern itself 
with tariff collections made by customs offices. It will be 
necessary to bring up to date a technical cooperation agreement 
which Venezuela has already signed with the United Nations for 
trade and development (UNTAC) to modernize the tariff system. 
Unfortunately, the most intractable focus of corruption in the 
whole system of government tax collection is in the customs 
offices. It is essential to wipe out this system of corruption 
and make changes in management personnel. 
  In his opinion the efforts which have been made in this 
direction have been very limited. He stated that receipts by the 
Treasury from tariffs amounted to 115 billion bolivares in 1993. 
It is estimated that, with the changes to be made, customs 
receipts could rise to 350 billion bolivares. In this way the 
new government, through the application of ethical and 
administrative principles, will be able to obtain from income 
tax and customs receipts sufficient resources (about 610 billion 
bolivares) to resolve the budget deficit to a large extent. 

  -  Urgent action should be taken on taxes which are owed but 
not yet collected and on any tax measure which the government 
may approve, including those tax cases which have already been 
decided favorably in the appropriate courts. According to a 
report from the Hacienda Publica Nacional [National Treasury] 
for 1992, the cumulative total of all of the potential receipts 
by the Treasury under this heading amounted to 400 billion 
bolivares. The most worrisome aspect of this situation is that 
there has been no will to collect these taxes. Corruption is of 
such magnitude that frequently obligations to pay are allowed to 
lapse. 
  The state can and should begin a healthy and sensible tax 
collection policy, using law firms and entrusting them with 
handling this task. Their services would be paid for by a 
negotiable percentage of the tax collections which they make. 

  -  Presenting to Congress as soon as possible changes in 
income tax legislation, including: (a) eliminating or 
substantially reducing authorized legal exemptions, especially 
those which protect the financial sector; (b) slightly 
increasing the taxes due on corporations. The maximum now is 30 
percent. It could be raised to 32.5 percent; (c) reducing the 
impact of direct taxation by enacting income tax legislation 
before providing for some other type of tax to replace the 
burden of indirect taxes on the people. Vivas Teran warned that 
the collection of income taxes in Venezuela amounts at most to 
2.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product. In 1993 it did not amount 
even to that much. In the United States, for example, income tax 
collections amount to 10.8 percent of total government income; 
(d) immediate substitution of the Value Added Tax by a tax on 
the consumption of luxury articles which would exempt from 
payment all products of common use by the people and which could 
start from a given unit value and rise higher. 
  Abdon Vivas Teran, expected to replace Julian Villalba as 
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, considers that the 
policy of privatization should be used more as an instrument 
aimed at correcting structural deficiencies in the distribution 
of income and property, in the provision of services, and in the 
level of government efficiency by helping to relieve the 
excessive burden of the external public debt, rather than as an 
automatic instrument to compensate for the budget deficit. 
  Therefore, he added, these processes should guarantee access 
to property, both by those who work for companies which will be 
subject to these transactions as well as by persons turning out 
production inputs, as in the case of the agricultural sector. 
  He was asked: "At present does the program for participation 
by the workers provide for the sale of between 10 and 20 percent 
of the shares in a company to the workers?" 
  He replied: "I am inclined to review and broaden this 
program, without suggesting that what has been done so far is 
not good. It could be better. Furthermore, privatization tends 
to reduce the portfolio of shares owned by the state. The most 
advisable action is for a substantial part of those assets to be 
earmarked to pay debts owed by the nation over the long term. In 
this way the balance sheet of the Treasury would be protected 
under optimum conditions. 
  Vivas stated: "It is clear that our task cannot be to 
privatize in part and to open another portfolio of unprofitable 
assets in the hands of the nation. On the other hand everything 
which adds significantly to the burdens of the state and which 
could be better handled by the private sector, by mixed private 
and state companies, or by associations, would be perfectly 
viable. In the case of companies owned by the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana, not all of them, in my view, are 
strategic. Initially, these companies could have a different 
form of management through mixed private and state firms." 
  He recalled that the administration of Carlos Andres Perez 
emphasized to the public the view that state-owned companies are 
not viable and that they are a useless and costly burden. 
  Vivas Teran said: "That is a picture which may be true in 
part, but it is not the whole truth. In some cases the condition 
of state-owned companies has been deliberately worsened to make 
the process of privatization easier, taking into account the 
fact that public opinion was going to react angrily against 
companies which were not providing the service expected. That is 
totally correct and, of course, that cannot be the philosophy of 
the new government." 
  Vivas Teran stated that, "We are not going to ruin state 
companies just to sell them for bargain basement prices. We are 
going to move them into the private sector at a good price, 
because they are productive and efficient and not because they 
have been deliberately bankrupted by state administrators."

  [Text] In 1993, 149,994,761,000 bolivares in ordinary 
domestic taxes were collected, according to a report prepared by 
the Incomes Sector of the Directorate General of Taxes of the 
Ministry of Finance concerning activity by that office in 1993. 
  This figure includes collections of income tax and taxes on 
liquor, cigarettes, matches, inheritances, and fees, as well as 
collections on tax stamps. It indicates an increase of 45.17 
percent over tax revenues collected in 1992. 
  Broken down in detail, tax collections were as follows: 

  -  Income Tax: 103,511.0 million bolivares, compared to 
63,486.0 million bolivares collected in 1992, an increase of 
63.04 percent. The 1994 budget has set out an income tax 
collection goal of 136,275.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Alcoholic 
beverages: In this category the difference between 1993 and 1992 
was not so pronounced. In 1992 13,754.0 million bolivares in 
taxes were collected, a figure which was 7.93 percent higher in 
1993, when 14,845.0 million bolivares were collected. The tax 
collection goal for 1994 is 18,250.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Tax 
stamps: in 1993 13,368.0 million bolivares were collected, or 24 
percent more than in 1992 (when 10,771.0 million bolivares were 
collected). With the reform of the law on tax stamps it is hoped 
to collect at least 27 billion bolivares in 1994, due to the 
increase in tax rates. 
  -  Cigarettes: tax collections in 1993 
amounted to 17,104 million bolivares, against almost 14,000 
million bolivares in 1992, which was 22.26 percent more in 
comparative terms. 
  -  Taxes on matches: tax income was 40,147.0 
million bolivares in 1993, or 11.26 percent more than in 1992. 
The report on tax collections states that the goal set by the 
Directorate General of Taxes was not completely attained, due to 
the effects of smuggling matches, which resulted in a decline in 
production. 
  -  Taxes collected on inheritances, donations, and 
other, related taxes brought in 966.0 million bolivares in 1993, 
a decline of 17.8 percent, compared to the 1,176.0 million 
bolivares collected under this category in 1992. According to 
the report, this is the only tax collection area which declined 
due to temporary circumstances. The projection for 1994 shows a 
decline to 650.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Finally, 159.0 million 
bolivares were collected in fees, or 49.6 percent more than the 
106.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992. 
The 1994 budget anticipates collection of 128.0 million 
bolivares in this category of taxes. 
  With the exception of income tax, the other, internal taxes 
showed a growth of only 16.69 percent in 1993, compared to 1992. 
  The report on tax collection activity in 1993 also showed 
that the activities of the Directorate of Tax Control in Caracas 
brought in 55,965.0 million bolivares in income tax. A special 
plan was set up for tax collections at the regional level. 
  Another 35,525.0 million bolivares were collected as a 
result 
of opening tax cases against 850 taxpayers. This figure broke 
down to 14,126.0 million bolivares from taxes, 14,396.0 million 
bolivares from fines, and the remaining 7.0 billion bolivares 
from interest collections. 
  Investigations carried out by the Directorate of Tax 
Collection on financial, industrial, and commercial companies, 
as well as service companies, had the following results. 
Reserves set aside amounted to 10,470.0 bolivares, and taxes 
plus contingencies resulting from reserves set aside amounted to 
8.0 billion bolivares. 
  Investigations carried out in the petroleum sector brought 
the following results: reserves set aside of 21,207.0 million 
bolivares and taxes plus contingencies amounting to 29,239.0 
million bolivares. 
  In the mining sector reserves set aside amounted to 643 
million bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies amounted to 455 
million bolivares. 
  In 1994, the report states, it is anticipated that a 
strategy 
will be followed which will extend until 1996 for increasing tax 
collection, tax pressure, and a range of tax contingencies, thus 
reducing tax evasion, delays in tax payments, and requests for 
resource set aside for litigation.

  [Text] Gustavo Gabaldon, president of the Venezuelan 
Institute of Social Security [IVSS], stated in an end of the 
year message to workers that the new draft law on social 
security to replace the present law and the regulations issued 
under it has been favorably received by the president, who has 
promised to consider it at a cabinet meeting during the next few 
days. 
  The draft bill has also been discussed with senior 
representatives of the president elect, who also received it 
favorably. 
  Gabaldon said in his report that it will not be possible to 
administer the IVSS properly with a financial deficit of almost 
one billion bolivares monthly, due to inadequate income to cover 
the basic expenditures of the institute. 
  The president of the IVSS proposed six urgently needed 
measures to the president: 
  1) Seek passage of a Law on Public Credit, under which the 
national government will cancel its debt to the IVSS of more 
than 8.5 billion bolivares. 
  2) Pass appropriate legislation to restore the technical 
reserves of the IVSS which are more than 300 billion bolivares 
short, due to mistakes made in the past. 
  3) Provide by decree for total coverage of all employees of 
the national government. 
  4) Seek a harmonious agreement between employers and workers 
to raise social security contributions within the next 30 days 
in such a way that this increase will be insignificant for those 
with the least resources. 
  5) Raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 
55 
to 60 for women. 
  6) Make changes in the percentages relating to each social 
security fund to make them adequate under present circumstances 
and separate the various funds, with different administrations 
and accounting systems. 
  Gabaldon said that when he became president of the IVSS, the 
institute was in a state of total collapse in the areas of 
administration, operations, and finance, notwithstanding the 
intense effort made by the Committee on Restructuring, which was 
established under special legislation. 
  He said that the results of this work became known through a 
draft social security bill which has still not been introduced 
in Congress for debate. He pointed out that, notwithstanding the 
advances made in terms of decentralization, through harmonious 
cooperation with several state governments, the financial 
deficit will continue and become intolerable if significant 
action is not taken. 
  The president of the IVSS said that the following actions 
have already been taken recently: 

  -  Improvements in the quality of IVSS 
employees. 
  -  Introduction of strict controls over bidding, 
purchasing, and payments. 
  -  Revision of general 
procedures. 
  -  Introduction of a system of automatic payments 
through the banks. 
  -  A total change in the system and control of 
surveillance of property belonging to the IVSS. 
  -  A substantial 
improvement in the processes of daily collections and 
receipts. 
  -  A substantial reduction in debts owed to suppliers and 
a considerable improvement in the system of 
payments. 
  -  Elimination of the use of blank payrolls. 
  -  Payment of 
pensions to workers. 
  -  A substantial improvement in making 
payments to hospitals and centers of ambulatory health 
care. 
  -  Raising the minimum IVSS pension to 9,000 
bolivares. 
  -  Making up one year of arrearages of unemployment 
payments; these obligations are now being paid on time. 
  -  Study of 
an independent social security management system to improve the 
Pension Fund. 
  -  Elimination of per diem allowances, unnecessary 
travel within and outside the country, and unjustified overtime 
payments, including the elimination of chauffeurs and escorts 
for the president of the IVSS, members of the Board of 
Directors, and directors of the institute. 
  -  Beginning the process 
of appraisal and sale of unnecessary IVSS assets. 
  -  Beginning the 
system of self-administration of hospitals under which they will 
present their own bills and collect contributions from workers 
not insured and from private persons or groups holding insurance 
policies. 
  Gabaldon pointed out that there is still a long way to go, 
but we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel through 
which we have been traveling.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Convergence Deputy Leonardo Montiel reports the Central Bank 
of Venezuela used approximately $1 billion to assist banks 
experiencing difficulties due to "very probable irregular 
management." The Central Bank president will be summoned 
tomorrow before the Finance Commission to explain why funds were 
used to help certain banks instead of depositors. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2049 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  Venzuelan Petroleum subsidiary Lagoven Inc. dispatched a 
total of 119 million barrels during 1993 from its La Salina 
Terminal, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, to export 
markets and local petrochemical- and petroleum-processing 
centers. A total of 237 oil tankers were used, of which 168 
went to the United States, 35 to Germany, 12 to Canada, eight to 
Jamaica, six to Chile, three to Africa, two to Norway, and three 
to the Amuay Refinery in Falcon State. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 17) 
  The National Venezuelan Telephone Company grossed 120 
billion 
bolivares during 1993, twice the amount for 1992. The company 
president said that at the end of the month the company will pay 
the National Treasury 6 billion bolivares for concessions 
granted by the government. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 9 
Feb 94 p 12) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum subsidiary Maraven increased its level 
of production and generated significant savings of 10 billion 
bolivares in 1993, in addition to increasing services for 
customers via its quality management program. (Caracas EL DIARIO 
DE CARACAS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 19) 
  The state group Venezuelan Petroleum, via its president, 
Gustavo Roosen, explains that the fall in petroleum prices on 
the international markets has forced a review of the 1994 budget 
and the implementation of appropriate adjustments. As a result, 
the government will have a much lower tax revenue. 
Conservatives place the national deficit at approximately $3.5 
billion, while pessimists estimate the same at approximately $6 
billion, 50 percent of the budget. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0041

  [Text] Unofficial sources reported today Alfonso Bustamante 
y Bustamante, president of the Council of Ministers, has 
confirmed his decision to resign, which he had made known in his 
resignation letter of 10 February. He has resigned because he 
disagrees with the so-called La Cantuta Law, which has 
transferred the trial to a military court. 
  It has been reported Bustamante confirmed his resignation 
when he learned of the sentences requested today for the people 
responsible for the disappearance of the students and professor. 
  Meanwhile, international agencies reported today 
Bustamante's 
resignation has sparked a new political crisis in the Fujimori 
Government, because the La Cantuta case invalidates all the work 
Bustamante has carried out to improve Peru's image abroad. 
  Bustamante is the fourth president of the Council of 
Ministers of this term. He is also chairman of the Commission 
for the Promotion of Peru's Image Abroad [Comision de Promocion 
de la Imagen de Peru en el Extranjero, Promperu] and industry, 
tourism, and integration minister. 
  Bustamante and Economy Minister Jorge Camet have implemented 
an aggressive economic policy aimed at reestablishing economic 
ties with the developed countries. 
  At the Industry Ministry it has been reported that 
Bustamante 
worked until noon today. 
  The Government Palace has issued no official comment on the 
resignation of the Council of Ministers president.

  [Text] Shining Path [SL] members who fled to Sweden have 
issued a lengthy and confusing leaflet, dated 3 December, under 
the letterhead Popular Movements Peru [Movimientos Populares 
Peru], which reveals their acceptance of a "peace agreement" 
proposed by SL leader Abimael Guzman to President Alberto 
Fujimori's government. The leaflet, entitled "New Great 
Decision: Strive for a Peace Agreement in Peru!", was sent to 
EXPRESO together with -- and this is what is amazing -- a 
"Directive" signed by Guzman. 
  The directive, text of which we publish below, was drafted 
on 
22 October 1993 and nobody knows how it got from Guzman's cell 
in the Callao Naval base to Stockholm. As can be seen in the 
"contents and grounds" of the "Directive", Guzman says that with 
him and the rest of the leadership in prison, the "revolution" 
is not possible and proposes to postpone it until the 21st 
Century. 
<H5>  Directive: Contents and Grounds </H5>
  By thoroughly assessing our situation and prospects, we have 
come to the conclusion that the PCP [Peruvian Communist Party] 
must assume and strive for a New Great Decision and Definition. 
The following are the main grounds for this: 
  1. One phase of the revolution has ended. Here's to the 
next phase of the World Revolution! Each party and organization 
must clearly and deeply determine how it serves and will serve 
the RPM [World Proletarian Revolution]... Our Decision and 
Definition adjusts to our situation. 
  2. The bureaucratic path is gaining shape and becoming 
feasible! 
  3. The GP [Popular War] can only remain as it is, rather 
than develop and pose growing threats. 
<H5>  Six indispensable conditions for victory are at stake: </H5>
  1. Proletarian leadership; 
  2. Support of the masses; 
  3. Strategic centralization; 
  4. New type of army; 
  5. Extended war; and 
  6. Favorable international situation. 
  (The first is the most important of the six conditions.) 
  4. The Leadership problem cannot be solved on a timely 
bases. 
  5. New Great Decision: "Strive for a Peace Agreement!" and a 
Great Definition: Second Congress. The first represents the 
grounds, and the second the guidelines. Aim for the 21st 
century as a decade. 
  6. Miracles will be possible as long as the masses and Party 
exist. 
  This is the Directive. It should be firmly and resolutely 
implemented. 
  22 October 1993 
  Signed: President Gonzalo, leader of the PCP.

<F P=106> [Article by Manuel D'Ornellas] </F>
  [Text] The contents of the "directive" sent by Abimael 
Guzman to Shining Path [SL] members living in Sweden -- which 
was published yesterday as an exclusive by EXPRESO -- are worth 
studying. It is also interesting how that "directive" found its 
way out of Guzman's cell in the Callao Navy base -- where he is 
supposed to be isolated -- and how it got to Stockholm. 
  As for the contents of that directive, several issues must 
be 
studied. First, "President Gonzalo" at no time says he will 
give up his objectives or ideology; he simply expresses in other 
terms what in other letters he described as a "retreat." 
  Second, he establishes a date on which the "peace agreement" 
will end and when hostilities will resume: "The 21st Century as 
a decade," he states. Guzman thus believes that at the 
beginning of the next century his organization will have 
completely recovered its capability to attack and destroy the 
Peruvian State, or that he will by then be freed through an 
amnesty of some administration. 
  Guzman states in his letter to his comrades in Sweden that 
the main problem of the "people's war" which "cannot develop" is 
found at the level of the "proletariat leadership" which "cannot 
be solved on time." This means that as long as he and his close 
aides are imprisoned, everything must be paralyzed. (It must be 
pointed out that he has not even considered replacing his 
leadership with other members.) 
  To summarize: This is not an authentic surrender. It is just 
a tactical capitulation to recover from some wounds and to 
regain forces which, Guzman estimates, will take a minimum of 
six years until the beginning of the first decade of the next 
century. 
  Nothing justifies having allowed Guzman to violate his 
isolation and send the letter to Sweden -- which obviously 
happened with the consent of the authorities, unless otherwise 
proven. 
  We hope that the government is not giving a better treatment 
to the man responsible for the most atrocious years of Peruvian 
history in exchange of epistolary offerings. A Justice Ministry 
report explaining the conditions of the imprisonment of Abimael 
Guzman would not go amiss.

  [Excerpts] Worldwide experience tells us that the road to a 
peace agreement is long and winding. This was the case in 
Colombia between Virgilio Barco's government and the M-19 [19 
April Movement], in El Salvador where the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] caused some 75,000 deaths, and even 
in Europe and the Far East. Therefore, it is too soon to say 
whether or not the efforts being made by the government to reach 
a peace agreement with the Shining Path [SL] will be fruitful. 
To hold talks by no means mean to negotiate. 
  Some weeks ago SL slogans, quite different to the usual 
ones, 
appeared on walls and even on posters. They read: "Let us 
strive for a peace agreement;" "Let us stand and fight for a 
great decision and a great definition;" and, "Let us support 
President Gonzalo [SL leader Abimael Guzman] and the 
leadership." In addition to this, last 25 January a local 
newspaper published a long SL document, which is "secret" 
according to the newspaper's editors, entitled: "The SL is using 
the `peace agreement' to gain time." 
  These facts inevitably awakened more than one specialist on 
Shining Path affairs, "experts" who study the violence 
phenomenon in Peru, with some exceptions obviously, whose 
apocalyptic predictions made before 12 September 1992 [when 
Guzman was arrested] we had forgotten. [passage omitted] 
  Santiago Pedraglio, another expert on the subject, believes 
it is a mistake to identify what is called a "peace agreement 
with the overall pacification of the country." 
  He said: It is fair to request the ideological defeat of the 
SL, but we should not "confuse apples and oranges." There is a 
time and way to defeat the SL ideologically, but this not the 
same as a political, and especially a military, defeat. The 
ideological defeat does not fit in a negotiation, no matter how 
different it may be. The Shining Path's ideological defeat not 
only concerns the government and Fujimorism, but also and 
especially the opposition... It is surprising, therefore, that 
criticism of any negotiation with the SL is coming from some of 
those who for many years fervently upheld the need for a 
political outcome to the armed conflict. It seems that they are 
blinded by their anti-Fujimori feelings. This is extremely 
dangerous because it encourages a military outcome from the 
opposition. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Enrique Obando, a military and subversion </F>
analyst, by Vidal Silva Navarrete -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Silva] Having read the Shining Path's [SL] "secret 
document" that was published by LA REPUBLICA this week, are 
there any changes in countersubversive strategy? 
  [Obando] A change was noted at the time [SL leader] Abimael 
Guzman's first letter was released; this document confirmed the 
change, clarified things, and ended speculation. Now we know 
what Abimael wants. 
  [Silva] What does he want? 
  [Obando] Two things: First, to save the leadership, and 
second, to save his entire party. The document says: "The 
people's war should not be developed, it must merely be 
maintained." As a precondition he establishes the need for a 
proletarian leadership, subordinated -- of course -- to him. 
The document adds: "The leadership problem will not be resolved 
for a long time." The document ends by quoting Mao: "All kind 
of miracles will be performed as long as there are masses and 
parties." 
  [Silva] Who is using whom? Is the government using Guzman or 
is Guzman using the government? 
  [Obando] Both are attempting to use the other. 
  [Silva] With what objectives and what are the risks? 
  [Obando] The SL seems to be trying to save its leadership on 
the understanding that members have a messianic view of their 
leaders. Guzman considers himself the greatest Marxist-Leninist 
alive and the only one who can give the right direction to the 
world revolution. That is why it is essential to save the 
leader. 
  [Silva] Save him from death? 
  [Obando] They know they cannot be sentenced to death but 
they 
are trying to maintain Guzman's contact with the party because 
it is useless to have a leader if there is no contact with the 
party. Guzman has managed to pull the strings of the party again 
and is trying to prevent the government from squashing the party 
completely because he knows this can happen. 
  [Silva] Is Guzman in complete control of the party? 
  [Obando] He controls the people in prison and is trying to 
control the people outside prison. 
  [Silva] Can that split the party? 
  [Obando] Yes. But he controls the party's internal struggle 
like in the old times. He talks about developing the struggle 
between two lines and "trying to keep the exodus to a minimum." 
  [Silva] So the government allowed Guzman to take back 
control 
over his party which he lost for a year by being kept 
incommunicado. 
  [Obando] That is right. Guzman is struggling, and apparently 
winning, the struggle against the group headed by Comrade 
Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, SL chief in central Peru]. I 
understand Feliciano's people are being reported to officials by 
the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] What does the government want? 
  [Obando] To discredit Guzman. The myth already ended, first, 
when he was captured and again when he wrote the letters asking 
for negotiations toward a peace agreement. After calling the 
president a murderer, who starved people, of being a servant of 
imperialism, he now treats him with respect, even with words of 
praise... 
  [Silva] With its references to 5 April [1992, the date on 
which President Fujimori dissolved Congress]? 
  [Obando] Exactly. But the government also wants the SL to 
lay down its arms. Guzman has the key to that because he says 
five or six years will pass before returning to the arm 
struggle. Meanwhile he says the talks must be in diplomatic 
language, no arms must be used, and a struggle must be made to 
allow a new revolutionary wave to emerge. Fujimori is thus 
assured that there will not be any attacks during those five or 
six years. 
  [Silva] Will he then be reelected? 
  [Obando] The big question is if, after that pause, we will 
see new and bigger attacks than those we have seen so far or if 
the government will use this truce to crush the Shining Path 
once and for all. 
  [Silva] Will this be only a truce? 
  [Obando] It could be but, there is also the possibility that 
the government will use Guzman to crush the Feliciano group, and 
once this is achieved then also crush the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] So both Guzman and the government get an advantage 
from the negotiations. The question is, who losses? 
  [Obando] It depends. It is possible that July 1995, which is 
the date given by Fujimori to crush the SL, will not be 
fulfilled but if someone sticks to that date Fujimori may agree 
to nonaggression for some time. Thus, everyone apparently will 
win but the country will lose in the long run. It would be the 
hibernation of the SL prior to a bloodier and more destructive 
return. This would be an act of treason. 
  [Silva] Do you believe this is happening? 
  [Obando] I don't think so, there is no reason for it and the 
Armed Forces would not allow it. The Armed Forces could crush 
the Shining Path. The proof of this is the fact that Guzman is 
negotiating. He would not negotiate if he knew his party's life 
was not at stake despite the blows. 
  [Silva] How can a man who was sentenced to life in prison 
and 
to be held incommunicado, exert pressure and negotiate? 
  [Obando] He cannot exert pressure. The SL received a harsh 
blow but, as the period of agony can last five years or more, 
the government wants a shortcut and are hurrying to fulfill a 
political promise in 1995 for electoral reasons. The SL could 
be crushed slowly but inexorably. There is no need to rush. 
The SL was hit hard because it was rushing, because it took a 
terrorist shortcut to take over the government in 10 or 15 years 
instead of its publicized prolonged people's war of 50 or 60 
years. For taking a shortcut in 1995, one could make the 
mistake of making a pact with the enemy and this is what should 
not be done. The war could last four or five years more and we 
will win it for sure, but because we want to win before the 1995 
elections we will make a pact and subsequently lose. 
  [Silva] You said the Armed Forces would not allow a pact 
with the SL, but why think of an institutionalized Armed Forces 
instead of thinking of an institution where personal 
calculations and the permanence in the commands are at play only 
because of the possibility of a presidential reelection? 
  [Obando] The Armed Forces and the police paid for their 
partial victory with their blood. There are lower rank officers 
who paid with sacrifice and with their lives for the struggle 
against the SL. These officers would not see the negotiations 
with good eyes if they know they can win. 
  [Silva] Under what conditions are negotiations held with the 
enemy? 
  [Obando] Negotiations are held when there is a military draw 
or when they are unable to obtain a achieve an easy victory and 
there is no desire to pay the price. 
  [Silva] But is there not a military draw now? 
  [Obando] Yes, but the cost that would be paid would be much 
less than what has been paid so far in almost 14 years of war. 
It would be like giving away something for no reason. 
  [Silva] The officers who were directly involved in the war 
would see the negotiations badly but unable to revert the 
situation because of the vertical command in the Armed Forces? 
  [Obando] Depending on the agreement reached and whether it 
would allow the SL to fulfill its objective, there may be some 
uneasiness in the Armed Forces, except among those who identify 
themselves with the government. 
  [Silva] Were some officers annoyed when Elena Iparraguirre 
received a cake on her birthday? 
  [Obando] Even some civilians were annoyed, but the fact that 
she received a cake does not seem to me as serious as reaching 
an agreement in the terms established in the document. 
  [Silva] Do you have doubts about the authenticity of the 
document? 
  [Obando] The way it is written seems to me identical to the 
terms the Shining Path leaders have always used, it seems an 
authentic document of the SL leadership in which they admit some 
things that are becoming very difficult to do. 
  [Silva] Considering the strict control on Guzman, the 
Intelligence Service must have known about this document before 
it reached SL militants. 
  [Obando] I have no doubt about that because as far as I know 
the document was sent by a SL woman leader from the Callao 
military base to another prison to convince other members to 
obey Guzman. 
  [Silva] The document describes facts or situations that 
occurred after Guzman was captured. For example it has economic 
information released this month such as the 1993 inflation rate 
or the growth of the gross domestic product. Does Guzman have 
full access to press information? 
  [Obando] Undoubtedly this could have been the first point of 
negotiation, the lifting of the incommunicado status allowing 
the visit of other SL leaders from other prisons, the 
possibility of writing, reading, watching television. Guzman 
knows what is happening outside. 
  [Silva] Is the court sentence to keep Guzman in complete 
incommunicado status being violated by the government and the 
Intelligence Service? 
  [Obando] In theory he is supposed to be incommunicado but I 
would not make a big issue out of this under the understanding 
that it is being done to defeat the Shining Path. 
  [Silva] Is there anything unclear in the negotiations? 
  [Obando] This is a game in which the one who hides his cards 
from the enemy wins. If the government announces its plan and 
everyone knows about it, then it gives victory to the enemy. We 
all know the SL plan and this is an advantage for the government. 
  [Silva] Why is it not possible to have a pact with the SL? 
  [Obando] Because in an agreement there are two parties that 
yield some. Guzman says he promises peace for a period. What 
can the government give in exchange? It cannot allow the SL to 
become a legal political party or surrender in stages by keeping 
armed cells. The only possibility is to discuss the penalties 
for the ones who surrendered or conditions for imprisonment. 
That would be like planting a bomb for the next government and 
that would treason. 
  [Silva] What other characteristics do you see in the 
document? 
  [Obando] First, an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's 
leadership, a recognition that circumstances have changed, and 
that appropriate decisions must be made such as the peace 
agreement, and the second congress. The big question is: how 
can Guzman believe he will win with this strategy when all the 
things he writes and the talks he holds are known by the 
Intelligence Service? Guzman is no fool, he knows that, which 
makes me fear there is some agreement about which we do not know.

<F P=106> [Report from Jejui, San Pedro Department by special </F>
correspondents Esteban Acevedo, Judith Maria Vera, Eduardo 
Franco and Agustin Gaona] 
  [Text] On 15 February, approximately 1,500 peasants blocked 
General Elizardo Aquino Highway No. 3 near the bridge over the 
Jejui River demanding better prices for their cotton. Police 
personnel moved to repress the demonstrators but in the end an 
agreement was reached to negotiate and the blockade was lifted. 
  A group of congressmen arrived at the site and signed an 
agreement that addressed seven items. As a result of this 
agreement the blockade was suspended until 21 February when 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will meet with peasant union 
representatives at Government House. 
  The main items of the agreement are the peasant's request to 
have Agriculture minister Raul Torres and Agrarian Reform 
Institute President Cancio Urbieta removed, and the price of 
cotton increased to 1,500 guaranies per kilogram. The 
congressmen promised to investigate the monopoly of Cadelpa 
[Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] over the distribution of cotton 
seeds and agrochemicals, and to study the possibility of 
controlling the prices of basic staples. 
  As of 0900, some 1,500 peasants from various districts of 
San 
Pedro Department gathered at the southern end of the bridge over 
the Jejui River. The main purpose of the demonstration was to 
ask that the price of cotton, the cash crop which is being 
harvested now, be set at 1,500 per kilogram. 
  At first the demonstrators said that they would not leave 
until they received a concrete answer to their demands. They 
were unable, however, to continue their demonstration because 
PEO [Special Operations Police] troops used force to keep the 
highway open, hurting a few people in the process. 
  At one point San Pedro Governor Erico Ybanez showed up and 
tried to calm things down. Instead he heard loud criticism for 
his lack of action to resolve the problems of the peasants. 
Ybanez had to leave in a hurry harassed by the peasants who 
kept accusing him of helping them only when he needs political 
support. 
  A group of congressmen including Senators Elba Recalde, Pura 
Aguero de Decoud, and Juan Manuel Peralta, and Deputy Jose 
Vazquez Vazquez later arrived. 
  The legislators came to seek a quick agreement that would 
reopen Highway No. 3. It was very obvious from the very 
beginning that the peasants were not well organized, which led 
to unnecessarily long discussions about what should done. 
  Each peasant representative talked about their concerns and 
they all complained about the shortcomings of the 
administration's agricultural policy, the lack of a clear-cut 
cotton policy, and their ongoing woes caused by the low price of 
agricultural crops and the high cost of living. 
  After a discussion that lasted more than four hours, 
legislators and peasants finally reached a temporary agreement 
by which the road block was lifted. The legislators promised 
that President Wasmosy will meet with the cotton farmers.

  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday 
acknowledged the existence of poverty and landless peasants, 
adding that the administration will need more funds all the time 
to finance agriculture and development. He said this to 
Argentine Chaco Province officials who visited him at Government 
House. 
  Speaking about the country's needs, the president stated 
that 
in its quest for the wellbeing of all those who live all 
Paraguay, his administration is committed to doing everything it 
can to help the peasants. The president also mentioned other 
urgent issues such as education and health. He explained that 
his administration will do everything it can to satisfy the 
various strata of the population.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juan Esteban Aguirre, Paraguayan ambassador </F>
to the United States, by reporter Andres Dario Cardozo Hohn; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cardozo] Ambassador Aguirre, 
it would seem that the United States still distrusts us as far 
as drug trafficking is concerned. 
  [Aguirre] The United States has given top priority to the 
drug problem. We need a precise diagnosis of drug trafficking 
in Paraguay. There is a problem and we need to know how bad it 
is to be able to implement the appropriate corrective measures. 
  I believe that at present we do not have the diagnosis of 
the 
situation that we need. 
  As to the request to allow U.S. troops into Paraguay, I do 
not believe it has anything to do with drug trafficking. I do 
not believe the U.S. military is coming to fight drug 
trafficking in Paraguay. As far as I am concerned, the two 
issues are not connected because we handle drug trafficking at 
another level, working with the United States through the 
National Antidrug Secretariat (Senad). 
  [Cardozo] Then what would be the point of these troops 
coming 
to Paraguay? 
  [Aguirre] I believe the United States looks for friendly, 
safe countries to train their troops. 
  If we bear in mind the role the United States plays in the 
world, where they deploy and use their Armed Forces to resolve 
problems, we will realize that there are few places in the world 
where they can send their soldiers without fear that they might 
be attacked. 
  [Cardozo] Would our country benefit from the presence of 
these soldiers? 
  [Aguirre] In addition to what they are promising to build, 
we 
also would benefit from being able to watch the deployment of 
the world's most advanced military technology.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia 
Elizeche said he still has not received official confirmation of 
the cancellation of the "Strong Roads of the South" operation 
that consisted of the entry of 600 servicemen for the 
construction of schools, roads, and water wells in San Pedro 
Department. 
  The U.S. answer was officially delivered on 14 February by 
U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman to Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis 
Maria Ramirez Boettner, with whom he met for some 45 minutes. 
  The U.S. ambassador regretted the fact that U.S. servicemen 
were unable to carry out social work in San Pedro Department 
because the "Strong Roads" operation was "for the benefit of 
Paraguay, however, there is no problem if it does not want the 
operation to be carried out; there will be no retaliations nor 
ill feelings." 
  The defense minister said: "I have not been officially 
informed yet; I have read the press reports. This seems to be a 
decision by the U.S. Government based on Paraguay's proposal. 
Well, it may take place some other time." 
  He added that he did not think the U.S. answer was negative, 
taking into account that it was based on terms imposed by 
Paraguay for the entry and stay in the country of U.S. 
servicemen. 
  Estigarribia commented: "I do not think it is negative for 
Paraguay to establish normal terms for the entry and stay of 
foreigners in the country. In other words, it is not wrong to 
establish those sorts of requirements." 
  The minister said: "It is completely normal because it is in 
the hands of the party that makes the offer to accept or reject 
the terms in a negotiation." 
  In referring to joint U.S.-Paraguayan military operations 
scheduled to take place in 1994, Estigarribia said they are 
normal exercises that are carried out every year. 
  He added: "They are normal operations that take place every 
year within the framework of an agreement and accepting all the 
terms regarding the entry and stay in the country. I do not 
think these operations are going to pose any problems." 
  The minister explained that the United Forces operations are 
carried out with the U.S. Army, while the Unitas operations are 
carried out by the Navy. 
  In the opinion of National Encounter Senator Luis Alberto 
Mauro, the terms established by the Paraguayan Government to 
allow the entry of U.S. troops into national territory are a 
pretext rather than measures to safeguard national sovereignty. 
  Mauro said the fact that the U.S. servicemen will not come 
to 
our country represent a victory for General Lino Cesar Oviedo, 
"who exerted pressure because the U.S. Government accepted the 
participation of the Paraguayan Public Works Ministry rather 
than the Army." 
  The senator added: "I do not think the United States intends 
to tread over our sovereignty nor that anybody within the 
government seriously believes that these terms are designed to 
safeguard sovereignty." He added: "The Paraguayan peoples' 
deception represents a victory for Gen. Lino Oviedo because it 
was he who convinced [President] Juan Carlos Wasmosy about this." 
  Mauro insisted: "It is obvious that these requirements are 
designed to obstruct and jeopardize the entry of servicemen who 
intended to build civilian works. It is only a pretext that has 
nothing to do with the zeal to safeguard national sovereignty. 
I deeply regret the fact that these civilian works will not be 
built because they would greatly benefit the country, and that 
the Unitas maneuvers have been authorized at a historical moment 
when they are really not justified because there is no 
belligerency, no border conflicts at either the international or 
regional level. This is a case of opting for weapons instead of 
peace, because opting for peace would have meant accepting the 
entry of servicemen to build civilian works."

  [Text] The Executive Branch yesterday released a decree 
appointing retired Police Superintendent Publio Fretes as the 
new director of the National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar). 
Fretes was the head of the Investigative Department during the 
previous government and according to the "Terror Archive," he 
was one of Pastor Coronel's [former investigative police chief 
accused of human right violations] trusted men during [Alfredo] 
Stroessner's dictatorship. 
  Presidential Decree 2325 says that Publio Fretes replaces 
Superintendent Justino Ramon Bracho "who will receive another 
assignment." 
  Surprised Dinar officials confirmed in the afternoon that 
the 
decree was released yesterday morning without them knowing that 
their director had been changed.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori today pledged in this city "to 
convince other presidents" of the region to vote for Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general. President 
Fujimori said this during a news conference he held in Santa Fe 
de Bogota shortly before returning to his country following a 
two-day official visit to Colombia. He said: "I will be 
honest; I am personally going to talk to some presidents to make 
this candidacy strong, with possibilities of winning." 
  Fujimori underlined President Gaviria's "leadership in 
international forums" and stressed that Gaviria "has defended 
Ibero-American interests, democracy, and the steadiness of his 
position." The Peruvian ruler added that he will support 
President Gaviria's aspiration to occupy the OAS post, if he 
decides to run, and that he will do so "not only because of our 
friendship, but because I believe he is a good candidate for the 
job." 
  Although journalists were forewarned that only the visiting 
head of state would answer questions, Gaviria attended the same 
news conference. A few hours earlier, however, Gaviria had 
indicated he would make a decision about his eventual candidacy 
for OAS secretary general in the next few days. 
  Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin on 14 
February 
told the media that if the election for OAS secretary general 
were held today, Gaviria would win. Regarding Sanin's comments, 
the Colombian ruler, whose term ends on 7 August, said: "I hope 
she is right." He added: "In any event, we have to wait and 
see." 
  President Gaviria said that he is going to "evaluate all 
opinions and requests from friendly countries before making a 
decision" about running. He said that he is very thankful 
nonetheless for "President Fujimori's advance support" for his 
eventual [as received] candidacy.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria said today he was pleased by the support 
he has received for his possible candidacy for OAS general 
secretary. Gaviria commented he will soon announce whether he 
will run. "I am pleased and thankful for President Alberto 
Fujimori's anticipated support of a possible candidacy for the 
post," Gaviria said during a tour with his Peruvian colleague 
through the crowded Ciudad Bolivar neighborhood, south of this 
capital. 
  Gaviria's still unofficial aspiration to the OAS post has 
gained momentum in recent days as former Bolivian Foreign 
Minister Carlos Irurralde withdrew his candidacy, while 
concomitantly announcing his support for the Colombian president. 
  The executive noted: "I must weigh the opinions and requests 
of friendly nations in order to make a decision in the next few 
days." 
  At the conclusion of a visit to Washington, Colombian 
Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin was "more optimistic than ever," stating 
that if OAS elections were held now Gaviria would win. 
  Colombia's political opposition, which has criticized 
Gaviria's aspirations for this post, called President Alberto 
Fujimori "Gaviria's OAS campaign manager." At the beginning of 
his two-day visit on Monday to Colombia, the Peruvian president 
made public his support for Gaviria's candidacy, arguing that 
the Colombian president's vitality and youth make him the best 
choice for the post. 
  Both presidents toured Santa Fe de Bogota's poverty-stricken 
neighborhoods, according to Fujimori, to "see how the Colombian 
Government faces problems with public services with a view to 
possibly transplanting this experience to Peru." 
  The visitor, who ended his stay in Colombia on Tuesday, 
awarded his host the "Sun of Peru" order in the "Large Cross 
With Diamonds" grade. 
  Diplomatic sources see a complicated scene for Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, Gaviria's main opponent, while 
noting that only Oscar Arias, former president of that same 
Central American nation, could pose a challenge to Gaviria for 
the post. 
  Media reports from Miami, Florida, indicated on Monday that 
Arias would be willing to accept the OAS candidacy if Niehaus 
withdraws and if this would guarantee Central America a place in 
the OAS General Secretariat.

in honor of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the Peruvian 
Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota; date not given; from the "Good 
Morning Peru" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] The consolidation of the processes of political and 
economic reforms offers great possibilities for bolstering 
Colombian-Peruvian relations. That is why we fluently speak the 
common language of development today. A civilized way of life 
and democracy have been threatened similarly in Colombia and 
Peru. Colombians and Peruvians, however, have responded readily 
to the scourge of narcotraffickers and terrorists. 
  Our societies know that we will succeed in establishing a 
genuine peace on which we can build true progress and justice. 
I am convinced that as of now, based on the premise of 
consolidating the processes of modernization of our countries, 
perspectives will open so that the existing bilateral mechanisms 
will become more dynamic and high-level contacts between our 
governments will become more frequent and profitable. 
  I am sure, President Gaviria, that Latin America's hour is 
at 
hand. The bases that we are laying today are the cornerstones 
of the building to be shaped by the hands of the new generations 
with a view to the future. Our independence will be sealed with 
our national development. For this new stage of 
Colombian-Peruvian relations and for the realization and 
progress of our peoples, we mutually wish ourselves much 
success. Thank you very much. [applause]

hosted by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori at the Peruvian 
Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota; date not given; from the "Good 
Morning Peru" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Mr. President, under this new reality that we are 
experiencing of trade opening, political reforms, modernization 
of the state, and hemispheric integration, your presence 
currently takes on a significant meaning. The similarities in 
the problems that plague the Peruvian and the Colombian peoples 
pave the way for understanding and comprehension between us. I 
am referring to drug trafficking, terrorism, the extreme 
guerrilla violence, and, of course, poverty, indigence, and lack 
of opportunity that so harshly continue to hit some areas of our 
two nations. 
  We Colombians are pleased with the great progress Peru has 
achieved in recent times. The Peruvian economy that had reached 
astronomical inflation rates barely a few years ago, now has an 
inflation rate slightly higher than ours. Also, economic 
growth, which for more than two decades had been stalled, in 
1993 achieved a 6-percent growth rate. 
  Likewise, drug trafficking, violence, and terrorism have 
strongly oppressed our peoples over the last decade. We are, 
however, winning this struggle. One only has to mention Abimael 
Guzman and Pablo Escobar's names to remind the most skeptical 
that no criminal, no matter how powerful he may appear, can 
indefinitely defy the will of a people who are not willing to 
live in fear. These people have found justice in their 
authorities through the required solutions. If the first one 
[words indistinct] is serving his sentence, the second was 
recently gunned down by our authorities. 
  This is why President Fujimori, I am certain that the 
positive results achieved by your government in the economic as 
well as political and social fields will allow Peru once again 
to be reintegrated into the international financial community, 
to advance with firms steps toward the encounter with progress. 
  From Peru arose the process that led to our independence, as 
well as Bolivar's integration [words indistinct]. We are united 
by the Amazon, the Andes, and the significant opportunities we 
have before us on the Pacific side. We are also united by that 
desire to [words indistinct] countries of a continent with a 
millennium of traditions; based on these we project ourselves 
toward the future. Few nations have [words indistinct] goals and 
expectations. 
  This is a happy occasion for all Colombians. My people and 
my government are honored by your presence, my president friend. 
There is a great deal that unites us. We have a common past, a 
common border, a [words indistinct], a cultural history, and a 
common future that men of your stature help to form. We must be 
conscious to share more in the future. We want our two nations 
to strengthen their ties of friendship. We want our mutual 
[words indistinct] to strengthen democracy and to give way to a 
better future for our children. 
  I know you well enough, President Fujimori, to say that you 
are a man of vision and of character, two of the vital [word 
indistinct] of true leaders. Allow me tonight to offer a toast 
to your country and to your personal well-being, with the hope 
that both nations will achieve peace, equality, and social 
justice which our peoples demand. [applause]

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Alberto Fujimori's official visit to 
Colombia has concluded. The last day of his visit was very 
important, as the Neighbors Agreement that was signed will 
increase and strengthen Colombia-Peruvian relations. Both 
presidents spoke out in favor of the defense of participative 
democracy in the hemisphere. The presidents visited the [word 
indistinct] neighborhood, one of the most poverty stricken in 
this capital. [passage omitted] 
  Subsequently, President Alberto Fujimori visited Congress 
where he met with Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias, who 
invited him to sign the book of illustrious guests. [passage 
indistinct] 
  In the afternoon, the closing ceremony was held at the 
ministers' council room with the participation of state 
ministers, congressmen, and businessmen. On this occasion 
President Cesar Gaviria and President Alberto Fujimori signed 
the document organizing the Neighbors' Commission and 
Peruvian-Colombian integration. 
  Immediately after, the joint declaration signed by the 
presidents was read. The document contains 15 points of which 
the main ones are: Make official the conversations between the 
military commands to strengthen both nations' security; 
stimulate direct investment and the flow of capital; and step up 
agreements to wipe out drug production, trafficking, and abuse. 
  In the drug struggle, Peru and Colombia will develop 
specific 
initiatives with consumer nations. The presidents reiterated 
their rejection of terrorism and agreed prompt implementation of 
bilateral measures to wipe out this scourge. 
  To conclude, during a news conference, President Fujimori 
added that there will be greater exchange of information with 
Colombia in the struggle against drugs, the goal of which is to 
attack top drug traffickers. With regard to trade, he noted 
there is interest on the part of Colombian businessmen to invest 
in the Peruvian fishing sector. Here is what President Fujimori 
said: 
  [Begin Fujimori recording] Obviously, in the drug 
trafficking 
activity there are relations between groups who operate in Peru 
and Colombia. The arrest of the El Vaticano [Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera] is the best evidence of the results of this 
cooperation. We must continue on this road. Of course, there 
must be greater exchange of information; there must be extensive 
reciprocal cooperation in the investigations, in the sharing of 
experiences in the struggle against terrorism and drug 
trafficking that each country has gained in these past years. 
In my opinion, in this manner we could speed up somewhat the 
results against these social scourges. On this matter, I 
believe there is a great deal one can learn from past 
experiences; a great deal. Peru, for example has had specific 
experiences in its struggle against terrorism; its efficiency 
has been highly considered worldwide. This is an experience that 
we will gladly exchange with Colombia's experience where other 
mechanisms have also been used. [end recording]

  [Text] A few months ago, a debate was sparked between 
economic commentators and monetary authorities regarding the 
possibility that the country might have to endure a significant 
budget deficit next year because public spending was growing out 
of control. Backed into a corner by this questioning, Finance 
Minister Rudolf Hommes pulled a card out of his sleeve and said 
to some who were expressing concern about the growth of 
spending: "Those accounts do not include what cellular telephone 
companies will pay in licensing fees, which will amount to about 
$500 million." 
  Hommes was right in saying that this money would go a long 
way toward solving the deficit problem, but his calculations 
were a little off. As it became clear this weekend, when the 
bids of the various cellular phone companies were opened, the 
minister's figures will be doubled: Private companies will pay 
nearly $600 million, and their mixed-band competitors, who will 
be chosen in the next few weeks, must pay 95 percent of that 
amount, for a grand total of around $1.2 billion. 
  If we add to that the more than $400 million (347 billion 
pesos) that the nation will receive from the sale of the Bank of 
Colombia, after deducting the funds earmarked for replacing 
capital and guarantees that were uncovered, the result is that, 
thanks to these two items, the nation's coffers will be richer 
by more than $1.6 billion. This is equivalent to about 3 percent 
of the Gross Domestic Product, and is more than double the 
amount that the latest tax reform will bring in over a period of 
one year. 
  The cellular phone situation is perhaps the most interesting 
development, because in the final analysis the sale of the Bank 
of Colombia means that the state is recouping the investment it 
made 10 years ago when it intervened and nationalized that 
entity. But despite the difficulties that arose at the last 
minute in both cases, it appears that the auction mechanism is 
here to stay in this country. It is not such a novelty in the 
sale of a bank; the gavel has been used in the past to sell off 
financial institutions. But with respect to bidding to operate 
public services, this development represents a major change, 
with two great virtues: its transparency, since subjective 
criteria give way to a very objective evaluation criterion 
(whoever offers the most money wins); and the way it optimizes 
state resources. If the government had set the value of the 
licenses according to its calculations, it would not have 
received even half what it actually obtained, given that the 
competition among several bidders to offer the best price 
necessarily drives up that price. The redistribution factor is 
another positive element of the auction; for example, much of 
the revenues from the sale of the Bank of Colombia will be used 
to pay overdue pensions. 
  To be sure, the auction can also be criticized because 
driving up prices will, in the long run, raise rates as the 
companies try to recoup what they invested in license fees. But 
since there will be competition between at least two companies, 
rates cannot climb too high. On the contrary, they may just 
lower the rates to attract more customers. 
  A more valid criticism may be that if all bidding is done 
through auctions from now on, only those with the most money 
will be able to participate: the same old handful of companies, 
which could lead to a greater concentration of wealth in 
Colombia. For many years now, analysts have seen that as one of 
the country's most serious problems. One way to mitigate these 
effects may be to pass antitrust laws, setting limits to the 
concentration of ownership. The incoming government will surely 
have to debate this issue. 
  In the meantime, the finance minister can rest assured: with 
full coffers, the specter of a runaway budget deficit seems to 
have been chased away.

  [Text] Andres Pastrana performed magic. In less than one 
week he succeeded in reeling in Alvaro Gomez and doing away with 
a long- standing split within the Conservative Party. 
Everybody, except for the Alvarists candidates, is happy with 
this. On one side, the Pastrana supporters are happy. With the 
Conservative Party majority assured, Pastrana can devote his 
attention to seeking the votes he needs and consolidate his 
image as a national candidate. 
  The supporters of Liberal Party presidential candidate 
Ernesto Samper are also claim to be happy because they say the 
Gomez endorsement of the New Democratic Force shows Pastrana's 
faithfulness to the old Conservative Party, something that 
weakens his stance as an independent candidate. Pastrana 
supporters respond by saying that what has been confirmed is 
Pastrana's independence regarding his father, Misael. 
  For Andres Pastrana, the challenge is to gather Conservative 
votes and endorsements before and during the party's convention 
on 18 February and continue of appear as the young, independent, 
and suprapartisan candidate.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today the People's Militias and the Valle de Aburra 
independent militias signed a preliminary agreement to disband. 
These are the principal groups of this kind that exist in 
Medellin, Antioquia Department, and control the city's 
northeastern area. They emerged years ago as instruments of 
self-defense against neighborhood violence and extortion by drug 
traffickers' henchmen. 
  The preliminary agreement took effect early today in 
Granizal 
neighborhood, where militias gathered surrounded by a crowd. 
They were transferred under police escort to a detente camp in 
Santa Elena district, 30 minutes from Medellin's downtown. 
  The negotiations began with the reading of the preliminary 
agreement and acknowledgment of this event by Government and 
Interior Minister Fabio Villegas. He described it as courageous 
and as an investment in the future. 
  [Begin recording] [Villegas] This is an example of how they 
can achieve their political goals, how it is possible to strive 
for their ideals amid tolerance, pluralism, and respect for the 
rights and lives of our people. 
  [People's Militias' spokesman Dennis Santamaria] It is 
absurd 
to continue with the armed struggle. We have to think of 
helping the country progress from another perspective, from the 
political and social perspective. [end recording] 
  The preliminary agreement recognizes these militia members 
as 
a political force. They will have six negotiators who must 
remain in the camp and five spokesmen who will mediate with the 
government on conditions for social investment for their 
communities and security in the neighborhoods, the most critical 
issue, since they fear an invasion by the militias of the Simon 
Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board once they disband 
and become legal.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Aida Abella, a 
leader of the leftist Patriotic Union (UP) party, has left the 
country because she has received death threats, the UP 
directorate reported on 15 February in addition to disclosing a 
plan to "liquidate" its participation in the upcoming March 
legislative elections. According to a joint communique issued 
by the UP and the Colombian Communist Party, Abella, a Bogota 
municipal official and Senate candidate, has "received serious 
threats against her life and had to travel abroad urgently." 
  The communique added the leftist leader will use her trip to 
report to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva "the 
systematic violation of human rights in Colombia under President 
Cesar Gaviria's government." The communique added Abella "will 
go to Amnesty International and other human rights organizations 
to reveal the fraudulent conditions in which the government 
prepares the 13 March elections." 
  Furthermore, the UP complained the Prosecutor General's 
Office had arrested Jose Antonio Lopez, the UP candidate to the 
Chamber of Representatives for the northeastern Department of 
Antioquia, and Nelson Campos, the mayor of the banana-producing 
community of Apartado and a UP member as well. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office had ordered their arrest in 
relation to its investigation of the massacre of 35 people in an 
impoverished Apartado neighborhood on 23 January.

  [Text] Quito--The Andean Development Corporation (CAF) 
approved credit operations during 1993 for a total of $232 
million to carry out various development projects in Ecuador. 
  The executive president of CAF, Enrique Garcia Rodriguez, 
said that $55.6 million went to loans for investment projects 
and share purchasing, $174.9 million for short- and medium-term 
financing, and $1.5 million was allocated for technical 
assistance. He pointed out that the institution's credit support 
was concentrated primarily in two sectors: hydrocarbons and 
transport, specifically, the development of petroleum fields and 
the maintenance of the country's highway system. 
  Garcia Rodriguez said that this would result in an increase 
of foreign exchange earnings generated by the petroleum sector 
and, in addition, would facilitate the transportation of private 
sector products, internally as well as toward ports, increasing 
the competitiveness of domestic industry by reducing 
transportation costs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Agriculture Minister Mariano Gonzalez by </F>
Roberto Peralta Cardenas; place and date not given] 
  [Text] If Ecuador agrees to the proposal of Colombia and 
Costa Rica to negotiate a fixed quota with the European Union 
(EU), we would be giving in to unfair demands. Referring to the 
banana issue, Agriculture Minister Mariano Gonzalez declared 
that is why we have taken our position on foreign trade and have 
said "no more obstacles to foreign trade." 
  The minister is firm in his position that "there must be a 
global quota and that market forces must be allowed to operate, 
so that those who can offer the best quality fruit at the best 
price are able to win a given share." 
  He admitted that centralism exists in the Ecuadoran 
Institute 
of Water Resources (INERHI) and said that "the current 
government has known of these irregularities from the 
beginning," and the National Council of Water Resources will be 
created as a result. 
  Gonzalez spoke with EL UNIVERSO during his recent visit to 
the Galapagos Islands to fulfill obligations of the chief 
executive. The interview follows: 
  [Peralta] After a lengthy process of negotiation, what is 
the 
situation with the country's banana trade? 
  [Gonzalez] If you start with the great discussions in 1992 
about what could happen, and the famous fights, including the 
meeting of presidents "all fighting for free trade," the 
negotiations were not really successful, because regulation 404 
was imposed at almost any cost by the European Community. 
  But everything has its good side and its bad side. On the 
good side is the fact that now we can enter markets that we 
could not legally reach before, such as France, England, 
Portugal, among other countries. The negative is that the global 
quota was reduced, and since then, there has been an effort led 
by Colombia to try to make the rule more viable. What was 
accomplished was not enough. Even more serious is that the 
Colombian Government did not consult with the other banana 
exporting countries, which caused resentment among most of us. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture has been much criticized as 
having no policy, but I must say that "it was not by luck that 
our country for the third consecutive year was the principal 
banana exporter to the EC, and we continue to lead in the world 
market as the first exporting country. This has been achieved by 
a policy of lowering prices at the opportune moment and by being 
attentive to changes in the market." 
  [Peralta] At the moment, one sees a divided region, Latin 
American unity no longer exists. How much does this affect us? 
  [Gonzalez] On learning of a division of the quota with the 
agreement of Colombia and Costa Rica, we learned that Ecuador 
would have no opportunity to win new markets until the year 2000 
or 2002, and the quota they gave us was all we could sell. 
  This is why we have maintained the position, supported by 
Panama and Guatemala, that there must be a global quota and that 
market forces be allowed to operate, so that those who can offer 
the best quality fruit at the best price are able to win a given 
share. I believe that this is the idea that has prevailed 
recently. 
  I am sorry not to have attended the meeting called by Costa 
Rica, but I was also concerned because there had been certain 
rumors inside the GATT to the effect that the European Union's 
proposal would be discussed again at the Costa Rica meeting. 
When we learned of this, it seemed to us that it would be 
inopportune to attend the meeting because it would send a signal 
to the GATT that we were prepared to discuss a proposal that had 
already been discussed and to which "we had already said no." 
  We talked to Costa Rica and we said that we were willing to 
meet as often as necessary, but only when the results of the 
second panel's hearings are known. It is important to emphasize 
that there were to be two panels before the GATT, and that the 
GATT would later say that these regulations were not legal. 
  Based on these two legal-type resolutions and within the 
Uruguay Round, we will take the necessary steps to change 
regulation 404 and make it more compatible with free trade. 
  [Peralta] What would be Ecuador's position? 
  [Gonzalez] What Ecuador asks specifically is that a time 
limit of five or 10 years be placed on regulation 404, perhaps 
the life of the treaty of Lome. This is the treaty that ties the 
EC countries to a commitment with those ex-colonies even though 
they are aware that what they produce is not of good quality and 
is more expensive than what Latin America produces. 
  We also ask that they place a time limit on the existing 
taxes, a reduction to apply gradually to what was really agreed 
on in the Uruguay Round. It would be a reduction equal to that 
planned for the developed countries in the commitment to move to 
lower tariffs. 
  We also intend to try to increase the global quota because 
the latest figures on banana sales to the European Union talk of 
2.5 million tons and the fixed quota is 2.2 million tons. 
  [Peralta] European integration brings with it the danger of 
reducing the market. How are you going to deal with this 
situation? 
  [Gonzalez] In fact, another reason we are saying that the 
quota should be increased over time is that there are countries 
we are selling bananas to that are not members of the EC but 
that are asking to enter it. The moment they enter the EC, and 
if there is a fixed quota, they would be diminishing the market. 
If the countries where we are now selling fruit come under the 
EC quota, we will be prevented from selling our bananas freely, 
as we have been doing until now. 
  With regard to this situation, we maintain that whenever a 
new country enters the EC, the quota should be increased so that 
we can continue selling to those markets as we have been able to 
do under free trade. 
  It should not be forgotten that Ecuador has a disadvantage 
since in order to reach the European market, to which we send 30 
percent of our exports, we have to consider the passage through 
the Panama Canal and the added distance. In order to compete 
with Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras, we have to have a 
product cheap enough to absorb the additional cost of the canal 
and the distance. 
  When Colombia and Costa Rica asked us to agree to the EU 
proposal, we told them that if we agreed to a fixed quota we 
would be agreeing to a position that is unfair. These are the 
basic outlines of our foreign trade policy, and we have said "no 
more obstacles to trade." 
  We did not attend the meeting in Costa Rica. We spoke with 
that country and told them that we are sympathetic to the idea 
of trying to reform regulation 404, but what has been proposed 
is not suitable. We are waiting to learn the result of the 
hearings, and we are pretty sure that they will say that the 
regulation is improper. Then we will initiate a commercial-type 
procedure prior to the 15 March signing of the Uruguay Round in 
order to say to the EC "now let us sit down and talk, based on 
these precepts." 
  They have said that if we do not accept their proposal, 
there 
will be no further negotiations, but we do not agree, and if 
they do not want to discuss it, we prefer to stay with 
regulation 404 as it is, rather than try for a new regulation. 
  [Peralta] Given the existence of quotas, what is the outlook 
for producers and exporters? 
  [Gonzalez] The ministry has had a very clear policy 
maintaining that it is in our interest to export a great volume 
of bananas and to set minimum export conditions, so that the 
country exports as many bananas as possible. When prices rise 
too high and market conditions become difficult, the first to 
suffer is the small farmer, because the large producer has his 
basic contracts with the big exporting companies, and he is the 
last to suffer. 
  Consequently, if there is a greater demand for fruit at a 
given moment, as is happening now, the minimum price for exports 
increases. 
  At this point we should be exporting more than in 1993. The 
first three weeks of 1994 have been excellent; between 2.7 and 
2.8 million boxes have been shipped, which is very good for this 
time of year, and if this trend continues the year will be 
favorable. 
  Furthermore, the National Banana Program no longer takes a 
deduction from the producers. The only one who pays any kind of 
contribution, and it is very small, is the exporter, but with 
the increase in price in effect since 15 January, the producer 
will have more profits and will be able to take care of some of 
the debts and other problems that he might have incurred during 
the second part of the year. 
  It could even happen that prices rise above the official 
levels decreed by the government, during the coming months. I 
know that the first purchases by Chiquita were made this year, 
which means that another multinational has come to our country 
to buy. To the extent that we maintain a healthy 
competitiveness, we could see better days, in commercial terms, 
improved incomes, and more profits for the banana sector. 
  [Peralta] Will the country's membership in the GATT 
influence 
its position on bananas? 
  [Gonzalez] To enter the GATT, the country has to fulfill 
certain commitments. This week, a delegation from our country 
will begin new negotiations, there will be others in February 
and "we expect that by March or April, if there is no problem, 
we will be able to join the GATT, and we hope that it will be 
before the signing of the Uruguay Round." 
  [Peralta] The national position on agriculture has been 
criticized in the Andean Pact. Are there problems for the 
country? 
  [Gonzalez] We have to wait for the consolidation and the 
formation of the new Venezuelan Government, which is the source 
of most of the criticism. We hope to go ahead with the 
negotiations, as we have done so far. In reality, a consensus on 
agricultural policies exists among all the ministers of 
agriculture. Under the Cartagena agreement, agricultural matters 
are often negotiated that are outside my jurisdiction. 
  We have had a very clear policy on agricultural markets, 
regardless of what others may say who maintain that we should 
open up to the world market. We are protecting those products 
that are receiving subsidies elsewhere in the world. This is why 
we speak of price margins, it is the protection we give our 
farmers. 
  I have been criticized because I do not subsidize producers, 
and the reason is very simple. We have no money. And since we 
cannot subsidize our producers, we have to provide a margin of 
protection against unfair competition. 
  I must simply tell those who doubt the results that in 1993, 
we exported more than 60,000 tons to Colombia, we exported an 
important amount of rice, some soya, but it is a process that 
our producers must continue to learn. To the extent that we have 
responsible leadership in the associations, "especially on the 
coast," we can open up new markets and give incentives to the 
farmers to produce. 
  The problem in our country is not producing but marketing, 
and that depends basically on our farmers, on their business 
skills and on the farmers' associations. Unfortunately, we have 
no leadership on the coast, and that is a large part of the 
problem we are having in being able to market our products in 
the region and around the world. 
  [Peralta] Now that the Modernization Law has been passed, 
what steps is your ministry taking? 
  [Gonzalez] So far, as a result of decisions we have taken, 
there is new restructuring of the ministry that is being carried 
out by SENDA [National Secretariat of Administrative 
Development]. We made certain changes because there were some 
difficulties in the original presentation. We achieved a very 
important reduction in personnel on the order of 25 percent and 
we expect, with the Modernization Law, to make the final 
adjustments, without sacrificing the ministry's technical 
capability, as such. 
  The ministry should have a normative rather than an 
executive 
role. In other words, if we have to work in the area of 
agricultural extension services, we are not going to do it with 
ministry personnel but contract the work out, and if the 
objectives are not being achieved, we will have the option of 
canceling the contract, which we do not have now. 
  [Peralta] ENAC [National Enterprise for Warehousing and 
Marketing] and ENPROVIT [National Enterprise for Vital Products] 
are the first to pass into the private sector. What comes next? 
  [Gonzalez] We took the first step with ENAC and ENPROVIT. 
There were a great many stores in ENPROVIT that are no longer 
part of that institution, and when we evaluated the sales, we 
saw that we sold three times more with 60 of those stores than 
we sold in 200 of the stores that we still have. That does not 
include the stores owned by ex-employees that are really doing 
well, since they do not sell only 12 products, but whatever they 
want. 
  With ENAC, we have leased its silos and we expect to turn 
over to farmers other silos that we still have. 
  In addition, we also have some driers that we want to give 
directly to the growers' associations so that those who do not 
want to turn over their rice to the warehouses can negotiate 
their own terms. 
  The next step under the Modernization Law is that those 
persons who were not covered by the ministry's authority to 
negotiate their separation directly under their labor contracts 
can now do so. The Modernization Law will allow us to make a 
further reduction, but the process of modernization in the 
various offices and departments of the ministry has already 
begun and will continue, using the instruments that have been 
given to us. 
  The most important asset we have is the Gran Colombiana 
Merchant Fleet, in which we own 20 percent of the shares. The 
board of directors of the fleet has already given its approval 
for a representative to make an appraisal and arrange for the 
sale of those shares. The Coffee Bank of Colombia has offered 
another 25 percent of the shares for sale, which with Ecuador's 
20 percent would make a package of 45 percent of the shares. We 
expect that this process will last two or three months more, and 
we will sell our interest in this important firm in order to 
capitalize the Development Bank. Unfortunately, these procedures 
take longer than one would like, but "we are on the road." 
  [Peralta] According to the law, there is a time limit for 
the 
sale of vehicles and the auctioning off of real property. What 
has been done? 
  [Gonzalez] The ministry has about 3,000 vehicles, of which 
1,400 are operational. We have about 700 in poor condition that 
give us problems. The order has been given to sell those 
vehicles belonging to the various departments of the ministry. A 
general order was also given regarding the sale of clubs and 
offices, as well as nonproductive lands belonging to the 
departments. We have ordered that they also be sold. 
  [Peralta] To judge from the subjects under consideration, it 
would seem that the aim is to create the Ministry of 
Agroindustry and to eliminate the Ministry of Agriculture? 
  [Gonzalez] That is definitely not the case. The Ministry of 
Industry has its own responsibilities. What has happened is that 
there have been a number of changes, three ministers in 17 
months. I spoke with then-Minister Garcia and he told me "you 
continue to handle this situation, since you have been following 
it from the beginning, but in fact it is something that is the 
responsibility of the Ministry of Industry." 
  We discussed this with Minister Maldonado, and, little by 
little, as he becomes familiar with all the details of what has 
happened in the negotiations, he will assume responsibility. The 
internal policies are really the responsibility of the Ministry 
of Industry, but there have been no talks in the sense of 
reducing his area of responsibility.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
reiterated that entering embassies is not an acceptable way of 
leaving the country and that those who do so are on the mistaken 
path. 
  In allusion to a group of persons who on 26 January entered 
the Belgian Embassy in Havana, he told PRENSA LATINA that [the 
authorities] will not allow this method to be adopted by those 
intent on leaving Cuba. 
  The Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry spokesman explained 
that 
entering a diplomatic mission cannot be a privilege or safe 
conduct for emigration. In that regard, he said that Cuba has 
not changed its policy and remembered that there are emigration 
laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long as he has 
received a visa and paid for the transportation. 
  The spokesman said that the four men, two women, and one 
minor who are in the Belgian Embassy in this capital must leave 
the diplomatic mission voluntarily and return to their residence 
and undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if 
they have a visa.

  [Text] Cuban Ambassador to Colombia Jesus Martinez has 
concluded a visit to Medellin during which he studied, with 
Medellin authorities and businessmen, the possibilities for 
cooperation in several different spheres. Accompanied by Antonio 
Gonzalez, one of the discoverers of the vaccine against 
Hepatitis-B, as well as by several tourist sector (?and) medical 
industry officials, Martinez discussed, with the Medellin City 
Council and the municipal firm, Metro-Salud, exchanges in that 
area. He held talks with businessmen from several sectors on the 
prospects of direct investment in other businesses that Cuba 
offers; and at the liquor firm that belongs to Antioquia 
Department, the possibility of bottling Cuban rum and 
distributing it from there was analyzed. The diplomat gave a 
talk at the University of Antioquia on Cuba's current situation 
and its future. 
  The Cuban delegation headed by Ambassador Martinez also 
looked into the possibilities for exchanges in the spheres of 
education and culture, as well as of joint publishing, with the 
Autonomous Latin American University, and visited the daily 
papers EL COLOMBIANO and EL MUNDO. 
  The visitors also met with Mayor Jose Luis Ramos, on which 
occasion it was proposed that Medellin become Cienfuegos' twin 
city. The Cuban delegation was also received by Antioquia 
Governor Juan Gomez, who, like Mayor Ramos, was accompanied by 
the secretaries in charge of the various sectors in that region 
of northwestern Colombia. At that meeting, the possibilities for 
expanding cooperation in the field of sports, in which three 
Cuban trainers have been working for some time, were examined, 
as well as in the fields of health, education, and the 
scientific/technical sphere.

He said I knew.... [end recording] 
  Looking aged and with a humble voice softened by his days in

violence broke out in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Castellanos recording] I do agree that social 
injustice really exists. Obviously they are greatly removed 
from civilization and there was this outburst. The outburst 
could have taken another form since the government has been

resolved soon and that we think of ourselves as brothers, 
Chiapas residents, all of whom bear responsibility for this 
situation. [end recording]

yesterday submitted his resignation to President Calderon given 
the imminent conclusion of this administration and to allow "his 
successor to choose a person that is politically and personally 
close to him as my replacement." 
  Although the letter states the resignation is effective 8 
May, Ambassador Facio told LA REPUBLICA he will leave his 
Washington post "late in April or early in May." Facio is 
currently in the country. He participated in the elections here 
and will return to the U.S. capital on Sunday. 
  Facio explained he met with President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres on Thursday to review Costa Rica's relations with Bill 
Clinton's administration, and to review challenges the next 
government will have to face in this regard. The meeting was 
requested by Figueres, to whom Ambassador Facio explained that 
discussions on the laws concerning the Uruguay Round are still 
pending and are "extremely important." Furthermore, the next 
government must follow up the proposal to extend the free trade 
agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada to 
include the Caribbean zone. The dispute with the U.S. Embassy 
over expropriations of U.S. citizens' properties will be another 
inheritance for Figueres, Facio emphasized.

  [Text] Yesterday Education Minister Cecilia Gallardo de 
Cano announced that the government intends to create peace 
policies through cultural and education projects financed by the 
United Nations. Their content and implementation will be 
decided on by the nation's economic, political, and social 
sectors. 
  Since the end of armed conflict, society has demanded that 
violence be put behind us and that an irreversible procession 
toward peace and national reconstruction be enjoined, she noted. 
  The official explained that the Education Ministry, in 
conjunction with UNESCO, will consult with government and 
nonofficial institutions to assess Salvadoran reality. 
  That document would justify the financing offered by UNESCO 
-- that totals approximately $32.7 million -- to implement 
specific projects in education, cultural, and communications 
sectors, the education minister commented. 
  The economic cooperation is conceived within the Peace 
Culture Program in El Salvador fostered by the international 
organization to erase the experiences lived during the 12-year 
war and to define a strategy for peace. 
  Gallardo Cano said: "The idea is to permanently sustain the 
peace process and to reinforce the reintegration of former 
fighters into productive life, with the help of these same 
participants." 
  The education minister explained that the ministry will 
design projects to strengthen democracy and to teach respect for 
diverse ideological tendencies and human rights. 
  The official disclosed the details of the Peace Culture 
Program to productive sectors, nongovernment institutions, 
cooperatives, and intellectual and artistic associations during 
a meeting at the Planning Ministry's auditorium. 
  The program will be initiated with the First International 
Forum on the Culture of Peace to be held from 16 to 18 February 
in a capital city hotel.

  [Text] Managua, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- German Vice Chancellor 
Helmut Schafer said here today, Monday, the quotas for the 
importation of Latin American bananas imposed by the European 
Union (EU) "is a measure that is detrimental" to the producer 
countries of America. 
  "The German Government's position is widely known, as we 
oppose that EU decision," said Schafer, making statements to the 
press after meeting with Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro. 
  The German vice chancellor, who arrived in Managua the night 
of 13 February for a three-day visit to this country, mentioned 
that Germany filed a recourse last year at the former European 
Community Court of Justice requesting that the application of 
the trade quota for bananas be suspended. 
  The new EU import regulations, effective since July 1993, 
set 
the Latin America importation quota at 2 million tons (108 
million boxes), 500,000 less than the previous year. 
  "The German Government opposes this kind of EU decision and 
has filed a recourse at the Court of Justice to revoke it and 
rebroaden the markets for bananas, which is something we want," 
Vice Chancellor Schafer said. He did not comment on the recent 
GATT ruling condemning the importation quota, however. 
  The Union of Banana-Exporting Countries (UPEB), which 
consists of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala, 
Colombia, and Honduras, termed the GATT resolution as important, 
because it allows the strengthening of its position to seek a 
compatible commercial agreement between the EU and Latin America.

  [Text] Olanchito, Yoro -- It was officially announced 
yesterday that seven persons, who were victims of explosions 
caused by grenades left behind by the U.S. Army in this village, 
filed a suit against the U.S. Army with the local Criminal Trial 
Court. 
  The U.S. Army has been participating in joint activities 
with 
Honduran Armed Forces on Honduran territory for a long time. 
These activities include specifically military civic action and 
the construction of roads and landing strips. 
  Raul Enrique Funez Santos was killed by a grenade explosion 
because he took a grenade home after finding it on the road. 
According to Funez Santos' relatives, the victim took the fuse 
from the grenade, which, in addition to killing him, injured 
those who were around him at the time of the explosion. 
  In the suit filed with the courts, the U.S. and the Honduran 
Armies are accused of homicide and injuries caused by explosive 
devices that were left behind in the area where they had 
conducted military operations in May 1993 in the village of 
Puntillas, in Olanchito, Yoro. 
  The plaintiffs are Maria Josefa Antunez, Lucrecia Rosales on 
behalf of the minor Maribel Melendez, Edin Martinez, and Mario 
Denis Rosales, all residents of Puntillas. Another group of 
plaintiffs includes Santos Diaz on behalf of his youngest son 
Rigoberto Villafranca Diaz, Enit Yovani Garcia Zelaya, and Juan 
Francisco Tejeda on behalf of his youngest son Juan Francisco 
Tejeda, who live in El Carril, Olanchito. 
  It was learned that the suit is basically against the 
Honduran Government because, according to the Executive Branch, 
National Congress authorities were the ones to approve 
operations of this type. 
  The explosion that killed Funez Santos injured the 
following: 
Maribel Melendez (11), Edin Marina Martinez (31), Mario Denis 
Rosales (19), Maria Josefa Antunez (31), Rigoberto Villafranca 
(17), Enit Yovani Zelaya (23), and Francisco Tejeda (11). 
Villafranca lost his left eye and part of his left foot. 
According to witnesses, Funez Santos and his brothers Denis 
Yovani and Francisco Alexis found seven grenades that were used 
by the U.S. and Honduran Armies and took them home. 
  It was reported that the suit was filed through the 
Committee 
for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras.

  [Text] The crisis between the Air Force and the Defense 
Ministry resulting from the purchase of the 36 Skyhawk planes is 
jeopardizing the operation that represented the end of the U.S. 
weapons embargo imposed on Argentina. 
  Disagreements between the Air Force and the ministry headed 
by Oscar Camilion originated with the ministry's decision to 
assign the Lockheed company the task of repairing and 
electronically equipping the planes (half of them at the 
Military Aircraft Factory [FMA] in Cordoba). The ministry thus 
overlooked prior contracts for these services that already had 
been signed with the U.S. Navy and Smith Industries and the $3.3 
million that already had been paid to them. 
  Brigadier Juan Paulik, chief of staff of the Air Force, now 
is studying the possibility of suspending the purchase if 
Lockheed takes more than 23 months to deliver the planes or 
fails to equip them with the same electronics and radar 
equipment authorized by the U.S. Government. 
  Although the Defense Ministry decision has yet to be made 
official, Military Affairs Secretary Jorge Baeza on 14 February 
adopted a measure that made the decision evident: He forbade 
Brigadier Ruben Zini to travel to the United States before 
consulting Paulik. Zini's trip to the United States was 
contemplated in the prior contracts signed with the two selling 
companies. 
  Friction between the Air Force and the Defense Ministry is 
based on the purchase of 36 Skyhawk fighters and the difficulty 
in equipping them with high-technology radars, which was a 
result of British pressure on the United States to prevent 
Argentine military rearmament. 
  The government deemed the U.S. Navy's decision to sell the 
planes with the radar equipment Argentina had requested as a 
victory. After months of tough negotiations, the Argentine 
Government saw, with satisfaction, that the British pressure was 
rendered without effect. Minister Camilion elatedly said on 1 
February: "The weapons embargo is over." 
  The Air Force decision not to purchase the Skyhawks now 
would 
not only ruin an operation resulting from careful military, 
commercial, and diplomatic negotiations, but also destroy the 
political victory resulting from the U.S. Government decision to 
sell the Skyhawks with high-technology equipment. 
  This tension began last September when the Air Force and the 
Defense Ministry decided to give the U.S. Navy (which sells the 
planes) and Smith Industries the task of repairing the planes 
and equipping them with modern electronic equipment, at an 
overall cost of $250 million, which will be divided almost 
equally between the two. Thus, the Lockheed and McDonell-Douglas 
companies were left out of the deal. 
  Notwithstanding, by mid-January Lockheed made a tempting 
proposal: To buy FMA and transform it into a plane repair center 
for South America. In exchange, it demanded to be given the 
contract to repair and equip the Skyhawks, although it promised 
to perform 50 percent of the work at the FMA in Cordoba. 
  This proposal has divided the Defense Ministry and the Air 
Force. While Camilion's people support the Lockheed proposal 
with enthusiasm in view of the possibility of reactivating FMA, 
the Air Force bluntly refused it. 
  In a report handed to the ministry by Paulik the proposal is 
rejected for many reasons. Here are some of them: 
  -- The planes' delivery will be delayed two years longer 
than 
planned if they are repaired and equipped in Cordoba. 
  -- Confidence in the materials used in the Cordoba plant 
will 
be less. 
  -- A landing strip for the Skyhawks will have to be built at 
the Cordoba plant because it does not have one. 
  In addition, the Air Force is concerned about its future 
relations with the [U.S.] Navy. According to Paulik's report, 
the Air Force will lose credibility if it goes back on something 
already agreed upon.

  [Excerpts] During a samba parade in Juiz de Fora, Minas 
Gerais, on the evening of 14 February, President Itamar Franco 
spoke for the first time about the incident with model Lilian 
Ramos at Rio de Janeiro Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground]. 
[passage omitted] 
  He said: [Begin recording] I want my right to privacy as 
president and citizen to be respected. There was nothing wrong 
with what happened in Rio de Janeiro. It was just an outward 
show of merriment, a sign of esteem for Rio de Janeiro Carnival. 
I was invited by the chairman of the samba schools association 
and I attended the parade in my capacity as president of the 
Republic. And yet, I also attended it as a human being, as a 
citizen. Therefore, I do not see that I have done anything 
wrong. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  He added: [Begin recording] For a year and a half we have 
been grappling with inflation, abject poverty, squalor. I would 
like to underscore that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has fulfilled his mission as a true patriot. Now, if he

  [Text] Lima, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The Peruvian opposition on 
Tuesday initiated the process whereby Council of Ministers 
President Alfonso Bustamante and two other members of the 
cabinet will be formally questioned about their approval of a 
controversial law that transferred jurisdiction of the case 
involving the disappearance and murder of nine students and one 
professor, presumably by soldiers in July 1992, to a military 
court. 
  An opposition coordinating board announced on Tuesday 
morning 
that most of the questions will be directed at Bustamante, who 
must clearly establish whether or not there is any truth to the 
growing rumors of his resignation from the Council of Ministers. 
  Another question he must answer is why he failed to sign the 
controversial law, which has been viewed by various sectors as a 
"coup d'etat" against the Judicial Branch because of its 
"unconstitutional" nature, according to Congressman Fernando 
Olivera. 
  The procedures for the questioning have come at a time when 
rumors are circulating regarding the possible U.S. withdrawal 
from the Support Group seeking Peru's reinstatement in the 
international economic system. "There is no official report 
concerning a possible suspension of U.S. support," says 
Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] Vice President Carlos 
Torres. 
  The local media expressed concern over statements by U.S. 
Senator Bob Graham, who said on Monday during an official visit 
to Peru that the law's approval "may constitute a reversal of 
the pledge to restore democracy and respect human rights." 
Nevertheless, Graham said he is confident that the discrepancy 
between the two governments will be resolved through dialogue. 
  The other two ministers who may be questioned are Defense 
Minister General Victor Malca, for his alleged political 
responsibility in this case, and Justice Minister Fernando Vega, 
who signed the law. 
  Local observers maintain that if there is any truth to the 
reports published in just about every Peruvian newspaper to the 
effect that Bustamante is resigning, a ministerial crisis may be 
brewing and it might break upon President Alberto Fujimori's 
return from Colombia. Bustamante is a member of his official 
entourage. 
  In accordance with the controversial law, known as the 
jurisdictional dispute law, the Supreme Court resolves 
litigation between civilian and military courts. The law was 
enacted precisely when a court was hearing the case of the nine 
students and one professor from La Cantuta Unversity in Lima, 
whose charred remains were discovered in common graves on the 
outskirts of Lima last year. 
  By virtue of the law, the case was settled when three 
Supreme 
Court justices voted in favor of transferring the case to a 
military court and two voted in favor of the common courts, thus 
eliminating the need for a decisive vote. In the past the 
Supreme Court required a majority of four votes to resolve a 
jurisdictional conflict and in the event of a split decision, 
another justice would cast the decisive vote. 
  Opposition congressmen on Tuesday began collecting the 27 
signatures required for approval of the ministers' questioning.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Carrillo in Juanchacho, Valle Department] </F>
  [Excerpts] Colombian military engineers, rather than U.S. 
Army engineers, are building the airport in Juanchaco with a 
clear vision of progress, wholly convinced of the national and 
international projection of the challenges the Pacific region 
faces for the year 2000. 
  Admiral Jose Ignacio Rozo Carvajal, commander of the Pacific 
Naval Force, has said, given the Navy's insistence and the 
decision by local authorities, Inter-Administrative Agreement 
No. 350 was signed on 17 August 1993 between the Valle del Cauca 
Department Governorate and the Defense Ministry. 
  He explained that on 29 and 30 October 1993 the ARC 
[Republic 
of Colombia Navy] landing craft "Bahia Solano," which belongs to 
the Pacific Naval Force, carried materiel, equipment, and a 
scouting detachment for the construction of a camp, which would 
precede the construction of an airport. 
  The Army Engineering Corps appointed the Codazzi Battalion 
to 
build the airport. 
  Military engineers believe the work to repair and extend the 
runway will be completed by late April, while the Valle del 
Cauca Governorate is in charge of building the control tower, 
passenger terminal, and access roads. 
  The only access road to the airport consisted of a dirt road 
that the U.S. soldiers have patiently turned into a highway so 
they could proceed with the construction of a school and health 
center. [passage omitted] 
  Admiral Rozo Carvajal has explained the presence of the U.S. 
Forces has made it necessary to double security measures not 
only in Bahia Malaga but also in Juanchaco, Ladrilleros, and 
neighboring areas to prevent any problems. 
  "Security measures were increased to provide protection to 
the Colombian military engineers in charge of building the 
airport and the North Americans who are building a school and 
health center," he has said. [passage omitted] 
  Admiral Rozo Carvajal has said he "would be the first to 
notify superiors if anything exceeds the framework foreseen with 
the U.S. military engineers. I must notify them, and that is 
how it should be." 
  He has reasserted the Bahia Malaga Naval Base has 
regulations, an internal system, and the U.S. forces involved in 
"Fuertes Caminos 94" were instructed on what they could do. 
  "We control the speed of vehicles, the way they are parked, 
the notices and reports when the "Runnymede," a craft used to 
transport personnel and machinery, will be mobilized, when 
helicopter support is given, and other measures," added Jose 
Ignacio Rozo Carvajal, commander of the Pacific Naval Force.

<F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Energy and Mines Minister Edwin Jose Arrieta today 
dismissed the possibility of any increase whatsoever in gasoline 
prices. Nevertheless, he said that ultimately any decision will 
be the Venezuelan state's sovereign decision to make. 
  Arrieta said that to discuss gasoline prices in terms of a 
necessary increase is a simplistic way of approaching the 
problem. Instead, he favors reducing basic production costs 
rather than increasing consumer prices. 
  [Begin Arrieta recording] We have no plans to discuss an 
increase in gasoline prices. At any rate, the petroleum product 
sector can conduct a study at any time to establish operational 
cost structures and so on, and at that time we would discuss the 
factors -- which, of course, are quite numerous -- and study the 
situation before adopting such a critical measure. 
  I believe the approach adopted thus far, the thought of 
increasing and, in fact, having increased gasoline prices 
already, has been very simplistic. Many factors must be 
considered, such as economic, operational, and social factors. 
Also, Venezuela is an oil-producing country and the Venezuelan 
people should have a relative advantage. [end recording] 
  Regarding the negotiations under way with the U.S. 
Government 
concerning restrictions on Venezuelan reformulated oil imports, 
Arrieta emphatically denied that they have failed. On the 
contrary, he said that progress has been made, adding that 
during the next round of negotiations scheduled to take place in 
Caracas, the U.S. representatives will answer 28 technical 
questions Venezuela will ask concerning its gasoline because, 
Arrieta reiterated, our gasoline meets the standards demanded by 
U.S. legislation. 
  Arrieta also said that the country's oil income has been 
recalculated and in 1994 is expected to be approximately 110 
billion bolivares. He added that Venezuela will propose to OPEC 
a policy of concerted effort and integration -- in other words, 
a return to the OPEC's original doctrine.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano; from the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The national government has decided to restore and 
reorganize Banco Latino. This information was released by 
Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez after the Council of 
Ministers meeting, which was held at the Presidential Palace, 
ended. He observed that the taking over of Venezuelan private 
banks by the government was not proposed at the meeting. 
Rodriguez added that the Council of Ministers decided to 
appoint a management council to reinforce the 
government-appointed administration council, renew the Banco 
Latino's assets, improve communications between the bank and the 
people interested in Banco Latino's recovery process, and 
identify the people who led the bank to its current critical 
situation. 
  Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez said the National 
Executive had also decided to implement measures that will 
guarantee the liquidity and standard operations of the entire 
banking system. This, he said, will require that the private 
financial sector increase its allocations to Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee Fund] from 0.25 percent to 1 percent of the public's 
total deposits. The government will also bolster Fogade's 
assets, speed the process to exchange the organization's assets 
in order to increase its liquidity, and reorganize Fogade. The 
Executive will also strengthen the supervision of financial 
institutions once the General Bank Superintendency and Fogade 
have been reorganized and their management changed, he said. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] The government alerts citizens 
to 
rumors aimed at increasing the unease and social uncertainty 
created by the Banco Latino crisis. The measures to strengthen 
assets, provide liquidity, improve management, and increase 
effective supervision assure the normal operations of the 
banking system and guarantee that people's savings will be 
secure. [end recording] 
  Additionally, the finance minister commented that the 
Council 
of Ministers will take up the tax issue next week. He added, 
however, that the general income tax will be implemented this 
year if it is approved by Congress. The income tax reforms, he 
said, will go into effect in 1995.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Convergence Deputy Leonardo Montiel reports the Central Bank 
of Venezuela used approximately $1 billion to assist banks 
experiencing difficulties due to "very probable irregular 
management." The Central Bank president will be summoned 
tomorrow before the Finance Commission to explain why funds were 
used to help certain banks instead of depositors. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2049 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  Venzuelan Petroleum subsidiary Lagoven Inc. dispatched a 
total of 119 million barrels during 1993 from its La Salina 
Terminal, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, to export 
markets and local petrochemical- and petroleum-processing 
centers. A total of 237 oil tankers were used, of which 168 
went to the United States, 35 to Germany, 12 to Canada, eight to 
Jamaica, six to Chile, three to Africa, two to Norway, and three 
to the Amuay Refinery in Falcon State. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 17) 
  The National Venezuelan Telephone Company grossed 120 
billion 
bolivares during 1993, twice the amount for 1992. The company 
president said that at the end of the month the company will pay 
the National Treasury 6 billion bolivares for concessions 
granted by the government. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 9 
Feb 94 p 12) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum subsidiary Maraven increased its level 
of production and generated significant savings of 10 billion 
bolivares in 1993, in addition to increasing services for 
customers via its quality management program. (Caracas EL DIARIO 
DE CARACAS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 19) 
  The state group Venezuelan Petroleum, via its president, 
Gustavo Roosen, explains that the fall in petroleum prices on 
the international markets has forced a review of the 1994 budget 
and the implementation of appropriate adjustments. As a result, 
the government will have a much lower tax revenue. 
Conservatives place the national deficit at approximately $3.5 
billion, while pessimists estimate the same at approximately $6 
billion, 50 percent of the budget. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0041

  [Text] The economic team of the administration of President 
Rafael Caldera is making the final adjustments aimed at reducing 
the national budget for 1994 by 150 billion bolivares. 
  It is estimated that as soon as the president enters office, 
the administration will request an amendment to the Budget Law 
for 1994 to reduce appropriations and allocations which it 
considers superfluous and unnecessary. 
  Abdon Vivas Teran, economic adviser of the next 
administration and member of the transition team, has pointed 
out that one of the priorities is to deal with the problem of 
the budget deficit. That will require carefully adjusting the 
balance between government income and expenditure. 
  Public spending is one of the variables which have the most 
decisive influence on the level of aggregate demand. 
Consequently, he commented, it has a significant impact on the 
maintenance of adequate rates of growth of Gross Domestic 
Product. At the same time, by carefully managing that element it 
will be possible to have a decisive impact which will lead to a 
decline in the level of inflation and interest rates and the 
small scale devaluations through which until the exchange rate 
between the U. S. dollar and the bolivar has been set. 
  He stated that the traditional policy of expanding demand 
tends to limit the scope for reconsidering public spending. 
Reducing the level of spending to a reasonable extent and, at 
the same time, reexamining the rest of the budget is another way 
of saying that we have to reform the Budget Law of 1994. 
  Vivas Teran said that, "The study conducted by the technical 
team of the new government indicates that a reduction on the 
order of 150 billion bolivares of public spending is an 
objective which can be achieved over the very short term. These 
adjustments," which are rather limited, "will not be oriented 
toward the investment area nor toward the socially productive 
area (education, health, and public security)." He indicated 
that cuts will be made in appropriations and allocations which 
have continued to reflect exaggerated levels of spending, such 
as for automobiles, travel, highways, aircraft, celebrations, 
and publicity, among other things. 
  Vivas Teran stated that the president elect has announced a 
30 percent reduction in spending on the security of the 
Presidency and on the secret appropriation of the Ministry of 
Internal Relations. He rejected the allocation of 60 million 
bolivares for expenditures related to his inauguration. 
  Vivas Teran was asked, "Will the bureaucracy be pruned?" He 
answered: "Yes. Within the goal of reducing the budget by 150 
billion bolivares consideration is being given to the 
elimination of some unnecessary services which probably are 
duplicated elsewhere. Hence the urgent need for restructuring 
existing institutions." 
  He added that action to reduce spending should be 
accompanied 
by a series of measures to increase public receipts. These 
increases should complement the program of reforms aimed at 
modernizing and placing income tax collection on a better 
technical basis, as well as other, ordinary tax receipts, 
including the collection of duties by the customs service of the 
country. Specifically, these involve the following: 

  -  The adequate management of the whole income tax system 
(without as yet introducing changes in the law which must be 
approved by Congress), creating an autonomous income tax system 
and strictly controlling tax collections. This would make it 
possible for the Ministry of Finance to collect about 260 
billion bolivares in 1994 in this category, as compared to the 
131 billion bolivares collected up to the end of 1993. 
  -  The next 
administration should, as a matter of preference, concern itself 
with tariff collections made by customs offices. It will be 
necessary to bring up to date a technical cooperation agreement 
which Venezuela has already signed with the United Nations for 
trade and development (UNTAC) to modernize the tariff system. 
Unfortunately, the most intractable focus of corruption in the 
whole system of government tax collection is in the customs 
offices. It is essential to wipe out this system of corruption 
and make changes in management personnel. 
  In his opinion the efforts which have been made in this 
direction have been very limited. He stated that receipts by the 
Treasury from tariffs amounted to 115 billion bolivares in 1993. 
It is estimated that, with the changes to be made, customs 
receipts could rise to 350 billion bolivares. In this way the 
new government, through the application of ethical and 
administrative principles, will be able to obtain from income 
tax and customs receipts sufficient resources (about 610 billion 
bolivares) to resolve the budget deficit to a large 
extent.%Urgent action should be taken on taxes which are owed 
but not yet collected and on any tax measure which the 
government may approve, including those tax cases which have 
already been decided favorably in the appropriate courts. 
According to a report from the Hacienda Publica Nacional 
[National Treasury] for 1992, the cumulative total of all of the 
potential receipts by the Treasury under this heading amounted 
to 400 billion bolivares. The most worrisome aspect of this 
situation is that there has been no will to collect these taxes. 
Corruption is of such magnitude that frequently obligations to 
pay are allowed to lapse. 
  The state can and should begin a healthy and sensible tax 
collection policy, using law firms and entrusting them with 
handling this task. Their services would be paid for by a 
negotiable percentage of the tax collections which they 
make.%Presenting to Congress as soon as possible changes in 
income tax legislation, including: (a) eliminating or 
substantially reducing authorized legal exemptions, especially 
those which protect the financial sector; (b) slightly 
increasing the taxes due on corporations. The maximum now is 30 
percent. It could be raised to 32.5 percent; (c) reducing the 
impact of direct taxation by enacting income tax legislation 
before providing for some other type of tax to replace the 
burden of indirect taxes on the people. Vivas Teran warned that 
the collection of income taxes in Venezuela amounts at most to 
2.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product. In 1993 it did not amount 
even to that much. In the United States, for example, income tax 
collections amount to 10.8 percent of total government income; 
(d) immediate substitution of the Value Added Tax by a tax on 
the consumption of luxury articles which would exempt from 
payment all products of common use by the people and which could 
start from a given unit value and rise higher. 

    Abdon Vivas Teran, expected to replace Julian Villalba as 
president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, considers that the 
policy of privatization should be used more as an instrument 
aimed at correcting structural deficiencies in the distribution 
of income and property, in the provision of services, and in the 
level of government efficiency by helping to relieve the 
excessive burden of the external public debt, rather than as an 
automatic instrument to compensate for the budget deficit. 
  Therefore, he added, these processes should guarantee access 
to property, both by those who work for companies which will be 
subject to these transactions as well as by persons turning out 
production inputs, as in the case of the agricultural sector. 
  He was asked: "At present does the program for participation 
by the workers provide for the sale of between 10 and 20 percent 
of the shares in a company to the workers?" 
  He replied: "I am inclined to review and broaden this 
program, without suggesting that what has been done so far is 
not good. It could be better. Furthermore, privatization tends 
to reduce the portfolio of shares owned by the state. The most 
advisable action is for a substantial part of those assets to be 
earmarked to pay debts owed by the nation over the long term. In 
this way the balance sheet of the Treasury would be protected 
under optimum conditions. 
  Vivas stated: "It is clear that our task cannot be to 
privatize in part and to open another portfolio of unprofitable 
assets in the hands of the nation. On the other hand everything 
which adds significantly to the burdens of the state and which 
could be better handled by the private sector, by mixed private 
and state companies, or by associations, would be perfectly 
viable. In the case of companies owned by the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana, not all of them, in my view, are 
strategic. Initially, these companies could have a different 
form of management through mixed private and state firms." 
  He recalled that the administration of Carlos Andres Perez 
emphasized to the public the view that state-owned companies are 
not viable and that they are a useless and costly burden. 
  Vivas Teran said: "That is a picture which may be true in 
part, but it is not the whole truth. In some cases the condition 
of state-owned companies has been deliberately worsened to make 
the process of privatization easier, taking into account the 
fact that public opinion was going to react angrily against 
companies which were not providing the service expected. That is 
totally correct and, of course, that cannot be the philosophy of 
the new government." 
  Vivas Teran stated that, "We are not going to ruin state 
companies just to sell them for bargain basement prices. We are 
going to move them into the private sector at a good price, 
because they are productive and efficient and not because they 
have been deliberately bankrupted by state administrators."

  [Text] In 1993, 149,994,761,000 bolivares in ordinary 
domestic taxes were collected, according to a report prepared by 
the Incomes Sector of the Directorate General of Taxes of the 
Ministry of Finance concerning activity by that office in 1993. 
  This figure includes collections of income tax and taxes on 
liquor, cigarettes, matches, inheritances, and fees, as well as 
collections on tax stamps. It indicates an increase of 45.17 
percent over tax revenues collected in 1992. 
  Broken down in detail, tax collections were as follows: 

  -  Income Tax: 103,511.0 million bolivares, compared to 
63,486.0 million bolivares collected in 1992, an increase of 
63.04 percent. The 1994 budget has set out an income tax 
collection goal of 136,275.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Alcoholic 
beverages: In this category the difference between 1993 and 1992 
was not so pronounced. In 1992 13,754.0 million bolivares in 
taxes were collected, a figure which was 7.93 percent higher in 
1993, when 14,845.0 million bolivares were collected. The tax 
collection goal for 1994 is 18,250.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Tax 
stamps: in 1993 13,368.0 million bolivares were collected, or 24 
percent more than in 1992 (when 10,771.0 million bolivares were 
collected). With the reform of the law on tax stamps it is hoped 
to collect at least 27 billion bolivares in 1994, due to the 
increase in tax rates. 
  -  Cigarettes: tax collections in 1993 
amounted to 17,104 million bolivares, against almost 14,000 
million bolivares in 1992, which was 22.26 percent more in 
comparative terms. 
  -  Taxes on matches: tax income was 40,147.0 
million bolivares in 1993, or 11.26 percent more than in 1992. 
The report on tax collections states that the goal set by the 
Directorate General of Taxes was not completely attained, due to 
the effects of smuggling matches, which resulted in a decline in 
production. 
  -  Taxes collected on inheritances, donations, and 
other, related taxes brought in 966.0 million bolivares in 1993, 
a decline of 17.8 percent, compared to the 1,176.0 million 
bolivares collected under this category in 1992. According to 
the report, this is the only tax collection area which declined 
due to temporary circumstances. The projection for 1994 shows a 
decline to 650.0 million bolivares. 
  -  Finally, 159.0 million 
bolivares were collected in fees, or 49.6 percent more than the 
106.0 million bolivares collected under this category in 1992. 
The 1994 budget anticipates collection of 128.0 million 
bolivares in this category of taxes. 
  With the exception of income tax, the other, internal taxes 
showed a growth of only 16.69 percent in 1993, compared to 1992. 
  The report on tax collection activity in 1993 also showed 
that the activities of the Directorate of Tax Control in Caracas 
brought in 55,965.0 million bolivares in income tax. A special 
plan was set up for tax collections at the regional level. 
  Another 35,525.0 million bolivares were collected as a 
result 
of opening tax cases against 850 taxpayers. This figure broke 
down to 14,126.0 million bolivares from taxes, 14,396.0 million 
bolivares from fines, and the remaining 7.0 billion bolivares 
from interest collections. 
  Investigations carried out by the Directorate of Tax 
Collection on financial, industrial, and commercial companies, 
as well as service companies, had the following results. 
Reserves set aside amounted to 10,470.0 bolivares, and taxes 
plus contingencies resulting from reserves set aside amounted to 
8.0 billion bolivares. 
  Investigations carried out in the petroleum sector brought 
the following results: reserves set aside of 21,207.0 million 
bolivares and taxes plus contingencies amounting to 29,239.0 
million bolivares. 
  In the mining sector reserves set aside amounted to 643 
million bolivares, and taxes plus contingencies amounted to 455 
million bolivares. 
  In 1994, the report states, it is anticipated that a 
strategy 
will be followed which will extend until 1996 for increasing tax 
collection, tax pressure, and a range of tax contingencies, thus 
reducing tax evasion, delays in tax payments, and requests for 
resource set aside for litigation.

  [Text] Gustavo Gabaldon, president of the Venezuelan 
Institute of Social Security [IVSS], stated in an end of the 
year message to workers that the new draft law on social 
security to replace the present law and the regulations issued 
under it has been favorably received by the president, who has 
promised to consider it at a cabinet meeting during the next few 
days. 
  The draft bill has also been discussed with senior 
representatives of the president elect, who also received it 
favorably. 
  Gabaldon said in his report that it will not be possible to 
administer the IVSS properly with a financial deficit of almost 
one billion bolivares monthly, due to inadequate income to cover 
the basic expenditures of the institute. 
  The president of the IVSS proposed six urgently needed 
measures to the president: 
  1) Seek passage of a Law on Public Credit, under which the 
national government will cancel its debt to the IVSS of more 
than 8.5 billion bolivares. 
  2) Pass appropriate legislation to restore the technical 
reserves of the IVSS which are more than 300 billion bolivares 
short, due to mistakes made in the past. 
  3) Provide by decree for total coverage of all employees of 
the national government. 
  4) Seek a harmonious agreement between employers and workers 
to raise social security contributions within the next 30 days 
in such a way that this increase will be insignificant for those 
with the least resources. 
  5) Raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 
55 
to 60 for women. 
  6) Make changes in the percentages relating to each social 
security fund to make them adequate under present circumstances 
and separate the various funds, with different administrations 
and accounting systems. 
  Gabaldon said that when he became president of the IVSS, the 
institute was in a state of total collapse in the areas of 
administration, operations, and finance, notwithstanding the 
intense effort made by the Committee on Restructuring, which was 
established under special legislation. 
  He said that the results of this work became known through a 
draft social security bill which has still not been introduced 
in Congress for debate. He pointed out that, notwithstanding the 
advances made in terms of decentralization, through harmonious 
cooperation with several state governments, the financial 
deficit will continue and become intolerable if significant 
action is not taken. 
  The president of the IVSS said that the following actions 
have already been taken recently: 

  -  Improvements in the quality of IVSS 
employees. 
  -  Introduction of strict controls over bidding, 
purchasing, and payments. 
  -  Revision of general 
procedures. 
  -  Introduction of a system of automatic payments 
through the banks. 
  -  A total change in the system and control of 
surveillance of property belonging to the IVSS. 
  -  A substantial 
improvement in the processes of daily collections and 
receipts. 
  -  A substantial reduction in debts owed to suppliers and 
a considerable improvement in the system of 
payments. 
  -  Elimination of the use of blank payrolls. 
  -  Payment of 
pensions to workers. 
  -  A substantial improvement in making 
payments to hospitals and centers of ambulatory health 
care. 
  -  Raising the minimum IVSS pension to 9,000 
bolivares. 
  -  Making up one year of arrearages of unemployment 
payments; these obligations are now being paid on time. 
  -  Study of 
an independent social security management system to improve the 
Pension Fund. 
  -  Elimination of per diem allowances, unnecessary 
travel within and outside the country, and unjustified overtime 
payments, including the elimination of chauffeurs and escorts 
for the president of the IVSS, members of the Board of 
Directors, and directors of the institute. 
  -  Beginning the process 
of appraisal and sale of unnecessary IVSS assets. 
  -  Beginning the 
system of self-administration of hospitals under which they will 
present their own bills and collect contributions from workers 
not insured and from private persons or groups holding insurance 
policies. 

    Gabaldon pointed out that there is still a long way to go, 
but we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel through 
which we have been traveling.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Roberto Cavada -- live] </F>
  [Text] We will now hear from Rebelde journalist Roberto 
Cavada, who is at present out in the Escambray Mountains, where 
a tour by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina began today in 
the company of the diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba. Good 
evening Cavada. We are ready whenever you are. 
  [Cavada] Yes, thank you very much. Good evening, people of 
Cuba. Once again, Cuba's Foreign Ministry has presented to (?the 
world) the true architect of its diplomacy: the Cuban people. 
  This evening, over 40 chiefs of mission -- ambassadors, 
consuls, military attaches -- left the Cuban capital to learn in 
detail about all the things that the men and women of the 
Escambray Mountain areas accomplish daily. 
  The first stop on this work tour was the Integrated Military 
Enterprise of the Che Guevara Center in Manicaragua 
Municipality, Villa Clara Province, very near the community of 
La Campana, where the visitors were informed about the 
possibilities the medical industry brings to the nation's life. 
There, Brigadier General Luis Perez, an engineer and director of 
the Military Enterprises Union, confirmed that over 40 
factories, in addition to making and repairing all the military 
material for the Revolutionary Armed Forces, are collaborating 
with tourism, the nickel industry, and petroleum. In this way, 
the alleged (?veils) that have always existed regarding military 
information were lifted because, as Foreign Minister Robaina 
said, at home, there are no hidden truths, and truth is 
precisely the distinctive sign of Cuba's foreign policy, which 
arises, without a doubt, from the interior of the country. 
  The following is the opinion of the Colombian ambassador to 
Cuba: 
  [Begin recording] Well, as for me, I must say that [words 
indistinct], because our idea is to bring businessmen, bring 
people linked (?to) businesses in Colombia; and this way we can 
identify the kinds of opportunities, the kind of exchange 
agreements that can be realized. Thus, it is particularly useful 
for the ambassadors and for me to begin learning from within how 
industry is doing, how the Cuban economy is doing. [end 
recording] 
  [Cavada] These have been exclusive details of the working 
tour that began today in central Cuba for the diplomatic corps 
accredited to Cuba, led by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. 
People of Cluba, Roberto Cavada wishes you a good night. 
  [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 
0100 GMT on 18 February, in a similar report, add, to conclude 
their report: Tomorrow, the group is scheduled to tour the Topes 
de Collantes area and a number of Escambray Mountain areas. This 
tour is part of a new offensive by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. 
It is undoubtedly a way of meeting with the true protagonists of 
the foreign policy on the island: our people.]

  [Text] Havana, 16 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported here 
today Cuban Defense Minister General Raul Castro had rejected 
the possibility that Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) officers 
and soldiers will surrender or desert massively in the future 
  "They cannot dream about massive surrenders or a generalized 
collapse. The fight against us is to the death," the top Cuban 
military commander has said in a speech to commanders, officers, 
and midranking personnel of the western Army. 
  Raul Castro has said the Cuban Government will act 
forcefully 
and coldbloodedly, "will not fall for provocations or allow them 
to take the initiative on any terrain." 
  Raul Castro, who is also the second secretary of the 
governing Communist Party, has inaugurated the annual training 
period of this section of the public force, which encloses the 
western provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana City, and the 
special municipality of Isla de la Juventud. 
  He said although the Cuban Armed Forces budget has been cut 
50 percent, the training program for FAR commanders, officers, 
and midranking personnel would be consolidated in 1994. 
  Up to the beginning of this decade, the former Soviet Union 
furnished the Cuban Armed Forces with planes, weapons, and 
ammunition, and top-ranking Cuban officers received military 
training in that country as well. 
  At the event, which was held at the San Antonio de los Banos 
Air Base, President Fidel Castro's brother said despite the 
current economic crisis in Cuba, FAR made "a giant effort" in 
1993 to ensure that its combat capacity not be eroded. 
  He added he had recently visited Army units in the central 
and eastern regions of the island and was able to see how the 
troops were trained, the maintenance given to weapons, the 
preparation of the military operations area, and how the 
soldiers tilled the land.

  [Text] The Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] are 
a socialist solution in keeping with our reality, said Politburo 
member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura after being informed that this 
UBPC experiment is doing well in Guane Municipality, Pinar del 
Rio Province. From a talk with workers at La Catalina UBPC, he 
learned that they expect to receive over 800 pesos per capita 
profit at the end of this year, in addition to daily advances 
for their work. 
  Machado noted the enthusiasm that prevails in La Catalina 
because of the results obtained by this UBPC in the short time 
it has been in existence, and emphasized the need to put into 
practice the profitability schema, which will be able to 
systematically measure productivity. 
  Machado Ventura also exchanged views with workers and 
leaders 
of the Camilo Cienfuegos livestock UPBC in Guane Municipality, 
where he expressed appreciation for that UBPC's good performance.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Rally] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (AFP) -- "Foreign Partner Wanted" by 
Cuba. Recently, this type of advertisement, which has no ties 
to the romantic ones that abound in times of crisis, 
proliferates in two new Cuban economic newspapers addressed to 
foreign readers. According to the monthly CONTACTOS magazine of 
the Cuban Chamber of Commerce and the weekly OPCIONES 
periodical, which began being published in Havana in January, 
the wanted partner must have funds to invest in the island or a 
market abroad where Cuban products can be sold. 
  The request for partners comes from very diverse as well as 
unexpected prospects in a country that continues to declare 
itself Communist and that practically eliminated foreign 
investment since the victory of the revolution in January 1959. 
Such is the case because not only do small- and medium-sized 
firms advertise their interest in foreign partners but the most 
important government associations, oil refineries, sugar 
factories, textile firms, distilleries, and cement factories do 
so too. They are organizations that have been partially 
paralyzed since the fall of the Soviet Union and the divorce 
from Russia. 
  Cuban authorities have established a list of 132 priority 
"investment opportunities," which they are proposing throughout 
the world in an effort to attract investors with a certain 
amount of incentives, mainly in the fiscal sector. Those 
proposals have not prompted great enthusiasm for the Cuban 
market of 11 million people up to now. However, they have 
prompted interest by certain businessmen, mainly Europeans, 
Latin Americans, and Canadians. 
  According to members of the French National Council 
Foundation delegation that visited Cuba recently, there is no 
doubt that President Fidel Castro's regime is willing to open 
the economic system. Castro met with them for eight hours to 
confirm the "irreversible" character of the ongoing economic 
reforms. Communist leaders have asserted that "the Cuban 
economic opening is not a tactical or circumstantial response 
but a realistic strategy to permanently adapt the country to a 
new international economic scenario. 
  Concerned that their bulky foreign debt could prompt 
difficulties, mainly with European countries, Cuban leaders have 
also asserted that "Cuba is willing to consider flexible 
renegotiation of its foreign debt, taking into account the 
creditors' interests." Parallel to this, the Castro government 
has created the International Commerce Bank and inaugurated an 
area for merchandise in transit that has many of the 
characteristics of a free zone. 
  The number of mixed firms is still relatively small -- 112 
in January 1994 -- but the number of foreign firms being 
established in Cuba -- 505 currently -- is increasingly rapidly. 
Out of the 112 mixed firms, 28 are in the tourism sector, which 
Cuban authorities present as the "salvation" of the economy and 
foreign specialists view as the most promising market in the 
entire Caribbean.

  [Text] Alfredo Diaz Urbay, director of the Labor Research 
Institute, said that, up until 31 January, a total of 141,637 
people were self-employed. Self-employment is based on Decree 
Law No. 141, which permits the practice of 136 different types 
of jobs. According to Diaz, more that 70 percent of the people 
authorized for self-employment fill less than 20 percent of the 
activities permitted, of which the most common are wagon worker 
[cochero], carpenter, hair dresser, pushcart worker 
[carretonero], and manicurist. 
  As you know, Decree Law No. 141 states that the regulations 
are dictated by two state committees: the State Committee for 
Labor and Social Security, and the State Committee of Finances. 
The first grants permission for self-employment and the second 
deals with collection, since authorized persons must purchase a 
license. This money is income for the state budget. 
  The State Committee of Finances has announced that the 
implementation of an overall tax system is being considered, 
which, if approved, would include people who are self-employed.

  [Text] When Cayo Largo is mentioned, it usually brings to 
mind tourism development -- which is logical. However, there is 
a military unit here keeping watch over the airspace of the 
southern part of Western Cuba. The Air Surveillance Troops 
[Tropas Radiotecnicas] unit has highly trained youths of both 
sexes. They are charged with the important mission of overseeing 
diverse air targets and, of course, watching that Cuban airspace 
is not violated. The Cayo Largo military unit is a frontline 
post because it provides timely information -- essential in the 
decisionmaking process -- to the high command of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. 
  For these reasons, the soldiers' welfare is vital. 
  [First unidentified speaker] "We are concerned with their 
mental welfare, nutrition, and good supervision. When we speak 
of good supervision we are not talking leniency or indulgence." 
  The female presence is an incentive for the young men and 
allows them to share leisure time, [words indistinct] in 
addition to love for a military career. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] "Women bring beauty here. 
[Words indistinct] all is not trees and sand. 
  [Reporter Marta Moreno] "What are your views on the role of 
women in the FAR? 
  [Third unidentified speaker] "It is a very important asset 
nowadays. It demonstrates a lot. [words indistinct] We have a 
very important role here." 
  Upon their term of enlistment [words indistinct] while 
others 
remain in Cayo Largo [words indistinct] the beauty of the 
surroundings, being so close to a tourist spot, and having such 
[words indistinct]. 
  For these soldiers, life is not easy. They spend long 
periods 
away from home -- 35 or more days with only seven days of leave 
or fifteen is [words indistinct]. To this you have to add the 
active hosts of mosquitoes at night, the constant rigors of 
defense readiness, and the stress of remaining alert at all 
times.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish on 16 and 17 February. 
  Radio Reloj at 2209 GMT on 16 February reports that the 
Ministry of the Sugar Industry is planning to organize in 
Matanzas, this month, 24 state farms for the self-sufficiency of 
agroindustrial workers. "The self-sufficiency granges implement 
the principles of linking workers to the land, building housing, 
and financial self-management, "and 50 percent of the profits of 
a given accounting period is distributed among the members." 
  Radio Reloj at 2229 GMT on 16 February reports that "(Lynn, 
Dorothee), president of the Guadeloupe-Cuba Friendship 
association, has delivered an important donation of food, school 
supplies, and cleaning products to the headquarters of the 
Santiago de Cuba branch of the Cuban Institute of Friendship 
With Peoples." (Dorothee) "is also a member of the Politburo of 
the Communist Party of Guadeloupe." Also, an Italian delegation 
from the cultural association called World Liberation presented 
two packages of antibiotics, anesthetics, and cortisone to two 
hospitals in Santiago de Cuba. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 February reports that 
Chile's minister of public health "has announced that Chile is 
going to begin a field test in March with meningitis vaccines 
from Cuba and Norway." The test will study the vaccinated 
persons' response to the different vaccines. "The test will be 
supervised by the Pan American Health Organization, a Cuban 
physician, and international experts." 
  In the same newscast, Cuba Vision reports that "the 
important 
Canadian hotel chain Delta Hotels has begun operating, with 
Cubanacan, several hotels in Santiago de Cuba: the Sierra-Mar, 
the Los Galeones Diving Center, and the Salton, all located west 
of the city -- a total of over 260 rooms." Delta also has a 
tradition of helping nearby communities; therefore, the hospital 
in the town of Chivirico received a big gift consisting of 
uniforms and tires, which the businessmen say is just a start. 
Tourists seem to like the hotels: "The Sierra-Mar is at present 
100 percent full. To begin this way is a good omen for the 
future, because this alone says much about the importance of the 
agreement." 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 17 February reports that an 
oceanographic atlas of the waters off the Sabana-Camaguey 
archipelago has been published. Engineer Angel Luis Chirino, 
interviewed at the Third Oceanographic Sciences Congress under 
way in Havana, notes that the atlas constitutes a solid basis 
for conducting research that will be done within the framework 
of a UN Development Program project. He explains that the 
Sabana-Camaguey archipelago area off the northern coast of 
Camaguey is being studied because it is one of the areas most 
greatly changed by man in recent years, and "is beginning to be 
exploited, from a petroleum point of view. That is, platforms 
are being built offshore. This is the first time this has been 
done in Cuba." 
  In the same newscast, it is reported that remodeling of the 
Hotel Habana-Riviera in Havana is among the projects of the 
(Caguama-Caribe) Hotels business group. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 17 
February report that a new variety of tobacco called Habana-200, 
as well as others also resistant to blue mold and other tobacco 
diseases and pests, has been tried out on certain small farmer 
and state sector lands in Pinar del Rio Province with 
encouraging results. Yields are expected to be 500 or 600 
quintals of tobacco per caballeria, with many high quality 
leaves. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 on 17 February reports that the Raul 
Cervantes tire recycling plant recycled 13,000 tires in 1993, 
which will be used in the agricultural sector in the current 
harvest. The plant was limited in production because of a 
shortage of resources. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 17 February reports that in 
1993 
Cuba received $50 million worth of donations from friends in 72 
countries. These figures were given by Sergio Corrieri, 
president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples, in 
an article printed in the 17 February issue of GRANMA.

based on the methodology used by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). 
  According to figures from the Central Bank, fiscal receipts 
during the period from January to September of 1993 totaled 
14,493.9 million Dominican pesos. In contrast, during the same

<F P=106> [Article by Claudio Cabrera: "Construction"] </F>
  [Text] Construction continued to absorb a large part of the 
tax revenue collected by the government between January and 
October of this year, with a 65.3-percent increase in spending 
over the same period of last year. 
  According to the information available, the government spent 
some 4,482 billion pesos during the first 10 months of this 
year, far exceeding the 1992 total, when the figure was 2,711 
billion. 
  Data supplied by the Dasa consulting firm indicate that, 
relatively speaking, construction spending increased faster than 
sums collected by the government. 
  While the increase in tax revenue rose 17.3 percent between 
January and October of this year compared with last, funding for 
this sector was far greater. The major spending effort aimed at 
construction results from the determination of government 
officials to expand the infrastructure in different areas of 
social services, a goal recently adopted as a priority by 
government authorities along with the construction of housing 
for lower-income groups and the middle class. 
  While the government did manage to collect 13.435 million 
pesos during the period of 1992 undergoing scrutiny, the 
absolute, percentage proportion was smaller this year, 
comparatively speaking. 
  From January to October of this year, duties and taxes 
totaled 15,758 million pesos, according to the information 
available, demonstrating that less is spent than is taken in. 
Despradel and Associates data also reveal a general, marked 
trend in the public sector to increase capital spending beyond 
regular spending. While regular spending rose by 33.8 percent 
during the period analyzed, capital charges increased even more 
on a percentage basis, amounting to 42.6 percent. 
  Despite the fact that the Central Government has maintained 
a 
policy aimed at increasing public spending by earmarking funds 
for construction, the country has not endured the scourge of the 
inflationary process that it has felt in previous years. 
  The figures show that inflation did rise in our country, but 
generally remained under control. For example, the increase 
during the peak month of September was only 1.2 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Mercedes Feliz: "Income Tax Collected </F>

  [Text] During the first 10 months of this year, the Income 
Tax Directorate collected revenue amounting to 3,777.9 billion 
pesos, an increase of 16.4 percent over the same period in 1992. 
  According to a report on collection trends during the period 
from January to October of 1992, the institution took in 3,243.5 
billion pesos. 
  So far this year, the Income Tax Directorate has done well 
in 
terms of revenue from the different taxes collected. 
  Institution officials had anticipated revenue totaling some 
4,187.9 billion pesos for all of 1993, meaning that only 410 
million remain to be obtained from the November and December 
collections. 
  From January to October of 1993, the institution collected 
income tax revenue from individuals, plus surcharges and fines, 
totaling 54.9 million pesos, a drop of 38.1 percent compared 
with the same period of 1992, when the figure was 88.8 million. 
  This was the only tax that recorded a drop during the first 
10 months of the year. 
  At the same time, from January to October of 1993, the 
institution took in 1,413.9 billion pesos from corporations, an 
increase of only .6 percent compared with the same period in 
1992, when the amount collected was 1,404.5 billion. 
  Additional payments also brought in 18.1 million pesos in 
revenue from January to October of this year, an increase of 
112.9 percent compared with the same period in 1993, when the 
total was only 8.5 million. 
  During the first 10 months of 1993, the amount of taxes 
withheld--including income tax--totaled 2,534.4 billion pesos.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Mercedes Feliz: "Production Is Limited by </F>
World Prices"] 
  [Text] During the first 10 months of 1993, 
the steady decline in nickel prices on the international market 
caused government revenue from Falconbridge Dominicana to 
register a 74.3-percent drop compared with the same period in 
1992. 
  According to mining company officials, from January to 
October of this year, Falconbridge brought in foreign revenue 
amounting to $8,990,720, compared with a total of $34,797,705 
for the same period of 1992. 
  They reported that firm executives plan to produce 70 
million 
pounds of nickel contained in ferronickel next year. 
  During the first 10 months of 1993, they said, nickel 
exports 
amounted to 43,579,4124 [as published] pounds, which production 
was sold at an average per-pound price of $2.02. 
  In contrast, 49,591,422 pounds were exported during the same 
period of last year at an average price of $3.20 per pound. 
  From March to October of this year, Falconbridge Dominicana 
produced 40,916,441 pounds. It will be recalled that due to the 
drop in price and demand on the international market, executives 
decided to suspend operations on 26 December 1992, then resumed 
them on 8 March. 
  During the first 10 months of 1992, Falconbridge produced 
47,933,842 pounds. The estimated monthly average was 5.6 million 
pounds. 
  From March to December of this year, the company planned to 
produce 55 million pounds at a much lower cost than that 
achieved during the final quarter of last year. 
  In 1992, production totaled 60.7 million pounds and 60.5 
million pounds were sold abroad at an average per-pound price of 
$3.14. A total of 70 million pounds was obtained during the 
entire period and the government took in $46,641,773 for the 
year. 
  Experts estimated that it is impossible to produce at a cost 
of under $2.00 per pound, meaning that it will be necessary to 
change policies if world prices drop below that price this 
coming year. 
  Falconbridge maintains its policy of reducing costs in order 
to continue operating, increase profits, and meet the region's 
development programs, the experts said. It will be recalled that 
in 1991, Falconbridge produced 64.1 million pounds of nickel and 
exported 61 million pounds. 
  For the first time, the mining company reduced its 
operations 
by 50 percent on 7 October 1991, a situation that continued 
until late February 1992 due to the drop in prices and demand. 
By that time, prices ranged between $3.23 and $3.29. 
  Meanwhile, production remained halted throughout almost all 
of August as the result of an effort to reduce the supply on 
hand. 
  Company experts attribute the drop in prices and demand on 
the international market to the current overproduction since the 
former Soviet bloc countries have become exporters.

  [Text] On the night of 2 February, an incident occurred 
between a military detachment and about 20 armed men, presumed 
partisans of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in southern Haiti 
near Les Cayes city, a Haitian military source told AFP on 16 
February. 
  According to this source, there was gunfire during the 
incident. The armed men, who are being sought, left weapons 
including three M- 1 rifles and ammunition in the area. The 
incident took place near the village of Chantal near Les Cayes, 
some 200 km southwest of Port-au-Prince. 
  Three Haitians from the diaspora, who had clandestinely 
reentered the country, were training young people of the region 
in the rural section of Le Pretre when they were discovered by a 
reconnaissance patrol acting on a tip, which then turned into a 
combat patrol, according to the same source. No Army personnel 
were wounded. There is no information about casualties among the 
opposing group. 
  The plan to train for armed struggle is part of Operation 
Iron Cuts Iron aimed at liberating the country, which was 
announced by President Aristide from Washington in a New Year's 
message to Haitians, this source explained. In order to thwart 
this plan and maintain order, search operations were recently 
launched by the Army in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area 
where six weapons, including two with telescopic lenses, were 
seized and arrests made, this military source pointed out. He 
added that the situation in Les Cayes, where similar incidents 
have taken place since Aristide went into exile in 1991, was 
totally under the control of the local military command. 
  Furthermore, the same source said that the fire that 
destroyed oil products clandestinely stored in a low-income 
neighborhood of Port-au-Prince on the night of 12 February might 
be the act of a criminal hand to raise fuel prices and 
exacerbate the crisis.

  [Text] Agronomist Roosevelt (Saindic) officially announced 
his resignation from PANPRA [National Progressive Revolutionary 
Party of Haiti] leadership after having discontinued 
participation in their activities as of May 1993. The 
resignation letter of Roosevelt (Saindic) mentions deep 
opposition to his management style from several members of the 
party, especially concerning work methods, strategy, and the 
party's current political leanings. 
  The resignation of (Saindic) from PANPRA's leadership, 
follows that of several other members of this political party 
including Georges Weirleigh, Arnold Antonin, and Claude Elisma.

  [Text] Despite the political and economic double crisis, an 
impressive crowd participated in the 1994 Carnival. For three 
days, from 13 to 15 February, Haitians attempted to forget their 
worries by delivering themselves, body and soul, to the 
delirious atmosphere of Carnival. 
  During the three days, the capital throbbed to the rhythm of 
meringues composed for the occasion. There were no colors or 
traditional floats in the 1994 version of Haitian Carnival. 
However, Champs-de-Mars and other main streets of Port-au-Prince 
welcomed thousands of people who celebrated this huge popular 
festival to their heart's content. No official theme was 
designated for 1994 but there was music, which served as a 
bridge among the various social classes hugging each other in 
the streets, forgetting the embargo and the political crisis. 
  Although the major topics of the news were not totally 
absent 
from the songs, a political truce was observed during the three 
carnival days. No major incidents were reported but tens of 
persons were stabbed and there were arrests by the 
Port-au-Prince police, who were out in force on the Carnival 
streets.

  [Text] In an initiative to restore democracy, and within 
the framework of their respective efforts to end the country's 
political crisis, the employers' associations and the Haitian 
labor union sector met on 1 and 3 February. Following 
discussions, the parties concluded as follows: 
  First, the nation's vital forces -- workers and employers -- 
are exhausted and are seeking immediate restoration of a 
political atmosphere favoring the resumption of economic 
activities. The employers' associations and the labor union 
sector point out that no employers, labor union organizations, 
or firms can efficiently function without a state of law in 
which law prevails over force. 
  They stress that the democratic regime advocated by the 
Haitian people under the aegis of the 1987 Constitution is the 
fundamental principle for running the state. They believe that 
constitutional, national institutions must resume their regular 
functioning while safeguarding democratic principles as their 
contribution toward a solution to the crisis. They further 
indicate that it is urgent to compel all political 
decisionmakers and concerned authorities to seek, find, and put 
into action all constitutional elements, with a view toward a 
negotiated, definitive solution to resolving the crisis and 
lifting the embargo. 
  They add that the employers' associations and the Haitian 
labor union sector will begin negotiations to define some new 
rules for the socioeconomic game, to stimulate business dynamism 
and promotion of workers in a system oriented toward reboosting 
production of the national economy with the building of adequate 
industrial and commercial infrastructures.

toward peace. Camacho Solis said that during the peace talks in 
Chiapas the proposals presented by the EZLN [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] and the Indian groups will be honored because 
the dialogue has political foundations. [sentence as heard] 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We have agreed on the date 
for the peace talks. Next Sunday, the movement of delegates 
will begin. Bishop Samuel Ruiz and I will be traveling Sunday 
morning to the various areas where there is an EZLN presence, 
and will be accompanying the delegates to the city in Chiapas 
State where talks for peace and reconciliation will begin the 
following day at 1100. 
  We all want to begin real negotiations. The peace talks can 
be one of two things: one, simply an opportunity to report 
problems or present political programs; the other, an 
opportunity to express views regarding the situation in Chiapas 
and the country, and also to advance in negotiations that could 
eventually lead to the end of hostilities, and hence to peace 
and reconciliation. We must all choose between those two 
options: Do we want this simply to be a forum to report 
problems, or do we want to make this an opportunity to build 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and in the country. I am 
totally committed to the second option. 
  I have come here and will go to the forum to listen and to 
learn. We have all learned a lot. We will also go to the talks 
with the clear purpose of facilitating the end of hostilities. 
In other words, the issue here is that we could not attain 
peace if someone tried to force the EZLN into accepting a 
solution that is not dignified. That is not the way to build 
peace. The only possibility is respecting the proposals, listen 
to them, discuss them, propose other things. The position I 
will present will be the one I perceive as best for the 
interests of the Mexican State, not of part of the 
administration. It must reflect the various interests and 
opinions, as well as the concerns, reports, and proposals that 
the EZLN will present toward a possible political agreement that 
can be built as time permits. 
  There are two options: either we simply meet to mention our 
problems, or we meet to sign a peace agreement. I have 
perceived that the EZLN, which at the beginning was probably not 
ready for a change under the political conditions that prevailed 
after 10 January, today has shown us through decisions like the 
ones it adopted yesterday that it is interested in coming to the 
negotiating table not only to present its political positions, 
but also to open the possibility of a real dialogue that can 
lead to dignified peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified studio announcer and Reporter Juan </F>
Carlos Atoyo; from the "Vector 21" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] sent to all party presidential candidates and to members 
of the political parties an invitation to participate in the 
meeting -- the initiation of the peace dialogue. The EZLN 
argues that their participation is a matter of interest to them, 
as one of these candidates will be president of the Republic. 
The EZLN indicated they want the presidential candidates to 
make a commitment to respect the agreements that might be 
reached with the current Mexican Government. Some presidential 
candidates have already replied that they will attend the 
meeting while others will do so through delegates. 
  Now, back to the communique sent last night by members of 
the 
Indian revolutionary clandestine committee, the EZLN General 
Command, to the presidential candidates of National Action Party 
[PAN]; Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]; Party of the 
Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party [PFCRN]; Labor Party [PL]; Authentic Party 
of the Mexican Revolution [PARM]; Mexican Green Ecologist Party; 
and the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]. The UNO [National 
Opposition Union] was not mentioned because it is not registered. 
  We now go to Congress where Reporter Juan Carlos Atoyo went 
to obtain the so-called opposition party's response to the EZLN 
invitation. 
  [Atoyo] The presidential candidates from the PRI, PARM, 
Mexican Green Ecologist Party, PL, and PFCRN, have already 
accepted the EZLN invitation to attend or to send delegates to 
the encounter with Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation, in Chiapas. Meanwhile, the PPS 
rejected the invitation and the PAN will issue its response 
through its national executive committee which is analyzing the 
EZLN invitation. 
  [Announcer] At first, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos [PAN 
candidate] had stated that he considered this invitation to be 
inconvenient. 
  [Atoyo] That is right. From the beginning, Diego Fernandez 
de Cevallos said the invitation was inconvenient, nevertheless, 
he left this decision to be made by his party's national 
executive committee. This has also been confirmed. 
  I will go one by one on what each political party said: PRD 
candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano said he accepted this 
invitation as this guarantees continuity in the commitments to 
be made during the pacification dialogue in Chiapas. When 
disclosing his candidate's reply, PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo 
said the following: 
  [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] This is an invitation addressed 
to the party candidates. I have consulted with our candidate, 
Engineer Cardenas, who is in favor, as I am, of accepting the 
invitation. Of course, I have called for a meeting of the party 
executive committee to define the terms of our participation and 
to appoint our representative. [end recording] 
  [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PARM candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said 
he officially accepted the invitation. Nevertheless, he sent a 
message to the EZLN to issue a personal and direct invitation 
for him to directly accept. In the interim, the PAN said that 
in a few hours it will disclose its position. Here is what PAN 
deputy candidate Gabriel Jimenez Remus said: 
  [Begin Jimenez recording] From a positive point of view, 
this 
invitation is of interest. Theoretically speaking, no one knows 
who will be the winner on 21 August. It is obvious that the 
EZLN needs to talk to or engage in a dialogue with the 
presidential candidates. I have no doubt the actions that the 
federal government takes and the participation of the diverse 
commissions will lead to the adoption of emergency actions to 
benefit Chiapas. There is no doubt, however, that these actions 
will have a bearing on the coming administration. [end recording] 
  [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PL candidate Cecilia Soto said that the 
EZLN invitation was another sign of this armed group's goodwill. 
Soto said she accepted the invitation but it would be her 
party's leadership that would decide if she would attend 
personally or if a delegation would be sent. 
  In the interim, PPS candidate Marcela Lombardo declined this 
invitation outright. Lombardo said that above all she did not 
accept the invitation because she did not agree with the 
attitude assumed by the EZLN to take up arms to solve diverse 
problems. Meanwhile, the UNO members indicated they had no 
comment to make given that their candidate has not been invited 
to the dialogue. 
  [Atoyo] In another turn of events, today during a meeting 
of the Chamber of Deputies' permanent commission, the Chiapas 
issue undoubtedly had to be brought up. The debate concentrated 
on permanent attacks between the PRI and the PRD. The first to 
take the podium was PRI Deputy Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo who 
launched severely criticized the PRD. Gaza Galindo said that 
the PRD has called on the EZLN to form an alliance to struggle; 
it speaks about laws and then turns around and supports the use 
of weapons to achieve goals, she noted. After indicating that 
the call to violence is a way of violating the peace and 
democracy agreement signed by all the presidential candidates, 
Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo challenged the PRD members as follows: 
  [Begin Gaza Galindo recording] They [PRD] want to break the 
political agreement signed by all the political forces. This 
implicitly means: Either they accept we have won on 21 August 
or there will be violence. They will get involved [word 
indistinct] through the armed struggle. All of these comments 
have been made by their top party leaders, who appear to take as 
their own a declaration of war; the EZLN's declaration was one 
of war. To Mexico's good fortune, this declaration seems to 
have been left behind. Is the PRD taking over this declaration 
of war as its own? What is this all about? Does this mean that 
the PRD will become the EZLN's political arm? Or does this mean 
that the EZLN becomes the armed body of the PRD? [end recording] 
  Afterward, PRD Deputy Jose de Jesus Martinez Campos launched 
his reply. Martinez Campos said that his party's call for the 
EZLN members to join the party seeks to incorporate them into 
the struggle through democratic means, by granting them 
representation. The PRD deputy said they had the right to their 
differences but to talk of the situation that could arise on 21 
August if the votes are not respected has serious implications, 
as this is closely tied to the Chiapas case. 
  [Begin Martinez Campos recording] If we do not guarantee 
that 
the election will be honest, that votes will be respected and 
well counted, that these issues can be discussed, the outcome of 
these 1994 elections will not be legitimate. Then, there will 
not be an EZLN but many civilian outbreaks and maybe unwanted 
violent outbreaks if this right is not guaranteed to be secure. 
[end recording] 
  [Atoyo] This is what happened today at the Chamber of 
Deputies during the session of the Congress of the Union 
permanent commission's session and the political parties' 
reaction to the EZLN invitation to participate in the first 
dialogue of the special commission for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas with Manuel Camacho Solis.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Mexican elections 
scheduled for 21 August 1994. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, led a meeting in Mexico 
City to discuss his campaign funding. PRI President Fernando 
Ortis Arana swore in the members of the party's national and 
state funding commissions. Colosio told the commission members 
that "the people are right to reject waste, mismanagement, and 
the splurging of money, as they offend the people, given the 
current social situation." The party plans to spend less than 
the government- imposed ceiling of 134 million new pesos and 
will not use public funds or property. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Colosio has proposed a five-point program to rescue Indians 
throughout the country from the neglect and discrimination they 
have always suffered. The program, among other things, reforms 
the judicial system, protects Indian property, and provides 
education and training for Indians. (Mexico City Canal 13 
Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  The Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, has announced a 
series of demonstrations at the Zocalo in Mexico City to promote 
an extraordinary session of the Chamber of Deputies to discuss 
electoral reforms. Although no dates were given, the first 
event will be a 100-hour march, followed by a 500 [number as 
heard] km run around the legislature buildings. (Mexico City 
Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate for the PRD, 
went to Constitution Square to participate in the so-called "100 
Hours for Democracy" march, which his party organized to demand 
electoral code reforms. He told reporters that political will 
alone is not enough to ensure a better election process. He 
said that talks between the Government Secretariat and political 
parties on electoral changes continue. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  The so-called 100 Hours for Democracy march ended on 13 
February. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, 
walked the final laps with party members. He said the solution 
to the Chiapas conflict lies in "the land distribution system. 
To ensure a long lasting solution, the country's peasants must 
be sure they have the right to claim and posses land of their 
own." He added that certain principles must be included in the 
Constitution "to recognize the individual political, social, and 
economic rights of the peasant communities and their 
inhabitants. He gave the government 10 days to respond to the 
party's call for extraordinary congressional sessions to discuss 
this issue and electoral code reforms. (Mexico City Canal 13 
Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate for 
the National Action Party, PAN, met with a group of 
demonstrators on their way to the Los Pinos Presidential 
Residence to demand the removal of several municipal officials. 
He took the opportunity to criticize media coverage of his 
campaign and asked for the Mexican voters to vote decidedly. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  PAN Presidential Candidate Fernandez de Cevallos began a 
two-day tour to Jalisco State on 11 February. He visited the 
San Juan de Dios marketplace in Guadalajara, where he met with 
rival vendors and spoke to them about pluralism in a democracy. 
Fernandez de Cevallos plans to meet with cattle breeders, 
farmers, and students. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0435 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said on 13 February that all 
those party members who opposed his presidential nomination now 
support him. "I know, and I always knew, how much it hurt 
certain party members when I won the nomination," he pointed 
out. "I also know that those same party members now support 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos in spite of Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos, because it is the PAN's democratic process at work." 
In a 30-minute speech in a low income neighborhood in Mexico 
City, he rejected the use of punishment votes and criticized 
those who vote out of fear. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos met on Tuesday 15 February with 
Iberoamerican University students in Mexico City in a packed 
auditorium. Fernandez announced the demise of the current 
Mexican political system and denounced the corruption, lies, and 
vested interests that have led to the social and political 
neglect of millions of Mexicans. "The stability of the Mexican 
State," he said, "has not been based on a fair and democratic 
social order because corruption and lies have prevailed..." 
(Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0030 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  Cecilia Soto, the presidential candidate for the Labor 
Party, 
PL, toured Aguascalientes on 8 February. She pointed out that 
there are several agreements that must still be reached among 
the political parties to ensure a clean and honest election. 
She stressed that the election process is the time to fight 
abstention. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 
GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  PL Candidate Soto told workers in Guanajuato that the 
party's 
platform is different and offers a new option for the working 
class. Before ending her tour she witnessed the signing of an 
alliance agreement between independent farmers and workers and 
the PL. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 
12 Feb 94) 
  Cecilia Soto says that clean elections in August can only 
be guaranteed through the reformation of the Electoral Law. She 
agreed with PRD candidate Cardenas that if the government's 
electoral policies are not reformed the people will seek 
solutions through the use of force. Soto also denounced the 
alleged proselytizing of Santiago Onate, Mexico's consul in the 
United states, who met with Mexican residents in Los Angeles to 
explain the positions held by the ruling party and candidate 
Colosio on several national matters, including Chiapas. (Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0030 15 Feb 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, the presidential candidate for the 
Mexican Green Ecologist Party, PVEM, kicked off his campaign for 
the State of Guanajuato at a rally held at an Indian 
reservation. "We must reconsider the way we deal with the 
native population all over the country," he said, "and recognize 
them as our true origin, care for them, protect them, and offer 
them the same opportunities other groups have." (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  PVEM Presidential Candidate Torres stressed the need for 
extraordinary congressional sessions to discuss electoral 
reforms, including article 82, with which his party does not 
agree. He said that those candidates who spend more than the 
imposed spending ceiling should be punished strictly, and not 
with what seem more like traffic fines. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  Marcela Lombardo, the presidential candidate for the Popular 
Socialist Party, PPS, toured Baja California, where she met with 
authorities of the Binational Human Rights Center, located at El 
Bordo, a well-known illegal crossing point into the United 
States. She talked to several people planning to cross and asked 
them to reconsider their decision. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  PPS Presidential Candidate Marcela Lombardo continued her 
campaign on 13 February in Baja California. There she demanded 
that Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz stay out of the Chiapas 
negotiations. She said that it is evident that the leaders of 
the Chiapas rebels are not Indians and, therefore, do not 
respond to Indian interests. She also reaffirmed support for 
legalizing abortion to prevent the many deaths produced by 
clandestine abortion clinics. She said that the real enemy to 
beat in August are the reactionaries and the Yankees. (Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 
Feb 94) 
  Presidential candidate for the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party, Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, campaigned in 
Chihuahua. He held coordination meetings with party members and 
chatted with the press on 11 February. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 12 Feb 94) 
  Cardenist Front Candidate Talamantes said on 13 February 
that 
it would be naive to believe holding special congressional 
sessions and reforming the electoral code will do any good. He 
pointed at political balance in the congress and the little time 
left for such significant debates. He said the Cardenists are 
in favor of the changes, but now is not the time. (Mexico City 
Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  Alvaro Perez Trevino, the presidential candidate for the 
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, PARM, took his 
campaign to Tlaxcala on 13 February. There he forecasted that 
his party will be the second strongest party in the country. He 
criticized the government's agricultural relief program saying 
it offers no long term solutions and benefits PRI farmers. A 
former PRI member, Trevino called NAFTA a way of bringing 
disloyal competition for Mexican products. He met with farmers 
and party members. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  The Federal Electoral Institute has reminded all political 
parties to file a copy of their government platform. The 
Electoral Code establishes this as one of the requirements for 
registering presidential candidates. The institute called on 
candidates and parties in general to be respectful of the rights 
of third parties. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish 10 Feb 94)

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Finance Secretary 
Pedro Aspe Armella announced that during the current year Mexico 
will earmark 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 
servicing its external and internal debts, which up until five 
years ago absorbed up to 18 percent of the GDP. 
  The finance secretary indicated that while five years ago an 
amount equivalent to 18 percent of the GDP was funneled into 
servicing external and internal debts, only 2 percent will be 
used during 1994 for the same purposes. 
  The announcement was made during a visit to the cities of 
Durango in the northern State of Durango, Culiacan in the 
northwestern State of Sinaloa, and Hermosillo in the 
northwestern State of Sonora. Aspe Armella reiterated that the 
federal government plans to continue with its policy of strict 
fiscal discipline, public finance equilibrium, cutting 
inflation, and encouraging productivity in order to accomplish 
3-percent economic growth during the current year. 
  Last year the government's objective was to achieve economic 
growth of not less than 2.9 percent, but according to estimates 
by some experts GDP growth was barely between 0.5 and 1.0 
percent. At any rate, Aspe Armella indicated that the government 
is determined to augment productivity. 
  Public finance equilibrium, Aspe Armella stated, will 
provide 
the government with sufficient resources to support the 
agriculture sector through the Direct Agriculture Support 
Program in order to raise agriculture productivity and encourage 
business through tax breaks. [as received]

  [Text] San Salvador, 15 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) today said the government 
was "cynical" because it criticized the latest report on the 
human rights situation in El Salvador. The report was prepared 
by Pedro Nikken, an independent UN human rights expert. 
  Juan Ramon Medrano, the official spokesman of the former 
guerrilla movement, stated at a news conference: "It seems to us 
that the position of several officials, who said that Nikken did 
not come to the country to verify the information in his report, 
is a bit cynical." 
  In the document, which was presented at the UN Human Rights 
Commission meeting in Geneva, Nikken expressed his concern over 
the deterioration of human rights in El Salvador, adding that 
the pace of compliance with the peace agreement "unfortunately 
has weakened. 
  Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria challenged the report 
and strongly criticized Nikken. According to the minister, 
Nikken prepared the report without visiting the country. 
Nikken, however, recently stated he was unable to visit the 
country because Salvadoran immigration authorities had not 
processed his entry permit. 
  The FMLN's Medrano pointed out that "the government was the 
one that blocked Nikken's visit," and he added that the report 
had been prepared with information provided by UN officials who 
are in El Salvador. Medrano said, "The fundamental aspect and 
also what causes more apprehension is that the report 
underscores the existence of armed groups with political 
objectives, as the government calls them, or `death squads' if 
you talk in plain Salvadoran Spanish." He added that up until 
now, authorities have not solved the cases of 40 FMLN members 
who have been murdered since the peace agreements were signed in 
January 1992. "Furthermore, three FMLN directorate members were 
also murdered and those cases have not been solved either, even 
though there was initial evidence," the FMLN spokesman observed. 
  In his report, Nikken asserted that in 1993, the practice of 
torture has claimed more victims in the country and that 
"arbitrary arrests continue on a regular basis." 
  Meanwhile, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Salavarria requested in Geneva last week, that UN human rights 
observers be withdrawn from El Salvador because of the 
"advances" made after the conclusion of the civil war. However, 
FMLN Adjunct Coordinator Marcos Jimenez stated, "The UN report 
is an obstacle for the government currently because it shows 
that the human rights issue must continue in the UN agenda in 
Geneva." The FMLN leaders said the human rights situation in 
the country was "serious." 
  FMLN spokesman Medrano also condemned the murders of two 
leaders of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] (governing 
rightist party), which were perpetuated in separate locations by 
unidentified people last Saturday. He likewise censured the 
attack against an Arena deputy in San Salvador last week. He 
said: "We condemn these events with the same energy with which 
we censured the murder of our members. We demand a thorough 
investigation of these crimes to ensure that they will not be 
used to generate further confrontation and to show that the FMLN 
party had nothing to do with them." He added that if any FMLN 
member had participated in those crimes "the entire weight of 
the law must fall of him because the FMLN Directorate and 
members are on the road to peace." 
  The FMLN will participate in the first International Peace 
Culture Forum to be inaugurated in San Salvador tomorrow. It 
will be represented by a commission headed by FMLN General 
Coordinator Shafik Handal. 
  The FMLN leaders criticized the government for refusing to 
comply with several points of the peace agreements, mainly those 
related to the implementation of programs for the social reentry 
of former FMLN and Army combatants, the deployment of the new 
Civilian National Police in the country, the transfer of lands, 
and the reforms to the judicial system.

  [Text] Santa Ana, El Salvador, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- General 
Luis Alonso Discua, the Honduran defense minister, said today 
that separating the police from the Armed Forces and placing it 
under civilian command is the "right" idea. He warned, however, 
that this "should be done some time in the future." 
  The [Honduran] military leader, his Salvadoran colleague 
Gen. 
Humberto Corado, and Gen. Julio Fidencio Otzoy, the Guatemalan 
deputy defense minister, were present today for a special 
ceremony honoring 210 disabled veterans from the three Central 
American nations. During the event, the veterans received 
artificial limbs donated by a U.S. humanitarian organization. 
  When asked about the project that would separate the police 
force and the Armed Forces, Discua said that "the right thing 
would be to do this some time in the future," because "it is no 
easy task. The whole transformation process will require 
resources, which are scarce in our countries." 
  In commenting about the recent report on the state of human 
rights in Honduras, issued by Leo Valladares Lanza, the national 
human rights commissioner, the Honduran minister said that the 
document is "a preliminary report that should be examined 
objectively." The report, entitled "The Facts Speak for 
Themselves," lists 184 cases of missing persons during the 
1980's. 
  Discua said that "there were some such cases in the past, 
which occurred under the specific circumstances of the time. 
There has always been a struggle between the officially 
constituted power and the subversive movements. The bad thing, 
however, would be to be partial about the situation, because the 
two fought against each other and there are victims on both 
sides." 
  Gen. Corado said the new atmosphere of peace in the Central 
American countries, which have overcome their armed conflicts, 
calls for reorganization within the Armed Forces's. The civil 
war in El Salvador ended in 1992, which brought about a 
reduction in the 66,000-strong Armed Forces to less that half. 
In Nicaragua, where the fighting ceased in 1990, the Sandinist 
People's Army cut its 80,000 force to less than 17,000. "We 
should not see armies as having only war as their mission. We 
were not born from war. We were born with the republic; we have 
participated in every stage of the nation's development; and our 
work is still valuable," he added. 
  Corado said the efforts of the Salvadoran Government and 
UNESCO to carry out the First Forum on Peace Culture are "worthy 
of praise." Representatives of 14 countries that have endured 
armed conflicts will meet this week in San Salvador, along with 
representatives from 40 other nations participating as observers. 
  Guatemala is the only country where civil war still 
persists. 
There is hope the war, which began in 1960, will end this year 
following negotiations that are scheduled to begin in March in 
Mexico.

<F P=106> [From the "Early News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has denied his 
government needs to be pressured into holding free and open 
general elections on 20 March. During his usual Monday news 
conference, Cristiani said he shared the Catholic Church's 
criticism of the political parties' proposals which, so far, 
have been vague and demagogic. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] I agree with San Salvador 
Archbishopric representatives who say the elections must be open 
and free. I disagree with the alleged need for pressure. I 
believe we all want the elections to be clean, free, honest and 
crystal clear. If something is brewing that could hinder the 
honesty of the elections, it should be disclosed, because I see 
no need for any pressure whatsoever. [end recording] 
  According to Cristiani, the presence of 911 UN observers and 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal delegates will guarantee the honesty 
of the 20 March elections. He also described as unnecessary the 
trip by a Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] 
delegation to UN Headquarters to seek guarantees for the 
fulfillment of the peace agreements. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] I do not know what the FMLN is 
going to do at the United Nations. Any time they have a problem 
they have to go abroad to level complaints. We are all 
Salvadorans, and there is no need to go abroad to level 
complaints. The rescheduling the FMLN talks about is permanent. 
[sentence as heard] We are trying to fulfill the agreements as 
soon as possible, and to do so we must establish gradually dates 
and deadlines. It is a permanent effort by Onusal [UN Observers 
for El Salvador], the FMLN, and the government. [end recording] 
  Cristiani said among the delayed peace agreements are the 
total deployment of the National Civilian Police, the 
transference of lands, and the reformation of the judicial 
system.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Salvadoran elections, 
scheduled for 20 March 1994. 
  Some 7,518 voting tables will be set up in the country for 
the scheduled 20 March elections. Electoral official Marco 
Antonio Castro stated that authorities are currently working to 
prepare the material that the Election Boards will use in 262 
municipalities. Authorities will stage a preliminary election 
before 20 March to identify problems that could arise on 
election day and adopt the necessary measures to prevent them. 
(San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 10 Feb 94) 
  Leaders of political parties on 10 February signed a new 
pact 
of honor at the regional office of the Human Rights Division of 
the UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal. The leaders of 
political parties in San Salvador "pledged to carry out a decent 
campaign by avoiding verbal attacks and violence in the days 
preceding the elections." (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in 
Spanish 0300 GMT 11 Feb 94) 
  The Salvadoran Catholic Church on 13 February criticized the 
nine presidential candidates because voters do not know their 
programs for resolving the country's problems. In his Sunday's 
homily, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez lamented that "only five 
weeks before the elections, the proposals of the different 
parties remain vague and the enthusiasm of voters limited." He 
stated that the violence in the country is "very dangerous," 
adding that parties should present their programmatic proposals 
to voters. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1956 GMT 13 Feb 94) 
  During the last 10 months the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, 
TSE, has issued 516,241 voting cards throughout the country, it 
has been officially reported. TSE Magistrate Jaime Romero 
Ventura said that the people are turning out massively to 
request their voting cards. Romero explained that "the card 
issuing process has increased considerably in the last few days 
thanks to the mega operations" carried out by the TSE. The 
official concluded by saying that the last day for issuing 
voting cards is 12 March. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in 
Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 14) 
  Fidel Chavez Mena, Christian Democratic Party, PDC, 
presidential candidate, has called for the freezing of prices of 
the basic market basket for six months so as to improve the 
purchasing power of the population. Chavez Mena also offered to 
create 20,000 jobs every month if he wins the presidency. He 
said: "We offer to create 20,000 jobs every month, in both 
rural and urban areas." Chavez Mena concluded that he reached 
agreements with productive sectors to increase jobs. (San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 11 Feb 94) 
  Armando Calderon Sol, Nationalist Republican Alliance, 
Arena, 
presidential candidate, has termed Chavez Mena's proposal to 
create 20,000 jobs monthly "ridiculous." He recalled that when 
Chavez Mena held the post of planning minister the economy 
failed to register growth. Calderon Sol stated: "The 
Salvadoran people are well aware of the fact that poverty 
increased when Chavez Mena served as planning minister." The 
progovernment presidential candidate noted the poor performance 
of Chavez Mena at the head of the Planning Ministry. (San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 11 Feb 94)

  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The official 
Peace Commission (Copaz) of Guatemala has requested that 
President Ramiro de Leon and Defense Minister General Mario 
Enriquez not change the three top military officers who are part 
of the negotiating team in the talks with the guerrillas. 
  Copaz President Hector Rosada today denied a local media 
report that the two generals and a colonel were going to be 
replaced before the next meeting with the guerrillas, which will 
be held in Mexico soon. The appointed officers are General 
Marco Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, current deputy chief of defense 
general staff and Copaz member under the previous government; 
General Victor Manuel Argueta, commander of the Honor Guard; and 
Colonel Victor Manuel Ventura, director of the Polytechnic 
School. 
  Rosada asserted that the defense minister had reported his 
intentions to replace one of the military representatives for 
health reasons and not "to find new participation mechanisms." 
The sociologist [Rosada] who met last week with the UN mediator 
in the peace process said: "Yesterday I asked President Ramiro 
de Leon Carpio and Gen. Enriquez not to change them because they 
are doing a good job." 
  The peace delegation is chaired by Rosada who is the author 
of the peace proposal presented by de Leon last year. The 
proposal includes three military and three civilians who will 
negotiate the end of the armed conflict that was initiated in 
1960. This is the only armed conflict that prevails in Central 
America.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Bayardo Arce, a member of the Sandinist National 
Liberation Front [FSLN] National Directorate, has presented to 
the public the FSLN Program Commission's official proposal, 
which will be discussed in May during the extraordinary meeting 
of the FSLN Congress. 
  According to Arce, the commission has worked on the basis of 
what was agreed upon during the FSLN's first congress, held in 
1991. Then, the delegates demanded the redrafting of four 
aspects of the FSLN program. 
  The aspects that were changed in the FSLN's program platform 
are those related to the FSLN's position on relations with the 
United States, the Nicaraguan Government, the land issue, and 
its social role as a party. 
  The presentation of the document was preceded by a strong 
debate on these and other topics that clearly established that 
there are, at least, three clearly defined different tendencies 
within FSLN ranks. 
  According to Arce, this document is only a proposal, but it 
is the official proposal and will be discussed as such by the 
party members. "The other documents presented will complement 
the discussion," Arce added. 
<H5>  Relations With the United States </H5>
  Regarding the FSLN's relations with the U.S. Government, the 
document suggests "establishing a new relation between the 
United States and Nicaragua in which mutual interests will 
prevail." 
  According to the document, the relations with the United 
States consist of two essential components: Nicaragua's 
unrestricted respect for the principles of self-determination 
and noninterference in other states' internal affairs, and the 
United States' unequivocal respect for the Nicaraguan people's 
sovereign and democratic decisions. 
  These aspects are related to the remarks made to the 
Sandinist government regarding its support for Central America's 
revolutionary movements and the history of U.S. military and 
political interventions in Nicaragua. 
  The document also supports the incorporation of Nicaragua 
and 
Central America into NAFTA. 
  The programs commission coordinator has denied this part of 
the document is influenced by the belief that it is necessary to 
be in good standing with the United States if one wants to be a 
true electoral alternative. 
  The second aspect, related to the position with the 
government, concerns the outright rejection of a government 
similar to the Somozist. In addition, it deals with the fight 
against corruption and favors an honest public administration 
and obedience to the Constitution and bylaws. 
<H5>  "Honest Opposition" </H5>
  To face the crisis and reactivate the country, the document 
proposes an honest strategy against the government policies that 
prostrate the country. 
  Concerning the phrase "honest opposition," Arce has said 
these two elements will have to be discussed in depth and 
outlined by the congress. 
  "The only way to overcome the vulnerability of the 
democratic 
process and ensure its stability is to base it on a nonexclusive 
economic and social project in the economic democratization," he 
has said, adding "the state's economic policies should be 
consistent with this objective." 
<H5>  The Electoral Way </H5>
  Regarding taking political power, the document states 
clearly: "For the FSLN, elections are the only valid means to 
accede to the government. Consistent with our democratic 
commitment, we hereby declare there is no room or justification 
for the current armed struggle in Nicaragua." 
  Regarding the controversial property issue, the document 
proposes truly novel points that will surely lead to very 
intense debates in the FSLN. 
  "The FSLN respects and defends the stability of private 
property. Similarly, the FSLN encourages the development of all 
forms of cooperative, associative, and community property, 
regarding these forms as an expression of the socialization 
process." 
  Consequently, the document proposes "a commitment with the 
country's economic and social agents to face the property issue 
problem being linked to political stability." 
  The document also proposes an immediate legalization of 
workers and peasants' property by allocating the property to 
them and to compensate fairly "the sectors that have been 
suffering from the uneven distribution." 
  Regarding the composition as a party, the program proposes 
assimilating organically the societal makeup, which is being 
defined as plural. [sentence as published] 
  Finally, the document extends an invitation to define the 
policy regarding the various social sectors, not only to social 
classes. 
  Arce has said this is the official proposal, which should be 
enriched in a debate that opened long before the official 
documents were presented. 
  The proposal on the statutes is scheduled to be presented 
this week, Commander Arce has reported.

<F P=106> [Letter issued by the National Directorate of the Sandinist </F>
National Liberation Front in Managua on 14 February] 
  [Text] The Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], in 
light of the threat from U.S. authorities to expel Nicaraguan 
citizens currently living in the United States, firmly backs the 
defense of the legal permanence of these Nicaraguan countrymen 
in U.S. territory. 
  The FSLN believes that one reason for the migration of 
Nicaraguan citizens to the United States was the war of 
aggression financed, directed, and organized by the U.S. 
Government against the Sandinist Government. 
<H5>  Exodus Promoted </H5>
  The U.S. Government in those days encouraged an exodus of 
skilled Nicaraguans to the United States. The effect of that 
policy was to subject a large number of Nicaraguans to a 
vulnerable migratory condition. 
  Our countrymen, seduced by offers of well being and 
democracy 
in the United States, pay their taxes and contribute to the 
economy with their work, whether they are aware of it or not. 
However, their legal vulnerability makes them second-class 
citizens, subjects them to low wages, and leaves them without 
the social protection afforded other immigrants who, for 
different reasons, emigrate to that country. 
<H5>  Object of Propaganda </H5>
  We believe it is totally unfair that citizens who have lived 
in the United States for many years, after being used as 
propaganda and cheap labor, are being pressured to leave that 
country. Furthermore, by virtue of their years of residency, our 
countrymen are protected by the rights they have acquired in 
accordance with U.S. laws. 
  The most conservative forces in U.S. society and "the 
establishment" [previous word in English] bolster xenophobic 
measures against Nicaraguan immigrants, thus universalizing the 
phenomenon observed in other parts of the world. Such actions 
must be rejected by the Clinton administration, which has the 
human rights doctrine as its main political banner. 
  Our Nicaragua of today is going through one of the worst 
moments of its economic crisis. The high unemployment rate and 
the stringent pressure from the international financial agencies 
(IMF-World Bank) preclude any thought of a possible economic 
reactivation that may bring hopes of progress and work for our 
countrymen. 
  The FSLN calls on the National Assembly and all the 
country's 
political and social forces to support our fellow countrymen. 
  The FSLN demands that the Nicaraguan Government defend the 
rights of these Nicaraguans, who are threatened with imminent 
deportation that implies familial and social instability. 
  The FSLN believes that the Clinton administration has an 
opportunity to exercise its human rights policy and to remain 
separate from the more conservative forces of his country that 
encourage xenophobic feelings.

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Cirias; from the "National Newscast" -- </F>
passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] German Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer, who 
has been visiting our country since 13 February, said today 
after meeting with President Violeta de Chamorro that German 
cooperation will continue. He added that efforts are being made 
to negotiate Nicaragua's debt with that European country. 
  In the meeting held this morning between FRG Deputy Foreign 
Minister Helmut Schaefer and President Violeta de Chamorro, both 
officials discussed the country's current situation. The German 
deputy foreign minister said that the objective of his visit is 
to corroborate that the friendship between the two countries 
continues and that Germany is making efforts to maintain its 
political presence here. 
  [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "I 
have 
known the president for many years. We maintain a friendship 
and I have been positively impressed by this meeting. We 
discussed bilateral relations between Germany and Nicaragua. 
She delivered to me a message for the German president and we 
have discussed ways to solve the foreign debt problem. We have 
talked about German aid to Nicaragua and internal politics in 
Nicaragua." 
  Schaefer said that despite the financial difficulties facing 
Germany, efforts are being made to resolve the problem of 
Nicaragua's debt with that country, which totals $600 million. 
  [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "In 
general, I am optimistic we can reach a satisfactory agreement 
in the negotiations." 
  He confirmed that German aid totalling about $25 million 
will 
be maintained. 
  [Schaefer, in German fading into Spanish translation] "The 
German cooperation will be maintained. However, the German 
Economic Cooperation Ministry must make cutbacks in its budget. 
These cuts are fundamental in view of the economic situation in 
Europe and also in Germany. Unemployment in Germany has reached 
rates unheard of following World War II. 
  "However, cooperation and funds for cooperation will 
continue 
to flow, although no increase can be made. There will not be 
cutbacks or reductions. This is our objective and we will 
continue to work in this direction." 
  Since his arrival last night, the German deputy foreign 
minister announced he will meet with different Nicaraguan 
sectors. 
  [Sergio Mario Blandon, Nicaraguan deputy foreign cooperation 
minister] "It is a good opportunity to have the deputy foreign 
minister here. As you may recall, last December we received the 
visit of deputy minister (?Resvick). The constant visits of 
German ministers and deputy ministers signifies their interest 
in assisting our country." 
  At the Foreign Ministry, the renegotiation of the debt was 
also discussed. 
  [Jose Pallais, Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister] "We have 
insisted that the negotiation of this debt must be different. 
Special treatment should be given to the military debt in 
contrast with commercial aid or aid to support the balance of 
payments." 
  This is the fifth time Mr. Schaefer has visited Nicaragua, 
and today he was scheduled to meet with other government 
officials and members of political parties.

  [Text] Presidency Spokesman Dr. Danilo Lacayo confirmed 
today that he has tendered his resignation to President Chamorro. 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] I leave with affection and respect 
for the president to dedicate myself to other tasks. Wherever I 
may be, I will always cooperate with the national project, as I 
have stated in my letter of resignation. [end recording] 
  Dr. Lacayo appraised the government's performance during the 
past years. 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] The president of the Nicaraguan 
people has performed an enormous task by ending a war, entering 
a period of peace, and building such a difficult democracy. The 
president has done a great job. Obviously, this is not the 
most perfect government in the world, but we can say that this 
administration has given us hope for the first time. It has 
helped us to achieve reconciliation. Above all, the president 
of the Republic of Nicaragua is determined to build democratic 
values and institutions and -- as she has always said -- she is 
carrying out a mission. It is a difficult mission but, it is 
the mission that she was given. [end recording]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 23 
January 1994 on page 3 reports that leaders of the Independent 
Liberal Party for National Unity (PLIUN), the Central American 
Unionist Party (PUCA), and the National Justice Party (PJN) held 
a press conference on 18 January in order to announce that they 
are "joining forces." The parties' communique stated that they 
"...seek alternative viable solutions with a view toward 
Nicaraguans working together to implement these solutions." 
Party leaders invited Nicaraguans to participate in a project 
called "Unity for Change" which offers a "credible and 
trustworthy" program to create "a new political culture." Party 
leaders explained that the country suffers from "a lack of moral 
values, discredited political leaders, and the absence of 
concrete programs to solve its problems."

<F P=106> [Clarisse Buma report on interview with Foreign Minister Dr. </F>
S. Ch. Mungra in Paramaribo; date not given: "`The Recovery of 
the Surinamese Economy Should Limit Exodus'"] 
  [Text] Paramaribo -- In Suriname they are already saying 
jokingly: Will the last person to leave please switch off the 
lights. Will that person be President Venetiaan? Or the former 
Army Leader Bouterse perhaps? 
  It is estimated that last year another 10,000 Surinamese did 
not come back from a "holiday" in the Netherlands, like the year 
before. There seems to be no end to emigration. Many Surinamese 
are asking themselves in despair how long this can go on. The 
reasons why the Surinamese people decide to seek refuge abroad 
in massive numbers have varied: In 1975 it was uncertainty 
about independence, then it was the military government, and now 
it is the economic collapse. 
  Foreign Minister Dr. S. Ch. Mungra also has concerns about 
emigration. Not that Suriname will empty suddenly -- in 1992 
the General Statistical Office estimated that there were still 
420,000 inhabitants. It is above all the departure of the top 
management which causes him real concern. 
  "We are in the middle of an economic adjustment program," he 
said. "That means that purchasing power must be lost. That is 
a sacrifice. But many people do not want to wait for recovery. 
Our problem is that we want to consume like a western 
industrialized country but we produce like a Third World 
country. Unfortunately, we, the Surinamese, regardless of who 
is to blame, have been destroying our economy for the last 10 
years. Just think about the war here, which led to a drastic 
drop in exports." 
  The minister said that the distressing position of education 
also played a role. In addition to the problems with school 
transport and the regular strikes, lessons sometimes stop for 
weeks because a teacher has not returned from his holidays 
overseas. "That makes people leave too," he said. "They hope 
to be able to give their children a better education abroad." 
  The Netherlands is not open to immigration, according to a 
cabinet decision, and therefore The Hague is sticking by the 
visa requirement. In contrast, the Paramaribo has been calling 
for the free movement of people for years. 
  "Many Surinamese reason as follows: Once I have that visa, I 
will stay in the Netherlands," Mungra said. "But if you are 
free to travel, then the urge to stay is far less, because 
people know that they can always return to the Netherlands. And 
in my view the Netherlands can build in enough guarantees so 
that people do not stay unnecessarily." 
  Abolishing the visa requirement is not a point of discussion 
between the two countries: Their positions are diametrically 
opposed. "But I still think that special family links justify 
the free movement of people," he said. 
<H5>  Wage differences </H5>
  Despite all the optimism about the start of the Venetiaan 
Government, very few immigrants return with a bonus to Suriname. 
"The difference in salaries is too big," Mungra said. "We can 
never pay them what they earned in the Netherlands. Here a 
minister earns U.S. $150 , when the salary is converted. That 
is less than a cleaner receives in the Foreign Ministry in The 
Hague." 
  Figures from the Migration Institute in Paramaribo show 
that the number of people using the scheme annually has varied 
between 55 and 155 for years. Around half of them are on social 
security or receive a pension and therefore make no active 
contribution to constructing the country. It is also estimated 
that round 50 percent of the returning immigrants are back in 
the Netherlands after two years. 
  The minister wants to make a priority of giving upper 
management a salary bonus in hard Netherlands guilders. The 
money for this was to come from the development cooperation 
funding. "We want very much to prevent more management from 
leaving and encourage well-educated countrymen in the 
Netherlands to return," he said. "After all, it is they who 
sustain development. I do not expect any jealous faces in the 
Army and middle management: We have other support measures for 
them in prospect." 
  People were inclined solely to material welfare, Mungra 
said. 
"But welfare is not well-being," he added. "In the Netherlands 
everyone lives on top of one another, you have 1,001 rules and 
you have to work a whole year for 21 days under the Spanish sun. 
Here it is easy-going, there is space, a clean environment and 
there is fine weather every day." 
<H5>  Hopeless </H5>
  Although the crisis seems to appear more hopeless every day, 
the minister is strikingly optimistic about the chances of the 
tide turning. "First of all, we are busy with restoring and -- 
even more so -- maintaining the rule of law and democracy," he 
said. "Because of course those are also important for citizens. 
I cannot see any new dictatorial movements forming here. 
  ``Also I am hopeful that the development relationship with 
the Netherlands can be restored in the second half of this 
year,'' he said. "Then the industry fund can start up so that 
production gets going. That will cause an uplift in the 
economy. That would be an important psychological factor. 
  ``So far we have not been able to impose the price increases 
because the economic measures were not implemented 
simultaneously,'' he said. "You cannot make cutbacks first and 
only afterwards do something for the productive sector. But we 
can already see that a large number of investments are getting 
off the ground: The bauxite sector, the gold and wood sectors, 
and the oil refinery, which is to be ready in 1996. Also this 
year we will join Caricom, the Caribbean Community, with a 
market of 250 million people. You certainly cannot say that 
Suriname has done nothing to make its economy healthy." 
  Nevertheless the Netherlands, the Antilles, the United 
States, and neighboring French Guiana remain irresistibly 
attractive. Many people have plans to emigrate. But do 
Surinamese in the Netherlands get what they thought they would 
find? [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay through 17 February: 
  The Central Bank reported that the state registered a $654.2 
million deficit in the January-November 1993 period. This was 
the result of the public sector's nonfinancial deficit of $194.5 
million and the parafiscal deficit of $459.7 million. 
(Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 38) 
  The European-Argentine group Miniphone will invest $21 
million in the next 24 months on the installation of a mobile 
cellular telephone system nationwide. This service will benefit 
80 percent of the urban population and 70 percent of the rural. 
(Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 12) 
  The public sector's deficit increased $69 million in 
November 
1993, raising the cumulative deficit in the past 11 months to 
$152 million, more than 1 percent of the GDP. (Montevideo EL 
OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 10)

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Attorney General's Office is a clear example 
of the moral damage that corruption inflicts on the daily 
activities of Panamanians in civil matters, be they penal or 
administrative, Ruben Dario Carles stated. Carles is the 
presidential candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement, National Renewal Movement, and Civic Renewal Party. 
  "Not enough has been done to combat the corruption inherited 
from past regimes, since it is not enough to denounce them. 
Corruption continues to seriously harm the interests of the 
Treasury, government functions, and the majority of the people," 
the former comptroller general added. 
  Carles indicated that privileges, concessions, pacts, 
bribes, 
and the "play it smart" attitude are the norm for persons who 
corrupt others and for corrupt persons who are bleeding the 
state and the people who strive for a better country. "The 
multiplication of these illegal and criminal activities that 
range from fixing fines and bonds to drug trafficking and money 
laundering undermine a citizen's chance to obtain greater 
progress and freedom," he noted. [passage omitted] 
  According to the presidential candidate, "widespread" 
unemployment is another consequence of the corruption in the 
state bureaucracy, which has tentacles that reach the major 
public services and which does not meet the essential needs of 
all Panamanians for health, housing, transportation, 
communications, electricity, and water. 
  He said the inefficiency and deficiency of public services 
constitutes one of the clearest examples of the "prevalence of 
corruption" that feeds on institutionalized immunity through a 
series of provisions and laws that allow influence peddling, 
something that is a slap in the face of the people and prevents 
national and international investments.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections, 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. 
  During a political forum held on 9 February promoted by the 
Center for Latin American Studies, CELA, Ruben Blades, 
presidential candidate for the Papa Egoro Movement, MPE, said 
that the current government corruption in Panama fosters the 
"imperial arrogance" of the international financial 
institutions, IFI's, that for many years have disbursed 
million-dollar loans that have only benefited their promoters. 
He stressed that it is time to put an end to the dance of 
millions received through international credits supposedly to 
carry out social works, but which never reach the poor people. 
He added that those who pay the foreign debt obtain juicy 
profits in reward for their services. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 3A) 
  At the same forum organized by CELA and sponsored by the EC, 
MPE presidential candidate Ruben Blades said he favors revising 
the Labor Code, privatizing public services, and the withdrawal 
of U.S. troops from Panama. Blades criticized corruption in the 
government and private sectors, and proposed the 
decentralization of the state, the purging of public 
administration, and independence of the Judicial Branch. On the 
subject of the U.S. military presence, he said the 20 December 
1989 Just Cause military operation was not a "liberation, but an 
invasion." He added: "We have been clear. We believe in 
(Panama's) total demilitarization. That means the withdrawal of 
foreign troops from Panama." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA 
in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Meanwhile, Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for 
the 
Civic Renewal Party, the Nationalist Republican Movement, 
Molirena, and the National Renewal Movement, Morena, who was 
also present at the forum rejected Blades' assertions, saying it 
is "infamous" to say that the IFI's are paying commissions for 
foreign debt negotiations. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 
Feb 94 p 3A) 
  At the same forum, Carles said if elected he would resolve 
transportation, crime, garbage collection, and housing problems 
in the first 100 days of his administration. Carles described 
the Just Cause military operation as a "liberation," and 
announced that if elected president, on 9 May he will send three 
delegates to Washington to seek a new relationship with the 
United States. According to Carles, since Panama will remain 
under "the Pentagon's umbrella," he will demand export quotas 
for our agricultural and manufactured products in exchange for 
the U.S. military presence beyond the year 2000. He also said 
he will repress drug trafficking and money laundering, and that 
he favors the privatization of public services. (Panama City LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 11 Feb 94 p 1) 
  Presidential Candidate Carles traveled to Honduras on 14 
February to visit industrial zones in that country. In a 
communique, the coalition supporting Carles said that the 
creation of industrial zones is being studied as a means to 
reducing unemployment in Panama. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 14 Feb p 2) 
  Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery ruled 
out the possibility of holding "a second round of elections" 
after 8 May. He said the subject was discussed by the National 
Commission for Revising the Electoral Code, but was not 
approved. Christian Democratic Party Legislator Guillermo 
Cochez has questioned Article 255 of the Electoral Code, which 
according to him violates Article 172 of the Constitution, which 
establishes that the president of the republic must be elected 
"by a majority of votes," meaning that he must obtain 51 percent 
of the votes. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 10 
Feb p A-1) 
  On 16 February, the Electoral Tribunal will officially 
announce its final decision on whether to reconsider the 
acceptance of candidates for the Authentic Liberal Party who did 
not present their documents in time to register for the upcoming 
elections. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 
1A)
