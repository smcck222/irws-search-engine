  [Text] La Paz, 8 Feb (ANF) -- Social Communications 
Minister Hermann Antelo said today the fact that the government 
was unable to meet the hopes of the Bolivian people during the 
first six months of its administration is "quite explainable." 
  He said: "The hopes the population had on the administration 
of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada were so high when he was 
inaugurated last August that it was impossible to satisfy them 
all. Even if we brought in a magician to run the country, it 
would have been impossible to satisfy the demands immediately." 
  A recent poll by the Bolivian Catholic University, UCB, 
shows 
the people's confidence in the government is decreasing as the 
government administration goes on. This situation also affects 
President Sanchez de Lozada, but to a lesser degree. 
  Antelo said the first stage in any government is to bring 
order and make preparations. He added: "The harvest comes 
later. The people want immediate results; however, they also 
want immediate well-being, and that is impossible to do." 
  He added that government actions will be recognized when the 
people are able to see the results of the great measures for 
change being implemented and under debate in Congress. 
  Antelo said: "We understand the people's reaction. It is 
valid from their perspective. We believe we are doing out best 
to prepare the grounds for changing that perspective, not only 
in appearance but through the implementation of measures." 
  According to the UCB poll, 62 percent of those polled have a 
bad impression of the government. 
  Last October the bad impression was only 44.5 percent, which 
means that the discontent increased by 17.5 percent.

  [Text] La Paz, 7 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The government does 
not discard the possibility of buying land off the peasants who 
grow coca in the Chapare and Yungas, which are traditional coca 
zones, "as a means to finally eradicate all illegal trafficking 
in Bolivia." 
  Government Ministry sources told LOS TIEMPOS on 7 February 
that the project to buy land from the peasants was proposed by 
the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada during the 
latest meeting of the World Bank Consultative Group for Bolivia 
late last year. 
  The sources said: "This option was proposed by the 
negotiating commission that went to Washington to the 
international community as a start of the Zero Option project." 
  They said the administration is seriously studying the idea 
of buying from the thousands of peasants "their land" used for 
growing coca. 
  The sources added: "The offer of $2,000 for every hectare 
cleared of coca made by the previous government to Chapare 
peasants, with a bonus of $500 per tract of land cleared of coca 
is not an empty proposal." 
  The sources indicated that the government is willing to pay 
up to $2,500 per hectare of coca to each peasant. 
  They added: "This means a farmer with 5,000 hectares, for 
example, will have the possibility of getting approximately 
$10,000 per hectare for the land he puts up for sale." 
[sentence as published] 
  President Sanchez de Lozada decided to implement this 
project 
which was labeled "Zero Option" but the project is subject to 
international financing for its implementation in the 
medium-term.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In response to a request by the Guarani 
People's Assembly, PRESENCIA, a Catholic Church-owned, 
center-left daily led an investigative team into the Chaco 
region for a week in December to look into charges that 
approximately 10,000 Guarani Indians are held in virtual slavery 
on large estates. The team included a Congressional delegation 
composed of deputies Silvio Aramayo, of Guarani background, and 
Daniel Santalla. Its observations are contained in a special 
report published 16 January entitled "In the Footsteps of Kunta 
Kinte: `Roots' in the Southeast." 
  According to the report, it is estimated that between 40,000 
and 80,000 Guarani Indians live in the Bolivian Chaco 
departments of Santa Cruz, Tarija, and Chuquisaca. Of these, 
21,000 are "free" and live in Santa Cruz's Cordillera province. 
The 10,000 Guarani Indians in the Chuquisacan and Tarijan Chaco 
live and work in "medieval serfdom," the report says, as 
agricultural laborers on large estates. Their salaries--often 
paid in the form of food, clothing, and coca, or alcohol--are so 
low that the debts they incur to their bosses keep them tied to 
the estate until they die. Their debts are then passed on to the 
next generation, perpetuating the cycle of bondage. The report 
stresses that although indentured servitude, sharecropping, and 
other coercive labor practices were outlawed by the Agrarian 
Reform Act of 1953, and despite Bolivia's ratification in 1991 
of the International Labor Organization convention on 
"Indigenous and Tribal Populations," the Guarani people are 
generally unaware of their rights because most are 
non-Spanish-speaking and illiterate. The patriarchal system of 
the large landholdings gives the landlord absolute power over 
these Indians who are labeled "uncivilized, non-Christian 
nomads." The "buying and selling" of Indians also occurs: one 
boss just pays off an Indian's debts and acquires a new laborer. 
Some of the worst abusers of the system are the "work 
inspectors," government officials whose legal mandate is to 
protect and uphold the rights of agricultural laborers. Instead, 
these functionaries profit by the "capture, arrest, and return" 
of runaway Indians to the estates, claiming violation of work 
contracts signed. Some Indians are able to "buy their freedom" 
with the help of UNICEF and other nongovernmental organizations 
active in the region. Others manage to escape to "free lands" or 
to Argentina. 
  Confiscation of Indian land continues to be undertaken 
"legally" with the complicity of agrarian judges, the report 
charges. Methods by which landlords lay claim to their domains 
and force Guaranis off the land include introducing cattle onto 
traditional Indian land, accusing them of cattle theft, 
arresting them, and putting them on trial; and burning or 
cutting down their fruit trees. Landlords also encircle entire 
Guarani communities with barbed wire to lay claim to the Indians 
as their property. 
  During its tour of the region, the PRESENCIA team 
interviewed 
men and women who described aspects of their servitude and 
voiced their many complaints: the daily wage of 5 bolivianos 
(4.48 bs=$1.00) for men, 3 for women, for a 12- to 14-hour day 
six-day week (the average daily wage in that region is 10 
bolivianos for an eight-hour day); years of work without any 
money exchanging hands; bosses who cheat them by falsifying the 
amount of their debt; poor food; malnutrition among children and 
a high mortality rate; and overwork of and lack of education for 
their children. 
  In past years, the report continues, the Guarani people's 
awareness of their status has changed perceptibly through the 
efforts of the Guarani People's Assembly which now represents 
approximately 80,000 Guaranis in Bolivia. The organization hopes 
to expand its membership to Guaranis in Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Argentina. Programs on their behalf are now better known, such 
as the Bilingual Intercultural Project being developed in 
Cordillera and the literacy campaign launched in 1992. The 
Guaranis in Cordillera, Santa Cruz Department, are better 
organized than those in other departments and have been able to 
hang on to their lands in the face of constant threats. Their 
organizational structure revolves around the five pillars of the 
PISET program (Production, Infrastructure, Education, Land, and 
Territory) which is Supported by various government and 
nongovernmental organizations. In addition, the organization 
Tierra has been able to buy lands and relocate escaped Guarani 
communities on them. Finally, the report concludes, the Guarani 
people are encouraged to denounce the injustices committed 
against them, because they now have a representative in Congress 
who is of Guarani descent.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Jose Meirelles Passos] </F>
  [Text] The prospect of the United States imposing trade 
sanctions against Brazil on 28 February gained ground on 16 
February after a 90-minute-long meeting between Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
  The meeting's result proved that the differences between 
both 
parties are still considerable and that there is very little 
time to overcome them. The deadline is only 11 days off and 
many of the measures the Brazilian Government could take to 
stave off sanctions must be passed by Congress. 
  The foreign minister noted: There are still differences of 
perceptions that could not be settled today. Nevertheless, we 
will keep in contact in the next few days. We decided that we 
would speak on the phone if necessary. This is not an easy 
situation, but it is not impossible to surmount either. 
  Kantor was circumspect in his remarks. He said it was a 
productive meeting, "but there are some issues whose settlement 
is still pending." Having assessed the meeting, another U.S. 
official involved in the negotiations later defined the 
situation: 
  -- This is a very complicated situation because our 
differences of opinion over certain items on the list under 
discussion are still quite considerable and serious. 
  The United States is convinced that Brazil does not give 
adequate protection to copyright, patent, and trademark rights 
and demands that this state of affairs be changed. Following 
the expiration of the first deadline [for taking corrective 
action] (last May), a period of six months was established to 
enter into negotiations. This period was extended another 90 
days last November and the deadline is 28 February. This could 
be the fateful date. 
  Amorim declined to speculate about the implications of 
possible retaliation by the United Sates. He said: 
  -- We are working on the assumption that we will be able to 
prevent retaliation. 
  After being asked openly what his wager on the denouement of 
this conflict was, the minister evinced uncertainty: 
  -- I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic. 
  Amorim asserted that both parties came up with new ideas but 
refused to disclose them. Kantor had at least mentioned that. 
In practice, the Brazilian Government has 11 days to try to 
convince the United States that this time it will indeed make 
the concessions that have been demanded. 
  If a trade sanction were imposed on our country, it would 
consist of a surtax on several Brazilian products entering the 
American market. The idea behind this is to offset the losses 
incurred by U.S. companies in Brazil -- a little more than $500 
million -- due to piracy.

<F P=106> [Article by Edna Dantas from the Rio de Janeiro bureau] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cardiologist Eneas Ferreira Carneiro, 55, might 
become the PRN (National Reconstruction Party) candidate in the 
presidential race. PRN President Daniel Tourinho told FOLHA DE 
SAO PAULO on 14 February that he is forging a coalition with 
PRONA [Party for the Redefinition of the National Order], Eneas' 
party. Tourinho stressed: "He is the physical antithesis of 
[former President] Fernando Collor and he is a good candidate." 
[passage omitted] 
  Confirming that he will contend in the presidential 
elections, Eneas said: "I already have been a candidate for 
five years." According to Eneas, the PRN would be one of the 
alternatives to make his candidacy viable. According to the new 
electoral legislation, PRONA cannot field a candidate of its 
own. In general elections like those for choosing a president, 
only those parties with 3 percent of the total number of 
deputies may field a candidate. The PRONA barely has one 
representative in the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Regina 
Gordilho (RJ [Rio de Janeiro State]). 
  The PRN, with a bloc of four deputies, may, as established 
by 
law, field a candidate of its own because it received the 
support of more than 3 percent of the constituency in nine 
states in the 1990 elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Amaral] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] on the budget scandal did more than uncover a large 
corruption scheme. The confirmation of the report made by 
economist Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos forestalled the political 
deaths of some important congressional leaders such as Deputy 
Ibsen Pinheiro (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), Genebaldo Correia (BA 
[Bahia]) of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Jose 
Luis Maia (PI [Piaui]) of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], 
and Ricardo Fiuza (PE [Pernambuco]) of the PFL [Liberal Front 
Party], and knocked down Congress President Senator Humberto 
Lucena (PMDB-PB [Paraiba]) and the PMDB leader in the Senate, 
Mauro Benavides (CE [Ceara]). The political space created by the 
CPI's tarnishing of these leaders' image ended up opening room 
for a group of young politicians who today head the political 
negotiations. 
  Ideology, different origin, and different political 
backgrounds are not obstacles to the new congressional foxes in 
understanding each other. In the conservative field, the most 
organized house is that of the PFL bloc in the Chamber of 
Deputies headed by Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (BA). Magalhaes 
is serving his second term. He was elected to Congress with the 
help of his father, Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, but he 
shines because of his own merits. His most courageous move was 
to accept Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS), another emerging star serving 
his second term, as general coordinator of the constitutional 
revision process. 
  "It was brilliant. Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' decision 
prevented 
the articulation of a scheme by people opposing the revision, 
and guaranteed the beginning of the process," said former 
Minister Gustavo Krause (PFL-PE) in praising Magalhaes. Krause 
is serving his first term in Congress. 
  Magalhaes' counterpart in the leftist field is Deputy Jose 
Genoino (PT-SP [Workers Party-Sao Paulo]), the oldest public 
servant (he is serving his third term) in the new generation of 
foxes. In association with Paulo Delgado (PT-MG [Minas Gerais]), 
Genoino paves the way for leftist proposals with a style 
entirely different from that used by his party's dogmatic 
executive board. Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor 
Party-Rio de Janeiro]) and Jose Serra (PSDB-SP [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party]) complete the group of the new cardinals 
association -- or the "Sacred College," as former President Jose 
Sarney defines it. 
  "It is only natural for new leaders to appear and face new 
difficulties. The CPI affected Congress like the stripping of 
political rights changed it at the beginning of the military 
regime. The political space left empty by the latest changes 
must be occupied and the process is not easy," said Civil 
Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves, who has served in Congress 
since 1961. 
  The process is more painful at the PMDB, which has the 
largest congressional representation. Before the CPI, party bloc 
leadership members were all supporters of former Governor 
Orestes Quercia. Today, the three most visible PMDB deputies are 
bloc leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG), CPI Vice President Odacir 
Klein (RS), and Luis Carlos Santos, government leader in the 
Chamber of Deputies. The three are opposed to Quercia and lead a 
congressional bloc where the former governor still has great 
influence. 
  "My single most important working tool is dialogue. I am not 
the result of any agreement, and all I can do try to convince my 
colleagues. That is my style," Tarcisio Delgado said. He is a 
strange case among a group of legislators who were already 
involved in politics (in Juiz de Fora) before 1964. 
  The young cardinals do not have a habit identifying them -- 
such as the "pears" [preceding word in French] liquor bottle 
made famous by [late senior Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes' group -- 
and prefer to talk about common objectives. Luiz Eduardo 
Magalhaes, Genoino, Miro, and Klein were the main proponents of 
an important decision made by CPI coordinator Roberto Magalhaes 
(PFL-PE). They convinced the deputy -- who also feels 
comfortable with the group -- to abstain from making a partial 
report. 
  "Roberto Magalhaes had the greatness of taking a step back. 
The partial report would have created such big pressure on the 
CPI that the investigation would have had to be cut short," 
Genoino recalls.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The new congressional leaders that 
emerged in the aftermath of the CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] on the budget scandal are legislators who are not 
always in tune with their party leaders but who have a great 
ability to listen and negotiate. In each party bloc new leaders 
are gradually occupying leadership positions at the side of 
others with more experience. 
  -- PSDB -- Leader Jose Serra appears in all important 
negotiations, from discussions on the presidential succession to 
talks on constitutional revision, thus consolidating the 
prestige he earned when he participated in the Constituent 
Congress. The figure who represents the party is Senate leader 
Mario Covas (SP). Deputy Sergio Machado (CE) operates as a 
bridge between Congress and Ceara's powerful party wing. When 
economic questions appear, negotiations always include newcomer 
(and alternate member) Jose Anibal (SP), who has direct access 
to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the ability of 
a veteran politician. 
  -- PPR -- The party's star is its president, Senator 
Esperidiao Amin (SC [Santa Catarina]), but Senate PPR leader 
Epitafio Cafeteira (MA [Maranhao]) is a rare case of a callous 
politician who still has influence within the party. As a 
blessing for the party bloc, the CPI multiplied the prestige of 
Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PA [Para]). In the Chamber of 
Deputies, new bloc leader Marcelino Guilherme Romano (SP) is the 
voice of Mayor Paulo Maluf. At times, when moral values are on 
the spot, the prestige of Deputy Adylson Motta, of Rio Grande do 
Sul, increases. He is the champion of diligence, so much so that 
he opens the doors of the plenum auditorium every day. The most 
promising newcomer is Fetter Junior (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), 
who formulates the party's proposals for the constitutional 
revision. 
  -- PFL -- Marco Maciel (PE), party bloc leader in the 
Senate, 
maintains his traditional influence in the party bloc and 
participates in all important negotiations. In the Chamber of 
Deputies, Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes showed great ability and is one 
of those rare figures who can really speak for the party bloc. 
Roberto Magalhaes and Gustavo Krause, both from Pernambuco and 
newcomers to the Chamber of Deputies, have increased their 
influence in the past few months, thanks to the CPI on 
corruption in the case of Magalhaes, and the constitutional 
revision in the case of Krause. 
  -- PMDB -- The collapse of [Orestes] Quercia's support group 
split the party bloc. Several PMDB followers must be consulted 
for any negotiation. Leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG [Minas Gerais]) 
speaks with the accent of an old MDB [former PMDB party name] 
authentic wing member. He has to add his voice to the voices of 
party President Luiz Henrique da Silveira (SC) and Deputy Odacir 
Klein (RS) to be heard. Deputy Roberto Rollemberg (SP) inherited 
Quercia's representation because he was an investigator -- and 
not investigated -- by the CPI on the budget scandal. The rest 
of the party follows regional leaders. 
  -- The left -- PT leader Jose Genoino (SP) and Paulo Delgado 
(MG) form a supra-party group of the left that has the support 
of Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Workers Party-Rio de 
Janeiro]) and Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF). Besides their 
personal affinities, they almost form a new political party in 
Congress and work as a communication channels between the left 
and pressure groups outside Congress. The CPI served to bring to 
the fore a skillful politician from the PC do B [Communist Party

  [Text] Brasilia -- Some new protagonists are filling the 
gaps left by the departure of [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party -- PMDB Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes [who was killed in a 
helicopter crash in October 1992], the lack of action by the 
Itamar Franco government, and the budget CPI's [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] "firing squad" which eliminated a 
significant part of a generation that was preparing to take 
power. This new group shares the scene with a few old-guard 
survivors who were not devoured by the CPI -- Senator Pedro 
Simon (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul], Senator Mario Covas 
(PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo State], 
Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal 
Party-Para State], Senator Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Liberal Front 
Party-Pernambuco State], Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) 
[PMDB-Amapa State], and State Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes 
(PFL-BA) [PFL-Bahia State]. 
  Even some historical Planalto hopefuls like [Sao Paulo] 
Mayor 
Paulo Maluf (PPR-SP) and [former Sao Paulo Governor] Orestes 
Quercia (PMDB-SP) can no longer move without the participation 
of the "new foxes," a team of congressmen -- whose average age 
is about 40 -- that was formed during the second half of the 
military regime. Despite all the difficulties, they earnestly 
entered the scene. For example, PMDB President Luis Henrique 
(SC) [Santa Catarina State] mustered enough courage to forge an 
alliance with the PSDB and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], 
contradicting Quercia who considers himself the proprietor of 
the ticket. 
  PMDB leader Tarcisio Delgado, Luis Henrique's squire, said: 
"We obviously have different styles. Nevertheless, we are 
responsible for solving our country's problems honestly." 
  One of the most substantial succession talks took place at 
the Brasilia residence of newcomer Sergio Machado, a jeans 
manufacturer who entered the political arena to help his friend 
Tasso Jereissati, the PSDB president, with the only experience 
of having been Ceara governor. The meeting at Machado's house 
united the PSDB leadership with the PMDB anti-Quercia band in 
the early hours of the day on which Congress rejected a quick 
approval of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic 
program. 
  Machado's house is on Lake Paranoa in Brasilia, near where 
former Minister Jorge Bornhausen also lives. At the PFL 
president's house, the spectrum ranges between Mayor Paulo Maluf 
and Jose Serra, the PSDB leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and 
includes new ticket leaders like Alvaro Dias (PP-PR) [Popular 
Party-Parana State]. The succession talks at Bornhausen's house 
have always been attended by Luiz Eduardo and Benito Gama, two 
Bahia congressmen who are serving their second term and have 
matured through the succession of crises prompted by the 
investigations of the CPI that handled the PC [Paulo Cesar] 
Farias case. 
  Jose Genoino, who is at the far left of the new generation 
of 
foxes and describes himself as "a democratic radical," explains: 
"We are molding a new profile of politicians who are concerned 
over supplying institutional responses to society's 
requirements. This common sentiment overcomes ideological 
disagreements."

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Equipment destined to be used at 
the Angra-2 nuclear plant that was purchased from Germany during 
the 1970's and 1980's is already obsolete and being superseded. 
A source from the nuclear sector said the electronic part of 
the control panel is now a museum piece. It is close to 15 
years old and has been superseded by more modern ones, but it 
can be used if necessary. The same source said that state of 
the art control panels with color video and sophisticated data 
processing systems are being installed in the nuclear plants of 
first world countries such as France, the United States, and 
Japan. 
  The same source said that during the next decade new 
reactors 
with improved safety concepts will be produced, in which case 
Angra-2 may no longer satisfy the requirements for a license 
because it has been out of use for a long time. The source 
noted that the heavy mechanical part of the reactor and the 
construction of the plant are not at risk of being obsolete but 
he indicated that the electronic part will all have to be 
reviewed. The equipment is being kept in warehouses with great 
care and under the supervision of technicians of the IAEA, which 
has its headquarters in Austria. 
  But the source said no one in the world can guarantee the 
realiability of high technology pieces kept inactive for almost 
15 years. The source said that pumps and motors, for example, 
kept idle for a long time tend to give problems. He added: 
"This happens with cars and refrigerators, so why not with a 
nuclear plant?" Luiz Manuel Amaral Messias, superintendent of 
the nuclear construction of the Furnas Electric Power Plants, 
Inc., admits that some parts will have to be changed but said: 
"This is very common in any project." Messias said that when the 
government decides to restart the nuclear plant construction, 
the parts will be subjected to many tests to prevent problems. 
  Messias admitted that the auxiliary computer for operating 
Angra- 2 that was bought in Germany is obsolete. He added that 
the electronic module of the reactor's protection system has 
already been changed because it did not fulfill the new 
requirements. The post-accident monitoring system was also 
replaced because it was too old. Messias added: "We are now 
discussing the exchange of the nucleus of the reactor, which 
monitors the flow of neutrons in the reactor." 
  As problems in the plants appear, Furnas plans to use 
(German 
technology) equipment and parts bought for the Angra-3 plant 
(which will not be rebuilt) in Angra-1 which was bought from 
Westinghouse in 1970.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil through 17 February: 
  The Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries reported that 
the unemployment rate in Sao Paulo rose for the fourth 
consecutive month in January with the dismissal of 11,939 
workers, a drop of 0.51 percent compared with December 1993. The 
unemployment rate dropped 0.57 percent in the past 12 months, 
which represents 13,453 dismissed workers. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 9 Feb 94 Section 2 p 1) 
  Sugar exports registered a record increase of 42.7 percent 
in 
1993 with revenues of $773 million, compared with $540 million 
in 1992. The volume of export increased from 2 million metric 
tons to nearly 3 million metric tons. (Sao Paulo GAZETA

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Feb (AFP) -- Five thousand 
Colombian oil industry workers stopped working this Thursday to 
protest the arrest of a union leader accused of subversive 
activities. The intended duration of the action is unknown. 
  Following the orders of a prosecutor who linked Freddy 
Pulecio, a member of the board of directors of the Workers Trade 
Union (USO), to a case of alleged rebellion, Colombian secret 
agents arrested Pulecio in eastern Arauca during the past hours. 
USO is comprised of Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] 
workers. 
  The strike has negatively affected the north-central 
Barrancabermeja installations, which houses the country's most 
important oil refinery, and has forced Ecopetrol to implement 
contingency measures to maintain the production rate and fuel 
distribution. 
  The strike started on Thursday afternoon and it is not known 
if it will last 24 hours or if it will be extended indefinitely.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian elections, 
scheduled for 8 May 1994: 
  The last-minute presidential bid of Carlos Lleras de la 
Fuente, a former Constituent Assembly member, has prompted 
divisions within the Liberal Party (PL), which will elect its 
official candidate on 13 March. Lleras is considered to be an 
independent politician removed from the influences of the party 
power brokers. 
  Although most PL presidential hopefuls accepted Lleras' bid, 
David Turbay has threatened not to participate in the PL 
election if Lleras is given special treatment because he is the 
son of former President Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Turbay said: 
"We cannot be divided up as mortals and gods. The mortals would 
be those of us who obey the rules and respect the laws, and the 
gods would be those who seek their own rules whenever they need 
to." 
  PL presidential hopefuls Ernesto Samper, Humberto de la 
Calle, and Carlos Lemos appeared to favor Lleras' presidential 
bid. De la Calle said it was a good proposal to fight "against 
the PL party machinery." Samper said Lleras' participation 
could give new dynamics to the campaign. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
1834 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  Carlos Lleras de la Fuente has said his presidential bid was 
inspired by civic and private sector organizations that 
encouraged him to become a PL presidential hopeful. When Lleras 
was questioned whether he had discussed the decision with his 
father -- the former president -- Lleras said: "No I have not." 
Lleras said mechanisms are being set up to oppose his 
candidacy, such as the argument about new voting lists having to 
be printed. He noted: "It has even been suggested that I run 
under an independent movement, outside the elections. This does 
not appear to be the most convenient decision given the nation's 
current situation." (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network 
in Spanish 1200 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
  PL presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano was seen 
campaigning in Caldas and several cities of middle Magdalena. 
Samper said that one of his government's goals is to return life 
to the Magdalena River, indicating that he would not hesitate to 
help the peasants and that he would return the Agrarian Bank to 
the farmers. 
  Meanwhile Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party hopeful, asked 
the government for necessary guarantees for the elections. 
Pastrana also sent a message of solidarity to the Boyaca 
political leaders who are being held hostage, and he expressed 
hopes for a speedy and safe release of the kidnap victims. 
  In Santa Marta, PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos said 
that given that women in general are honest and therefore more 
difficult to bribe, one must take advantage of this virtue by 
appointing them to important posts in public administration to 
create a climate of honesty in the nation. 
  Over the weekend, Humberto de la Calle, PL presidential 
hopeful, said that a large majority of Colombians should have 
access to education because a lack of education is the root of 
many problems in the nation. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision 
Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Feb 94)

  [Text] The sentences requested by the military prosecutor 
for the soldiers implicated in the La Cantuta case was what 
finally made Minister Bustamante resign from his post. The 
military prosecutor requested jail sentences of 20 and 15 years 
for the soldiers who committed the crime -- two majors and four 
subofficers -- while only five officers were included in the 
proceedings and charged with negligence. 
  Jurists, congressmen, and other prominent people linked to 
human rights organizations have described the sentences 
requested by the military prosecutor for the 11 soldiers being 
tried in the La Cantuta case as mild. 
  [Begin unidentified priest recording] In my opinion, the 
sentences are too mild, because it was a very serious crime. 
[end recording] 
  The most drastic sentences were requested for Majors 
Santiago 
Martin Rivas and Carlos Pichilingue, for whom the military 
prosecutor requested 20 years each. In descending order, 15 
years were requested for subofficers Jesus Antonio Sossa, Nelson 
Carvajal Garcia, and Pedro Guillermo Supo; five years for 
General Juan Rivero Lasso; four years for Colonel Federico 
Navarro Perez; two years for Captain Jose Velarado Astete; and 
30 days for Colonel Manuel Guzman Calderon. 
  In view of the situation, relatives of the slain civilians 
announced via their lawyer that they will not participate in the 
trial to be held in a military court. 
  [Begin Attorney Saul Cuadros recording] The civilian side -- 
the relatives and three others -- today agreed not to 
participate in the military trial. Previously, in May and 
October, we acted on behalf of the civilian side in written 
documents, but we never received approval to do so. By 
participating on behalf of the civilian side, we would be 
endorsing many irregularities committed by the military court -- 
irregularities with which we totally disagree. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Congressman Cesar Larrabure criticized U.S. 
meddling in Peruvian affairs by commenting on the so-called La 
Cantuta law. He said the autonomy and sovereignty of countries 
must be respected, adding that the United States cannot treat 
Peru as a colony. In this regard, he said the U.S. State 
Department's statement with regard to the so-called La Cantuta 
law is unacceptable. He also expressed his confidence that 
soldiers implicated in this case will receive a fair trial.

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Vargas Romero] </F>
  [Text] Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, alias 
Vaticano, the most powerful Peruvian international drug 
trafficking kingpin, was protected by Huallaga Front's 
top-ranking military commanders for four years. He even used 
Colombian Air Force planes for his illegal and criminal 
business. It was reported that he transported 3,000 kg of drugs 
on each flight on the Campanilla-Cali route. 
  Chavez Penaherrera became a sort of king in Upper Huallaga's 
northeast jungles. He could even afford an army of hired foreign 
gunmen to fight off an attempt by the Maoist Shining Path to 
take control -- at machinegun point and with dynamite -- of the 
transportation of cocaine paste to Colombia 
  But the Shining Path, when confronted with Chavez 
Penaherrera's paramilitary forces, withdrew and contented itself 
with protection quotas on drug shipments from roads in 
coca-producing areas as well as from clandestine airstrips. 
  These explosive revelations were made on 6 February by 
former 
DEA agent Augusto del Rio during an extensive interview with 
journalist Alfredo Barnechea during the Channel 9 program 
"Live." An important panel of narcoterrorism experts also 
participated in the interview. 
  The interview was recorded 24 hours earlier for security 
reasons involving the former DEA agent. The program included a 
large portion of the first testimony given by Chavez Penaherrera 
to National Anti- Narcotics Directorate (Dinandro) investigators 
at 1120 on 25 January. 
  In the most important part of his declaration, Del Rio shook 
the panel when he named Generals Alberto Arciniegas Huby and 
Eduardo Bellido Mora, former Huallaga Front commanders, as 
"Vaticano" protectors. 
  Using direct language, Del Rio said Bellido forced the 
abortion of the operation code-named "Campanazo" that was 
designed to capture Chavez Penaherrera. 
  "I participated in a 45-day intelligence project. The 
operation was conceived on 6 February 1992 but implemented on 3 
March 1993. We thought we were going to hit them hard but 
everyone in Campanilla had been alerted. We thought we would 
seize between 2,500 and 3,000 kg of drug, but we were only able 
to seize 500 kg of cocaine paste. All this indicates that 
'Vaticano' was able to manipulate and give orders, but always 
under Army protection," Del Rio said without hesitating. He also 
said "Vaticano" paid his protectors between $400,000 and 
$500,000 [numbers as published] for each flight. 
  During his testimony at Dinandro, "Vaticano" contradicted 
President Alberto Fujimori's assertions that his capture was due 
to the direct work of the National Intelligence Service, which 
carried out an operation that lasted three months and included 
following a former beauty queen (Lucila Boggiano, Mrs. World). 
  Chavez Penaherrera said: "I was visiting a friend at his 
home in Cali and I was arrested because I did not carry any 
identification with me. The operation was carried out by 
Colombian Fiscal Police. When I gave them my name, when they 
learned of my name, they checked it with a list of petitions in 
Maynas, Loreto. That is why they took me to Peru." 
  The drug trafficker said no Peruvian woman, least of all a 
beauty queen, had been involved in the operation that ended with 
his detention in Cali. 
  "Vaticano" said, however, that he met Alexis Janeth Ramirez 
Perdomo, a Colombian Intercontinental de Aviacion airline flight 
attendant, when he made a trip from Bogota to Cali. 
  When learning of this, television program reporters called 
the Colombian airline offices in Cali in order to find out the 
whereabouts of Alexis Janeth, but the answer was negative. 
  "We do not have her registered here," a voice answered at 
the 
other end of the telephone line. 
  Participating in the interview were congressman Julio Castro 
Gomez, former Dincote chief PNP [Peruvian National Police] 
General John Caro, CARETAS director Enrique Zileri, and 
political analysts Carlos Tapia and Federico Prieto Celli. 
  Julio Castro Gomez, a CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] 
Supervision Committee member, revealed that at present there are 
350 military chiefs involved in drug trafficking violations in 
Huallaga Valley, the world's main source of raw material for the 
manufacture of cocaine. 
  The legislator said the officers are under investigation for 
alleged crimes committed since 1980. 
  Castro Gomez mentioned figures released in 1991 by a former 
Central Reserve Bank president saying that drug trafficking 
moves around $1.2 billion annually, that is, more than $3 
million per day. 
  "This means that drugs' corrupting power is very important 
and it would be naive not to accept that civilian or military 
authorities, particularly officials operating in emergency 
zones, might be involved in the dirty trade," Castro Gomez said, 
adding that the officers involved in drug trafficking must by 
tried by ordinary courts and not by military courts, where 
crimes are covered up because of a false esprit de corps. 
  Former Dincote chief John Caro paid homage to the honest 
military men who fought and continue to fight this scourge. 
  In order to stress his remarks, Caro mentioned the names of 
officers Mayatoshi and Taboada [not further identified], who, 
according to him, "are examples of personal dedication and 
defense of the institutions for which they patriotically work." 
  Nevertheless, John Caro expressed his dissatisfaction by 
stating that the good name of the Armed Forces and the police 
has been tarnished since many of them are tempted and ensnared 
by the corruptive power of drug traffickers who handle huge sums 
of money and are protected by hirelings. 
  With a characteristic Loreto accent, the former DEA agent 
openly accused with names and details the high-ranking military 
officers who protected Chavez Penaherrera, who has been 
arraigned on treason charges and today will be sentenced to life 
imprisonment by a faceless military court. 
  At the beginning of his deposition, Augusto del Rio 
acknowledged that Peruvian drug traffickers have now become 
actively involved in the industry. They not only buy coca from 
peasants and soak it but also have ventured into processing 
cocaine in keen competition with Colombian cartels. 
  He then reported that "Vaticano," whom he trailed in several 
operations to capture him, gained a foothold in the 
international drug business in 1989 when he had his own landing 
strip built in the village of Campanilla. 
  Del Rio claimed that at that time, having signed contracts 
with the other "firms" (other powerful drug traffickers), 
"Vaticano" rented that airstrip for $5,000 per flight. 
  He added that "when he arrived at Campanilla in 1989, Chavez 
Penaherrera was no longer 'Loco Lemonier' but 'Vaticano.' Or in 
other words, he was already a drug kingpin who rubbed shoulders 
with Colombians and he had entered the big business, in which he 
succeeded thanks to his good fortune and, consequently, he 
amassed a fortune." 
  Del Rio also pointed out that by personal endeavor, 
"Vaticano" gained a foothold in the Colombian market and 
directly contacted the mafias there. This, he assured, cost 
"Vaticano" his head, as the notorious Cali cartel had a lot to 
do with his capture. 
  He further stated: "The Colombians were jealous because he 
had reached the top. Moreover, the Cali cartel had been dealt a 
severe blow with Pablo Escobar's death." Del Rio's remarks 
caused a great impact in political circles, especially military 
ones. 
  To that effect, the most revealing reports are that three 
Army captains protected "Vaticano" in exchange for large sums of 
money and that a major called "Otorongo" came especially from 
Tarapoto to Campanilla to act as link to collect the protection 
money that finally ended up in the hands of the former Huallaga 
Counter Subversive Front commander, Gen. Eduardo Bellido Mora. 
  At this point, Bernechea asked him whether he had evidence 
to 
support his statement. 
  The former DEA agent said he had participated in several 
operations in the last few years in which a total of 3,000 kg of 
drug were seized and that "I have seen with my own eyes" how 
high- ranking military officers are implicated in the protection 
of drug traffickers, especially "Vaticano." 
  He said: "Let us start with Gen. Arciniegas and finish with 
Gen. Bellido. I need only show you a photograph in which you 
could see them there. But hirelings registered everybody who 
came to the landing strips so it was impossible to take 
photographs. Those who were found in possession of a camera 
were killed." 
  When giving details about how shipments to Colombia were 
made 
under the protection of Army soldiers and officers, del Rio 
noted that at that time, all movements were timed with a 
chronometer. 
  Light aircraft, for example, stayed between 8 and 10 minutes 
on airstrips for loading shipments, which were not registered 
since "agreements between firms are to the point and highly 
respected; therefore, there is no need to check them." 
  With regard to shipments made by "Vaticano," del Rio 
commented that his hirelings controlled landing strips when 
light airplanes landed and took off, while Army patrols were in 
charge of watching the cars that transported the shipment along 
highways and roads. 
  He explained that shipments were made Monday to Saturday in 
light aircraft, the number of which ranged between four and six 
per day, and flights were scheduled from 0900 to 1700. 
  Del Rio disclosed: "I saw -- on two or three occasions -- 
that Colombian Air Force planes were used. They took off 
transporting 3,000 kg of cocaine paste in each plane at around 
1700." He noted that the type of aircraft was similar to the 
one used by the DEA in its operations.

  [Text] Huancayo -- Remains of the bones of some of the 10 
peasants kidnapped and murdered by peasant patrols at a 
community in El Tambo were discovered a few hours ago inside an 
abandoned mine near that community. The discovery was made by 
two Huancayo provincial prosecutors accompanied by a detachment 
of policemen and soldiers. 
  The prosecutors conducted the search at the request of 
congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, president of the Democratic 
Constituent Congress Human Rights Committee, who received a 
report on the massacre from relatives of the missing persons. 
  The officials made the morbid find at the Paccha annex, in 
the heights of El Tambo District, Huancayo Province, some 75 km 
west of the city of Huancayo. 
  The massacre allegedly was carried out by more than 100 
peasant patrol members from the Suitucancha and Rangra annexes 
using the breech-loading shotguns supplied by President Alberto 
Fujimori a few years ago to defend their communities from 
terrorist attacks. 
  The victims were Paccha annex inhabitants with whom the 
alleged killers had constant disputes over the ownership of 
grasslands and agricultural lots located between the two 
communities, which allegedly was the cause of the crime. 
  According to the testimony of the missing peasants' 
relatives, Suitucancha and Rangra peasant patrols on the night 
of 27 February 1992 launched a surprise attack against Paccha 
peasants, shooting and killing 10 of them. 
  The killers then threw the bodies of the dead peasants 
inside 
an abandoned mine located high up a hill in the Paccha area. 
  On 25 August 1993, a commission named by the Attorney 
General's Office guarded by a group of military and police 
agents, heeding a complaint by relatives of the dead peasants, 
went to the mine to verify the existence of the remains, but 
they were attacked by a mob of 150 Suitucancha peasant patrol 
members. 
  Commission members, however, were able to enter the mine and 
locate three graves containing the remains of the murdered 
peasants, but they could not take anything out because the 
peasant patrols attacking them at the time forced them to leave 
empty-handed. 
  On 4 February, Huancayo provincial prosecutors Jean Diaz 
Alvarado and Juan Lezama, following a request to finish the 
proceeding from congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, travelled 
to the Paccha annex to excavate the remains of the slain 
peasants. 
  The prosecutors, accompanied by 15 Huancayo Criminal 
Investigation Commission agents, led by PNP [Peruvian National 
Police] Lieutenant Daniel Berrocal, plus 15 soldiers, entered 
the mine. 
  Inside the mine, the officials were surprised to find that 
the places where the first commission had located the three 
graves were covered by metric tons of rock and soil from the 
mine's roof, presumably loosened with dynamite by the murderers 
in an attempt to hide the evidence of their crime. 
  However, thanks to a careful inspection of the mine's 
entrance, the officials found the remains of the bones of a 
total of 15 people buried there.

  [Text] National Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan 
Maguino said yesterday that the National Detainees Registry 
[Registro Nacional de Detenidos] will guarantee absolute respect 
for human rights and will permit a better administration of 
justice throughout the nation. 
  The registry will open to the public as of today. Initially 
it will work exclusively with individuals charged with violating 
antiterrorist and national security laws in Lima and El Callao. 
  Colan Maguino said in the next few months the registry will 
cover all regions of the country and will cover individuals 
arrested for all crimes, a task that will involve the Attorney 
General's Office, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense 
Ministry. 
  The attorney general said that the registry's central 
headquarters will be connected with the various prosecutor 
offices -- particularly those located in emergency zones -- 
through radio equipment donated by the AID. 
  The Registry will provide free information to relatives, 
lawyers, and national and international organizations involved 
in the defense of human rights. 
  Interior Minister General Juan Briones Davila said the 
registry will prevent excesses that might distort Peru's current 
efforts to defend human rights. 
  Briones said that all national police regions are linked to 
the registry's computer system which operates from the first 
floor of the Attorney General's Office Building on Abancay 
Avenue, in downtown Lima. 
  The files used by the registry contain information on the 
physical condition of the detainee at the time of his arrest at 
a police, military, or judicial department. It will also 
include other information such as sex, education level, age, and 
the number of the prosecutor's office that is handling the case.

  [Text] A total of 126 PNP [Peruvian National Police] 
officers, including colonels, commanders, and majors were 
"invited" to retire on 3 February, according to an Interior 
Ministry supreme resolution that explains that the purpose is to 
renew the cadres. 
  The list of the 126 officers includes 70 colonels, 17 from 
the General Police [PG], 19 from the Technical Police [PT], 
three from the Security Police [PS], and 31 from the Police 
Forces Health Unit. 
  Also, 36 commanders, of which seven belong to the PG, 22 to 
the PT, four to the PS, and three to the Police Health Unit. 
  The list also includes 20 majors: Five from the PG, 12 the 
PT, and three the PS. 
  It was learned that in the next few days this measure also 
will affect captains, lieutenants, and second lieutenants. 
  Police sources who asked to remain anonymous, said the 
"invitation" was delivered on 3 February to the homes of the 
affected policemen who will have to accept it. 
  It also was disclosed that six generals retired last 
December. 
  The sources noted that disciplinary measures played a strong 
role in the aforementioned "invitation" because a commission 
assessed the respective service records of all the commanders 
between 1989 and 1993. 
  In the case of retirement for years of service, the sources 
said that those who graduated between 1961 and 1963 were 
included. 
  It was also disclosed that those "invited" to retire will 
not 
lose any of their benefits. In the case that they were found 
liable for promotion to the next rank, they will get the salary 
and fringe benefits of the next rank. 
  This measure, as well as changes announced by the 
Counterterrorism Division (Dincote) and the Crime Investigative 
National Directorate [Direccion Nacional de Investigacion 
Criminal -- Dinincri], has generated uncertainty within the PNP, 
according to the same sources. 
  As is known, a few days ago PNP Director General Victor Alva 
Plasencia asserted that police stations that [words indistinct] 
to the public and carry out street services will be reinforced 
to do a better job. 
  He did not specify, however, if the reinforcement will come 
from Dinincri. 
  Moreover, on that occasion he said that in view of the 
reduction of terrorist actions, the crime prevention service 
will be reinforced so the citizenry can carry out its activities 
normally. 
  In this regard, Alva Plasencia only said that the units will 
continue doing their job and that there is no estimate of the 
percentage of personnel that will be rationalized. 
  In referring to Dincote, he said it will continue doing its 
job throughout the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila by </F>
unidentified EXPRESO reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] EXPRESO interviewed Interior Minister Juan Briones 
Davila to learn about the rumored reduction within special 
police units. Some 150 Dincote [National Counterterrorism 
Directorate] members have been reassigned to other regional 
terrorism units, while the National Crime Investigative 
Directorate [Dinincri] is as yet untouched. 
  [EXPRESO] Is it true that 30 percent of the Dincote 
personnel 
are being reduced? 
  [Briones] We are doing the following: Dincote personnel have 
been sent to reinforce regional counterterrorism divisions to 
improve the countersubversive action at a national level. Among 
the 12 police regions are the Jecotes (Counterterrorism 
Provincial Police) and the Secotes (Counterterrorism Section) 
[Seccion contra el terrorismo]. We are reinforcing them to 
finish off the last few subversives. 
  [EXPRESO] Have 30 percent of the members gone to the 
Jecotes? 
  [Briones] Much less. They total 150 members. But we will 
not remove support from the Dincote. The idea is to improve our 
action at a regional level without reducing support. 
  [EXPRESO] But it has also been said that personnel from 
other 
police units will be retired. 
  [Briones] No. We have already announced that the police 
schools will not receive new students for a determined period of 
time. The schools will train personnel who are currently 
holding desk jobs so that they return to police work in the 
police stations. 
  An enormous number of people worked in the Police Staff. No 
one wanted to go to the streets for fear of the terrorists. 
Instead of being on the streets, they held desk jobs. 
  [EXPRESO] How many men are we talking about? 
  [Briones] About 2,500. 
  [EXPRESO] It is said that personnel in the Dinincri have 
also 
been reduced. 
  [Briones] No. There will be investigative police members in 
each police station from now on. If the case is more 
complicated or if it has national ramifications it will pass 
under the jurisdiction of the Dinincri. This unit is like the 
FBI in the United States which intervenes when a case goes 
beyond a local jurisdiction. 
  [EXPRESO] But will investigative police members leave the 
Dinincri? 
  [Briones] No, they are already in the police stations. The 
Dinincri will not be touched. There is no change. I do not 
know where that rumor came from. The only changes are the 
normal police reassignments according to the rules.

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Tapia] </F>
  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] document published by LA 
REPUBLICA a few days ago giving an account of what was discussed 
by Abimael Guzman and other main SL imprisoned leaders, as an 
underlying fact throughout it, recognizes the validity of the 
policy chosen in May 1982. This fact is taken as a basis for 
the peace agreement. 
  Considering "the people's war to be the greatest social 
revolutionary movement in Peruvian history...." and "the strong 
point, the most developed in the democratic path....," it 
describes clearly how difficult it will be for those defending 
true democratic interest to reach a peace agreement when faced 
with this SL fundamentalism. 
  The greatest majority of Peruvians want peace and an end to 
the attacks, the blackouts, and the car bombs. We would also 
like an end to the cases of disappeared prisoners and a 
reduction of the number of provinces in a state of emergency so 
that we can gradually return to our normal lives and to the full 
state of law throughout the land. 
  We would like to see differences among Peruvians on the 
grave 
problems afflicting the country resolved through democratic 
mechanisms. This and nothing else was the lesson derived from 
the 1976-78 struggle that allowed us to recover our democracy 
and to end 12 years of military government. Even the 5 April 
self-imposed coup, the legitimacy of which will be decided by 
history, had to withdraw some of its initial objectives and 
allow CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] and municipal 
elections. The authoritarian characteristics of the present 
government, which were useful for the initial coupist project, 
are today increasingly isolating the government from the masses. 
If the wearing effect is still slow to affect this government 
it is only because of the mistakes made by those who from 
government positions ransacked democracy or as a result of 
errors by those who from radical and alarmist opposition 
positions showed a resounding lack of loyalty. 
  The start of the SL armed struggle was, undoubtedly, a 
growing destabilizing factor that affected our democratic 
achievements. If we look at the 13 years of internal warfare in 
hindsight we will not only see the dead, injured, and maimed; 
damage to the Peruvian economy, displaced persons, the culture 
of violence, and the arming of peasants; we will also see the 
overall weakening of democracy, the growing military presence, 
and, particularly, the disintegration of people's movements and 
the crisis of those who wanted to assume their political 
representation. 
  It is clear, then, that the so-called SL people's war has 
not 
served to establish any democratic path. On the contrary, it 
has served directly or as a pretext -- together with other 
factors -- to advance toward more authoritarian positions. 
  In fact, Abimael's boast that he had given "harsh blows" to 
the three mountains -- feudalism, imperialism (including the 
"social- imperialism" of the USSR), and bureaucratic capitalism 
-- does not stand any analysis. This is because, first, the 
large landowners of the semi-feudal era had already been 
virtually eliminated as a result of the agrarian reform of [Juan 
Velasco] Alvarado by the time he started his war. Second, the 
Unites States, as we all know, enjoys good health and it has 
consolidated its position as a world hegemonic power. The 
disintegration of the USSR can be explained in many ways, but it 
would be preposterous to link it to any SL or MRI 
[Internationalist Revolutionary Movement] actions. 
  Now, and because of the importance Abimael grants it, let us 
analyze the "harsh blows" by the SL to the so-called 
"bureaucratic capitalism." As we all know, Mao referred to a 
capitalism that was linked to feudal large landowners' interests 
in the China of the 1930's and which joined forces with the 
imperialist interests of the time to monopolize state powers and 
were politically represented by the Kuomintang and Chiang 
Kai-shek. Mao identified four large families that directly 
benefited from this Chinese bureaucratic capitalism. It seems 
that, at the beginning of the 1970's, Abimael fell in love with 
the term and in an anti-Marxist way defined it the way he saw 
fit in order to continue to defend the characterization of 
Peruvian society as "semi-feudal" and justify its peasant war 
strategy. Therefore, all objective discussion on industrial 
progress, the growth of cities, the relative decrease of the 
importance of agriculture in the country's overall economic and 
political structure were for him nothing but the confirmation of 
the semi-feudal character of the country and our developing 
capitalism was only consolidating this semi-feudal system. 
  It is not clear if the murders and pillages perpetrated 
against small retailers who live on the mountains, against 
private agricultural companies, and against SAIS's [Social 
Interest Agricultural Association] in the countryside, are the 
harsh blows dealt to the "bureaucratic capitalism." Perhaps, 
Guzman is referring to the dynamite attacks on bank branches and 
the burning of some industrial facilities in Lima. If he 
alluded to the former, the result of his action only served to 
deepen the agricultural crisis that batters the country and to 
increase our dependence on foreign foodstuffs; in other words, 
to favor agricultural producers from "imperialist" countries. 
If he referred to the dynamite attacks, his action was 
instrumental in helping insurance companies and leading security 
companies -- established precisely through "bureaucratic 
capitalism" -- to increase their profits. 
  If he intended to "dismantle" government investments in the 
economy, in fact by blowing up nearly 2,000 high-tension towers 
he merely managed to leave many little villages without 
electricity and to facilitate pretexts for laying off staff from 
large companies which were affected by the crisis and which lost 
less money by being closed down than by producing. The bulk of 
these losses were passed on to users by hiking the price of 
electricity rates and reducing -- or at best by freezing -- 
workers' salaries and wages. 
  In fact, a better and more efficient dismantling of the 
state 
economy occurred during the current administration, from which 
not even the National Bank seems to escape. The consolidation 
of a true bureaucratic bourgeoisie is also under way by all 
those who, with or without debt notes, stand to gain with the 
so-called privatization process. 
  Notwithstanding this, by "applying the ideas of MLM [Marx, 
Lenin, and Mao] in a creative way, and specifically the PG 
[Thoughts of Gonzalo, that is Guzman's Plan]," we might venture 
to suggest that the SL's greatest contribution has been to the 
drug trafficking business. The "novelty" of all this has been 
the attempt to displace hirelings, mafias, and small "firms." 
Initial efforts were rapidly absorbed by powerful foreign and 
domestic interests that capitalized on the terrorists presence 
to consolidate a new hegemony that considered the interests of 
representatives of the different armed powers present in the 
region. Following a brief encounter, the "firms" decided that 
SL members who had settled in areas under the control of 
traffickers would handle the stocking and transportation of up 
to 50 kg of "cocaine paste." Other, more powerful individuals, 
receive "orders" under the protection of the SL for consignments 
of 400 or 500 kg and guarantee its transport to the airstrips 
where Colombian light aircraft land and take off. 
  Even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the document 
-- 
possibly due to the context in which it was written, with his 
captors present and the need to use a "diplomatic language" 
given the present circumstances -- it does not refer to the 
"harsh blows" dealt to the Armed Forces, which were hitherto 
considered as the main stanchion of the three mountains. 
Neither does it refer to "the generals specialized in defeat," 
as he did in previous documents when, using an impassioned 
language, he deceived his followers into believing that an SL 
victory was imminent. 
  During the 11 years the Armed Forces have combated terrorist 
subversion, they had a little more than 800 casualties -- merely 
0.7 percent of their personnel. Losses suffered by the PNP 
[Peruvian National Police] during subversive actions total 1,500 
-- nearly 1.3 percent of its personnel. If we look at the 
situation that faced the Armed Forces in relation with society 
and the state in general before they engaged in the fight 
against terrorism, we can see that the situation has greatly 
improved. Deployment throughout the interior has been stepped 
up as have the advantages they achieved in the emergency areas 
and in the Military Political Commands are countless. They also 
played a decisive role by taking on in the true ruling of the 
country -- if we leave aside all euphemisms. 
  Abimael Guzman is right when he says there has been a 
centralization of power, which in turn has strengthened the 
conditions ("formed the basis" in SL jargon) for the "successful 
development of a bureaucratic capitalism." Guzman believes a 
long- term project and a government to "manage it and implement 
it" have become a state "need" (and therefore, there is nothing 
we can do but accept it). He is completely mistaken on this 
point. The need to maintain the current correlation between 
military commands and Fujimori's reelection may surely be urgent 
for some, but not for the entire Peruvian society. 
  Cynically, he notes that the people advocate peace and 
answers that "he realizes the need...." The truth is that for a 
long time his so-called people's war has been rejected and 
caused resentment among the absolute majority of the population. 
What does he want? Did the cowardly murderers of Maria Elena 
Moyano, of the children of the Ashaninka Indians whose throats 
were sliced, or the car-bomb in Tarata create support for his 
fundamentalist craziness and his interminable desire for power? 
  About 1,300 mayors and councilmen -- including candidates 
for 
those positions -- thousands of humble peasants, lieutenant 
governors, and community leaders as well as hundreds of 
teachers, and district and union leaders have been murdered in a 
cowardly manner; some of them out of rage, by SL detachments who 
put into practice the "Great Military Plan" meticulously 
prepared in Guzman's morbid mind. 
  Thousands of youngsters who became fanatics through the 
"thoughts of President Gonzalo" were tortured, killed or are 
missing. Many others were killed in clashes with the police. 
Undoubtedly, also thousands of innocent individuals were 
jailed, are missing, or were shot in their heads and buried in 
clandestine graves. 
  But don't let that lead to confusion. We do not want to put 
at the same level the action of terrorism and the violation of 
human rights by the Armed Forces. The spark that started the 
fire was purposely programmed by Guzman. His objective was to 
set the meadows on fire. For a long time the Armed Forces, in 
their effort to put out the fire, made the mistake of throwing 
fuel instead of water. 
  Everything that has happened cannot be erased with a simple 
change of language which is now called "diplomatic." The fact 
that now Guzman uses the phrase "Mr. President Alberto Fujimori" 
instead of "sly hotshot who acts as president" does not change 
in the least the past events and the responsibilities of having 
shed blood in our fatherland. 
  In the document, Abimael does not rule out a people's war. 
Curiously enough, he points out that six or seven years are 
required to resolve the problems of today's world and, we would 
add, today's Peru. In a nutshell, Abimael is proposing to 
suspend his armed actions until the second Fujimori 
administration ends. Abimael wants "to form close links with 
the masses" and fight his foes through a hatred based on class 
differences. 
  If we consider Abimael's proposal for "objective 
convergence" 
with the current Armed Forces echelons, and the acceptance of 
the Fujimori administration for "historical needs," against 
whatever -- or whomever -- the neo-SL people fight in their 
effort to get close to the masses? Abimael boasts that his 
followers have always been "politically strong." In a party 
that has fanatic militants who voluntarily express their 
"physical submission" to "President Gonzalo," and a totalitarian 
internal structure, it is not hard to imagine the party's 
effectiveness in the mass struggle. The APRA [American Popular 
Revolutionary Alliance] people from the time of the buffaloes 
and truncheons -- the times of the communist workers guard -- 
will seem like a kindergarten compared to the events in store 
for us. 
  As Abimael admits in his second letter, and confirms in the 
document on which we are commenting, the identity of the SL is 
expressed by the struggle against "revisionism." The SL 
understands that revisionism basically represents accepting 
elections as a way to reach power. Therefore, the work with the 
masses, mentioned by Abimael, does not seek to gain strength for 
future elections. The goal actually involves fighting the 
"electioneers" (the traditional parties, especially the legally 
established left) who are working within the people's 
organizations. 
  All this considered, we reaffirm our stance that, if there 
is 
a transition toward a "war without bloodshed," we will have a 
sort of semi-legal neo-SL, with a shock apparatus linked to 
obscure interests in Peruvian politics until they decide to 
resume "a bloodletting policy." Let's hope we are mistaken!

  [Text] The U.S. Government's unilateral decision to prevent 
the marketing of Venezuelan gasoline in U.S. territory is unfair 
and detrimental to the excellent trade relations which have 
prevailed between the two countries until now. Therefore, we 
must support the actions carried out by the executive branch and 
the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Petroven) to prevent this 
measure from being implemented. 
  The statement was made by Allan Viergutz, president of the 
Venezuelan Oil Chamber, who believes the current situation 
"contradicts those excellent trade relations." 
  Viergutz explained that one of Petroven's most important 
marketing policies has been to guarantee the United States a 
reliable and continuous supply of petroleum-related products. 
This included purchasing and refurbishing a series of 
refineries, oil pipelines, terminals, and distribution systems. 
  Consequently, Petroven is currently one of the United 
States' 
largest gasoline suppliers, and this is why limitations to the 
marketing of Venezuelan gasoline in U.S. territory is undeniably 
an unfriendly action toward our country, which has been one of 
the United States' most reliable suppliers of oil and 
petroleum-related products for more than half a century. 
  "This inexplicable lack of loyalty toward a reliable 
supplier 
of the U.S. economy should prompt us to adopt a harder line in 
our international policy," it was stated by Viergutz. He added 
that, aside from the technical decisions which Venezuela may 
adopt in connection with the EPA decision concerning refined 
gasoline, our country "must adopt aggressive measures through a 
boycott -- not only of oil products imported from the United 
States but also of industrial products. The Venezuelan market 
represents an important element in the U.S. export formula." 
  The Venezuelan Oil Chamber also believes that, in case we 
are 
compelled to seek new clients for our refined gasoline because 
of the EPA's standards, we must counter the measure by importing 
oil products -- which are normally purchased in the U.S. market 
-- from other markets that receive our gasoline. This would 
mean we would use "economic solutions." 
  Meanwhile, the Venezuelan Oil Chamber will adopt the 
necessary actions to sponsor the free marketing of products in 
the United States, given this "change in relations."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- One of the main 
regional integration organizations maintains that the 25 border 
posts along the Central American isthmus constitute an obstacle 
for free trade and movement of people and that some $42 million 
needs to be invested to improve this situation. 
  The Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration 
(SIECA) reached this conclusion in a report on the situation at 
18 of the 24 border posts between the Mexican-Guatemalan border 
and the Costa Rican-Panamanian border. 
  SIECA pointed out that the trade and transportation 
obstacles 
begin with the numerous bureaucratic procedures needed to cross 
resulting from a paucity of human resources, infrastructure, and 
guidelines, and from the lack of common schedules. For example, 
the regular working day in Guatemala, which has five border 
posts, begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 1630 (2230 GMT), 
while the working day in El Salvador begins at 0600 (1200 GMT) 
and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT). 
  SIECA admits that the customs offices could hardly work 24 
hours a day due to the lack of security; it recommends, instead, 
standardizing services and scheduling a regular working day that 
begins at 0800 (1400 GMT) and ends at 2200 (0400 GMT). The 
report also suggests the complete standardization of in-transit 
fees, as is the case in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua. This is not the case, however, in Guatemala and 
Panama because additional charges affect the competitiveness of 
products. 
  As for the facilities, of the 18 offices visited, none is in 
good condition, except the "El Guasaule" office at the 
Honduran-Nicaraguan border. All of the others pose problems in 
the layout out of quarters, offices, warehouses, and stores. 
  Some countries have already begun to channel funds to 
improve 
these "ports of entry." The Nicaraguan Government, for example, 
is investing $14.3 million, donated by the Central American Bank 
of Economic Integration, to modernize such facilities. The 
Costa Rican government, meanwhile, is planning to invest some 
$100,000 for the same purpose. 
  About 5 million people and almost 1.5 million tonnes of 
merchandise go through the Central American border posts each 
year, enduring the bad condition of border infrastructures. The 
poor "surface" of the highways worsens this situation. Very few 
stretches of road near border posts are in good condition. 
  The Central American Commission to Facilitate Transportation 
[Comision Centroamericana de Facilitacion de Transporte -- 
Cocafatra] is considering the possibility of carrying out a 
plan, in the mid term, to refurbish the 24 border posts so that 
they can handle 10 million people and 3 million tonnes of 
merchandise by the year 2000. According to preliminary 
estimates, repairing the existing facilities and building new 
ones will require some $42 million, 80 percent of which the 
countries expect to get from international aid. 
  Cocafatra officials are also analyzing the creation of posts 
with common facilities, which the two bordering countries will 
manage and where all procedures can be accomplished. Cocafatra 
is recommending that a post of this type be in operation by June 
1994, but it did not disclose which two countries would 
participate in this pilot project. 
  The existing facilities would reportedly be used in the 
model 
plan: one facility would house the two countries' customs 
offices, and the other would house immigration. These two 
offices could be combined into a single facility if a binational 
body of trained officers can be formed to minimize bureaucracy. 
  There are five border posts in Guatemala, six in El 
Salvador, 
six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua, two in Costa Rica, and two 
in Panama.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Miguel Carrion] </F>
  [Text] At a meeting presided over by President Joaquin 
Balaguer, the National Development Council (CND) yesterday 
passed the draft Budget of Revenue and Spending for 1994, 
totaling 23,177,451,340 Dominican pesos. 
  Some 18,212,581,705 pesos of that total will reportedly come 
from the general fund, while another 1,834,225,785 pesos will be 
provided by special funds and 3,130,643,850 from outside 
resources. 
  Some 12,156.9 million pesos, 52 percent of the general 
total, 
will be used for regular expenses, while 11,020.5 million, or 48 
percent, will go for capital charges. 
  Acting Budget Director Jose Eligio Jaquez explained that the 
12,156.9 million pesos earmarked for regular spending include 
the Central Government's operating expenditures, amounting to 
7,966.3 million, and interest on the foreign debt, totaling 
1,623.8 million. 
  The official said the budget was drafted in accordance with 
President Balaguer's instructions that it be realistic. 
  "In addition," he said, "we must pay special attention to 
our 
routine contributions to public and private institutions, 
amounting to 2,043.7 million pesos." 
  The institutions receiving the bulk of the allocations are 
the Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE), with 360 million, 
the municipalities, with 406.7 million, civilian and military 
pensions, totaling 274.8 million, and the liquified petroleum 
gas subsidy, amounting to 360.5 million. 
  Of the 11,020.5 million pesos earmarked for capital charges, 
2,799.4 million will reportedly go for agricultural construction 
and plantations, 1,511.6 million for the purchase of machinery 
and equipment, and 2,007.1 million for amortization of the 
domestic and foreign debt. Capital contributions to public 
institutions and enterprises will amount to 4,444.7 million 
pesos. 
  The CDE will receive 1,418.9 million of the latter total, 
while funding for the National Institute of Drinking Water and 
Sewage (INAPA) will total 489 million. The Santo Domingo 
Waterworks and Sewage Corporation (CAAN) will receive 530.1 
million, and the National Institute of Water Resources will have 
1,418.7 million. 
  Another 3,739 million will be used to pay the public debt, 
while education will receive 2,642.2 million, health will get 
2,214.7 million, energy 1,794.8 million, irrigation 1,588.9 
million, and agriculture and fishing 1,439.9 million. 
  Items contained in the draft budget are: the National 
Congress, 98.6 million; the Office of President, 2,909.6 million 
(including 290 million from outside resources); Interior and the 
Police, 1,425.8 million; the Armed Forces, 1,558.6 million; 
Foreign Relations, 1 million; Finance, 6,467.1 million (1,030.1 
million from outside resources); Education, 2,526.5 million 
(135.7 million from outside resources); and Public Health, 
3,026.7 million (172.6 million from outside resources). 
  In addition, the Office of Secretary of Sports will receive 
234.9 million; Labor, 33.5 million; Agriculture, 2,855.7 
million; Public Works, 1,213 million (530.5 million from outside 
resources); Industry and Commerce, 107.1 million (1.2 million in 
outside resources); Tourism, 92.1 million; the Attorney 
General's Office, 102 million; the Judicial Branch, 122.5 
million; the Central Election Board, 255.9 million; and the

  [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
(FMLN) stated that the time is not yet right to take El 
Salvador's name off the list of countries under UN scrutiny with 
regard to human rights violations. According to FMLN Deputy 
Coordinator Marcos Jimenez, the report by independent UN 
Observer Pedro Nikken is an indication that an evident decline 
in respect for human life persists in the country. "The report 
stresses activities by death squads" and calls attention to the 
fact that details with respect to the investigations into the 
murder of several FMLN activists including former commanders 
Francisco Velis, Eleno Castro and Mario Lopez are still not 
known. 
  According to Jimenez, the government is seeking, at any 
cost, 
to have the country's name taken off the list of countries under 
UN scrutiny. However, Nikken's report has put the Alfredo 
Cristiani administration on the spot. He added that that is why 
they are attempting to downplay the content of Nikken's report 
by saying that he did not come to the country. They also point 
out that he based his report on affidavits by several local 
organizations without on- site verification, "which is a 
shameless lie since it was the government's officials themselves 
who prevented Nikken from entering the country." 
  On the other hand, FMLN spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano 
expressed confidence that the International Forum for Culture 
and Peace, which is scheduled to start tomorrow, will contribute 
to accelerating the peace process. He added that the event must 
help overcome delays that are taking place now with respect to 
issues such as land distribution, the reintegration program, the 
National Civilian Police (PNC), and the justice system. He also 
described the arrival of Brian Atwood, representative of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as "a way of prompting 
the Salvadoran Government not to commit fraud during the March 
elections." Finally, Medrano referred to a trip to New York by 
an FMLN delegation that includes Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador 
Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno, who are expected to meet with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.

<F P=106> [From the "The Morning Paper" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] President Carlos Roberto Reina traveled to the 
Swan Islands yesterday to investigate certain strange rumors 
that troops planning to overthrow Fidel Castro were on the 
island and to confirm that only authorized aircraft, boats, and 
other vessels are allowed to transit Honduran airspace and 
waters. 
  [Begin recording] [Reina] One reason for my visit to the 
Swan Islands was to investigate complaints that there might be 
some sort of strange activity going on there related in some way 
to the Caribbean situation. I have gone all over the islands 
and seen what I just told you. Let this serve as evidence to 
deny any suspicions, rumors, or comments that differ from the 
truth. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What strange activities were 
reportedly going on there? 
  [Reina] We were advised by a nearby country that some sort 
of 
armed action against a Caribbean country was being prepared 
there. 
  [Reporter] What country? 
  [Reina] When you speak of the Caribbean, the political 
problem has always been Cuba, the Republic of Cuba, which I hope 
will reenter the inter-American system when the island can meet 
the system's requirements. These complaints had been kept 
secret, but they could surface later and tarnish Honduras' 
image. We do not want our country to be hurt in any way. On 
the contrary, we want Honduran prestige to afford us all 
possible international assistance and worldwide acceptance, 
because democracy is reaffirmed every day in Honduras. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Sonia Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Managua, 17 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- General Humberto 
Ortega, commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS], 
announced his decision today to reduce the Army's presence in 
northern Nicaragua to a "minimum" once the 3-80 Northern Front's 
unconventional forces are disarmed. 
  The "demilitarization" of northern Nicaragua and the 
inclusion of the demobilized in the National Police are among 
the rebels' conditions for establishing a schedule for their 
disarmament within the next few days. 
  Ortega reasserted the Army will reduce to a minimum its 
presence in northern Nicaragua--an area of conflict since the 
past decade when the contras struggled to topple Daniel Ortega's 
government-- after the recontras end the armed struggle. 
  For the first time ever, Ortega admitted that as total peace 
is achieved in Nicaragua "it will become unnecessary for the EPS 
to deploy troops." 
  According to military sources, a meeting between the rebel 
leaders and EPS officers with the mediation of a commission 
formed by the OAS and Catholic Church is scheduled to take place 
on 21 February in the city of Antigua. 
  This will be the first meeting between the rebels and the

High Command, who have been political and military foes since 
the past decade and over the past two years when the "recontra" 
groups emerged. 
  After presenting a military base to the Natural Resources 
and 
Environment Ministry, near km 20 on the Managua-Masaya Highway, 
Gen. Ortega dismissed the possibility of a "fatal deadline" in 
order to achieve results in the talks with the rearmed groups. 
  He said, nevertheless, his desire is to achieve "as soon as 
possible" the demobilization of the main group that is still up 
in arms against Violeta Chamorro's government. 
  Ortega admitted pacification in the north requires economic 
and social programs to deal with the region's high levels of 
poverty and unemployment and to secure means of survival for 
hundreds of rebels who for the second time will lay down their 
weapons. 
  The military chief acknowledged the shortage of jobs in the 
country and the "considerable poverty" this generates; he also 
said "disarmament is not enough," because effective social 
programs must be executed. 
  Ortega, in a letter he sent recently to 3-80 Northern Front 
chief Jose Angel Talavara, guaranteed respect for the lives and 
property of members of the group who immediately lay down their 
weapons. 
  Talavera responded with a list of requests that included 
social and economic demands and the return of government troops 
to their headquarters.

  [Text] Operation "Strong Roads 1994" was hamstrung due to 
Paraguay's refusal to accept the entry of 600 U.S. soldiers in 
our country. Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner 
asserted that this would not have any negative repercussions in 
our relations with the United States nor will the latter 
withdraw its cooperation. 
  The foreign minister remarked that it was totally "absurd" 
to 
think the United States would curtail its aid to and backing for 
Paraguay in retaliation for the government's decision not to 
allow the entry of U.S. servicemen into our country. 
  "Not by any means; that is totally absurd. Our relations and 
cooperation with the United States are very friendly, very 
cordial." 
  "We have established some conditions for the coming of those 
servicemen, as their presence was totally unjustified for the 
public works they were going to build. Therefore, the good 
relations existing between Paraguay and the United States will 
not be affected by this," said the minister in response to a 
question from the press. 
  The foreign minister shared the view that the U.S. response, 
to the effect that it will suspend Operation "Strong Roads 1994" 
here for lack of time while at the same time stating that 
military maneuvers might be conducted in another Latin American 
country, is a contradiction. 
  It should be pointed out that the official U.S. response 
submitted to the Paraguayan foreign minister by U.S. Ambassador 
to Paraguay Jon Glassman contends that "the U.S. Government will 
not be able to conduct military exercises due to a lack of time 
for logistics arrangements, including the dispatching of 
building equipment." 
  Ramirez Boettner then confirmed that the Paraguayan 
Government was not pleased with the U.S. State Department report 
on human rights in Paraguay, which underscores some deficiencies 
on the issue. 
  He stated that our government will give an official response 
to the U.S. State Department next week. 
  "We thought the report had not assessed things in their true 
perspective and, therefore, we are analyzing the points in which 
they deem that human rights have been violated so as to be able 
to give an appropriate answer," he noted. 
  The minister went on to say that the United States 
customarily evaluates the respect for human rights in every 
country, and wondered whether the United States is rated on this 
issue, too.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 17 Feb (AFP) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori accepted on Wednesday the resignation of Alberto 
Bustamante y Bustamante's, president of the Council of 
Ministers. The Presidential Press Secretariat announced that 
Bustamante would be replaced by Foreign Minister Efrain 
Goldenberg. 
  Bustamante, who had been appointed president of the Council 
of Ministers in August, tendered his resignation six days after 
the promulgation of a law that granted military courts 
jurisdiction over the "La Cantuta" case, an incident in which 
human rights were seriously violated and in which members of the 
Peruvian Armed Forces have been charged. 
  The Presidential Palace communique indicated that new Prime 
Minister Goldenberg will assume his post this Thursday while 
continuing to hold his post as foreign minister. 
  President Fujimori also accepted Education Minister Raul 
Victor Alfaro's resignation, who just two days ago denied any 
disagreement in the government regarding the La Cantuta case. 
The new education minister will be Jorge Reyes. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Paloma Boves from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Latin America's problems of democracy and extreme 
poverty have once again come to the fore. During the 
inauguration of the 20th extraordinary period of sessions of the 
Inter-American Cooperation for Development General Assembly at 
the Foreign Minister, OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena 
Soares warned that the downtrodden need much more than just a 
chance to be heard in order to maintain stability and democracy 
in the region. 
  [Begin Baena Soares recording] Just giving the downtrodden a 
chance to be heard is not enough to improve the fate of large 
segments of our society, rescue them from scarcity and 
exploitation, and ensure their full right to live with hope. We 
need sustainable democracy to overcome extreme poverty. [end 
recording] 
  Speaking to 20 Latin American foreign ministers and 34 
special delegates from member countries, Baena Soares warned 
government representatives of the danger that extreme poverty 
and social injustice may break the region's democratic order. 
Recalling the Mexico Declaration, signed in March 1945, which 
emphasizes the right of equal opportunity for all people in the 
hemisphere, Baena Soares hit the nail on the head when he 
affirmed that more progress is made today consolidating wealth 
than in halting the avalanche of extreme poverty and neglect, 
although the growth of these factors dampens possibilities for 
stability, development, and peace, which the countries of Latin 
America require to advance on the path of democracy. 
  As an example, the OAS secretary general said that 230 
million citizens in the region lack the resources to meet their 
basic needs. He stressed that in at least 11 Latin American and 
Caribbean countries, the available firsthand information reveals 
that one-fifth of the population earns less than 6 percent of 
the total per capita income. He noted that even those societies 
that have achieved high levels of production exhibit serious 
deficiencies linked to the displacement of indigenous 
communities, neglected populations, a lack of food and housing, 
high rates of crime and violence, the illegal trafficking and 
use of drugs, and environmental deterioration. 
  Baena Soares noted that among the international community, 
close to 6.5 percent of the labor force in the wealthier 
countries is jobless. The unemployment rate of the hemisphere's 
industrialized countries is almost 7 percent. This segment of 
society, the poorest, must work an average of nine weeks to 
acquire the resources earned in just one week by the richer 20 
percent. Although cold and repetitive, the figures are a cause 
for reflection after almost half a century of OAS assemblies, 
where extreme poverty, injustice, and democracy are recurrent 
themes. The OAS secretary general stressed the need for the OAS 
member countries to ratify their commitment to base the 
preservation of democratic order on an open struggle against 
extreme poverty and on the consolidation of social justice. 
American countries, he said, have the resources to defeat 
poverty. 
  In turn, Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello, who was 
elected president of the extraordinary assembly, stated during 
the inaugural ceremony that Mexico is convinced that the 
people's aspirations for justice and welfare demand an end to 
the backwardness and neglect in which millions of Latin American 
live. That, he said, can only be achieved as peoples and 
governments make new commitments to cooperation and development. 
The war on extreme poverty, Tello concluded, should become a 
priority of the OAS, because inequality hurts everyone.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The 20th OAS 
special session closed here today with a commitment to zero in 
attention on social problems in order to overcome poverty and 
consolidate democracy on the continent. 
  Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello Macias, who presided 
over the meeting, said at the session's closing that "as of 
today, the OAS will tackle the social problems of our nations on 
a priority basis." Tello Macias and OAS Secretary General Joao 
Baena Soares considered the meeting named "Inter-American 
Cooperation for Development" to be finished. 
  The commitment by the 34 OAS members materialized in two 
documents that contain the conclusions reached following two 
days of discussions between foreign ministers and 
representatives at the Foreign Relations Secretariat 
headquarters in Mexico City. On 18 February the delegates signed 
the documents entitled "Commitment To Promote Joint Cooperation 
and Overcome Poverty" and "Framework of General Policies and 
Priorities of Joint Cooperation for Development." 
  The first document seeks primarily to strengthen democratic 
institutions and contribute to maintaining peace and security in 
the hemisphere as a formula for overcoming the poverty that 
affects 43 percent of the population in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. This document urges the "promotion of joint 
cooperation for development as an OAS goal and as a suitable 
tool to support ... local development efforts." The American 
countries committed themselves to promote cooperation "without 
seeking to impose preestablished individual models and by 
valuing direct participation from the communities." The document 
states that "the strengthening of national programs designed to 
meet the basic needs of the population" is necessary to stem the 
poverty problem, particularly regarding the most vulnerable 
sectors of society. 
  The second document pointed out that joint cooperation for 
development will support efforts br OAS states to achieve full 
and sustainable growth. Specifically, the delegates will seek to 
contribute to the eradication of poverty from the continent to 
strengthen the commitment and the consolidation of democracy in 
the area and its institutions. 
  The document is comprised of a framework of priorities for 
the OAS and the Inter-American Council for Integrated 
Development (CIDI). Those priorities include the improvement of 
nutrition and health levels, attention to population issues such 
as family planning, support for education, promotion of 
productive employment, and support for the fight against drugs. 
  The delegates agreed that in order to support the poor 
sectors "other actions are required (such as) insuring larger 
and more efficient social expenditures in accordance with the 
priorities and criteria established in each country." They added 
that the OAS will welcome regional projects that respond to 
multinational initiatives and that facilitate the participation 
of public and private organizations. 
  The OAS offered to give special attention to countries that 
"have faced serious situations of armed violence and that are 
rebuilding their economies." 
  The foreign ministers and officials in charge of development 
programs who attended the meeting agreed to share their 
experiences as well as "to promote technology exchange, the 
broadening of markets, and the mobilization of resources." In 
order to achieve these goals, a coordination mechanism between 
the OAS cooperation institutions and the CIDI will be examined. 
This mechanism will come into force with the Managua Protocol. 
  The Managua Protocol was approved by the OAS General 
Assembly 
in June 1993, although it has only been ratified by Canada and 
Mexico, which ratified it today. That commitment establishes, 
among other points, Inter-American cooperation for development 
as the tool to anticipate crisis and strengthen democracy in the 
area. 
  The delegates also agreed to promote the immediate 
ratification of the Washington Protocol, which includes the 
eradication of poverty as a primary goal of integrated 
development. They reiterated that: "The goals and principles in 
the OAS Charter, namely the ideals of peace, democracy, respect 
for human rights, social justice, solidarity, and integrated 
development, constitute the basis of this organization."

special session. The meeting, which began here yesterday, was 
originally scheduled to close tomorrow following six plenary 
meetings, but the session's conclusion was unexpectedly moved

agreement entitled "Framework of Policies and Priorities for 
Unified Cooperation for Development" was released, which was 
signed by the 34 countries attending the session. There was no 
official explanation on why the agenda was changed, which 
reliable sources attributed only to a "time adjustment."

  [Excerpt] The parliamentary delegation now in Washington, 
does not have an official mandate from the parliament. 
Therefore, it cannot in any way commit the institution in its 
consultations or in any plans or proposals for a solution to the 
crisis, assert the legislators from the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, notably Senators Dejean Belizaire, 
Ebrane Cadet, and Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Neither can this 
delegation discuss the country's future, according to Senators 
Belizaire, Cadet, and Dupiton. Daly Valet filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Valet, in Creole] The parliamentary 
delegation which is holding negotiations in the United States on 
Haiti's political crisis, has no mandate to negotiate on behalf 
of the parliament. This is the position of some senators of the 
ACP, who indicate that the Senate never met in a formal session 
to give a mandate to some senators to negotiate for the purpose 
of making a commitment on the nation's future. Furthermore, 
Senator Firmin Jean-Louis is no longer the Senate's president, 
according to Engineer Dejean Belizaire. Senator Thomas Eddy 
Dupiton maintains the same thing. According to him, it is on 
their own behalf and not on behalf of the parliament that the 
legislators went to discuss national politics in Washington. 
  [Dupiton, in Creole] I am reacting once more regarding the 
delegation. In the parliamentary practices that we observe 
here, any delegation traveling receives a mission from the 
assembly. 
  Several times, even in the case of President Sansaricq, when 
you asked if he traveled on an official trip, we said no, he 
traveled on private visit. 
  That means there can be no formal decisions that commit the 
parliament, because the assembly had no knowledge of the trip. 
  [In French] The entire assembly had no knowledge of the 
trip. The senator spoke with some other senators, telling them 
that he was traveling. We recognize that he is an eminent 
political personality who has the right to establish some 
political contacts during this trip abroad, some contacts that 
could be beneficial for the Senate and Haiti. But he will 
return to share that with the parliament before any deeper 
commitment. One should believe the same thing for the other 
delegations. They cannot return with a solution that commits 
Haitian sovereignty. 
  [Valet, in Creole] Ebrane Cadet, first secretary in the 
office of Firmin Jean-Louis office and also first secretary in 
that of Bernard Sansaricq, goes further in his thoughts. Along 
with the fact that no one was mandated to negotiate on behalf of 
the parliament, he adds that those talks and travels here and 
there will not bring any positive results for Haiti. Senator 
Ebrane Cadet cited as examples the failure in Cartagena, the 
failure of the Washington agreement, and the failure of the 
negotiations resulting in the Governors Island accord. The 
senator is very pessimistic. [passage omitted]. [end recording]

  [Text] The Haitian delegation that has been in Washington 
for more than a week now has been joined by other legislators. A 
number of deputies from the opposition National Front for Change 
and Democracy, FNCD, including three former presidents of the 
Chamber of Deputies, have joined the delegation, which is 
involved in a number of new negotiations with a view to solving 
the political crisis. 
  The Haitian legislators are in Washington at the invitation 
of the State Department. They are Antoine Joseph, Duly Brutus, 
and the legislators from the FNCD -- Edmond Mirold and 
Pierre-Canel Rindal. Two other deputies, Ernst Pedro Casseus and 
Antoine Medard, were due to join them. 
  Moreover, National Education Minister Victor Benoit and 
Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul are also supposed to go to 
Washington. 
  It appears that the U.S. State Department is in this way 
attempting to gather in Washington legislators of all leanings 
represented in the parliament, in order to prompt President 
Aristide to appoint a new prime minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Roberto </F>
Cavada; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Expressions opposing the U.S. blockade of Cuba 
continue to take place in the United States. Yesterday, the 
third Friendship Caravan sponsored by Pastors for Peace got 
under way. Democrat Congressman Charles Rangel is drafting a 
bill to be introduced in the next Congress to counter the 
Torricelli Law. 
  [Begin recording] [Cavada] Minister, there is a bill against 
the blockade by Congressmen Charles Rangel. What is your 
opinion? Are you aware of what it contains, exactly? 
  [Robaina] Yes, we are aware. It is another way of 
....[changes thought] From within U.S. society, spokesmen of 
that society are realizing the absurdity, unfairness, and 
anachronic nature of that measure which not only blockades Cuba 
economically, but also blockades Americans -- in a country 
calling itself the land of liberty. Americans are blockaded in 
travel and investment. It seems to me that it is only fair and 
proper, logical and intelligent that representatives of the 
American people should be the ones bringing the issue to the 
attention of international public opinion. 
  The fact that congressmen like Rangel are doing this is 
simply another step in a road we need many others to travel. 
This is why we stress that there is no number one foreign policy 
priority other than continuing to condemn the unfairness of the 
blockade. This is separate from any conditions set for Cuba. It 
is not a question of conditions for Cuba. The blockade is 
unfair, independently of whatever Cuba decides to do or not to 
do. This is gaining support each day. It has the important 
support of a number of countries. The breaches being made in the 
blockade within the U.S. society are very interesting. [end

  [Text] On 21 February, the newspaper TRABAJADORES features 
an article by journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo regarding the 
effects of the blockade on health services entitled: "If It 
Comes From the United States." 
  The article is based on the research that Nicanor Leon 
Cotayo 
has been carrying out for 15 years on the isolationist policy 
Washington conducts against Cuba. Leon Cotayo discusses several 
issues in collaboration with the Public Health Ministry, 
particularly the finance office. The article is especially 
significant now that the UN Human Rights Commission is meeting 
in Geneva. 
  Because of the blockade, in one year of this five-year 
period, Cuba paid an additional $45 million in health costs. 
Cuba could have bought 180 million liters of milk with that 
money. Nicanor Leon Cotayo points out that this effect of the 
blockade is reflected simultaneously in the increase in the 
foreign debt and a greater outlay of hard currency for excessive 
transportation costs -- in most cases air transportation -- in 
order to ensure the swift delivery of highly critical products. 
Despite these difficulties, the article adds, Cuba has preserved 
its accomplishments in this sphere regardless of Washington's 
systematic efforts to damage our health care system.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel de la Guardia from the "Commenting on </F>
the News" segment] 
  [Text] Many people view the recent measures taken by the 
U.S. Government as strange, but there are some clues to indicate 
the real intentions behind those actions. As of 1 October 1994, 
every immigrant requesting political asylum in the United States 
will be charged $130. A corollary to that measure is that any 
person requesting political asylum will not be granted a work 
permit in the United States for six months following the date 
the petition was filed. 
  Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] officials 
report 
that 364,000 requests have accumulated with 10,000 new requests 
being received each month. The aforementioned measures are 
expected to help expedite processing. At this time there are 
only 150 people who process political asylum and residency 
requests, thus the decisionmaking process takes an unusually 
long time to complete. There are plans to hire more personnel to 
allow the INS to reduce the number of unprocessed requests to a 
normal level. That seems perfectly normal and logical. 
  But there are other considerations. Not all immigrants to 
the United States are unwanted, and political refugee status is 
granted to some with extraordinary ease. One example is those 
Cubans who dare cross the Florida channel in dilapidated sea 
vessels and by the most unusual and risky methods. This a 
politically oriented measure that is part of a crusade to wage a 
negative propaganda campaign against Cuba, a country that has 
adopted a social and political regime not to the U.S. 
Government's liking. The intention is to present these people 
as politically persecuted individuals who have escaped alleged 
repression in their respective countries. In those cases, after 
the newly arrived immigrants have made statements against their 
governments, political refugee status is granted swiftly in 
accordance with laws and dispositions in existence since the 
early days of the Cuban revolution. 
  These Cuban immigrants are not the real targets of the 
recent 
measure to charge $130 for each political asylum request. There 
are mechanisms in the [word indistinct] community such as the 
relatives of the emigres or the counterrevolutionary 
organizations that can provide the money. 
  The real issue is that there are hundreds maybe thousands of 
other immigrants who claim to have been persecuted in their 
countries in order to take advantage of the same benefits 
accorded the Cubans. Among those immigrants who risk their 
lives to travel under pathetic conditions to the United States 
-- also aboard fragile sea vessels -- we can mention the 
Haitians, who flee repression and famine in their country in 
search of a better future in the United States. These displaced 
persons have two monumental stumbling blocks that prevent them 
from being admitted to the northern colossus. The first is that 
they are black, and the other is that they are extremely poor 
with very little education. Such traits make them unwanted in 
affluent North American society, where there are already too 
many blacks who are unemployed, destitute, and discriminated 
against. 
  It is very unlikely that a Haitian fugitive will be able to 
pay the $130 fee, much less be able to wait the established six 
month period to receive a permit that will allow them to work in 
the great northern country. The same can be said of the 
numerous Mexican and other Third World immigrants who seek to 
travel to the United States for economic reasons. Isn't the 
real intention behind the unusual tax quite clear?

  [Text] Jose Raul Amaro, the president of the People's 
Supreme Tribunal, released details of ruling No. 104 of 1994 for 
Guantanamo Province, which stipulates strict sanctions against 
anyone attempting to leave the country illegally through the 
border with the Yankee base in Caimaneras. According to reporter 
Leonel Perez Moya, who is in Guantanamo, the president of the 
People's Supreme Tribunal stated that the new legislation 
establishes policies for the imposition of more severe 
sanctions, although such severity will be be effected within the 
framework of the law without neglecting procedural guarantees. 
  Amaro Salup stated that they are not trying to repress for 
the sake of repression but to dissuade and protect people who 
commit this serious crime, as well as to ensure the safety of 
the border guards and the integrity of national territory.

  [Excerpts] As part of the tour he is making through Villa 
Clara Province [name of province as heard] accompanied by the 
diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba and representatives of the 
Cuban and foreign press, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
today visited the Ernesto Guevara Military Industrial Enterprise. 
  [Words indistinct] today took up most of the time of this 
second day of the tour Foreign Minister Robaina is taking in the 
company of a delegation made up of diplomats accredited in Cuba. 
This time, the effort being made in the area to effect the final 
stage of the coffee harvest successfully focused interest on 
these workers, who have today become -- as Robaina said -- true 
protagonists of Cuban foreign policy. 
  The first spot visited on the tour of the Cienfuegos 
mountain 
range was the Cuatro Vientos area. [passage omitted] 
  The visitors saw proof of these changes at [words 
indistinct], one of the 46 camps belonging to the Youth Labor 
Army and the Escambray Division, which embraces the mountain 
areas of Cuba's three central provinces. [passage omitted] 
  The last place visited was the mountain industrial complex, 
where various articles are produced to meet the needs of the 
inhabitants of these hills. [passage omitted] 
  Late yesterday evening, the fatigue from this intense work 
day did not keep the diplomatic corps and the foreign minister 
from meeting with some of the residents of Manicaragua 
Municipality, Villa Clara Province. [passage omitted] Neither 
did the Don Quixote Equine Reproduction Center, deep in the 
Escambray Mountains, go unnoticed. 
  This work campaign through the interior of Cuba that the 
Cuban Foreign Ministry has undertaken with a large group of 
chiefs of diplomatic missions, a tour which has turned out to be 
motivating and a source of experience, ends in Cienfuegos 
Province tomorrow. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In 1993, more than 100 tons of fuel-oil were saved 
by the biogas plants in Ciego de Avila Province in response to 
the instructions given of taking advantage of renewable energy 
sources. At the closing of 1993, Ciego de Avila Province had 12 
biogas units in use and it is expected that they will increase 
that figure as part of the generalization of an initiative that 
is being implemented in that province. 
  The biogas plants use leftovers obtained from sugar mills or 
cattle manure to produce methane gas which is used for cooking 
at work center cafeterias and homes, for lighting at dairy 
farms, as well as in the metallurgic industry. The largest 
biogas plant in Cuba was built on the island of Turiguano and it 
has the capacity of generating 2,000 cubic meters of methane gas 
per day through the process of fermenting the manure obtained 
from a nearby cattle ranch.

  [Text] The second anniversary of the founding of the 
Ministry of the Interior's Higher Institute was commemorated in 
Camaguey today with a military review. Here is correspondent 
Ileana Borges, linked to our national network, with the details. 
Ileana, good evening! 
  [Borges] Thank you, and good evening. The second anniversary 
of the founding of the Ministry of Interior's Martires de Tarara 
Higher Institute was celebrated with a military review and other 
activities at the institute in Sierra de Cubitas Municipality in 
northern Camaguey. The ceremony was presided over by Julian 
Rizo Alvarez, member of the Politburo and first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey, and included promotions to 
the next grade up, (?and presentation) of the Distinguished 
Service honor to a group of officers, cadets, and workers. 
  Addressing those present, Rizo pointed out that despite the 
short time it has been in existence, the institute is among the 
best in the nation, with energetic and hard-working personnel 
whose work contributes to raising the level of the ministry's 
operative cadres in different specialized domains. Rizo also 
(?pointed out) the important role they play in support of 
agriculture, and (?exhorted) them to participate in an efficient 
and well-organized manner in the planting of [words indistinct] 
crops [words indistinct] after the coming potato harvest, which 
is scheduled to begin in March. 
  The celebration concluded with an exhibition of the young 
cadets' abilities, including the use by a large group of young 
women of several different forms of self-defense, as well as 
action taken by a brigade of special troops against the actions 
of a group of make-believe criminals. 
  The Martires de Tarara Institute prepares specialists in 
police training, counterintelligence, investigative techniques, 
reeducation of prisoners, and reeducation of minors. All these 
specialists also have law degrees. The institute has, among its 
students, [words indistinct] from Ciego de Avila, Las Tunas, 
Holguin, and Camaguey. 
  This is Ileana Borges Diaz of the National News Agency for 
Radio Rebelde's "Exclusive" program.

<F P=106> [Speech by Army General Raul Castro at a ceremony marking </F>
the beginning of the Western Army's training year in San Antonio 
de los Banos on 15 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed Comrades of the Western Army and guests. We 
begin the new training period of the Western Army. The Playa 
Giron border guard fighter plane brigade [words indistinct] and 
to a certain degree the important perfecting process which has 
taken place in the defensive structure of the western part of 
the country. 
  As many of you know, during the second semester of 1993, a 
group of important units of the Antiaircraft Defense and 
Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] and the Revolutionary Navy 
located in this territory became part of the Western Army, which 
elevated considerably the combat capacity and the 
responsibilities of this Army, which defends one of the most 
important strategic areas. 
  This measure, which had been previously taken by the East 
and 
Central Armies, considerably elevates the operational 
independence and the combat capabilities of the main commands of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. It was not for the 
purpose of symbolizing that union which motivated the selection 
of this site for the ceremony. Rather, it was the results of the 
work done by this great unit, which has gathered more than 
enough historic and current achievements to host this important 
ceremony on behalf of the combat glory [words indistinct] it 
joins the long trajectory of heroism in the battle together with 
the dedicated work of thousands of men and women. 
  Almost 31 years ago, on 16 April 1963, in this same spot 
Fidel said that we would not have an air force of weaklings or 
an air force of wealthy children [burguesitos] but a force of 
the people, the best of the people. Today we can say with pride 
that the path set by the commander in chief has been carried out 
fully. Our pilots as well as the rest of the combatants of the 
[words indistinct] have given a solid example of modesty and 
maturity with their understanding and support for the drastic 
reductions that were necessary in this type of a concentrated 
force. This was the same attitude taken by the members of the 
Revolutionary Navy where it was necessary to make cutbacks that 
correspond with the [words indistinct] in a shared manner by all 
our combatants and civil workers. 
  [Words indistinct] the past 25 December, in summarizing the 
good results obtained by this army during its inspection, what 
the last three years have been for all the armed forces in this 
effort and work. More than ever before, it has been an eloquent 
demonstration of the permanent disposition by all the members of 
the FAR to confront any task and of the enormous amount of 
intelligence that our units have. We have been capable of 
fulfilling the difficult challenge that being the armed forces 
of a country with a revolution like ours represents, remaining 
in harmony with the sacrifices and efforts of our people. 
  All of you know, that I am not likely to exaggerate 
achievements and much less to fall into complacency. But I can 
say that what we have seen, together with the officers that have 
accompanied us in the recent tours of the three armies, is truly 
impressive. Not only have we carried out a gigantic effort to 
put the armed forces in shape to successfully confront the 
current economic difficulties, and in continuing its refinement 
and development under these difficult conditions, but we did it 
without affecting the fulfillment of the FAR's missions, which 
can be summarized in the five main goals that we established 
last year. 
  In combat readiness, a vital aspect for the Armed Forces, 
all 
the commands exceeded the results of previous years in the 
elevated number of inspections that were carried out. The work 
that has been necessary to carry out with the technique is 
[words indistinct]. It is enough to mention the millions in 
material conserved or reconditioned, ranging from rifles to 
airplanes. This task being fundamentally completed, we have 
instructed that this experience be employed to preserve the 
costly investment made by the country in agricultural machinery, 
construction equipment, and equipment of other branches of the 
economy, with the goal of continuing their use when we overcome 
the special period, a task in which the first steps have already 
been taken. 
  Tens of thousands of professionals, workers, and rank and 
file soldiers, have dedicated their talents and energy to 
maintain military equipment and weapons in operational, and 
perfect, condition. Just a few days ago, during a visit to a 
great unit of the DAAFAR of the Eastern Army, I recalled the 
ample reference to this effort made by the commander in chief 
during the Eighth Forum [of Science and Technology] especially 
what he said about the difficulties of maintaining airplanes, 
tanks, and the rest of the modern equipment of the armed forces 
in operational condition after three years of not receiving 
spare parts. He concluded by saying that someday history would 
note these heroic deeds. Neither did we forget the tasks of the 
military theater of operations during 1993 in which substantial 
progress was made, despite the limitation of resources; in the 
people's defense tunnels in which the year's goal was exceeded, 
as well as in the projects of more technical complexity. 
  As I have insisted on other occasions, we will continue 
advancing in this direction no matter the circumstances and with 
the available means. The agroindustrial activity directed 
towards self-sufficiency has been a path of permanent priority. 
We can already see important results in this area. As we have 
said on other occasions, except for sugar and salt, which would 
be senseless to produce, we will continue developing the 
production of all other foods. 
  We have already reached high levels of self-sufficiency in 
all the agricultural-livestock sectors. For example, the FAR is 
already self-sufficient in the production of rice in many units, 
as in the case of an artillery regiment of the Eastern Army that 
I recently visited that was 72 percent self-sufficient in 1993. 
It received 22 percent of its needs from the army. It only 
depended on the national economy for the remaining 5 percent. 
Like this unit, there are many other examples. We are also 
giving great attention to aquatic production, which we will 
significantly boost this year because this is an important 
source of animal protein [words indistinct]. 
  All the main commands of the FAR have achieved important 
results in herbal remedies, which has meant a significant 
savings for the country in imported medicines. It has allowed us 
to obtain adequate health levels in our units, where herbal 
remedies currently make up 70 percent of the medicines that are 
used. In a recent visit to the Eastern Naval Base, we were able 
to verify that they are producing 104 of the 109 formulas. This 
allows them to provide substitutes for 93 percent of the 
industrial medicines. 
  That is not all. Our combatants are making an important 
contribution to the country's food program and seeking new ways 
to make the defense expenses weigh less each day on the national 
budget. We have the firm goal of making the armed forces weigh 
as little as possible on the people. In that sense, we are 
advancing toward the goal of self-financing. It is a difficult 
goal but possible to reach in a reasonable period. That is why, 
next year, this goal will be added to the other five we had 
already defined as the main goals. 
  An example of this was the visible progress experienced by 
the Youth Labor Army [EJT] whose combatants without abandoning 
any of the important [words indistinct] in the Turquino plan, 
tobacco production, and many other areas. They have taken on the 
responsibility of cultivating 49 percent of state lands 
dedicated to miscellaneous crops in Havana Province. They are 
working in these farms with only half of the fuel these farms 
had before they were taken over by the EJT. 
  Furthermore, they remain ready to carry out the combat 
missions they are assigned. They must maintain their elevated 
political and moral state and the satisfactory discipline that 
exists in our units under the complex circumstances that the 
country is facing. 
  To achieve these results it does not take an army of 
priviledged people, but an Army that is expressly linked to the 
population, with whom the combatants share their problems and 
difficulties. It is an important example of the FAR's firmness. 
Our three main commands are developing a healthy and fraternal 
emulation with the population. The Eastern, and Central Armies 
have just been challenged by the Western Army, [words 
indistinct] apart from all formalism, it has been an important 
factor in achieving these results; an essential element of the 
defensive power of our country. It is its combatants: the 
millions of prepared men and women, who are determined to take 
up their weapons. 
  This preparation will continue to be the center of our work. 
In 1994, we will consolidate the system of preparation of 
personnel which should allow us to concentrate efforts and 
resources in vital matters. We will continue adjusting the 
preparation of our officers, sergeants, regular soldiers, 
reserves, and the people's militiamen to our current conditions. 
We will continue developing the tactical thought on the basis of 
harmoniously combining the universal with the autochthonous. We 
will continue giving special attention to the living conditions 
of all our combatants and civilian workers, especially to the 
corps of officers, which carries out a decisive role as a solid 
pillar of [words indistinct] made up of men and women with a 
high level of professionalism, modesty, and dedication. 
  Lieutenant Ermis Brooks Chivas recently lost his leg as he 
rescued a group of irresponsible people who attempted to abandon 
the country through the perimeter that borders the Guantanamo 
Base. They entered a minefield. The only demand of this young 
man, who is only 22 years old, was that he be allowed to remain 
active in the FAR as part of the heroic border brigade. Our 
officers are of that type. They are the inheritors of the Mambi 
and rebellious traditions. They are children of a people for 
whom heroism is an everyday occurrence. 
  One cannot be amazed that from a people like ours, in the 
past year, despite the greatest shortages and difficulties of 
the revolution, there was an unprecedented number of new members 
in the the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and the Union of Young 
Communists [UJC] within the country, including the armed forces. 
  This confirms, once again, the statement made by our 
commander in chief that the current moment is the most difficult 
one, but, at the same time, the most glorious of our history. 
[applause] 
  Deeds are demonstrating that time is on our side. To the 
same 
degree that we resist, solidarity increases as well as the 
number of people who, even though they do not totally agree with 
our ideas, are convinced that the Cuban revolution is not at the 
mercy of the reactionary winds and that its deep popular roots 
allow it to confront these winds successfully despite their 
strength. 
  We have difficulties, but we are not at a dead end. We know 
very well what our deficiencies are, where our problems lay, and 
what we have to do to overcome them. We will continue acting 
energetically, analyzing the pros and cons of every decision 
without letting ourselves be provoked, but without allowing the 
initiative to be taken for us in any field. The enemy must 
undoubtedly know that the battle with us is until death. In 
Cuba, they cannot dream of mass surrenders or general 
desertions. [applause] 
  As the commander in chief said in his report to the first 
congress of the PCC about the rebellious army, the FAR has not 
ceased to be the soul of the revolution. To the contrary, we 
have the duty of being one of its most solid pillars. To be able 
to maintain that position in the ranks we must preserve our 
monolithic unity which is based on the ideological firmness and 
the absolute [word indistinct], the revolution, and the 
commander in chief. With the visible results that you have been 
obtaining in all fields, for the solidarity and working spirit 
that we have been able to see in the large number of units that 
we recently visited we are sure that the combatants of the 
Western Army will be the vanguard [words indistinct] for our 
people in the great battles that are ahead of us. 
  On behalf of myself and the commander in chief, I 
congratulate you for the good results obtained in 1993 and I 
ratify my assurance that in 1994 those results be even greater. 
Long live our commander in chief! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] Long 
live our invincible revolution! [Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] 
Socialism or [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "or death"]; fatherland or 
death... [pauses] [Crowd shouts: "We will win!"] [applause]

  [Text] The Sugar Industry Ministry has concluded the 
installation of four turbogenerators in four different power 
plants in Holguin Province, seeking to increase energy 
production and to contribute to the national electricity supply 
system. Two of these generators are already in operation while 
the other two are being installed at the (Tino) Naranjo and 
Urbano Noris mills, to fulfill a program which provides for the 
maximum exploitation of renewable energy sources such as sugar 
cane husks. 
  Moreover, in Guantanamo Province, two other turbogenerators 
are also operating in the Manuel Tames and El Salvador 
industrial complexes, which as of this harvest will have their 
own energy generators. The Manuel Tames complex is in a position 
to supply iteself with 70 percent of its electricity needs, 
while El Salvador can generate four-fifths (?of its current 
electricity needs).

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Jose Alejandro Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Text] [Roque] Jose Alejandro Rodriguez, of the weekly 
JUVENTUD REBELDE, is here with us today to discuss the 
self-employment issue. As you know, this activity has prompted 
many different opinions on whether this activity should be 
allowed in this time of crisis in our country. Alejandro, your 
idea please. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, Juan Carlos. The self-employment activity 
as 
a labor system in the country was implemented some five months 
ago by Decree Law 141. But like anything that breaks the 
routine, anything that introduces something new, the 
self-employment issue has prompted a major conflict in our 
society. 
  [Roque] There are many skeptics... 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. And there are many aspects to discuss. But 
I 
will refer only to the extreme positions. There are those who 
propose an unrestricted promotion of that activity, without any 
control whatsoever. And there are those who are very suspicious, 
fearful, and take this activity as a change in the social and 
economic projection of our social activity. But I think we must 
put this activity on a scale. We must take this self-employment 
as a new activity joining the Cuban labor system. We must take 
it as a feasible alternative, something that will reduce the 
employment problem at this time of recession, and as a 
possibility, an alternative way of providing services and 
consumable goods to the people under severe economic conditions. 
  [Roque] The people must understand that this is the first 
decree, the first measure being adopted, and that all measures 
have to go through several stages. The first stage is to prepare 
the measure and then to publish it. Then it must be implemented; 
the consolidation of the measure will come afterwards. This is 
important because consolidation cannot be achieved overnight. It 
is a process that takes time. 
  [Rodriguez] I agree. But we must also take it in a good 
sense, as a great prospect. We cannot take all the measures 
being adopted in the Cuban economy as a partial solution, as a 
temporary patch-up solution to current problems, but as a 
prospect of how our economy will be designed for the future. I 
think this is very important. All these measures are qualitative 
changes. I am one of those who are convinced of the economic and 
political feasibility of self- employment, although it must be 
submitted to rigorous control and oversight. But I am also 
convinced that it must be submitted to other economic control 
systems, to discipline the work of these individuals who are 
self-employed. I also think that well established and well 
controlled self-employment as a social discipline is a useful 
activity and must be defended. Besides, I think the people will 
appreciate this activity because in the end we will all benefit 
from it. 
  [Roque] Jose, you were just talking about the control that 
must be imposed on self-employed workers. Why? There are those 
who talk about the deviation of state resources. It is true, 
this deviation of resources is a common practice. But why are 
they deviated? 
  [Rodriguez] The deviation of resources must not be related 
to 
the self-employment activity. Sometimes we mistake the images of 
things with the things themselves: the consequences with the 
causes. The deviation is one problem, a weak and vulnerable side 
of our economy that occurs in many areas of the Cuban economy. 
  [Roque] Let us take this under the current situation. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course, deviation of resources can also take 
place in the self-employment area. When there is no stable state 
supply of products to sell, these people could be using deviated 
or illegal resources.... 
  [Roque, interrupting] But we cannot stop being objective. 
This is real. This is taking place, and we cannot avoid it. 
  [Rodriquez] That is right. But what we have, we cannot.... 
[pauses] Since this harmful practice can be reversed, and since 
it can also become common practice, we cannot confront this 
problem in the final stage, when the man is already selling the 
product. I think the control problem affects all aspects of our 
economy; and that must be resolved at the root, at the place 
where the money is deviated. But it is also good to create 
justice, Juan Carlos. We must not be mistaken, because people 
often identify self- employed workers as individuals who only 
want to rob the people through dirty tricks, individuals who 
profit from the people's needs, and individuals who are 
deviating resources. 
  [Roque] That is not always true. 
  [Rodriguez] No. I know honest people and hard workers. And 
Decree 141 was made for those people, for those who want to make 
a living by honest work, perhaps a better living than average 
but a living supported by their work, by an honest and clean 
activity. 
  [Roque] However, honest work demands clear and continuous 
control. How can this be achieved? Is the country prepared for 
strict control of self-employment? 
  [Rodriguez] The first impression is that the country is not 
prepared. But this decree has been in effect for only five 
months. These changes are taking place in a very dynamic way; 
besides, this is a very decentralized activity. It will not be 
resolved by the state council or by any ministry. This will be 
solved at the level of the people's council, or at the municipal 
level. We already have some experience on this. There are 
provinces and there are regions. There are places where 
self-employment activity is more intense, as in Holguin, for 
instance. But this is the place also where it is more rigorously 
controlled, and where there is the greatest will to implement it 
because people are convinced that it is useful and is a way of 
solving many daily and social problems. 
  But the role of the people's council is decisive. The 
council 
must decide on this activity in its territory. The measures are 
written, but they must be fulfilled. There are also other 
control elements. I an certain that in times of absolute 
shortage, of scarcity, it is possible that some people would be 
helping others to sell things, to use illegal resources. But 
there are other aspects as well. We must look at this activity 
in a realistic manner. To the extent that our economy is 
reactivated, as production increases, there will always be the 
possibility that self-employed workers will gradually be 
supplied raw materials and provisions purchased from the state. 
  [Roque] What about the consolidation stage? This is an 
important stage. We can talk about advantages, about the 
negative and positive aspects of a given activity, especially 
when measures are adopted to solve this set of problems, and 
when a new activity emerges, such as the supply of staples by 
the self-employed. 
  [Rodriguez] As for the consolidation stage, obviously there 
are also other control measures. A new decree on violations is 
under discussion. This decree will cover and punish all 
irregularities in this area. I believe a strong oversight body 
will be created. But there is another problem: economic changes 
and tax policy. The self-employed must now pay a minimum tax. 
But this tax is variable, and must be increased in accordance 
with the increase in their income. The income declaration is 
something new for us and is a way to control the self-employed. 
  [Roque] We are now getting to the end of our program. Can 
you 
make a final analysis of the subject we are discussing? 
  [Rodriguez] I simply want to stress the fact that among all 
the transformations taking place in the economic area, 
self-employment represents an alternative that supplements other 
activities. I think it is a useful activity and a way of seeking 
development. It is also an opportunity for a group of persons to 
develop their potentials in a decentralized, simple, and dynamic 
manner, to render services and goods to the people. But this 
activity, to prevent abuses, must be subject to strict social 
discipline and control. It must be demonstrated to society that 
this is an honest activity, and that individual initiatives must 
be promoted, though in a controlled manner, observing the rules 
of cleanliness and of service to society. 
  Today I wanted to talk about the good and honest 
self-employed workers who seek to make a living through their 
honest effort, work, and initiative. 
  [Roque] Everything you are saying creates an economic 
culture, an economic culture the country needs today more than 
ever. But we can also say that this economic culture has not 
been sufficiently assimilated, not only by the people, but also 
by those who are in charge of leading important activities like 
this. 
  [Rrodriguez] Yes. I think we must strive for the development 
of this alternative, of this new activity. We hope it will grow 
healthy and develop well because it is also a way of providing 
alternatives to the people, alternative solutions to our 
problems, of coexisting with them without fear, because I am 
certain that it will not disrupt the current economic policy. It 
is only a necessary supplement of activities, which will make 
economic relations more dynamic. 
  [Roque] Our appreciation to Jose Alejandro Rodriguez for 
participating with us in this program.

under Decree Law No. 141; 61 percent of these are new requests. 
The occupations most requested to date in Matanzas Province are 
wagon worker and preparer of light foods -- the latter of which 
has been temporarily suspended. Independently of the services 
and needs of the Matanzas market that the province's residents 
might meet through self-employment, the state budget also 
benefits, receiving income of over 0.25 million pesos for new

  [Text] On 18 February, Division General Senen Casas, a 
member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, 
praised the progress of the people of Guantanamo Province in 
overcoming the damage caused by severe rains in November. Casas 
Regueiro heads a ministerial commission which includes the heads 
of the Construction and Water Resources Ministries, the Cuban 
Institute of Radio and Television, and the construction 
materials industry. Their visit, which concluded at noon today, 
included socioeconomic projects in Guantanamo and Caimaneras 
Municipalities and farming areas of San Antonio del Sur 
Municipality. 
  Div. Gen. Senen Casas told reporters that the two months 
since the commission's last visit show significant progress in 
recovery efforts and demonstrate the extraordinary efforts of 
Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba construction workers despite 
supply shortages. 
  Senen Casas, who is also the transportation minister, 
relayed 
kudos to the people of Guantanamo on behalf of Commander in 
Chief Fidel Castro; Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces; and the government for the progress they have 
achieved in such a short time; however, there is still much to 
be done. The ministerial commission oversaw the level of 
fulfillment of the recovery effort and the prioritized 
socioeconomic program undertaken following the Politburo 
committee's visit of April 1992.

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On the evening of 17 February, Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis met privately with President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari. Upon leaving Los Pinos Presidential Residence, 
Manuel Camacho stated progress is being made in the right 
direction -- toward pacification -- in Chiapas. In very brief 
remarks, he noted that statements by the EZLN [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] will be respected, because if each statement 
causes controversy, no progress would ever be made in the peace 
process. Jaime Guerrero has filed the following report. 
  [Guerrero] The Mexican Government has confirmed its 
determination to reject violence, which only causes more 
injustice and controls the political solution, following the 
outbreak of violence in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The government of the republic 
will 
continue to favor a political solution over armed confrontation. 
We believe in democracy. [end recording] 
  [Guerrero] The liberation of General Castellanos paved the 
way for direct negotiations between the government and the EZLN. 
During a short tour of the capital, President Salinas stated 
these are times of peace. From his comments, one can infer that 
the Mexican Government is ready to negotiate with the EZLN. 
Negotiations will begin soon. We must understand to be able to 
resolve, the president explained. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] They all deserve respect. That is 
why we must and will undertake the greatest effort to 
understand, to talk, and to resolve the situation. We will do 
all we can to commit ourselves to a future of harmony and unity, 
which we undoubtedly share. We will do all we can to meet our 
promises. [end recording] 
  [Guerrero] The president delivered 2,000 land titles to 
residents of the Ixtapalapa neighborhood, where he said the 
conflict in Chiapas is affecting the poorest of the poor. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We will seek ways to generously 
open the way of humanism. These are times for peace. [end 
recording] 
  The message ended shortly afterward. Salinas de Gortari 
stepped down from the stand into a large crowd to continue his 
activities, which included the inauguration of a school. He said 
he was proud to be the president of the republic.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 19 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari stated today that the Mexican Army's 
support for peace has allowed progress in the search for a 
peaceful solution to the conflict in the southeastern State of 
Chiapas. 
  "The Army, as result of its professional performance, with 
the lives of its members, has allowed us to progress in 
accomplishing something which is the desire of the entire 
population: a definite end to the violence, as well as peace and 
tranquility for Chiapas," the president's message indicated. 
  Salinas de Gortari's address was read by General Arturo 
Cardona Marino, chief of the presidential high command, during 
an event commemorating Army Day that took place on Military 
Field No. 1 located north of Mexico City. 
  The president highlighted the government's decision to 
search 
for a peaceful solution from the onset of the "unpredictable" 
Chiapas events, which represents "a test for all Mexicans. This 
willingness for peace has been possible because the Mexican Army 
performed, and performed well, during the conflict's contention 
and population protection phases," Salinas indicated. [passage 
omitted] 
  The dialogue between the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, is scheduled to begin this coming 
Monday. Camacho Solis was appointed as peace commissioner on 10 
January as a result of an initiative by President Salinas de 
Gortari. 
  "By providing protection to the Chiapas civilian population, 
the Mexican Army and Air Force have carried out their 
constitutional responsibilities," the president stated. Salinas 
de Gortari emphasized that these two military institutions "have 
given evidence throughout the conflict of their discipline, 
unalterable commitment to the state of law, support for peace, 
and loyalty to Mexico." 
  The address also stressed the Mexican Army's contributions 
to 
the health sector, national natural disaster relief, drug 
trafficking, and public order threats. "On this Army Day, please 
receive from the president of the Republic, as commander in 
chief, a most extensive congratulations and, along with this, 
the acknowledgement, respect, and affection of the Mexican 
people," Salinas de Gortari stated. 
  The president headed the ceremony accompanied by National 
Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan and Navy 
Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo, as well as other 
cabinet officials. 
  During the ceremony, Riviello Bazan indicated that the Armed 
Forces "never remember their actions, but rather the spirit and 
mission for which they were created," which is to serve "in 
order for the nation to live in peace." He highlighted that 
"this is the Mexican nation's Army, proud of its origins, an 
Army of men who are loyal, capable, honest, and convinced of the 
postulates ingrained in the Constitution." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Acapulco, Mexico, 16 Feb (AFP) -- Wednesday, the 
Guerrero 500 Years of Indian Resistance Council said it "will 
not take up arms" against the government, but it will support 
the rebels in Chiapas State in "a peaceful and legal manner." 
  Martin Equihua, leader of the Indian group, pointed out that 
approximately 560 representatives from Guerrero ethnic groups 
will begin marching toward the Mexican capital on 21 February so 
as to "not leave the Chiapas Indians without support." The march 
will begin at Chilpancingo, 210 km south of Mexico City. 
  He said this organization "supports" the rebellion started 
by 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) on 1 January, but, 
after meeting with Guerrero Indian communities, it agreed "not 
to take up arms because we are going to follow the path of a 
peaceful and legal organization and to more enthusiastically 
promote the political demands" of the rebels. 
  In a message that did not specify if they were requesting 
military or simply political support, the Zapatist rebels asked 
the Guerrero Council "not to leave them alone" in their fight 
and to take our blood as nourishment." [quotation marks as 
received] 
  In early February, journalist Raymundo Riva told the local 
EL 
FINANCIERO newspaper that there are reportedly 52 groups apt to 
engage in guerrilla warfare in Mexico. These groups could take 
up arms anytime; the probable date of an uprising reportedly 
would be in August just before the presidential elections. 
  Equihua emphasized that the Guerrero peasants will walk 11 
days before reaching Mexico City and will try to meet with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to ask him to create an 
autonomous fund for the development of Indian peoples and to 
keep the official promises to meet Guerrero State's 
socioeconomic demands. 
  The Indian leader added that some 200 Nathuatlaca Indians 
will participate in the 21 February march, along with 150 
Mixtecos, 110 Tlapenecos, and some 100 Amuzgos. These Indians 
live in the mountainous zones of Guerrero and will hide their 
faces behind balaclavas, as the EZLN rebels do. 
  Equihua noted that the march, for which the Council has 
requested support from political organizations and the 56 ethnic 
groups that live in the country, "has no partisan or electoral 
goals."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 18 Feb (EFE) -- 
Peasants and Indians who are members of 278 organizations in 
Chiapas State have asked that the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) be acknowledged as a "belligerent force" and that 
the mayors of 110 municipalities in the region be removed. "The 
acknowledgement would increase the extent of the people's 
participation and would foster solutions for the causes that 
prompted the conflict, which are the same causes that 
precipitated the organizations' mobilizations," Ayala Program 
[Plan de Ayala] Coordinator Carlos Ramos told EFE. 
  The EZLN took up arms in Chiapas on 1 January. It demanded 
that land be given to the people and stated its position against 
poverty and injustice. On 13 January, the Indian Organizations 
Council [Consejo de Organizaciones Indigenas] was established. 
It represents a million peasants in Chiapas, which has 3.2 
million inhabitants. A document issued by the council said: "We 
are making public our unconditional support for the EZLN, and we 
are demanding that the federal government designate the EZLN as 
a belligerent force, because it complies with all the protocols 
of the Geneva Convention." 
  The Chiapas peasants met 15-17 February at San Cristobal de 
las Casas, 780 km to the southeast of Mexico City, and asked 
that the 1992 reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution be 
repealed. Article 27 was one of the pillars of the Mexican 
political system until it was reformed. It regulated the land 
ownership issue, which is one of the main demands of the 
peasants organized in the so-called ejidos community-held lands. 
  The Indian Organizations Council in Chiapas called people to 
hold marches in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Tapachula, and San Cristobal 
de las Casas -- the three most important cities in the state, 
which borders with Guatemala -- on 6 March. Members of two of 
the council's commissions met with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez 
and San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz on Thursday, 
to inform them of the decisions made at their meeting, which is 
the second one held during the past month. 
  The council's social demands include the release of 2,877 
peasants and Indians who were arrested in Chiapas on charges 
related to the struggle for land; the withdrawal of the Mexican 
Army from Chiapas; and the punishment for what they considered 
to be "excesses committed" during the conflict. In the 
political sphere, the council demanded the removal of 110 
mayors, especially 21 mayors who have been charged of financial 
misappropriation; an undetermined number of deputies to the 
Chiapas State Congress; and judges and prosecutors in the 
Chiapas Supreme Court. 
  "We have increased our demands to include the removal of all 
mayors," Carlos Ramos stated. 
  After the 6 March mobilizations, the council is calling all 
peasant organizations in Mexico to a meeting in San Cristobal de 
las Casas on 13 and 14 March and to a national march in Mexico 
City on 10 April -- the anniversary General Emiliano Zapata's 
death. Zapata, who was killed in 1919, has become a hero to the 
peasants who are fighting for land, and the Ayala Program has 
taken his "land and liberty" slogan as its own. 
  The armed conflict in Chiapas, which has been suspended 
since 
17 January, will start a new phase on Monday. On that day, 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis will meet with the EZLN 
delegates to find political solutions to the situation.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 21 Feb (EFE) -- Just 24 
hours before the peace dialogue between Zapatist rebels and the 
Mexican Government begins today, Monday, the Chiapas Supreme 
Tribunal of Justice released 28 Indians who have been imprisoned 
for months, charged with various crimes. 
  The release of Indians who are "imprisoned without 
justification" is one of the main demands of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN), which has been in a state of 
revolt since 1 January. The released Indians have not been 
charged with belonging to the EZLN, although the press thinks 
their release seeks to diminish the conflict of interests 
between the rebel group and the government prior to the peace 
dialogue. 
  Arturo Nazar, president of the Chiapas Supreme Tribunal of 
Justice, said the decision to release the prisoners -- all of 
whom were charged with common crimes -- was made after a 
thorough analysis of the cases. Human rights groups said the 
Indians were charged months ago with robbery, theft of public 
funds, attacking other people, damaging property, raiding homes, 
and extortion, even though in some cases they were not even 
tried. "The peasants and Indians were released according to the 
Law of Suspended Sentence and for having served part of their 
sentences, and not because of the peace dialogue," Nazar pointed 
out. 
  When the conflict first began, the Mexican Armed Forces 
arrested 70 alleged Zapatists and accused them of bearing 
firearms which are for the exclusive use of the Army, homicide, 
and association with criminal intent. On 28 January, the 
Tribunal of Justice released 38 Zapatists following demands by 
the Zapatists and only one week later Congress approved an 
Amnesty Law for the armed groups. At that time, each one of the 
accused paid $330 for his release. The money came from the 
Auxiliary Fund for the Administration of State Justice. 
  There are still 32 Zapatists imprisoned at the Cerro Hueco 
Prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas State, some 700 
km southeast of Mexico City. They should have been released 
after the rebels freed former Chiapas Governor Absalon 
Castellanos Dominguez. The release of those 32 prisoners was 
requested by the rebels when they liberated Castellanos last 
Wednesday, but this request has not been met. Castallanos was 
taken hostage by the Zapatists on 2 January. He was accused of 
starting a repression campaign against the Indians and of 
promoting and supporting the "ladinos" (whites) in committing 
injustices against the Indians. 
  Around mid-January, the Mexican Congress approved an Amnesty 
Law for the Chiapas rebels and other groups who might rise up in 
arms on the condition they turn in their weapons. According to 
Juan Manuel Ulloa, delegate in Chiapas of the Office of the 
Attorney General of the republic, the 32 imprisoned Zapatists 
cannot receive the amnesty benefits because the EZLN General 
Command has not yet turned in its weapons, even though 
Castellanos has been released. 
  It is expected the Zapatists will remind Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis, in the dialogue which begins today, of the 
promise to release the imprisoned rebels, and that they will 
demand compliance, in one way or another, with the commitments 
agreed to before the negotiations begin. 
  The EZLN rose up in arms against the hunger and poverty to 
which 1 million Indians of the state have been subjected for 
years, and against the agrarian policy and repression in Chipas. 
During the first 12 days of the armed conflict, the EZLN waged 
combats with the Armed Forces that left at least 108 killed, 500 
wounded, and 20,000 evicted from their communities.

  [Text] The Independent Front of Indian Peoples [Frente 
Independiente de Pueblos Indios], FIPI, reported "murder 
attempts" today against five Indian leaders in the southern 
State of Oaxaca by municipal policemen from that area. 
  According to a FIPI communique made public in this capital, 
"members of the municipal police" last Sunday attacked Indian 
leaders Juan Rojas, Higinio Roman, Felipe Bolanos, Ezequiel 
Valdez, and Paula Sanchez in front of a public office in the 
town of Temascal, Oaxaca, some 370 km from Mexico City. 
  The policemen "beat and fired high-caliber weapons" at the 
Indian leaders, who are members of the Directorate of the 
Chinanteco, Mazateco, and Cuicateco Regional Council, a branch 
of FIPI, the report added. 
  The communique continued that two Indians "were injured" by 
policemen Ramon Coria, Domingo Vasquez, and Enrique Lara, who is 
the commander of the municipal police in Temascal. These 
policemen were "accompanied by nine other police agents armed 
with machine guns, pistols, and tear gas." 
  According to FIPI, the attack was perpetrated "in 
retaliation" for the occupation of the local municipal office, 
which was taken over last Saturday by residents who demanded 
that the government reinstate the mayor and revise land 
expropriation cases. 
  The State of Oaxaca borders Chiapas, where today a dialogue 
began between the government and the guerrillas to end the armed 
conflict that started 1 January with an Indian rebellion led by 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN).

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning from Mexico" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Three political parties have accepted the EZLN's 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army] invitation to be present at 
the dialogue for peace in Chiapas. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution], candidate, said his party will appoint a commission 
to attend the meeting. The Authentic Party of the Mexican 
Revolution also agreed to attend the dialogue but ruled out that 
its presidential candidate, Alvaro Perez Trevino, will form part 
of its delegation. The Labor Party will also send 
representatives to Chiapas. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate of the 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], said in Acapulco that 
the party's national committee is analyzing the proposal to send 
delegates to the peace talks in Chiapas. He said the party 
supports any initiative in favor of a dialogue and a concerted 
political solution for peace in Chiapas. He added that the 
release of Absalon Castellanos and the upcoming dialogue should 
encourage everyone. The PRI candidate also said he hopes the 
Chiapas conflict will not affect the electoral process in August. 
  Because the National Action Party [PAN] believes that the 
EZLN armed movement is clandestine and uses violence, it has 
rejected the EZLN's invitation to attend the peace talks next 
week. PAN leader Carlos Castillo Peraza said his party will 
only accept the invitation if the EZLN abandons its clandestine 
nature and the use of violence and lays down its weapons. He 
stated that the country can be changed through the policy of 
peace, dialogue, and publicly assumed commitments. He urged the 
EZLN to abandon its violent attitude and respect the lives of 
peasants. He also said the Mexican Army should guarantee the 
human rights of the rebels.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Ortega, special envoy] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 19 Feb (AFP) -- 
A rebel communique released on 19 February states that we the 
Zapatist guerrillas "will not go (to the dialogue with the 
Mexican Government) to ask for forgiveness or to beg," but to 
"demand what everyone has a right to: freedom, justice, and 
democracy." 
  The text of the communique, to which AFP has gained access, 
stressed that the delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) will not go to "beg for charity or to pick up the 
leftovers that fall from the full tables of the powerful" at the 
meeting with the commissioner for peace, to be held on 21 
February. 
  The Zapatists said their demands are good for all Mexicans, 
"for us, the smallest in these lands, those without faces or 
history, those armed only with truth and fire, those who come 
from the night and the mountains." 
  The communique, issued on 16 February in the mountains of 
the 
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, advises that "if lies again 
return to the mouths of the powerful, our voice of fire will 
speak again (...) Right now the mouths of our rifles our quiet 
so we may speak the truth for all." 
  Commissioner Manuel Camacho and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
reported today that the first meeting between the government and 
the rebels will begin on 21 February at the cathedral in San 
Cristobal, but they did not disclose the topics to be discussed 
or the expected duration of the meeting. 
  The rebel message, signed by "Subcommander Marcos," stated 
that "our delegates, disregarding the risk to their lives, will 
go to the established place and will represent, with honor and 
truthfulness, the thoughts and hearts of the men who walk with 
the truth." 
  The rebels ended by saying that at the dialogue they will 
seek "to find a fair and dignified political solution to the 
current conflict, so "the many deaths are not in vain and so 
truth will return to our land." 
  Subcommander Marcos stated that he does not know whether he 
will attend the meeting with the commissioner but said that the 
points stated in the communique are, "in general, the position 
the EZLN will take at the dialogue."

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 20 Feb (DPA) -- The 
delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) who 
will participate in peace talks with Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis arrived today headed by the legendary 
"Subcommander Marcos." 
  The 18 EZLN representatives arrived in three groups from the 
Lacandona Jungle, where the guerrillas have settled since the 
war began on 1 January, in vehicles supplied by the 
International Red Cross. "Subcommander Marcos," whose identity 
is unknown, arrived in the first group, made up of eight 
delegates, accompanied by Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis and 
Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and mediator 
in the conflict. The group, which was greeted with applause and 
shouts from people who gathered at the main plaza in San 
Cristobal, arrived from the nearby town of San Andres Laraizal, 
40 km west of San Cristobal. 
  A second group made up of seven rebels arrived from 
Ocosingo, 
some 90 km east of San Cristobal, and a third group, made up of 
three guerrillas, arrived shortly after noontime (local time) 
from Las Margaritas, 100 km south of San Cristobal. 
  The EZLN delegates gathered at the San Cristobal Cathedral, 
site of the peace talks scheduled to begin at 1100 (1700 GMT) on 
Monday [21 February]. 
  "We will not turn in our weapons, definitely not. We have 
learned from other countries where rebels disarmed and then were 
repressed and exploited again," one of the rebels who arrived 
from Las Margaritas said. 
  All the delegates, including "Marcos," wore EZLN uniforms 
and 
had their faces covered with ski masks or scarves. None carried 
weapons. 
  The cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas is protected by 
three "security cordons," made up of members of the 
International Red Cross, nongovernment human rights 
organizations, and unarmed policemen.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta from the "Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The dialogue for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas 
will begin earlier than originally planned. Although the talks 
between the 19 EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Front] 
delegates headed by Subcommander Marcos and Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis will formally begin today, some meetings were held 
yesterday. 
  According to reports released yesterday and early today, 
three groups were formed to define negotiation mechanisms. 
Although the reconciliation process formally begins at 0900 
[1500 GMT] today, the first phase of the meeting will be private 
and accredited reporters will not be allowed coverage. We do not 
expect to receive any information on the first direct meeting 
between the 19 EZLN delegates, among whom are four women, 
Commissioner Camacho Solis, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
until midday. 
  The EZLN representatives have spent 18 hours inside the San 
Cristobal de Las Casas cathedral, which is now being called the 
cathedral of peace. Standing guard at the cathedral are unarmed 
military policemen, Red Cross volunteers, and members of 
nongovernment organizations. These three circles were 
established on Saturday, and they operate day and night with 
changes every four hours. Working in these circles are 
approximately 450 volunteers, a similar number of persons from 
nongovernment organizations, and approximately 500 soldiers.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>
  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, 20 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- 
The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] delegates arrived 
in this capital today to participate on Monday in negotiations 
aimed at ending the armed conflict, which began in southeastern 
Mexico on 1 January. [passage omitted] 
  Four "neutral" security circles were established in the 
cathedral where the talks will be held with representatives of 
the military police, nongovernmental organizations, the Mexican 
Red Cross, and the International Red Cross. [passage omitted] 
  During the day the members of the EZLN will work on their 
agenda and work plans, Major "Moises" said shortly before 
entering the cathedral. "We are going to seek peace (...) we 
want better answers from the federal government," Lieutenant 
"Camilo" said in Ocosingo Municipality shortly before leaving 
for San Cristobal. 
  In three communiques published by the media on Sunday, the 
armed group said it would not come to this city to ask for 
forgiveness but to demand justice. 
  Shortly before departing to pick up the first group of 
rebels, Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation, stated in a communique that the effectiveness of 
the political solution "lies in a real commitment for change 
that will not endanger the essential principles of the nation 
and the state. We should emerge with new solutions for just 
causes here, but we should also strengthen the state of law. 
Only then will we have solutions and achieve lasting and 
democratic progress." We must respond to the demands of the 
armed group, but we must also respond to the demands of the 
communities in Chiapas who do not belong to that organization, 
to social groups who do not support them, and to an entire 
society which is hopeful but also troubled. [passage omitted] 
There are no deadlines to end the dialogue because "its 
objective is truly building peace, and therefore we are not 
going to make the main aspect -- the political part -- fail due 
to formalisms," Camacho Solis said. 
  The agenda for the talks, agreed upon through indirect 
negotiations, includes economic, social, and political demands, 
in addition to definitively ending the hostilities. The economic 
demands refer to the situation of the Indians in Chiapas, while 
the social demands refer to racism, neglect, and respect for the 
culture and traditions of the Indian people in Chiapas. The 
political demands refer to opportunities for real participation 
by the Indians. 
  Camacho Solis said on 20 February that the agenda includes 
economic, political, and social problems in Chiapas and no 
national topics. He added that national topics will be 
discussed, but no resolution will be issued on them. Camacho 
Solis had said he would allow the participation of EZLN 
representatives carrying weapons or wearing the ski masks that 
the rebel leaders usually wear. "If I must be in front of 
someone carrying a submachine gun or someone who prefers to wear 
a ski mask, I will respect his decision. If he decides to take 
it off, I will also respect his decision," Camacho Solis said. 
  He explained that representatives from the registered 
political parties will attend the meeting and that there will be 
permanent communication with the so-called Plural Group of the 
National Congress for Chiapas in case there is need for another 
government representative at the talks. 
  "If there is a joint conference or a joint communique at the 
end of the first round of talks, it would be an excellent signal 
that we are on the right track," Camacho Solis stressed. 
  Bishop Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, and 
Camacho Solis issued a call to the people of San Cristobal to 
contribute to guaranteeing security during the meeting. After 
announcing the site of the talks at the cathedral, Ruiz asked 
the people to prevent any type of provocations, disturbances, 
partisan demonstrations, or irresponsible actions. In his 
homily, Ruiz said that in view of the importance of the meeting, 
San Cristobal and its main church will be called from now on 
"the city and the cathedral of peace" and urged the people to 
mark their homes with the sign of peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmenta; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] [Sarmenta] The first meeting between the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] delegates and Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis ended a few minutes ago at the Cathedral of 
San Cristobal de las Casas. They spoke to the national and 
international media, which has arrived here in San Cristobal de 
las Casas. 
  Bishop Samuel Ruiz pointed out that yesterday both sides 
basically worked on the mechanisms for the negotiation. 
Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, 
in an act of friendship and great symbolism, both carried a 
Mexican flag to the location of their meeting with the national 
and international media. We must point out that we had access 
to the cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas at approximately 
1730 under tight security measures. All our equipment was 
inspected. There were numerous reporters from various parts of 
the country and the world. 
  Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that in this first meeting they 
basically talked about a dialogue, which has been initiated with 
goodwill. He said there is a high degree of communication 
between the sides precisely to achieve good negotiations. He 
said there is mutual respect. The bishop said both sides 
introduced themselves and translation was necessary because some 
representatives of the EZLN....[three-minute break in reception] 
  [Begin EZLN Subcommander Marcos recording in progress] 
....so that the dialogue is possible. He especially praised 
the work done by the national mediation commissioner, Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz, and his team. He especially congratulated and sent 
greetings to the men and women of the nongovernment 
organizations, who are the ones who are guaranteeing the 
security of our leaders. Subsequently, we talked about how we 
would discuss the points contained in the list of demands, which 
the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee will present 
tomorrow. We talked about the problems at the national and 
state levels and those specifically having to do with the 
peasants and Indians. 
  Today we basically talked about the agenda for the dialogue 
that began today and which we hope will continue tomorrow. 
Members of the committee are willing to listen to the words of 
the federal government. We also believe the commissioner is 
also willing to listen to what the EZLN has to say. That is how 
we prepared everything to initiate the discussion scheduled to 
be held tomorrow. That is what we have to say to the national 
and international media. [end recording] 
  [Unidentified Radio ACIR announcer in Mexico City] That was 
the voice of Subcommander Marcos, who is the official spokesman 
of the delegates and representatives of the armed wing of the 
EZLN. 
  [Sarmenta] Subcommander Marcos said they believe Manuel 
Camacho Solis is willing to contribute to a fruitful dialogue. 
  [Announcer] Subcommander Marcos talked about the topics of 
the agenda that will be discussed tomorrow. I remember that in 
his latest statement, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho said 
that in this peace dialogue they would not talk about any topic 
in the national agenda. There is apparently a victory for the 
EZLN in this dialogue. 
  [Sarmenta] That is true. Manuel Camacho Solis had pointed 
out that in this topic they would not discuss national issues, 
however, he pointed out that he would be willing to listen to 
all the concerns of the EZLN delegates. I can also report that 
a small kiosk was set up in front of the main altar of the 
cathedral. Both sides sat down at a table there. A Mexican 
flag was set up behind the kiosk. We must point out that the 
person who attracted the most attention from photographers and 
cameramen was undoubtedly Subcommander Marcos. The peace 
commissioner spoke later on. He pointed out that they have come 
a long way from war to politics, from weapons to dialogue. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I appreciate Samuel Ruiz' 
hospitality and the respectful behavior shown by the EZLN 
clandestine committee members. 
  You witnessed a very important event a few minutes ago. You 
and all the people who are sitting here owe allegiance to only 
one flag. We all stood up to show our respect to this national 
flag that unifies us all. This dialogue is being held on 
Mexican territory. The EZLN is an organization of Chiapas 
residents who are Mexican -- predominantly Indian -- citizens. 
  The key point of this negotiation is that it allows us to go 
from force to politics. We are going from weapons to dialogue. 
Words, not weapons, are talking right now. There are mutual 
guarantees. That is why we are here. Both parties respect each 
other. We are attempting to find a solution to the conflict 
through the political dialogue channel. This new political 
situation should not be reversed, not only because both parties 
are willing to talk but because it is the will and the demand of 
Mexican society. My media friends, this is what I have to 
report to you at present. Thank you. [end recording] 
  [Sarmenta] After Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis talked Bishop Samuel Ruiz told reporters 
that from now on we will probably be told ahead of time if there 
is to be a news conference or an interview with one of the 
parties at this dialogue. He said, however, that in this first 
meeting with the press the commissioners had expressed their 
points of view but reporters would not be allowed to ask 
questions. We were also informed that the list of EZLN demands 
will be revealed tomorrow, as well as Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis's reply to those demands. 
  [Announcer] Jose Luis, I thank you very much for this 
detailed report on what has just happened at the San Cristobal 
de las Casas Cathedral in Chiapas. This is the peace fortress 
where the first peace and reconciliation meeting is ending right 
now. It is so good to hear the EZLN members and the peace 
commissioner state that they will continue to discuss the topics 
on the agenda tomorrow because this shows that the dialogue is 
to continue. We, as many Mexicans, believe that while the 
parties in conflict sit and talk, words and not firearms, will 
talk. 
  [Sarmenta] Right. At the meeting, the fact that the dialogue 
started with the opportune mediation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and 
that there is mutual respect between the EZLN members and the 
peace commissioner was underscored. 
  [Announcer] However, we are worried about what is happening 
in other areas of Chiapas State. We reported to our ACIR Radio 
Noticias listeners a few minutes ago that the cattlemen and 
people who have had to move from the area because of the 
conflict in Altamirano area in the Chiapas highlands....[pauses] 
We are worried because one of the regents of the Altamirano 
municipal council said the cattlemen had threatened to return 
tomorrow to recover their ranches -- with or without permission. 
There are more than 101 ranches in that area. This prompts 
apprehension because right now that region can be compared to 
very dry grasslands during the hot season -- any spark can set 
things on fire. 
  [Sarmenta] Yes Pepe, we have kept abreast of the events at 
Altamirano. Up to now, the people in the area have not suffered 
any type of physical pressure due to the cattlemen's threats. 
However, we will be attentive to this situation. 
  [Announcer] We will be attentive and I thank you for this 
report. Thank you, Jose Luis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello </F>
Bazan by Ruben Alvarez; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Alvarez] Good day. We are here at the office of 
General Antonio Riviello Bazan, secretary of national defense, 
who has kindly approved of this interview with the Mexican news 
agency NOTIMEX. Good day, General. 
  [Riviello] Good day. 
  [Alvarez] Sir, the talks for peace and reconciliation began 
today in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. What is the 
opinion of the Mexican Army and the secretary of national 
defense regarding this round of negotiations? 
  [Riviello] In the first place, I would like to tell you that 
I thank you for your presence here at the National Defense 
Secretariat, which allows us to convey our views to Mexican 
society. 
  I would tell you that the members of the Army and Air Force 
support the decision of the government of the republic to 
continue the path of political solutions over armed 
confrontation. We believe this is the most appropriate way to 
attain peace and reconciliation in the Chiapas highlands. 
  [Alvarez] What are the measures that the Army will adopt 
regarding the troops based in the area, particularly those in 
the area of conflict? 
  [Riviello] As we have said on various occasions, since the 
day the president of the republic decreed the cease-fire, the 
troops returned to their garrisons in order to preserve the 
security of the towns. Since then, the troops have avoided all 
operating movements [movimientos operativos] that could 
interfere with peace negotiations. 
  [Alvarez] Will the conflict in Chiapas have an effect on the 
Mexican Army? Will it affect the Army's organization, training, 
or reconnaissance of potential conflict areas, for instance? 
  [Riviello] Our legislation is very clear in that regard. The 
Basic Law of the Army and Air Force establishes that to fulfill 
their missions these services must organize, train, and equip 
themselves with the requirements demanded by their missions. We 
have not stopped fulfilling these ordinances. 
  However, these circumstances have given us the opportunity 
to 
assess our deployment and concentration capacity and, of course, 
to train our ground and air troops [one-second break in 
reception] Regarding the areas of potential conflict, I can tell 
you and our compatriots that the security missions encompass not 
only Chiapas but all the national territory. 
  [Alvarez] Gen. Riviello, without a doubt, the Mexican Army 
has contributed since the beginning to create conditions for the 
political dialogue in Chiapas. Do you believe that the media 
have objectively reported the actions of the National Defense 
Secretariat? 
  [Riviello] Since the beginning of the conflict, the National 
Defense Secretariat has issued several communiques explaining in 
a specific and honest manner the information available to the 
public. Now, regarding the media's handling of that information, 
I can tell you that their reporting has been very accurate. 
However, they have carried out their duty from different 
perspectives and according to their opinions. 
  [Alvarez] General, Gen. Absalon Castellanos was finally 
released after 45 days of being held captive. Do you think that 
the release of Gen. Castellanos is a good start for the dialogue 
on peace and reconciliation? 
  [Riviello] I think that this event represents a step 
forward. 
[words indistinct] Castellanos had been held illegally. His 
release reduces the existing tension and improves the 
possibilities of solution through dialogue, which has been the 
offer of the government of the republic. 
  [Alvarez] If you had to summarize, how would you evaluate 
of the Mexican Army's performance during the Chiapas conflict? 
  [Riviello] I believe I addressed that in a previous 
question. I would like to add that the Army and Air Force 
prepare and train continuously to be ready to accomplish their 
missions. These missions include guaranteeing internal order, 
to which they responded efficiently to reestablish peace and 
guarantee the security of the inhabitants in strict compliance 
with the law. 
  [Alvarez] Allow me to ask a somewhat elaborate question now. 
Following the Chiapas conflict, have you considered the 
possibility of reinforcing our country's borders militarily? 
Perhaps not because of the continued speculation about foreign 
participation in the conflict, but because the enormous amount 
of information has shown that our southern border is highly 
vulnerable. 
  [Riviello] As the public knows, the relations Mexico has 
with its bordering neighbors are of total respect and sincere 
cordiality. The borders are in fact quite vulnerable, given 
their geographic characteristics and their length. To reinforce 
them militarily requires an enormous economic and human effort, 
which cannot really be justified by the purpose. I would like 
to remind you that we have always had personnel stationed along 
the southern border to aid in the fight against drug trafficking 
and ensure national security. 
  [Alvarez] General, has the Chiapas conflict had any kind of 
political effect within the Mexican Army? 
  [Riviello] I would say that it has allowed us to reaffirm 
our commitment and loyalty by placing the fulfillment of our 
specific duties above our personal interests for the benefit of 
social peace. This implies the commitment Mexican soldiers have 
to serve Mexico. 
  [Alvarez] Finally, General Riviello, do you believe certain 
human rights organizations have politicized the issue or lost 
their objectiveness? 
  [Riviello] Allow me to say that these organizations are of 
great importance to society and therefore deserve our respect, 
especially those which carry out their duty objectively. Now, 
regarding the possibility that some have politicized their work, 
I would say that they would be making a serious mistake if they 
were to trade such a noble goal for some sort of political 
interest.

  [Text] Quito, 16 Feb (EFE) -- Ecuadoran police have 
discovered an alleged plan of the Colombian "Medellin Cartel" to 
establish a branch in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city, 
from where it was going to distribute drugs to the United States 
and Europe, local media reported today, Wednesday. 
  According to the source, the arrest of Colombian drug 
trafficker Jorge Andrade Caliz during "Operation Victory" a few 
days ago allowed Ecuadoran police to discover the plan. Andrade 
Caliz, who is linked to the "Medellin Cartel," had 372 kilos of 
cocaine when he was arrested. 
  The Ecuadoran Drug Police also arrested Colombians Morlan 
Marulanda Mejia and Victoria Eugenia Hurtado and Ecuadoreans 
Telmo Iturralde Merchan and Cecilia Navarrete Munoz.

  [Text] Quito, 17 Feb (DPA) -- The Ecuadoran Government 
announced it has reached an agreement with the IMF after hiking 
fuel prices to eliminate the fiscal deficit. This agreement is 
the first step to renew foreign debt renegotiations. 
  "We already have the backing for our economic program," 
Central Bank President Augusto de la Torre said after concluding 
his Washington meetings with the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
Inter-American Development Bank. 
  An IMF delegation will visit Quito in March, and it has not 
been ruled out that at the end of the Quito meetings the 
respective letter of intent and a biannual "standby" [preceding 
word in English] agreement could be signed. This agreement would 
allow the government to renew negotiations on the commercial 
portion of its foreign debt. Both the renegotiation as well as 
the service of this $6.5 billion portion have been suspended 
since August 1992, when the liberal government of Sixto 
Duran-Ballen took office. 
  The total Ecuadoran debt, according to the latest official 
reports, amounts to $12.6 billion. 
  The letter of intent will include the Ecuadoran pledge to 
continue its structural reform programs with a government 
reduction, a public spending reduction, and greater reduction of 
the inflation rate that is currently at 29 percent a year. 
  Nevertheless, the constitutionality of the fuel increase, in 
effect since 29 January, is the subject of an appeal before the 
Supreme Court of Justice which could suspend the increase. 
According to the government that "would topple the whole 
economic program."

  [Text] In statements to the Ecuadoran media, Argentine 
President Carlos Saul Menem stated this visit was aimed at 
improving political, economic, and social relations. He 
indicated that his country is going through an in-depth 
modernization process, which might not be the most beneficial, 
but which is undoubtedly showing results and which he plans to 
continue implementing. 
  [Begin recording] [Menem] [Words indistinct] the Ecuadoran 
people with the assurance that our relations will continue 
[words indistinct] in political, economic, and social areas. 
That is why we have come here today and [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Then you are willing to abide by the 
decisions of [words indistinct] 
  [Menem] Of course, of course. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Menem] Well, I am grateful and comforted by your welcome. 
[Words indistinct] I feel for this wonderful people. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Menem] The list includes numerous items. This list includes 
items which we Argentines can exchange and introduce here in 
Ecuador. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, can you comment on the 
relationship 
between the private sector and the state to push the 
privatization process forward? 
  [Menem] Well, that is an issue that depends on the Ecuadoran 
Government and people. Argentina is experiencing an in-depth 
tranformation process. Our model may or may not be acceptable, 
but it has yielded excellent results for us. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Menem] Well, basically, to do things intelligently, 
meticulously, honestly, and with a significant dose of courage. 
[end recording] 
  Subsequently, upon receiving the keys of the city from the 
hands of Quito Mayor [name indistinct], President Carlos Menem 
called for the union of all nations of the great American 
continent in solidarity. He stressed that unresolved challenges 
must encourage all of us to search for solutions to the problems 
of poverty that persist in our society and to provide social 
improvements to society as a whole.

  [Text] Quito, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen and Argentine President Carlos Menem signed in 
Quito today four cooperation agreements and one financial 
protocol worth $45 million to build three roads in Ecuador. 
  The economic, trade, sanitation, and academic agreements 
were 
signed in the Carondelet Palace, seat of the Ecuadoran 
Government, at the end of the Argentine president's official 
visit to Ecuador. 
  Both presidents highlighted the excellent level of 
diplomatic 
relations between their countries during an act in which a 
consortium of Argentine banks granted funds to build three roads 
in the Amazon region. 
  The governments established an agreement for reciprocal 
investment promotion and protection, which became effective 
immediately. They also agreed on the mutual recognition of 
academic grades, certificates, and titles. 
  In a political declaration, Duran-Ballen and Menem 
highlighted increased bilateral links in all fields during the 
first official visit of an Argentine president to Quito. Both 
governments ratified their pledge to bolster and consolidate the 
democratic system in Latin America, defend human rights, and 
boost peace in the area. 
  Both presidents spoke in favor of dialogue and the peaceful 
solution to territorial and political problems that involve 
Latin American countries. They reiterated their support and 
assistance to UN and OAS efforts to maintain world and regional 
peace. 
  In a joint news conference, President Menem denied he 
intends 
to impose an economic model that "has been so successful for 
Argentina," but expressed his willingness to cooperate with 
other governments' modernization efforts. He also downplayed 
the "circumstantial" social outbreak his government had to face 
in Santiago del Estero, which he attributed to the "incapacity" 
and bad administration of local authorities. 
  Menem and his retinue, about 30 people including officials, 
legislators, and businessmen, were seen off by Ecuadoran 
authorities at the Mariscal Sucre Air Force Base in Quito at 
1530 (2030 GMT), bound to Cartagena, Colombia. 
  The Argentine president will rest during the weekend at this 
beach resort, and on Monday he will begin his official visit to 
Colombia.

  [Text] The first political alliance was presented today 
before the Electoral Tribunal Secretariat. It is called the 
United People [Pueblo Unido], and it comprises the PRD 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party], the Labor Party, and the 
Liberal Republican Party. 
  According to Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential 
candidate 
for the alliance, the purpose of this electoral merger is to 
present a program to resolve the country's most pressing 
problems. Perez Balladares also stressed that the possible 
reentry of the former military into politics would pose danger 
to the country. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I respect the right 
that 
members of the military or former members of the military have 
to participate in politics and party politics. Nevertheless, I 
must call attention to the fact that it is dangerous if they 
unite as a power bloc or somehow again become a determinant 
force. Even though this may only be the start of what could be 
the return of such a force, I must draw attention to it, because 
the desperation to attain power could lead someone to resort to 
something we all wish to forget and leave in the past. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, is the 
purge, so to speak, which evidently has been taking place within 
the PRD, designed to ensure that civilian forces lead the party? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe we have instituted an internal 
democracy, which is very evident to the great majority of the 
Panamanian people. This internal democracy has caused 
individuals or people who disagree the party's main ideals to be 
cast aside by the very dynamics of democracy. I do not think we 
have had... [pauses] I do not like the term purge, but we have 
had a continual influx of internal democracy. This is also 
proof positive that we have pledged to maintain this internal 
democracy and to make it effective nationwide the day we come to 
power. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "As of Today" column] </F>
  [Text] There is a constant in Panamanian-U.S. relations, 
perhaps as a result of the superficial visits to which U.S. 
congressmen are so addicted and the prejudices that abound in 
the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA, the DEA, and all 
the apparently countless agencies that gather, process, and 
analyze information on almost anything imaginable. 
  Another reason for this could be the intervention of 
"experts," who frequently visit our country for two or three 
days during which they attend dinners, receptions, cocktail 
parties, and then feel they have the authority to talk about the 
past, understand the present, and anticipate the future of the 
entire region. Despite all their efforts, they have accomplished 
very little. 
  Panama is not what they imagined under the Torrijos, Flores, 
Paredes, or Noriega dictatorships. It is not what is conceived 
through the talent of one limited bureaucrat or another. There 
are certainly many limitations in our country: the burden of 
public debt is unbearable, the administration of justice is not 
perfect, the Legislative Assembly is far from being truly 
representative, the differences within the government coalition 
have made it difficult to effectively conduct public 
administration, and the political class is not precisely 
knowledgeable. 
  Nevertheless, in Panama today, human rights are respected, 
the economy is developing, unemployment has decreased, and 
public security has improved. There is a democratic government 
system and significant progress has been made in the fight 
against drug trafficking, gunrunning, and our country is no 
longer a haven for guerrillas and all kinds of criminals. Please 
understand this!

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 18 Feb (DPA) -- The presence of 
foreign troops in Honduras for military purposes "no longer 
makes any sense" now that the Cold War is over, says Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez. 
  The president said this in reference to the existence in 
Honduras of the U.S. military base at Palmerola in the central 
Department of Comayagua, approximately 80 km from Tegucigalpa. 
  The air force base was installed at the beginning of the 
eighties and was used by the United States to support the 
Nicaraguan contras who were fighting against the Sandinist 
government and the Salvadoran Government which was fighting 
against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
  At present the U.S. Government is still conducting 
operations 
at the base with 1,200 troops, and the base also houses the 
Honduran Military Aviation Academy. 
  Reina Idiaquez said he is examining the existence of the 
Palmerola base from "another context" and hinted that he would 
like the antinarcotics forces to be more active. 
  Honduras has proposed to Washington that it convert 
Palmerola 
into the Central American headquarters of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA). The United States already has two 
radars with which it monitors the flights and boats of South 
American drug traffickers who take advantage of the extensive 
aerial and maritime space of the Honduran Atlantic. 
  The Honduran president made the comment after a meeting 
today 
at the Government House with activists from the ruling Liberal 
Party when one of the participants asked him why he does not 
charge for the presence of foreign troops and use the money to 
amortize Honduras' foreign debt.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirna Lozano; from the "Notivision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Brian Atwood, special envoy of the U.S. Secretary of 
State, has said his country's economic aid to El Salvador may be 
made contingent upon the investigation of illegal armed groups 
by the Joint Group. Commenting on the matter, Presidency 
Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria said it would be a mistake on 
the part of the United States to restrict aid to El Salvador. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] It must help other countries, 
but it seems to me that making this sort of assessment is a 
little premature. I think the United States has so much to win 
or lose in Latin America it will not establish conditions for 
certain actions that someone must carry out. I think that to 
continue the U.S. policy on aid or cooperation would be a grave 
mistake. [end recording] Santamaria said the U.S. Government 
must understand that the work by the Joint Group is based on 
confidentiality. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] The reference framework stated 
it was an investigation based on confidentiality. The commission 
cannot divulge a series of breakthroughs or partial results it 
may have achieved at some time. Therefore, we must also look at 
this from that standpoint. In other words, this is not a matter 
of not wanting to report. Instead, the work carried out by this 
commission has been in some way protected so that, by 
withholding it from the public, they will be spared from any 
difficult situation. Consequently, the other thing the U.S. 
delegate is referring to .... [pauses] nobody can force anybody. 
I already said every country is sovereign. [end recording] 
Atwood also said the United States will continue supporting 
the country regardless of the government that may be elected in 
the next elections. For the presidency minister, the decision 
by the Clinton administration on the matter is part of that 
country's sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Report by William Melendez; from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria 
said today that the government continues its efforts to get the 
country removed from the UN permanent supervision list in 
connection with the human rights situation. 
  The foreign affairs minister believes that the situation 
with 
respect to human rights has changed substantially since signing 
the peace agreements, which generated a series of changes. 
Salaverria says that following that improvement in the 
protection of the right to life the government continues making 
efforts to be removed from the UN list. 
  [Begin Salaverria recording] We will not see El Salvador's 
removal from the list until the end of February or the beginning 
of March. The human rights commission meeting lasts five 
months. [end recording] 
  Salaverria admitted that there are still after effects of 
the 
war that show up as violent acts, but they are of a criminal 
nature. The minister says that the removal of El Salvador from 
the list following the observations by Pedro Nikken, independent 
human rights expert sent by the United Nations, is possible with 
the strengthening of institutions such as the Human Rights 
Ombudsman. 
  [Begin Salaverria recording] We must strengthen our own 
institutions. We have a human rights ombudsman; we a have human 
rights prosecutor. They are strengthening their offices, and 
they are strengthening their techniques. We hope that one day 
there will not be a need for international observation. [end 
recording] 
  The minister said that although results on the efforts to 
place the country in a new stage regarding respect for human 
rights are still not known, several UN member countries have 
expressed their support for the initiative.

  [Text] The first Peace Culture Forum, which brought 
together 14 nations that are enduring or have endured armed 
conflicts, was inaugurated yesterday with a call to change the 
mechanisms of war to those of peace to contribute toward the 
nations' development. 
  Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary 
general, said during his inaugural speech that the participants' 
purpose in the event was "to encourage the reestablishment of 
good sense and equanimity needed to banish war from all corners 
of the world as a means of solving political and social 
conflicts." 
  Perez de Cuellar, one of the promoters of the negotiation 
process that concluded with the signing of the Chapultepec 
Agreement, said: "El Salvador has given Latin America and the 
world an example of the participants' political willingness to 
find peaceful and negotiated solutions to a conflict." 
  Meanwhile, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, UNESCO general director, 
in his video message seen by all the participants, congratulated 
all those who had the sense, courage, and unselfishness to 
achieve peace in El Salvador. Mayor said: "I want to 
congratulate President Cristiani, the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front], all those who put the force of 
reason before the reason of force, those pioneers of the peace 
culture, who are convinced that violence and conflict lead to 
sacrifice and the death of the causes that deserve to be lived 
through education, science, and culture." 
  Mayor expressed that the participating nations' contribution 
of reason and experiences to this forum shall be decisive in 
orienting the debate and analysis. 
  Upon inaugurating the Forum, President Alfredo Cristiani 
expressed his happiness and satisfaction that the nation had 
been chosen for this period of reflection. 
  Nevertheless, FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal said before the 
event's inauguration: "We believe it is not appropriate to hold 
this forum before the elections because it makes the government 
look like it is complying with the peace agreements. Handal 
criticized UNESCO for agreeing to organize and promote the forum 
before the 20 March elections, as this, he noted, gives the 
government party a lead. 
  President Cristiani in this regard said: "It is unfortunate 
that Handal, one of the promoters of the peace process, has 
expressed himself in this manner." 
  After the inauguration, Dr. David Escobar Galindo and 
current 
Presidency Minister Dr. Oscar Santamaria, who were members of 
the government commission that signed the peace agreements, each 
gave a lecture on "The Nature of the Peace Culture" and "The 
Salvadoran Case," respectively. 
  In addition, the Forum, where 80 nations and 140 domestic 
and 
foreign organizations assembled as observers, continues today 
with the topic "Local and Regional Contribution for the 
Installation of a Peace Culture."

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has sent a 
message to President Alfredo Cristiani asking him to hasten the 
implementation of pending points of the peace agreements. 
  According to a UN spokesman, Butrus-Ghali informed a 
visiting 
FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] delegation 
yesterday in New York that he has already sent a letter to this 
effect to Cristiani in which he also urges the president to 
continue exercising his personal authority until his mandate 
ends with a view to fulfilling all pending points of the peace 
agreement. 
  The FMLN delegation visiting the United Nations, formed by 
Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador Samayoa, and Rafael Moreno, 
expressed concern over the delays and the failure to fulfill 
certain agreements concerning the formation of the National 
Civilian Police, the dismantlement of the former police force, 
the return to society of former combatants, and the transfer of 
lands. 
  The FMLN delegates also asked Butrus-Ghali to enforce the 
mandate of the UN Observers for El Salvador mission and 
reiterated their concern over delays in the issuance of 
electoral identification cards in areas of the country where the 
FMLN has its electoral base.

  [Text] San Salvador, 19 Feb (DPA) -- The so-called "Joint 
Group for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups with 
Political Motivations" announced today the start of its 
operations at the national level as part of the process for the 
consolidation of peace in El Salvador. 
  The group, which will be responsible for investigating 
criminal activities committed by illegal armed groups with 
political motivations, better known as "death squads," announced 
in paid ads published in today's San Salvador newspapers that 
since 1 February its offices have been established and it has 
the necessary personnel to carry out its duties. 
  The previously mentioned organization was created by the 
Salvadoran Government with the consent of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali given the increase in the number of "death 
squad-style" murders late last year, which even cost the lives 
of various commanders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front (FMLN). 
  The joint group "invites all people and entities that may 
have any information or are willing to help discover illegal 
armed groups with political motivations to come forward so these 
groups can be eradicated from our country and prosecuted 
according to the law." 
  It also points out that the "confidentiality of information 
provided to the Joint Group for the Investigation of Illegal 
Armed Groups with Political Motivations is absolutely 
guaranteed." 
  The group will investigate all criminal actions attributed 
to 
illegal armed groups committed between 16 January 1992, the date 
on which the peace agreements were signed by the government of 
President Alfredo Cristiani and the FMLN, and March of the 
present year. 
  Among the members of the Joint Group are: Human Rights 
Ombudsman Carlos Molina; Diego Garcia Sayan, chief of the human 
rights division of the UN Observer Mission for El Salvador; and 
two Salvadoran Government representatives. 
  Last Thursday, while visiting El Salvador, Brian Atwood, 
special envoy of the U.S. State Department, said the U.S. 
Government has decided to provide technical and economic support 
to the Joint Group for the eradication of illegal armed groups 
with political motivations from El Salvador.

  [Text] San Salvador, 21 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Monday, 
the Salvadoran Government denied it has lost interest in 
complying with the peace agreements that are pending 
implementation and assured that there are just some delays, 
which it described as "normal." 
  Minister of the Presidency Oscar Santamaria told the press 
that "this government is committed to concluding all agreements 
by the end of its term." He added that "naturally, some of these 
agreements will continue to be implemented beyond that time 
because these are scheduled for beyond the period of 
transition." He noted that there is not an impasse, but a 
dynamic that is appropriate to the peace process, in which there 
are some time difficulties, but which are normal within the 
complexity of the process." 
  The government and the former Salvadoran guerrillas signed 
more than 100 peace agreements on 16 January 1992 in Mexico, 
ending a civil war which had lasted more than 12 years and in 
which over 75,000 persons were killed, according to humanitarian 
organizations. Santamaria added that "we have not reached any 
crisis because we are heading in the right direction 
fortunately," although he admitted that "sometimes we are not on 
schedule, but despite problems, we are advancing." 
  Last week before UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the former 
guerrilla organization now turned political party, claimed there 
were several delays in implementing some peace agreements, which 
are the responsibility of the government, such as rejoining 
civilian life and transfer of land to the former fighters. In 
addition, the FMLN thinks the complete development of the new 
National Civilian Police (PNC) and the definite dismantling of 
the current National Police (PN), which has a military 
structure, is another delay in the peace agreements. 
  For his part, Ghali told the FMLN in New York that he sent 
President Alfredo Cristiani a letter asking him to accelerate 
the implementation of the issues pending from the peace 
agreement. Santamaria insisted that "we are doing this with our 
best political will, and we are not going to back out in any way 
from our commitment." He also accused the FMLN of not 
surrendering all of its weapons yet. Santamaria said the Ghali's 
letter is "welcome," and he affirmed that "the government does 
not see anything negative in it. On the contrary, it reminds us 
that we have agreements pending so that we will not lose the 
impetus we are giving the entire implementation." 
  Santamaria said FMLN representatives went to the United 
Nations not because of an alleged crisis in the agreements, but 
because they wanted to talk with Ghali about the future of the 
peace process following the change of government after the 20 
March general elections. The official added that the government 
has met with the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) to 
coordinate the implementation of the peace agreements, mainly 
those related to the former guerrillas rejoining civilian life 
and the deployment of the PNC. 
  Santamaria made these statements after presiding at the 
graduation ceremony of a new group of PNC officers who will be 
sent to enforce security in various parts of the country where 
there are delegations of the new police corps created by the 
peace agreements.

  [Text] San Salvador, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Police (PN) reported today that one elderly woman was killed and 
seven people were injured in an attack against the Central 
Mortgage Bank (BCH) in downtown San Salvador. A PN spokesman 
explained to NOTIMEX that last night unidentified individuals 
threw a fragmentation grenade near the BCH and the national 
library without causing much property damage. 
  The PN says that the victims were passing the area when the 
explosive was thrown. Authorities identified the elderly woman 
as Agripina Azucena Rivera de Rada, 61. The injured were taken 
to the local hospital where they were given immediate medical 
attention. According to the medical report, they are out of 
danger. 
  The PN also reported that yesterday another group of 
unidentified individuals threw tear gas bombs into a San 
Salvador municipal registry office. Political observers called 
this the first act of sabotage to the electoral process. The two 
attacks took place 30 days prior to the general elections in 
which 2.7 million Salvadorans will elect a president, a vice 
president, deputies, and aldermen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Christian Democratic Party Presidential </F>
Candidate Fidel Chavez Mena by an unidentified reporter; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What are the PDC's [Christian Democratic 
Party] economic proposals within a market economy? 
  [Chavez Mena] We propose establishing conditions for 
creating 
an integrated economy with strong sustained growth, through a 
model of social market economy, characterized by combining three 
areas: free initiative or free competition, social development, 
and citizen participation. We want to create a social market 
economy that combines these three factors. 
  Three areas are important to us. We include investing in the 
people in the first area. We propose four priority programs in 
this area: education, health, potable water, and the ecology. 
  The second area attempts to broaden the business base. It 
strengthens current entrepreneurs and encourages new ones so as 
to broaden the base. To this end, there are four priority sector 
policies. First, encourage cattle raising and agricultural 
production levels; second, medium-, small-, and mini-sized 
entrepreneurs should be supported with fair policies; third, 
there would be a policy for professionals; fourth, the state 
should encourage better academic preparation through the 
supervision of university training. 
  The third idea is to incorporate women into the production 
sector. There is a special emphasis on low-income women and 
peasant women. Women are the head of the household in 63 percent 
of Salvadoran homes, only 33 percent of homes are maintained by 
a couple, and 1 percent are homes where just the man works. Our 
policy is to incorporate women into production activities, 
creating entrepreneurial agents and even banks for women. This 
strengthens the small and the medium-size entrepreneur and 
creates women agents. 
  [Reporter] The government says it has a social market 
economy. What is the actual difference from your social market 
economy? What measures would the PDC implement? 
  [Chavez Mena] To our way of thinking, the difference is that 
the government has seemingly encouraged a structural adjustment 
program to reach greater economic stability levels, which was 
important and has yielded good macroeconomic results. I do not 
question the macroeconomic figures. 
  The structurural adjustment program was applied to resolve a 
problem at the time; however, it is not true that the government 
set down the bases for a social market economy model, it was 
more like an adjustment program that may or may not be done 
within a social market economy program. 
  [Reporter] What is the problem then? 
  [Chavez Mena] Rather than a production economy, a more 
speculative and financial economy was encouraged. To our way of 
thinking, we should maintain all macroeconomic policies that 
have created certain levels of economic stability. It is not a 
question of destroying what works. What is needed is to 
implement extensive sector policies. 
  Exporters of agricultural and other products have complained 
of an absence of sector policies; there really were no policies 
intended to encourage agricultural and cattle raising sector 
activities. The topic of updating industries, which we feel is 
part of the Central American integration, was not included 
either. 
  The presidents made a lot of headway in political accords 
and 
have laid down important principles for the integration process, 
but this should be coordinated with macroeconomic policies. For 
example, basic grains: There cannot be complete freedom of trade 
between Central American countries if all macroeconomic politics 
are not coordinated. The EEC's toughest problem was to solve the 
agricultural sectors' problems. 
  It is true the government achieved certain levels of 
stabilization; what we need today is to encourage the country's 
production. We propose creating new entrepreneurs through 
credits with FIGAPE [expansion unknown] or Fedecredito 
[expansion unknown]. We plan on opening new banks and allowing 
these facilities to compete. It is important to allow foreign 
banks to open but within a regulated framework. If we are going 
to open trade, we need a very aggressive policy so our 
industrialists can begin to improve. 
  Another difference is the need to increase remittances 
[remesas]. Here we have an extraodinary amount that covers the 
$1.4 billion trade deficit. These remittances must be used 
appropriately. How? By offering homes, for example. 
  Production activities must be encouraged, which for one 
reason or another this administration did not do. 
  [Reporter] Where will the funds come from? 
  [Chavez Mena] To implement this program we have drafted a 
budget to cover 1994-99. 
  To this avail we have taken into account several resources. 
First of all, we have taken into account fiscal income, which 
does not require additional taxes. I believe that a lot of 
headway has been made because the tax system has been 
streamlined. Secondly, we have taken into account family 
remittances over the next five years. A third source of revenue 
is international cooperation. The country is going to need 
loans, donations, and honestly speaking hefty international 
cooperation. 
  [Reporter] Taking into account the delays in project 
approvals, especially at the ECC and international organization 
level, are there projects that have already been approved? 
  [Chavez Mena] There are some. From the [Jose Napoleon] 
Duarte administration there were between $1.2 to 1.3 billion 
left in projects, such as overpasses, repairs to the North 
Junction Road, and the continuation of the road toward eastern 
El Salvador. 
  The projects will take approximately 20 months from the time 
the requests are presented and the contracts are signed to when 
the plans are drafted and construction is undertaken. We are 
taking this into account plus the existing volume. Thus, a very 
aggressive foreign policy is needed to gain access to the 
difference in funds required. 
  [Reporter] As part of this aggressive foreign policy, do you 
have at this moment any general idea, for example, on reducing 
the number of embassies and consulates, or obtaining the 
necessary funds to send more qualified personnel abroad? Has 
anyone thought of sending businessmen or economists to get more 
aid? 
  [Chavez Mena] Foreign policy must have a strong economic 
content. During the years I was foreign minister, there was 
greater emphasis on the political side as opposed to the 
economic side. This was due to the war situation. We intend to 
take advantage of all our consular and embassy infrastructure to 
promote our exports and to use that infrastructure more as a 
commercial agent for exporters. 
  [Reporter] If you have an economic plan based on a market 
economy already designed to be put into effect in case you are 
elected, what was last week's "emergency" [emergente] proposal? 
  [Chavez Mena] We consider that there are several problems 
that are urgent, which demand extraordinary measures. We 
believe a plan to control crime is needed. With such a high 
level of insecurity, the problem of encouraging economic 
activity and investment, especially foreign investment, becomes 
even greater. 
  Likewise, we need to freeze basic food basket prices. Supply 
is too low and the market is distorted. When the imbalance is 
so great the idea is to halt somewhat the demand during six 
months to stimulate all participants in the production chain, 
especially in the cattle raising and agriculture sector and in 
the small and medium sized businesses. 
  What we propose, immediately after we take office, is to 
call 
on producers and union leaders to establish a social pact, much 
like in Mexico, which also worked in Bolivia, and not freeze 
basic food basket prices by decree.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose David Guevara M.] </F>
  [Text] If the past is any indication, the phrase "much ado 
about nothing" will sum up the short-term fate of the Third 
Economic Adjustment Program (PAE III). 
  The fact is that this initiative, promoted by the current 
administration since December 1990 and approved by the World 
Bank last June, will be sent to Congress on 14 February and will 
be buried. 
  That is what we gather from President-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres' remarks to LA NACION yesterday. 
  He expressed surprise over the Executive Branch's decision 
to 
send the package of state reforms to the Legislative Assembly, 
"because everyone knows full well that I and the National 
Liberation Party deputies will oppose it in its current form." 
  Figueres reiterated that his opposition to the program -- 
which includes loans totalling $300 million -- stems from the 
fact that it requires the approval of a series of laws which, in 
his opinion, have not been closely examined and would compromise 
the country. 
  Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle announced the night before 
last that the PAE III would be sent to Congress. 
  Social Democratic Deputy Federico Vargas supported Figueres' 
position, stating that "we are about to witness the burial of 
the PAE III." 
  Despite that assertion, Social Christian Legislator Gerardo 
Bolanos said his faction will do everything possible to pass the 
reform package. 
  President Rafael Angel Calderon hopes the same. "The PAE III 
is advantageous for the country," he said. Planning Minister 
Carlos Vargas Pagan reiterated that opinion: "What we are 
sending (to Congress) is what the country needs and what will 
allow it to become a developed nation." 
  Javier Sandoval, assistant director of public credit at the 
Finance Ministry, announced that the only thing certain about 
the PAE III is that as of this month the country has lost $1.43 
million (almost 220 million colones) which must be paid -- 
regardless of whether the program is approved -- by way of loan 
commissions to the World Bank and Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
  A loan commission clause is customary in contracts with 
international organizations. It establishes that 60 days after 
signing an agreement, the debtor country must pay between 0.75 
and 1.25 percent on the sums it has not received.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>
  [Text] Economy Minister Roberto Rojas has announced that 
on 8 February the government contacted Jose Maria Figueres to 
ask him his opinion on the free trade treaty negotiations with 
Mexico. 
  By presidential order Rojas spoke with Figueres' economic 
advisers in order to inform the Mexicans [of Figueres' views]. 
"The president-elect's position is very important to us because 
he has made statements to the effect that he wants to reach an 
agreement with the approval of the private sector, which has 
been our policy," Rojas said. 
  On 9 February Rojas met with President Calderon and assured 
him that he expected white smoke from the following week's talks 
[with Figueres' advisers]. Calderon pointed out that with 
Figueres' approval he will be able to guarantee his Mexican 
counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, that the agreement will 
be confirmed by the Legislative Assembly without any problem 
whatsoever. 
  The agreement has been held back by farm-related 
regulations, 
specifically those that would give Costa Rican meat, sugar, and 
milk access to Mexico's market of 90 million consumers. 
  On 11 February Luis Tellez, Mexico's Assistant Secretary of 
Agriculture, is expected to arrive in Costa Rica, and on 14 
February Rojas will travel to Mexico City to continue the 
process with his counterpart, Jaime Serra Puche. 
  Rojas warned that agreements have already been reached on 
issues such as intellectual property, investments, and a 
well-balanced tariff package. Mexican producers will receive 
the same protection given to Costa Rican producers. "We are 
guaranteeing an active system to resolve any expropriations that 
may emerge." In the industrial sector, he said, there is 
consensus regarding the disproportional tariff system and a 
temporary solution has been established through the original 
regulations. The idea, he concluded, is to have products such as 
textiles accepted as if they were local raw material from the 
countries that signed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA): United States, Mexico, and Canada.

  [Text] San Jose, 19 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- A San Jose court has 
accepted a U.S. extradition request for Cuban citizen Huber 
Matos, charged with allegedly defrauding the U.S. Treasury. 
Huber Matos, who has lived in San Jose since January 1993, is 
the son of Cuban exile leader Huber Matos, owner of a San Jose 
radio station and head of the Independent and Democratic Cuba 
(CID) organization. 
  The extradition request, which was filed by the U.S. Embassy 
in Costa Rica, says that Matos and Juana Mayda Perez Batista are 
accused of "administration irregularities" of a Miami (U.S.A.) 
clinic. Judicial sources said the two Cubans have been charged 
with using "fraudulent methods against U.S. Government agencies 
to charge for fictitious or unnecessary services given to 
patients at a medical center in Miami. 
  According to the records filed with the Costa Rican court, 
Matos faces 21 criminal counts in southern Florida for money 
laundering, 49 for postal fraud, 24 for charging money with 
false documents, and one for conspiracy and violating federal 
laws. Federal Judge Barry Garber issued the U.S. arrest warrant 
against Matos on 23 June 1993. 
  The Costa Rican court handling the extradition request has 
imposed a precautionary measure on Matos banning him from 
leaving the country until a decision is made on his case. 
  A bilateral extradition treaty between Costa Rica and the 
United States exists. It was suspended in January 1993 when the 
Constitutionality Court declared several of its articles 
"unconstitutional."

  [Text] Caracas, 20 Feb (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Foreign 
Ministry has announced in an official communique that Carlos 
Gottberg, the Venezuelan consul general in Colombia, was not 
hurt in a terrorist attack which took place in the Colombian 
city of Medellin early this morning. 
  The bomb explosion at the offices of the Venezuelan 
consulate 
did not inflict any casualties but it did cause serious property 
damage. 
  When informed about the situation, German Carreras Damas, 
the 
Venezuelan ambassador to Colombia, immediately made contact with 
the consular offices in Medellin and requested an explanation 
from the Colombian Government. 
  Foreign Ministry sources told EFE that the Venezuelan 
Government will formally ask the Colombian authorities for their 
cooperation in providing the proper protection to its diplomats 
on the territory of the neighboring country.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Rodriguez] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli denied 
reports stating that the Colombian Army of National Liberation 
(ELN) is receiving economic and military support from Venezuelan 
merchants. 
  The rebels are allegedly creating border commandos to 
operate 
along the border separating Venezuela and Colombia. "I have no 
idea what the reports are based on and I am going to ask where 
they are coming from. This is all based on supposition," he 
said. 
  The Colombian daily EL TIEMPO said that certain documents 
seized from the ELN indicate that the rebel group, with the 
support of Venezuelan merchants, is trying to create a permanent 
military force. Their purpose is to intensify their terrorist 
strategy in Colombia against the state and against Japanese, 
European, and U.S. multinational corporations. The documents 
held by the Colombian newspaper, describing the guerrilla 
organization's military plans and the support they receive from 
Venezuelan merchants, reveal the complicity of a large chain of 
Venezuelan stores in the planning and execution of several 
kidnappings near the border for the ELN. Military intelligence 
analysts, quoted by the Colombian daily, indicate that the ELN 
formed logistics commandos, which have been channeling financial 
resources from Venezuela into Colombia since August 1993. The 
operation is coordinated by a committee the rebels call "Border 
Coordinators" [Coordinadores de la Frontera], which are in 
constant contact with the Venezuelan liaisons promoting the 
insurgent movement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose M. Rojas] </F>
  [Text] The Defense Ministry, through General Rafael Montero 
Revette, has reported that leaders of the bloody 4 February and 
27 November coup attempts have expressed to the government their 
interest in reaching agreements to resolve the current 
situation. Gen. Montero said there are no preexisting conditions 
for dismissing the proceedings against them. Gen Montero, who 
arrived with High Military Command members, met with President 
Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores presidential building. 
  Montero said informal talks have been held with the coupists 
who fled to Peru on 27 November but that these contacts have not 
been held at the Defense Ministry level. There is great interest 
in resolving the problem, not only for those imprisoned in 
Venezuela, but for those living abroad as well. Francisco 
Visconti and other exiles asked about their legal situation and 
were told that everything was status quo. Montero said the 
coupists are willing to return, but the government has not 
established any prerequisites for their return. "No one has been 
told to apply for discharge," he said. This government 
position was also reported to Commander Hugo Chavez, who has not 
been pressured to request his discharge. The minister said he 
has not personally talked to Chavez. "But I know he has every 
intention of helping to solve the detained officers' problem." 
Montero denied Chavez has demanded his proceedings be dismissed 
based on a decision to discharge him. Montero said none of the 
officers have been pressured in this sense. 
  In addition, Montero said the Armed Forces and the 
government 
will help those who ask to be discharged to get a job so they do 
not have any problems. The files of those who do not request to 
be discharged will be studied carefully but none will be forced 
to request it. All of the files are being studied. Some of them 
have been approved and the officers have been released. Others 
will probably be released, too. The Military Justice 
Administration, Legal Advisory Office, and Defense Ministry are 
currently considering each of the files. 
  [Rojas] Will the officers benefited by dismissing the 
proceedings remain in the Armed Forces? 
  [Montero] Probably. 
  [Rojas] Can you guarantee that they will not become a reason 
for division in the Armed Forces should they be readmitted? 
  [Montero] We will first consider who will be reinstated. 
  Montero finally referred to rumors that Venezuelan 
businessmen support Colombian guerrillas at the border. The 
minister said the Military Intelligence Directorate is 
investigating, but he does not believe there are "Venezuelan 
traitors."

  [Text] Members of the Intervention Board investigating 
Banco Latino have disclosed that they sent a message to Bank 
Superintendent Roger Urbina resigning from their duties at that 
financial institution. Members Julio Santodomingo, German 
Ollar, and Tasalio Cadena were appointed to the Intervention 
Board on 21 January. The three board members said they were to 
have broad powers of administration, disposition, control, and 
surveillance, including all duties that the law and by-laws 
grant to the general assembly, the board of directors, and the 
other bodies of the intervened institution. 
  Nevertheless, the treasury minister reported that the 
executive had decided -- within a special program set up to 
handle the Banco Latino problem -- to appoint an administrative 
board that would cooperate with the Intervention Board. Tesalio 
Cadena, Julio Santodomingo, and German Ollar Sabal rejected the 
appointment, saying that there cannot be an administrator of the 
administrators. In any event, these high-ranking officials 
believe they have fulfilled their duty to the extent possible. 
  [Begin recording] [Tasalio] We are acting in keeping with 
our 
consciences. We were not consulted on this measure. We have 
our self-respect, and that is why we have resigned. 
  [Unidentified reporter] So where does that leave the Bank? 
  [Tasalio] That's the problem of the other board. 
  [Santodomingo] Our priority was to protect the account 
holders. I do not participate in politics. I am not looking for 
a ministry or an economic position. I accepted this position 
only to defend the depositors. [end recording] 
  In any event, the new intervention board must wait for a 
report on the Bank's current status to decide if this financial 
institution can be salvaged or not, although the auditors have 
the last word. Meanwhile, Bank Superintendency Director Roger 
Urbina replied to the members of the Banco Latino Intervention 
Board. 
  [Begin Urbina recording] I have not been officially informed 
of their resignation. If I receive their resignation, another 
intervention board will be appointed; if not, the same board 
will continue, whatever is appropriate. The important thing is 
to do whatever must be done quickly, because we can't lose 
another minute in Banco Latino's follow-up, intervention, and 
possible recovery. [end recording] 
  The Banco Latino situation, far from being solved, is 
becoming more difficult as it will force the Venezuelan 
Government to make specific decisions to punish those 
responsible for this financial institution's crisis. In any 
event, Roger Urbina will not accept the Intervention Board's 
resignation until it is official.

  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez denied press

person who would be responsible for the Banco Latino 
intervention process. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] He was never a candidate. So far 
there are no candidates and that is something that must be 
determined by the president of the Republic. There are some 
persons who, considering the superintendent's resignation, could 
occupy the position. I believe that at this moment it would not 
be fitting for me to start speculating on names. As I said, 
that will be determined by the president after discussing it 
with the Senate of the Republic. [end recording] 
  The finance minister's statements were made after his five 
hour interpellation before the National Congress. He also 
referred to the resignation by Banco Latino's intervention board 
and stated that the creation of an administration board will not 
undermine the authority of those who are already involved. 
According to him, it is only a manner of expediting the entire 
process. In conclusion, he did not discard the possibility that 
Fogade's [Deposit Guarantee Fund] financial assistance to some 
banks could be eliminated. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] We would first have to determine what 
the situation is, because transient financial assistance which, 
let's say, does not increase, could help to stabilize a specific 
situation. However, I believe that financial assistance that is 
constantly on the rise will undoubtedly lead us to at least some 
type of intervention. [end recording]

  [Text] President Rafael Caldera met a few minutes ago with 
representatives of the Banco Latino Depositors Front, who 
delivered a letter to him demanding that the bank not be 
dissolved, punishment for those responsible, supervision of 
those in charge of the intervention, and a satisfactory solution 
for those savings depositors who have yet to be paid. The 
Depositors Front has thus requested the urgent intervention of 
the president for a prompt solution. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] I would like to tell you briefly 
that the government has not stopped to figure out how much it 
will cost to solve the Banco Latino problem but how and when can 
we obtain the funds to solve it. [applause] If the coffers 
were full and oil receiving a reasonable market price, if we did 
not have the terrible fiscal deficit, then undoubtedly the 
government would not have hesitated to assign all the needed 
funds to solve the problem immediately. 
  There are paths toward a solution, and the most advantageous 
is the one you have suggested. There is the concerned 
solidarity of the Legislative Branch, the executive branch, the 
various public administration organizations, the private sector, 
and public opinion in general to ensure all paths explored will 
be truly efficient. We have ruled out the possibility of 
sensationalist measures that can have an initial impact but will 
fail to lead to a definitive solution. 
  We agree that we should not consider dissolving the bank, 
and 
hopefully it will not come up as an option. [applause] We 
believe there is a way for the bank to recover, a way for the 
bank to establish itself once again on healthy, solid, and 
honest grounds, to be able to save not only the small savings 
account holders but all depositors who in entrusted their funds 
to Banco Latino in good faith. [end recording]

  [Text] The Banco Latino Intervention Board was installed 
today. Gustavo Roosen will preside over the commission until 22 
March, when President Rafael Caldera will appoint a new 
intervention official. Edgar Dao, president of Banco del 
Caribe; Celso Dominguez, vice president of Banco Mercantil; 
(Jack Vera), president of (Fidenes); and German Garcia, manager 
of the Venezuelan Bank of Credit, will accompany Roosen on the 
board. 
  Regarding the specific problems the institution is facing, 
Gustavo Roosen stated that it would be better to reactivate the 
financial institution and get it working again, instead of 
liquidating it altogether. Julio Santodomingo, the intervention 
board's outgoing president, said the body's achievements were 
satisfactory when compared to similar intervention efforts with 
other banks. Roger Urbina, the outgoing bank superintendent at 
the General Bank Superintendency, described other such 
investigations forwarded by the Executive Branch in recent 
years. He said that the measures taken in the Banco Latino case 
are no stronger or weaker than those in any other case. 
  [Begin Urbina recording] During the last few days I have 
repeatedly said that the General Bank Superintendency moved in 
accordance with the law. It abided by the laws ruling such 
interventions when it examined and acted against Banco Latino. 
The examination process was identical to all other bank 
examinations carried out on other financial institutions. If 
this process can be called weak or lenient, then all such 
examinations are lenient. If it is strong, then they are all 
strong. There are no exceptions to the rule, much less with 
Banco Latino. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The trial of the 11 military men charged with the 
disappearance and deaths of nine students and a professor at 
Enrique Guzman y Valle University, also known as La Cantuta, 
started at 0930 today in a specially prepared room in the Simon 
Bolivar garrison building. 
  The civilian parties were not present at the proceedings. 
General Luis Chacon Jara, who presided over the proceedings, 
waited half an hour for the lawyers of the victims' relatives. 
Their failure to appear confirmed their decision not to attend 
and participate in the trial. 
  Despite the secrecy with which the trial is being conducted, 
it filtered out that prosecutor Saul Calledo opened the trial by 
reading a summary of the preliminary proceedings and demanding 
sentences from three months to 20 years for the various accused 
men. 
  Two of the military men, Colonel Guzman Calderon and Gen. 
Rivero Lasso, were interrogated this afternoon. The questioning 
will continue tomorrow at 0900. 
  Two criminologists are of the opinion that, should the 
existing penal code be applied, the maximum sentence that the 
involved military men would receive would be life for the 
clearly typified crimes of kidnapping and manslaughter. 
  The La Cantuta case, which created a crisis in the 
government 
when it was transferred to a military court, is still being 
debated due to the penalties demanded by the military 
prosecutor, Col. Raul Calledo Valdivieso. Several authorities 
have described the penalties as mild because the existing penal 
code is being applied to military law. It has been reported that 
the penalties demanded for the accused range from two to 20 
years for the crimes of homicide, kidnapping, abuse of 
authority, and oversight. 
  According to a comparative chart, simple homicide receives a 
minimum sentence of six years and a maximum of 20 years under 
military law, while under the civilian code such a crime is 
punished with a maximum penalty of life. Under common law 
kidnapping receives at least 10 years, but the crime does not 
exist under military law.

  [Text] As had been announced this afternoon, the military 
court of the Supreme Council of Military Justice handed down 
sentences on the military personnel accused of the kidnapping 
and murder of nine students and one professor from La Cantuta 
University. The sentences ranged from one to 20 years in prison. 
  The military court also decided to acquit Colonel Manuel 
Guzman Calderon when it was established that he had been 
transferred from the command of the university's civic action 
before the crime. At the end of one hour, the length of the 
hearing at the Simon Bolivar military quarters in Pueblo Libre, 
the following verdict was read: Brigade General Juan Rivero 
Lasso, five years in prison and a fine of 50,000 new soles as 
civil compensation in favor of the state; Colonel Federico 
Navarro Perez, four years in prison, payment of civil 
compensation for the same amount; Major Santiago Martin Rivas, 
20 years prison; and Major Carlos Pichilingue Guevara, 20 years 
prison. Both officers jointly will have to pay 500,000 new 
soles as civil compensation. Captain Jose Adolfo Velarde was 
only sentenced to one year prison; this will have been served by 
14 July taking into account time already served. Velarde will 
have to pay 10,000 new soles as civil compensation. 
Noncommissioned officers Pedro Suppo Sanchez, Julio Chuqui 
Aguirre, Nelson Carbajal Garcias, and Jose Antonio Sosa Saavedra 
were sentenced to 15 years in prison each and ordered to pay a 
collective civil compensation of 2 million new soles to the 
victims' legal inheritors. The military court resolved to file 
the legal case against Lieutenant Aquilino Portela who is at 
large. 
  Meanwhile, the military prosecutor and the district attorney 
did not agree with the verdicts, indicating they will file an 
appeal. The sentenced officers, one by one, indicated they 
would appeal their sentences.

  [Text] According to an official communique issued by the 
Supreme Military Justice Council, Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, 
alias El Vaticano, Peru's most powerful drug trafficker, was 
sentenced today by a military court to life imprisonment. He 
will serve this sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he will 
be Abimael Guzman's neighbor. 
  According to a document circulated today by the Supreme 
Military Justice Council, Chavez was sentenced to life and will 
serve it at the maximum security prison at the Callao Naval 
Base, possibly in a cell next to or near terrorist leader 
Abimael Guzman Reynoso. 
  Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, has 
been condemned for treason against the fatherland and the state, 
but he will be tried for illegal drug trafficking in a civilian 
court. El Vaticano, however, will not go the Justice Palace 
offices. Instead, the penal judge will go to the naval base 
installations just as has already been done once, according to 
information given by a military spokesmen. 
  El Vaticano was captured in Cali, Colombia, where he was 
living. According to what has been established, however, he 
continued handling the drug business in the Peruvian jungle. 
The criminal, who is now serving a life sentence, was 
considered Peru's most powerful drug trafficker due to the 
amount of drugs he collected and shipped to Colombia to be 
converted into cocaine for subsequent shipment to the U.S. and 
European markets.

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Feb (DPA) -- It was 
learned today in Santa Fe de Bogota that residents of Tumaco, a 
port on the southern coast of Colombia, have charged that U.S. 
soldiers are allegedly conducting operations in that area. 
  The charges made to EL ESPECTADOR reporters in Narino 
Department, where Tumaco is located, state that soldiers, 
wearing uniforms with the acronym "USA" on them, have even been 
asking residents of the area for their identification papers. 
  According to several residents of that port town, the 
soldiers, who "are tall, well-built, and blond-haired" have 
conducted "sudden patrols" of the town, supposedly while 
conducting antidrug trafficking operations. 
  The alleged actions of the foreign soldiers adds yet another 
ingredient to the problem Colombia is facing because of the 
presence of some 150 U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco, a small town 
located along the Pacific coast but quite removed from Tumaco, 
where, according to official reports, they are building a school 
and health center. 
  The soldiers arrived in Colombia in early January and their 
arrival unleashed a heated debate that included the State 
Council asking congress to investigate President Cesar Gaviria 
for violating the country's sovereignty. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National" newscast; </F>
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff came to cool 
tempers. He assured he committed no irregularities in terms of 
the procedures for having Cali Cartel members surrender to 
justice. He met with Attorney General Carlos Arrieta early this 
morning, and he will meet with President Cesar Gaviria later 
this afternoon. 
  The prosecutor general will meet with the president of the 
Republic in a few hours to explain his position and the 
procedures carried out so far by the Prosecutor General's Office 
regarding the policy governing the surrender of Cali Cartel 
members. 
  After meeting with the prosecutor general, the attorney 
general today admitted there had been a confrontation between 
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's 
Office because of a lack of clarity when charges were issued 
against alleged Cali Cartel members Olmedo Ocampo, Juan Carlos 
Ramirez, and Elmer Herrera. 
  [Arrieta] "State institutions cannot quarrel among 
themselves. It does not make sense. That is what government 
officials are for; that is why we sit down and talk, and when we 
talk, we make things clear and comprehensible. This does not 
mean there are no differences. There may be differences on 
various occasions." 
  On the other hand, the prosecutor general said a preliminary 
investigation continues against the three to uncover any facts 
that may incriminate them. 
  [De Greiff] "A permit or license to act illegally cannot 
possibly be issued in Colombia. It would be monstrous if this 
were possible. You cannot arrest a person just because an 
official thinks he is a criminal, only if you have proof that 
the person is a criminal." 
  The attorney general and the prosecutor general do not rule 
out the possibility that the alleged Cali Cartel members who 
presented themselves at the Prosecutor General's Office could 
have been taking part in a scheme designed to provoke a 
confrontation between the two government institutions. 
  [Arrieta] "We are not dealing with honest citizens or with 
common people. We are dealing with a drug cartel. When you 
negotiate with a cartel, you must start with the assumption that 
all sorts of things might happen. The state must develop the 
ability to understand, prepare itself, and avoid all of their 
tricks." 
  [De Greiff] "We are not going to let them drag us into their 
game. We are going to proceed with the law in our hands and 
with the formalities established by the law in our efforts to 
convict these people." 
  It was also stated that the process for the surrender of 
Cali 
Cartel members remains suspended. Another subject that has 
angered the prosecutor general is the rumors of an alleged 
mediation by the Prosecutor General's Office to put an end to 
the war between the Cali and Medellin Cartels. 
  [De Greiff] "Naturally, the Prosecutor General's Office 
cannot serve as mediator between criminal organizations to stop 
them from killing each other or to achieve peace between them. 
It would be atrocious if that were true. That is not the 
mission of the Prosecutor General's Office, nor would the 
Prosecutor General's Office accept such a mission."

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Credible legal sources have told Emisoras Caracol 
that members of the so-called Cali cartel will not surrender en 
mass because of penal code stipulations, more particularly 
because of the vagueness and ambiguity of Article 389-E, which 
lately has been the subject of a spirited controversy among the 
Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, and 
officials of the Justice Ministry. 
  This recent controversy has prompted lawyers of the drug 
traffickers, who are being accused by authorities, to revise 
their strategy. Therefore, one of the Ordinolas [as heard] and 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela might be surrendering soon. 
  The mass surrenders that were announced at the end of 1993, 
however, following Pablo Escobar's death, will not take place. 
This was fully confirmed to Emisoras Caracol. 
  In the meantime, "Caracol's 0600-0900" learned the United 
States is very concerned about the latest Cali cartel 
developments, and it has virtually suspended all cooperation in 
delivering and providing proof for pending trials of Cali 
cartel's leaders. 
  The refusal to deliver evidence is based on the fact that 
the 
U.S. Government and Justice Department are currently unclear 
about what path Colombian justice will take regarding the 
cartel. If the evidence were to be submitted to the Colombian 
Government, then the opportunity to use it in pending U.S. 
trials of the so-called drug traffickers will be lost.

  [Text] Cali cartel men, who appeared at the Prosecutor 
General's Office, have an extensive criminal record. Even though 
the prosecutor general said they do not have any outstanding 
debts with the justice system, their criminal record is 
extensive. 
  This is Elmer Herrera Buitrago. [video shows still 
photograph of man] The DEA, in one of its reports, calls him 
the drug king. He has been arrested five times in the United 
States for the possession of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute 
drugs, and conspiracy to escape. He served one sentence at the 
Oxford penitentiary. The DEA considers him to be the other big 
Cali cartel associate in charge of distributing drugs in New 
York and money laundering operations. When he appeared before 
the prosecutor general he said he was in fact captured, 
prosecuted, sentenced, and released for these crimes in the 
United States. 
  Jose Olmedo Campo Duque, another one of the three 
individuals 
who appeared before the prosecutor general's office, owns 
properties raided by authorities in several narcotics 
operations. His farm, called Miralindo, was raided during the 
Green Ice and Robledo III Operations. San Francisco de Portugal, 
another one of his properties, was also raided during the 
Robledo II and III operations following the assassination of 
Carlos Galan and the Green Ice Operation. This property is 
currently in the hands of the National Narcotics Council. The 
cars that were confiscated were turned over to the Civil 
Aeronautics authorities. At this same farm, authorities found 
Russian-made weapons, six passports with the same name, and 
savings accounts from banks in Panama, Guatemala, and Miami. He 
was investigated for the killing of a Administrative Department 
of Security agent in 1990 and is still under investigation for 
vehicle theft and robbery. 
  On 2 May 1992, authorities raided his apartment on the 12th 
floor of the (Marley) Building in Cartagena. There they found 
weapons, various caliber ammunition, jewels, and a safe-conduct 
pass for Beatriz Elena Cuervo Londono. This raid was part of 
file No. 95-13 of a Santa Fe de Bogota public court order. The 
strange thing is that this file is under the name of Ivan 
Urdinola Grajales. In the Prosecutor General's Office files, 
this raid appears under another number, 15-156, a file which is 
still in the preliminary stages and which no one is responsible 
for yet. NTC News was able to determine that Jose Olmedo Campo 
Duque is still living on the 12th floor of this building. 
  Today, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he knows 
about the criminal records of the Cali cartel men who went to 
his office, and he added that he does not believe the Cali 
cartel men will surrender in the next few hours. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office confirmed it knows about the 
raids and arrests made abroad against Jose Olmedo Campo Duque 
and Elmer Herrera Buitrago, alleged Cali drug traffickers. For 
the Prosecutor General's Office, however, these actions do not 
constitute enough evidence to link them to criminal drug 
trafficking activities. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] Up until now we have not seen 
any 
evidence against him as a result of those raids. [end recording] 
  Herrera Buitrago said when he testified before De Greiff 
that 
he had been in prison for drug trafficking in the United States. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] If he served a sentence in the 
past, then naturally it is in the past. [end recording] 
  Gustavo de Greiff said Cali cartel drug traffickers will not 
surrender in the next few hours. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] We cannot say it is something 
imminent. [end recording] 
  Gustavo de Greiff said he will meet with the lawyers of the 
Cali drug traffickers and government officials the first week of 
March.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said today that 
the country should not have any illusions over the imminent 
surrender of Cali Cartel drug traffickers, but added that in 
less than a month they will have probably turned themselves in. 
He also reiterated that there are no legal cases pending in 
Colombia against Pacho Herrera [not further identified], but 
that investigations shall continue.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Feb (AFP) -- The daily EL 
TIEMPO, published in Santa Fe de Bogota, reported today that the 
Cali and Medellin cartels, Colombia's two largest cocaine 
trafficking organizations, are negotiating a peace agreement 
after seven years of bloody war. According to EL TIEMPO, 
negotiations began two months ago, just 15 days after an elite 
Army squad killed Medellin cartel's top leader Pablo Escobar on 
2 December. 
  The majority of Escobar's most well-known and violent 
lieutenants are already in prison after voluntarily surrendering 
to justice to obtain the legal benefits granted by a special law 
offered by the government to drug traffickers who turn 
themselves in. Cali cartel leaders, through their lawyers, have 
contacted Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to coordinate 
their surrender to justice. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, representatives from the two 
criminal 
organizations met clandestinely on 11 February somewhere in 
southwestern Valle del Cauca Department, where the Cali cartel 
is based, to negotiate a peace agreement. EL TIEMPO reported a 
pregnant woman was also present at the meeting, representing 
Escobar's widow. 
  After Escobar's death, his eldest son, Juan Pablo Escobar, 
issued a public call for peace to his father's enemies, asking 
them to put an end to the confrontation and offering to talk. EL 
TIEMPO says the Cali cartel practically imposed its conditions 
on the Medellin cartel to end the confrontation because, 
according to a source cited by the daily, "the winner imposes 
the conditions." 
  According to EL TIEMPO, Cali cartel leaders demanded the 
withdrawal of charges against brothers Fidel and Carlos Castano, 
who were accused of perpetrating an attack on a commercial plane 
that exploded on the air with 111 persons on board in December 
1989, from Escobar's men. In their confessions to obtain a 
reduction of their sentences, Medellin cartel leaders reportedly 
accused the Castano brothers, well-known paramilitary chiefs, of 
perpetrating the terrorist attack on the plane. 
  Cali cartel members also demanded that their traditional 
enemies turn over to them a man identified as Julio Mamey, who 
is accused of murdering Antioquia Department Governor Antonio 
Roldan Betancur in July 1989 when a car bomb exploded as his car 
was passing by. Authorities blamed the Cali cartel for Roldan 
Betancur's murder; therefore, the Cali cartel wants Mamey to 
tell the Prosecutor General's office that he received the order 
to kill the governor directly from Pablo Escobar, the Medellin 
cartel's slain chief. 
  The Cali cartel drug traffickers also demanded that the rest 
of Pablo Escobar's men who are still at large surrender to 
justice and serve the sentences issued by the Prosecutor 
General's Office. In addition, they demanded that Escobar's 
fortune be used to help the victims of the terrorism he 
unleashed during the past few years in Colombia. 
  Finally, EL TIEMPO reported that four of Escobar's top men, 
who are currently in prison, have already signed the peace 
agreement.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 20 Feb (DPA) -- Several 
medium-intensity bombs exploded today at the Venezuelan 
Consulate in Medellin and at four political headquarters, 
injuring a child and causing considerable damage. 
  According to official spokesmen, the explosives were planted 
by Communist guerrillas, who over the past few days have 
intensified their attacks in an attempt to sabotage the 
congressional elections scheduled for 13 March. 
  The attacks caused considerable damage at the Venezuelan 
Consulate, two of the ruling Liberal Party's offices, and two of 
the Conservative Party's offices in various areas of Colombia's 
second largest city. 
  Yesterday the guerrillas abducted Deputy Tomas Devia in the 
southern department of Guaviare, and two policemen and one 
soldier were killed during an armed attack in the eastern town 
of Cucutilla. 
  Last week subversives kidnapped Senator Hernando Torres and 
Deputy Victor Buitrago in the central department of Boyaca. 
Campaigning politicians are now demanding that the government 
increase its security measures. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1417 GMT on 20 February transmits a 
50-word report stating the following: "The Colombian Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board today detonated bombs at the Venezuelan 
consulate and four political party offices in the city of 
Medellin. The explosions caused no deaths or injuries, 
according to the Metropolitan Police."]

  [Text] Medellin -- Carlos Gottberg Rivero, Venezuela's 
consul general in Medellin, told the Emisoras Caracol Network 
that he is surprised at the attitude of the terrorists who this 
morning destroyed the Venezuelan diplomatic facility in Medellin. 
  [Begin Rivero recording] My first impression is one of 
surprise, because we are a neighboring country. Venezuela is a 
country that shares common interests with Colombia, a good many 
Colombians live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans 
live in Colombia under conditions of stability and respect. I 
do not have the slightest idea why the terrorists chose to bomb 
this consulate. [end recording] 
  Rivero said the terrorist attacks may be an effort to create 
chaos in the city and to hinder investigations. 
  The Venezuelan consulate in Medellin must be transferred to 
another site due to the magnitude of the damage caused by the 
bomb explosion at 0548 this morning.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 21 Feb (EFE) -- Today, the 
Medellin Bolivarian Militia (urban guerrilla groups) claimed 
responsibility for the dynamite attacks perpetrated early Sunday 
against the Venezuelan consulate and four political party 
offices in Medellin, capital of Antioquia Department in the 
country's northwest. 
  According to police, the clandestine groups of Medellin's 
outskirts, linked to the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
[CNG], claimed responsibility for the attacks because they 
regard the peace negotiations between the government and a 
similar group, the People's Militia, as "treason." 
  Carlos Gottberg Riveros, Venezuelan consul to Medellin, said 
that although he does not know the reason for the attack, "it 
could have something to do with the subversives' interest in 
creating confusion in the city. My first impression is one of 
surprise because we live in a friendly country. Many Colombians 
live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans live in 
Colombia in stability and respect." 
  The bomb attacks only caused damage, estimated at some 
$30,000. The worst damage was sustained by the Venezuelan 
consulate, located in the Manrique-Rosales neighborhood, in the 
western part of Medellin. 
  The Bolivarian Militia of Medellin believe the negotiations 
between the Colombian Government and the People's Militia "are 
an unconditional surrender." 
  The attacks perpetrated in Medellin are part of a wave of 
CNG 
attacks throughout the country, including the kidnapping of two 
parliamentarians and one mayor as well as clashes with policemen 
and soldiers in the outskirts of Santa Fe de Bogota.

Santander municipalities if they attempt to participate in the 
coming elections. 
  The guerrillas' plan to prevent the election process has 
been 
expanded to eastern Santander Department, where the subversives 
have intimidated voters in rural areas. Voter lists were 
destroyed in the area's municipalities and a warning was issued: 
No one will be allowed to go to the voting sites. 
  In the 12 municipalities where guerrilla raids have taken 
place, the rebels have warned that they will control highways 
until election day and will close the area to visiting political 
candidates. 
  The area where the death threat against voters has been made 
includes the municipalities of Surata, Chata, Matanzas, and 
Veta, all of them in eastern Santander, Santa Elena, [words 
indistinct], and Pata, where police have not been allowed to 
enter, and the entire province of Velez, where the guerrillas 
threaten to kill any candidates who attempt to visit the area. 
On Monday the mayors will present a report on the situation to 
the defense minister and the Army commander.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Feb (DPA) -- Military 
sources in Santa Fe de Bogota announced today that individuals 
presumed to be Communist guerrillas kidnapped Colombian Deputy 
Tomas Devia and attacked Cucutilla, a town in eastern Colombia, 
resulting in the death of two policemen and one soldier. 
  The congressman was kidnapped in Guaviare Department in 
southern Colombia by several men who identified themselves as 
members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). 
  The 63-year-old Devia, a member of the ruling Liberal Party, 
is Guaviare's deputy in the Chamber of Representatives and was 
campaigning for reelection in the 13 March congressional 
elections, according to sources close to him. 
  Members of the pro-Cuban Army of National Liberation (ELN) 
kidnapped Senator Hernando Torres and Deputy Victor Buitrago in 
Boyaca Department in central Colombia last weekend. Both men 
were also campaigning for reelection. 
  Meanwhile, government spokesmen pointed out that FARC and 
ELN 
guerrillas staged a joint attack on the town of Cucutilla, 350 
km northeast of Santa Fe de Bogota, where they murdered two 
policemen and one soldier and destroyed a bank and the 
headquarters of the state Telephone Company (Telecom). 
  The police disclosed that 12 members of the ELN were 
captured 
in Antioquia Department in northwestern Colombia during an anti- 
kidnapping operation, among them two of the group's alleged 
ideologists, sociology students Myriam Giraldo and Fabian Masso. 
  It has been announced that the guerrillas' arrest marked the 
culmination of an operation by the police, who had discovered a 
case of self-abduction by a merchant who surrendered to the 
subversives to collect a $6 million insurance policy he had 
purchased abroad.

In Pasca in the southeast and in Guasca in the northeast the 
Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNGSB] 
attacked toll booths, communications antennas, and police 
stations. Just hours ago rebels from the 22d Front of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] launched 
simultaneous attacks against police stations in Aguaditas and 
Pasca and a toll booth in Alto de San Miguel, Cundinamarca. At 
2130 [0330 GMT] 40 subversives from the Juan de La Cruz Front 
took positions in houses. They shot rockets and hurled grenades 
at the Aguaditas police station. For two hours four policemen 
faced the attack. 
  [Begin unidentified policeman recording] They arrived in a 
pickup truck and began shooting. Fortunately, my comrades and I 
did not panic and were able to face the situation. As you can 
see, we came through it without injuries. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, another small group of the 22d FARC Front 
dynamited the Alto de San Miguel toll booth. 
  [Begin unidentified employee recording] They arrived at 
about 2100 and made us move our personnel away from the 
building, where they were collecting the toll payments. Then 
they blew up the installations. [end recording] 
  The authorities also reported that 60 rebels destroyed the 
Pasca police station. Seven policemen held off the attackers 
for eight hours.

  [Text] Cundinamarca Department has been among the hardest 
hit by the guerrillas, who have staged five attacks over the 
past few hours. This has prompted the authorities to increase 
security. 
  A special security council meeting is under way at this hour 
at the Cundinamarca governor's office. Presiding over the 
council are Governor Manuel Guillermo Infante, 13th Brigade 
Commander General Norberto Adrada, and Cundinamarca Police 
Commander Colonel Roberto Fajardo. 
  Departmental authorities are considering the serious public 
order problem which affected at least five towns in the 
department this weekend. The authorities are considering new 
strategies to counteract the guerrillas' actions and security 
measures to guarantee the electoral campaign. This weekend in 
Cundinamarca, the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 
implemented a strategy aimed at isolating Bogota, which was 
drafted at the most recent guerrilla summit in La Uribe. The 
guerrillas operate on four fronts. In the south, they are 
located in the municipalities of Fusagasuga, Cabrera, Pasca, 
Gutierrez, Chipaque, and Fomeque. In the east, they are located 
in the municipalities of Ubala, Chacala, and the Chingaza area. 
In the northwest, they are located in Yacopi, Caparrapi, and 
Topaipi in La Palma and Villa Gomez on the Boyaca border.

check point only 20 minutes away from his city. 
  [Begin recording] [Campos] We were returning from 
(?Mayapola) 
when, somewhere between Mayangola and Aguas Blancas, we 
discovered the guerrillas had set up a check point obstructing 
traffic. The guerrillas stopped every vehicle and encouraged 
support for a group called Caribbean Bloc composed of several 
FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] fronts. They 
distributed a communique protesting the presence of U.S. troops 
in the country; they preached to the people who were there; and, 
after an hour and a half, allowed traffic to begin circulating 
again. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Were they aware of your presence, 
Mr. 
Mayor? 
  [Campos] No. My presence went totally unnoticed, which was 
also the case with the president of the Municipal Assembly, the 
president of the Municipal Council, Chamber of Representatives 
candidate Mauro Tapia, several councilmen, and virtually the 
entire municipal administration. The guerrillas were there 
simply to promote their new Caribbean Bloc. [end recording]

  [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 18 Feb (AFP) -- Friday evening, 
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem arrived in this colonial 
beach resort on the Caribbean where he will remain until Monday 
when he will travel to Santa Fe de Bogota to initiate a 48-hour 
visit to Colombia. 
  Menem, who arrived from Ecuador amid tight security 
measures, 
which even prevented the media from having access to the local 
airport, met for a few minutes with his Colombian colleague 
Cesar Gaviria at the hotel where he is staying. 
  On 21 and 22 February, both presidents will discuss various 
bilateral and multilateral topics and sign agreements in the 
fields of telecommunications, scientific cooperation, education, 
culture, and environment. 
  According to the official schedule released here, Menem will 
meet with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin at the Catam military air 
terminal in Santa Fe de Bogota on Monday shortly before noon. He 
should be at the Presidential Palace by 1500 to hold his first 
work session with Gaviria. 
  Afterwards the visiting president will visit the Congress of 
the Republic, he will meet with Argentines living in Colombia, 
and during the evening he will attend a banquet in his honor 
hosted by Gaviria. 
  On Tuesday, Menem will have breakfast with a group of 
businessmen; he will inaugurate a satellite reception station 
north of the city, which is run by the Impast enterprises, an 
Argentine company. He will receive the keys to Santa Fe de 
Bogota from Mayor Jaime Castro, and he will place a wreath at 
the Simon Bolivar monument at the Simon Bolivar Plaza. 
  At noon, he will host a luncheon for President Gaviria at 
the 
Argentine Embassy and three hours later he will unveil a 
monument in memory of Evita Peron, also north of the Colombian 
capital. 
  Later on he will meet with Gaviria and their respective 
delegations to sign the agreements reached, after which he will 
hold a news conference, and before leaving Colombia, he will be 
awarded an honorary economics degree granted by Our Lady of the 
Rosary College. 
  Foreign Minister Guido di Tella; Admiral Enrique Emilio 
Molina, Navy chief of staff; Military House Chief General Jorge 
Rearte; Culture Minister Jose Maria Castineira; Tourism Minister 
Francisco Alberto Mayorga; and several parliamentarians 
accompany Menem on his visit to Colombia.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 20 Feb (DPA) -- In statements 
made today, Argentine President Carlos Menem said in Cartagena 
de Indias -- where he is on a private visit -- that Cuba might 
rejoin the OAS if it becomes democratic. Menem referred to the 
subject when he was asked about the possibility that this might 
be one of the objectives of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in 
case he is elected OAS secretary general because of the role he 
has played during the past year with regard to the Cuban 
Government making democratic changes. 
  "It might be," said the Argentine president who is known for 
his hard stand with regard to the Fidel Castro regime. 
Nonetheless, he added that Cuba's reentry can only take place 
when democracy prevails on the island. The visitor added that 
"no one likes to see a country excluded," but he insisted that 
Castro has been in power for 35 years and it is necessary to 
make some changes now, as has happened in other nations of the 
area that had long periods of dictatorships. 
  The Argentine president arrived on Friday in Cartagena de 
Indias and tomorrow will begin a two-day official visit in Santa 
Fe de Bogota. He also said that Gaviria has the capacity to be 
OAS secretary general, but he commented that his victory depends 
on how much support the other candidate, Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus, has for the post. Menem added that his 
Colombian counterpart has the virtues for becoming a good 
secretary general of the multilateral organization because "he 
is a qualified, good, and resourceful man and he has carried out 
a very good administration in Colombia." 
  Meanwhile, in statements published today in the daily EL 
TIEMPO, Menem defended his economic model and said that due to 
the results, people are starting to talk about the "Argentine 
miracle." Menem explained that the model is based on a people's 
market economy that is accompanied by a strong policy of social 
solidarity. "We are absolutely convinced that this model is the 
only one that allows us to take up once again the path of growth 
and higher standards of living for the entire population," he 
said. 
  As the main achievements of his government, Menem pointed 
out 
the elimination of inflation, monetary stability, elimination of 
the budget deficit, the privatization of several enterprises, 
renegotiation of the foreign debt, and a drastic reduction of 
tax evasion. 
  While in Cartagena de Indias, the Argentine president has 
been visiting tourist spots and playing tennis and golf with 
Gaviria, with whom he will travel tomorrow to Santa Fe de Bogota 
to begin an official visit. It was learned that Menem and 
Gaviria will sign important agreements, one on judicial 
cooperation matters in the struggle against narcotics 
trafficking and terrorism and another one that regulates animal 
sanitation measures in order to increase trade in agriculture 
and livestock. 
  Menem is scheduled to arrive in Santa Fe de Bogota at 1100 
at 
a military airport where he will be received by Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin. In the afternoon the two presidents will meet at 
the House of Narino (government palace). Later on, Menem will 
speak with leaders of Congress and leaders of the Argentine 
community residing in Colombia, while on Tuesday he will have 
breakfast with Colombian businessmen, unveil a monument in 
memory of Eva Peron, and sign agreements with Gaviria.

  [Text] The government received today at 1100 the 3-80 
Northern Front's (FN-380] counterproposal delivered yesterday to 
the CIAV [International Commission of Support and 
Verification]-OAS following a meeting held in El Rosario, a 
hamlet located two hours from military positions held by 
Sandinist People's Army [EPS] special forces. 
  Sergio Caramagna, head CIAV-OAS official in charge of 
delivering the 3-80 Northern Front's counterproposal, which 
primarily consists of demands for the rearmed group's security 
and the withdrawal of EPS forces in the conflict areas as 
conditions for holding another meeting with the government 
authorities. 
  A few days ago the government ordered the EPS to halt 
operations -- a cease-fire -- as a sign of political willingness 
to initiate talks with the 3-80 Northern Front. In addition, 
the government's peace proposal explicitly stated that a 
political negotiation with the rearmed group is unacceptable. 
  Despite the presence of EPS special troops in the Quebrada 
Negra and El Mapa areas, 10 km northeast of El Rosario, 
Commander Esteban, [Salvador Talavera Alaniz] second in command 
of the 3-80 Northern Front, deemed "very positive" this first 
encounter at the health center. 
  Nevertheless, "the EPS is setting up a military cordon that 
endangers future talks," Esteban noted after reporting that this 
is why Commander El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], the 3-80 
Northern Front's main leader, was not present at the meeting, 
which was attended by Commanders Piloto, Chele Gringo, and Musun. 
  Caramanga delivered to Esteban a letter from General 
Humberto 
Ortega addressed to El Chacal. The letter proposed to the 3-80 
Northern Front an "earnest meeting" between this rebel group and 
a broad sector of the government. 
  EPS delegates also participated in the meeting, sitting down 
to talk to an armed group for the first time since the 
demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance. 
  Esteban told LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega's letter "was looked 
upon favorably," and that El Chacal will respond with a personal 
message in a few days. 
  Caramanga today will attempt to set up a new meeting with 
the 
3-80 Northern Front. Yesterday at El Rosario he said that the 
CIAV-OAS had fulfilled its objective by delivering Gen. Ortega's 
to the 3-80 Northern Front. 
  On the presence of EPS special troops, Caramagna said that 
the CIAV-OAS was investigating to verify the activity of those 
troops. 
  Caramagna did not want to go into detail about the demands 
contained in the rebels' counterproposal.

<F P=106> [Letter from Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra to 3-80 </F>
Northern Front leader Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a. El Chacal; 
place and date not given; from the "This Morning" newscast] 
  [Text] Mr. Jose Angel Talavera: 
  The socioeconomic woes you say prompted all of you to take 
up 
arms will not be resolved by following a bloody path, because 
instead of creating the necessary conditions to overcome the 
dire poverty our peasants live in, fighting will worsen the 
situation because of the mourning, hatred, and pain that every 
war triggers. 
  There are more convincing and effective means, if they are 
well-organized with the definite support of the peasants, to 
demand and defend the rights that we all have as Nicaraguans. 
I, as well as those around me, will never allow you to be 
neglected or ignored once you disarm, as is the case with former 
Army members and with former Nicaraguan resistance members. 
  The stability we are all striving for must not solely 
benefit 
the traditionally powerful and wealthy people from the 
countryside and the city. Instead, it must basically benefit 
the workers who, along with the heroic Nicaraguan peasants, 
constitute the essential foundation of the Nicaraguan nation's 
life. 
  On behalf of the General Staff and the Military Council of 
the EPS [Sandinist People's Army], I guarantee respect for and 
protection of the lives and assets of all those who disarm 
immediately to rejoin the country's everyday life. We will 
support the mechanisms agreed upon with you in order that you 
will feel truly certain that the personal safety of each one of 
you will be guaranteed. 
  The Nicaraguan fatherland and people require absolute peace. 
I am sure that you will contribute to achieving this absolute 
peace by disarming with dignity and by later striving in a 
civilized manner for peace, which is in jeopardy because of the 
severe unemployment and socioeconomic inequalities that all 
Nicaraguans face. 
  [Signed] Sincerely, Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra, 
Commander in Chief of the EPS

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco] </F>
  [Excerpts] After analyzing the counterproposal from the 
3-80 Northern Front, the government yesterday agreed to hold a 
meeting on Monday [21 February] in Ciudad Antigua, Nueva Segovia 
Department. As Army spokesmen disclosed, the meeting will be 
held in the morning. Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command 
of the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General Staff, will be 
among those attending the meeting. 
  This will mark the first time the military will sit down for 
talks with an armed group after the demobilization of the 
Nicaraguan resistance in 1990. This morning during a ceremony 
to turn over the Region 3 Military Command Building, EPS Chief 
General Humberto Ortega said government troops are withdrawing 
from the conflict zone to the area suggested by the OAS-CIAV 
[International Commission of Support and Verification] and 
Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission. 
  Yesterday, the government reviewed the counterproposal sent 
by the 3-80 Northern Front in the main offices of the Government 
Ministry with Carrion present. Carrion arrived at the 
Government Ministry after CIAV Director Sergio Caramagna and 
Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission representative 
delivered the armed group's new proposals to the government at 
1100. 
  Those proposals, according to "Estaban," the 3-80 Northern 
Front's political chief, "are not outlandish." In order for the 
meeting to be held, the 3-80 Northern Front is basically 
demanding the physical security of all of its guerrillas and an 
EPS withdrawal from the conflict zone. 
  Last Tuesday, following a meeting with the OAS-CIAV and 
Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission in El Rosario, 
35 km northeast of Murra, the rearmed group claimed that special 
EPS troops equipped with rifles with silencers and supported by 
heavy artillery "are putting a military cordon around us." 
  During that same meeting, "Esteban" termed as "positive" the 
letter from Gen. Ortega, which informed the rebels on behalf of 
the EPS General Staff and the Military Council that "I guarantee 
you respect and protection for the lives and assests of all 
those who disarm immediately." [passage omitted] 
  Jose Angel Talavera Alaniz, a.k.a. "El Chacal," answered 
Gen. 
Ortega's letter yesterday. In a letter dated 15 February, the 
day of the meeting between the 3-80 Northern Front and the CIAV, 
"El Chacal" reaffirmed his willigness, as well as the 
willingness of the 3-80 Northern Front's Board of Commanders, to 
contribute to the peace process. 
  "On behalf of the 3-80 Northern Front, I am reiterating that 
the demands submitted to the OAS-CIAV at the 15 Febuary meeting 
in El Rosario have my full support," "El Chacal" wrote. 
  "We hope and trust that you (Gen. Ortega) and the EPS 
General 
Staff will contribute as soon as possible to giving us the 
minimum guarantees to begin to bring our troops together and 
immediately begin negotiations leading to the incorporation of 
our command members into the mainstream of society, within the 
context of the proposals made," the letter from "El Chacal" 
concluded. 
  The demands the 3-80 Northern Front basically refer to the 
personal safety of the rebels and their incorporation into the 
national police, as well as to some economic projects that the 
government must begin in the northern zone.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Mora from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Both the Army and the 3-80 Northern Front 
acknowledge that there is great resolve to reach a solution in 
advance of the negotiations that will be held by the two sides 
on Monday [21 February] in Ciudad Antigua, Nueva Segovia 
Department. 
  On Monday, the 3-80 Northern Front's Council of Commanders, 
the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] staff, the OAS-CIAV 
[International Commission of Support and Verification], the 
Verification Commission of Cardinal Obando y Bravo, and Esteli 
Bishop Msgr. Abelardo Mata will begin the first of a series of 
meetings that will have the objective of demobilizing the 3-80 
Northern Front. In letters to each other, General Humberto 
Ortega and El Chacal [3-80 Northern Front leader Jose Angel 
Talavera] expressed mutual confidence in heading down the road 
toward disarmament. 
  [Begin recording] [3-80 Northern Front leader known as 
Esteban, in progress] ...the willingness of both the EPS staff 
and himself in guaranteeing us our safety to enable us to 
proceed toward our disarmament. We have viewed this as 
positive, but we obviously have to establish the mechanisms for 
this to take place. 
  [Humberto Ortega] We will maintain the truce. We will 
provide every facility so the CIAV and the cardinal's 
Verification Commission can create the conditions to establish 
direct contacts with them. In the short-term, we hope -- as all 
Nicaraguans want -- that they will rejoin the country's normal 
life, with all the guarantees I reiterated to Talavera and his 
people in my letter to him. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, in the nine demands that the recontras 
presented, they asked for participation in police commands in 
Jinotega, Nueva Segovia, Quilali, El Jicaro, Murra, San Juan del 
Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, Ciudad Antigua, La Concordia, San 
Rafael del Norte, El Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay. They also 
demanded the demilitarization of northern Nicaragua. 
  [Begin recording] [Esteban, in progress] ...Nicaragua. 
Therefore, the police should be the ones to provide security to 
this entire area. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When you speak of the north, what 
areas are you talking about? 
  [Esteban] We are talking about Matagalpa, Jinotega, Nueva 
Segovia, and Esteli. [end recording] 
  The 3-80 Northern Front is practically demanding that it be 
given police and military control of a large part of Region 1. 
In Murra, they do not want to see any soldiers. They are 
demanding a maximum of 60 EPS members in the other 
municipalities. Referring to the demands of the recontras, Gen. 
Humberto Ortega said that in times of peace, few soldiers are 
needed. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortega] To the extent that total peace is 
achieved, the Army will not need to deploy troops. The number 
of troops we have is quite above what should really exist 
permanently in the various areas -- in this case, in the 
country's north. Once Chacal's group disbands and the problem 
of armed groups substantially eases, we will not need to have an 
excess number of troops in those areas. 
  [CIAV representative Sergio Caramagna] This is progress. A 
strong willingness exists, and this is essential to begin 
reaching a solution. [end recording] 
  One's attention is drawn to the fact that the recontras are 
not asking for the presence of any civilian authority and, for 
the first time, prefer to talk, face to face, with those they 
confronted in combat in the past.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco B.] </F>
  [Text] The 3-80 Northern Front, in a nine-point list 
released yesterday, demands from the government the chief of 
police posts in most of the municipalities and department 
capitals in Nueva Segovia and Jinotega Departments. 
  The government has not reacted to these demands, which 
according to the 3-80 Northern Front are requested as a 
guarantee for personal security for the rearmed rebels. 
  Nevertheless, both sides will meet on Monday in Ciudad 
Antigua, Nueva Segovia Department, to start negotiations that 
will permit the guerrillas to demobilize. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front Command Council headed by Jose Angel 
Talavera, known as Commander "Chacal," demands that once 
demobilized the group be assigned the chief of police posts in 
the municipalities of Quilali, El Jicaro, Murra, San Juan de Rio 
Coco, Yali, Pantasmas, Ciudad Antigua, La Concordia, San Rafael 
del Norte, El Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay. 
  The list of demands delivered to the government two days ago 
contain other secondary demands, such as the demilitarization of 
northern Nicaragua once the 3-80 Northern Front disarmament 
process has moved ahead, leaving only 60 soldiers in the above 
mentioned municipalities, except Murra. They also ask for the 
creation of new settlements for development based in Quilali, a 
disarmament schedule for the 3-80 Northern Front, and a special 
fund for the area's economic reactivation and road rebuilding. 
  Included in the points are the creation of a commission 
represented by the 3-80 Northern Front, the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] General Staff, CIAV [International Commission of 
Support and Verification]-OAS, and Cardinal Miguel Obando y 
Bravo Verification, including Esteli Bishop Monsignor Juan 
Abelardo Mata. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front, according to Commander "Esteban," 
who is second in command, dropped its previous political 
demands, such as the dismissal of General Humberto Ortega and 
Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, because the 3-80 Northern 
Front will restate these demands once they join the civilian 
struggle. 
  Yesterday Gen. Humberto Ortega said that the EPS has not set 
a hard and fast term for the 3-80 Northern Front to demobilize. 
"We are not placing them up against the wall, but we hope the 
talks do not take too long otherwise everything may turn sour," 
Ortega said. According to Ortega, the EPS will maintain the 
truce and will allow the necessary conditions for the 3-80 
Northern Front and the government to meet on Monday. The 
meeting will be attended by Colonel Javier Carrion, second in 
command in the EPS General Staff. 
  Ortega said that the Army is redeploying its troops to 
wherever intermediate organizations (CIAV-OAS, Cardinal Miguel 
Obando y Bravo Verification) suggest. The military leader agrees 
with demilitarizing northern Nicaragua and said as peace is 
achieved "there will be no need for the EPS to maintain its 
troops in these areas. We are willing to maintain a minimum of 
soldiers once the 3-80 Northern Front disarms. We will keep 
enough troops to support the police in maintaining order," 
Ortega said.

3-80 Northern Front, which was slated to discuss its disarmament 
with government representatives, has announced these talks have 
been suspended due to the strong presence of EPS [Sandinist

  [Text] Managua, 21 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government today proposed keeping the troops of the Sandinist 
People's Army [EPS] only in the cities and roads in the northern 
part of the country, in an attempt to negotiate with "recontra" 
leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front the disarmament and 
demobilization of that rebel organization. 
  This evening, the Government Ministry released a press note 
reporting that it also agreed to "clean" El Zungano region of 
any military presence. The rebels headed by Jose Angel 
Talavera, also known as "Chacal," operate in that region. 
  According to official information, the EPS will only leave a 
small unit in the Cautalu sector, another bastion of 
approximately 400 former rearmed "contras," known as "recontras." 
  "Seven days after the opening of the (recontras') 
reconcentration zone, the (eight-point) agenda will be discussed 
in total. This agenda was presented by the Northern Front on 15 
February," the note added. 
  These counterproposals by the government will be sent to 
"Chacal" at an undetermined date through the OAS' International 
Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) which, 
together with representatives of the church, is serving as a 
mediator in these negotiations. 
  In addition, the government will focus its efforts on social 
development in the country's northern area with the support of 
ministries and other state agencies and with the opening of an 
interinstitutional office in Quilali, near the border with 
Honduras. 
  A group of six from the 3-80 Northern Front's staff demanded 
the incorporation of "recontra" chiefs to the Jinotega and Nueva 
Segovia Police in order for them to disarm and demobilize. Other 
(recontras) should be incorporated into the Quilali, Jicargo, 
Murra, San Juan del Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, Ciudad Antigua, la 
Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay Police. 
  They also asked for the creation of a development center 
located in Quilali, the reconcentration of the EPS' troops, and 
the maintenance of no more than 60 soldiers in those 
municipalities, except in Murra. 
  Other rebels demands are the demilitarization of the 
northern 
part of the country -- once the 3-80 Northern Front's 
disarmament progresses -- as well as benefit programs for the 
wounded, widows, and orphans. 
  Additional rebels requests are the repair of rural roads in 
the region, the creation of a special fund for the north's 
economic reactivation, and legal status for the "3-80 Northern 
Front" organization. 
  The first direct meeting between the government of Nicaragua 
and "recontra' chiefs of the 3-80 Northern Front slated to be 
held today, Monday, was put off for several days after the 
rebels argued that "there was still strong Army presence in the 
nation's northern regions." 
  The problem of the rearmed rebels arose in 1990 shortly 
after 
President Violeta Chamorro took office as several thousand of 
the 22,000 former demobilized "contras," not happy with the 
government, broke the agreement to turn over their weapons and 
once again took up arms.

Service]. During the ceremony to transfer the EPS installations 
located at kilometer marker 20 of the road to Masaya to the 
Environment and Natural Resources Ministry, EPS Chief Gen. 
Humberto Ortega said yesterday that the Military High Command is 
not planning to reestablish the SMP in the country. Here is what 
Gen. Ortega said: 
  [Begin Ortega recording] It is not enough to disarm. An 
effective program is necessary to permit the disarmed 
individuals to earn a livelihood and gradually rejoin the 
country's life through employment in order to increase their 
standard of living and live decently. Disarmament is not enough 
for peace to exist. We must all work to overcome the high levels 
of inequality and poverty and to prevent the concentration of 
capital in the hands of a few people because that will always 
create a big gap between the few who have everything and the 
many who have nothing. Those are the real roots of violence that 
might come in the future. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 17 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Chamorro today appointed Luis Rivas Leiva, a physician 
and Social Democrat, to the post of director of Social 
Communications of the Presidency of the Republic. Chamorro also 
signed a decree creating the Social Communications Directorate, 
which dissolves the Public Relations and Official Information 
Directorate of the Presidency, as well as the Information and 
Press Directorate of the Presidency. 
  The Public Relations and Official Information Directorate 
was 
previously headed by Danilo Lacayo Lanzas, a lawyer and Social 
Democrat, who resigned on Tuesday to practice his profession and 
return to the private sector, according to official sources. 
  The Information and Press Directorate of the Presidency was 
in charge of reporting the activities of cabinet members and was 
headed by Ernesto Robleto, who resigned from the position in the 
latter part of 1993, also to return to the private sector. 
  Chamorro appointed journalist Maria Alicia Talavera Sevilla, 
former editor of BARRICADA newspaper in Managua, as deputy 
director of the Social Communications Directorate. Both 
officials were sworn in by the Nicaraguan president in her 
office this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Nicaraguan Presidency's </F>
Information and Press Directorate in Managua on 16 February; 
from the "This Morning" newscast -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Information and Press Directorate informs the 
public that Vice President Virgilio Godoy's remarks regarding an 
alleged Nicaraguan Government contributions to the Costa Rican 
electoral campaign are unfounded and false. Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo and his wife visited this sister nation in 
January because the candidates of the National Liberation and 
Social Christian Unity parties invited them to observe the 
electoral process. 
  Mr. Lacayo seized this opportunity to talk with the two 
candidates about the good relations that Nicaragua hopes to have 
with the new Costa Rican Government that will rule this country 
for the next four years. He also spoke to them on behalf of 
those Nicaraguans who work or want to work in Costa Rica. He 
received from current Government Minister Luis Fishman and from 
the two candidates words of support for the Nicaraguan workers 
who go there protected within the framework of the agreement 
signed by the Labor Ministries of the two countries. The 
agreement guarantees such workers the full enjoyment and benefit 
of the labor rights in force in Costa Rica. 
  The current Costa Rican Government believes that those 
Nicaraguans who go there unprotected within the framework of the 
said agreement are exposing themselves to mistreatment by 
unscrupulous people who take advantage of the Nicaraguan 
workers' lack of legal documents to avoid paying minimum wages 
and other social benefits. This constitutes a crime that Costa 
Rican authorities are willing to fight by issuing the pertinent 
documents through the mechanism agreed upon by the Labor 
Ministries of the two countries. 
  [Dated] Managua, 16 February 1994

Directorate

  [Text] Three individuals were injured this morning 
following a confusing incident near the U.S. Embassy, in the 
Parque Forestal area. 
  According to the first report, three individuals provoked 
Carabineros agents guarding the area and escaped when the agents 
tried to arrest them. Police organized a dragnet in the area 
with the support of central Santiago's Fourth Police Station. 
The individuals were finally captured and taken to the central 
hospital for the treatment of possible injuries. Police did not 
reveal the identity of the individuals in question, but we 
reiterate, their arrest was as the result of a provocation 
against personnel on guard near the U.S. Embassy. The incident 
occurred at approximately 0615 today.

  [Text] Sofofa [Industrial Development Association] and 
Chilean Foreign Ministry representatives, after a meeting at the 
Finance Ministry, attributed the harm Mexican industrialists 
have blamed on Chilean fishmeal producers to the Peruvian 
presence in the international market and high production costs 
in Mexico. 
  The meeting was attended by Juan Salazar, Finance Ministry 
international policy adviser and future Foreign Ministry 
economic affairs director; Alejandro Jara, bilateral affairs 
director for the International Economic Relations Directorate; 
and Fishing Corporation and Sofofa representatives. 
  Sofofa Secretary General Jaime Pozo said the Mexican 
charges, 
which resulted in temporary sanctions against Chile while an 
investigation is conducted, are quite groundless: 
  [Begin Pozo recording, in progress] ...punctual. One must 
adjust to the international market prices currently set by Peru, 
which is exporting at significantly low prices. Chilean 
industry cannot just fail to comply with previously made 
contracts. Mexico also is buying in the international market 
because Chilean fishmeal is of very good quality and, in this 
sense, it is very competitive precisely because of its quality. 
[end recording] 
  The Chilean business sector has asked the government's 
support in confronting charges that, according to the Mexican 
law system, Chile exports below cost. Salazar explained that 
the government is concerned about this issue and will raise the 
subject before the administrative council of the Chilean-Mexican 
Free Trade Accord. 
  Moreover, Alejandro Jara said Chile is not causing Mexican 
producers any harm: 
  [Begin Jara recording, in progress] ...we are very worried. 
Mexican businessmen cannot categorically say that Chilean 
fishmeal exports are the direct and main cause of the harm 
suffered by the Mexican industry, which has experienced a 
significant reduction in its sales in addition to having to go 
by the international fishmeal price, which also affects Chile 
because they have been relatively low or, at, least lower than 
when the investigation was carried out. [end recording] 
  Jara said these measures are unjustified and must be 
reversed 
as soon as possible.

  [Text] Acting Economy Minister Andres Couve said the 
problem posed by Chilean fishmeal exports to Mexico are a 
national problem. 
  Couve ratified the government's support for Chilean fishmeal 
producers by explaining that commercial sanctions imposed by 
Mexico, although the conflict only involves private companies, 
will affect the entire Chilean fishmeal industry. 
  According to Couve, the Mexican Fishmeal Industry Chamber 
has 
charged four Chilean companies -- Coloso, Eperba, Iquique, and 
Indo -- of dumping, that is, of selling fishmeal in Mexico at 
prices below those they would sell in Chile. 
  However, the compensatory fees these enterprises will have 
to 
pay will be extended to all other Chilean fishing companies. 
This information was confirmed by Chilean Ambassador to Mexico 
Julio de la Fuente. [recorded passage indistinct] 
  We are going to grant our full support to the Chilean 
fishing 
companies because our objective is that the Mexican sanctions be 
lifted, stated Andres Couve, who said the compensatory fees 
established by Mexico almost ban Chilean fishmeal from entering 
the Mexican market. 
  He recalled that fishmeal exports are the ones that have 
increased most among Chilean exports to Mexico. 
  He added that this situation benefits Peru, which has grown 
and is now competing with very low prices in markets that were 
supplied exclusively by Chile until recently.

  [Text] National Resources Minister Luis Alvarado announced 
that a biogenetic laboratory to study the lenga magallanica tree 
will be built in Tierra del Fuego Province. 
  This initiative falls within the framework of an agreement 
signed by the National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation, 
and a private foundation interested in studying why this specie 
grows in an unfavorable environment. 
  The reason for this initiative is the intensive exploitation 
of this resource by wood mills that use the lenga tree to 
produce chips [preceding word in English]. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarado] The idea is to carry out a 
scientific investigation that will tell us why this specie grows 
in such an unfavorable environment. What we want to do is build 
two sites on which this laboratory will be located. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this require a law? 
  [Alvarado] No. There is a direct agreement between the 
National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation, and a private 
foundation. We estimate the research will take four to five 
years before the lenga tree can be grown in nurseries. [end 
recording] 
  If this initiative proves fruitful, Chile will be able to 
grow lenga forests and thus have a new resource to exploit, 
according to Alvarado, who is visiting the 12th Region.

  [Excerpts] One of the former Soviet Union's airplanes that 
has always been a mystery to Western powers, the Sukhoi, which 
can hit a speed of Mach 2, will be shown at the International 
Aerospace Fair (Fidae 94) which will take place between 20 and 
27 March at the Los Cerrillos base. 
  A group of officials from the Russian state company 
"Rosvuruzhenie" headed by Vladimir Kolnytchenco on 9 February 
signed a contract with Air Force Colonel Rodolfo Acuna Guimpert, 
Fidae executive director, to present SU-27 and SU-30 jets at the 
fair. [passage omitted] 
  The Russian state company "Rosvuruzhenie," which is the only 
Russian company entitled to trade weapons, also is dedicated to 
strengthening ties with foreign countries. 
  It will show about 100 pieces of war equipment and Russian 
military technology at Fidae 94, of which the Tor-M1 
anti-aircraft rockets, which can down two airplanes 
simultaneously, are the most outstanding surface weapons.

Rahmat announced in Kuala Lumpur on 7 February that Chile and 
Malaysia have agreed to establish a joint commission to 
cooperate in the areas of information broadcasting and 
dissemination. 
  The agreement was closed by Enrique Correa Rios, minister 
secretary general of government, during meetings with Malaysian 
officials in that Asian country.

  Mohamed told the press that the commission will hold its 
first meeting in Santiago de Chile in June to try working out 
the details of the agreement that seeks to promote the exchange 
of news and political, educational, social, and cultural radio 
and television programs. 
  The minister said the commission will project Malaysia in 
the 
South American continent and promote Chile in Southeast Asia. 
  The agreement also will help the two nations' purpose of 
turning Chile into a Malaysian access door to South America and 
Malaysia into a Chilean access door to Southeast Asia.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish, in its 
11 February issue, carries on page C3 a 900-word unattributed 
article about alleged links between Chilean Ambassador to 
Switzerland Alejandro Montesino and former Italian Prime 
Minister Bettino Craxi in a bribery scandal in Italy. 
  According to Peruvian congressman Fernando Olivera -- who 
was 
interviewed in Lima by EL MERCURIO correspondent Anibal Alvarado 
-- Montesino lived in Italy from 1974 to 1988 after the 1973 
military coup in Chile. There he worked for the Italian 
Socialist Party and became "Craxi's man of trust" for 
international cooperation programs with Latin America. Olivera 
accuses Montesino of being involved in the bribes charged by 
several former Italian government officials to construction 
companies that carried out works in Latin America through the 
international cooperation program. "Olivera maintains that 
Montesino allegedly attended a meeting between Craxi and former 
Peruvian President Alan Garcia in September 1989 in the 
Excelsior Hotel." According to some former Peruvian government 
officials, Olivera said, "Montesino `had authority delegated 
directly from Craxi.'" 
  The article also reports that Montesino, who is currently in 
Santiago recovering from a car accident while on vacation in 
southern Chile, categorically denied to EL MERCURIO the 
statements made by Olivera about his alleged involvement in the 
Italian bribery scandal on account of his relation with Craxi. 
Olivera made the accusation for publicity so "`I deny his 
charges categorically,'" Montesino says in the article.

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has reported that he 
instructed judicial authorities to take severe legal action 
against Roosevelt Hospital employees and officials whose 
irresponsibility has cost at least one person her life. 
  [Begin de Leon recording] This unfortunate incident has 
happened because of the state workers' irresponsibility. Instead 
of meeting with the economic cabinet at the Finance Ministry and 
talking to try to find a creative solution, they want an 
unrealistic solution by demanding salary raises. It is their 
fault. 
  There are only two ways of meeting their demands. One would 
be to start operating the little machine and print unsupported 
currency. Such an action would be irresponsible because, by 
meeting the demands of a minority, 100,000 or 150,000 public 
employees, the economy of 10 million Guatemalans would be 
jeopardized. This I cannot and should not do. The other solution 
would be to transfer investment resources from other sources. 
For the first time we will invest 28 percent of the investment 
budget in drinking water systems, health, and education. 
Diverting money from the health and education sectors to raise 
salaries would be an irresponsible decision. I could not, should 
not, and will not do this. 
  Instead of playing around with the Guatemalan people's lives 
-- there is already one victim, and one human life is worth as 
much as 10, 20, 100, or 1,000 lives -- they should be seated and 
talk as representatives of Guatemalan state workers are doing 
today. I understand that a meeting is in progress and a general 
assembly will be held tomorrow to continue these talks. I regret 
deeply that their position has already cost a person her life. 
By looking after their particular interests only, they are 
violating the Guatemalan people's rights. 
  Of course, I have issued instructions to conduct an 
investigation and ordered the Attorney General's Office to take 
drastic measures against these persons, who are responsible as 
individuals and as members of the institutions. They must be 
punished according to the law. We are dealing with human lives. 
As president of the Republic, I must act accordingly, regardless 
of whether it is only one life or more and no matter to which 
social level this person belonged. She was a Guatemalan woman 
who lost her life because she was neglected, because the workers 
only looked after their own private interests, workers whose 
duty it was to look after her. These workers are being paid a 
salary to attend to the population. This is an outrage, which 
falls in the category of crime. [end recording]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 18 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Approximately 
160,000 public workers today went on a 24-hour strike in view of 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio' refusal to grant a 40 percent 
salary readjustment. 
  The president has, for the time being, ruled out declaring a 
"state of emergency" to halt the public workers' stoppage, which 
affects mostly education and health sectors due to the strike of 
some 12,000 teachers and 32,000 health sector workers, including 
9,000 doctors. 
  De Leon, who ordered that workers who join the strike be 
reported, ruled out fears by the Catholic Church that the strike 
may destabilize his government and for the time being did not 
accept a mediation offer by Archbishop Propsepero Penados del 
Barrio to seek a solution to the crisis. "It is not necessary 
because we are open to negotiations," the president underscored 
and asked that the full weight of the law fall on those doctors 
who may turn out to be responsible for the death of a woman for 
alleged lack of medical attention. The case was reported to the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  Penados has stated that the workers' demands are "fair," 
even 
though he regrets it is affecting the poorest people. 
  The National Federation of Public Employees Unions 
(FENASEP), 
which has about 40,000 members who do not support the strike, on 
Thursday began talks with the government to put forth their 
demands. 
  In view of the general strike called by the National 
Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) and the State 
Workers United Instance [Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del 
Estado -- UITE], the president ratified that he will not grant 
any salary increases. "It is impossible that in order to grant 
an increase to about 150,000 workers we will harm 10 million 
inhabitants," the president emphasized and explained that to 
give in to the demands of the workers means printing money 
without backing or investing funds, earmarked for social 
development programs, in operating expenses. De Leon reiterated 
that workers who are on strike will not be paid in full. 
  Despite the president's warnings, UITE leader Nery Hernandez 
told ACAN-EFE that they will not give up holding a national 
strike, which is not only to demand a readjustment, but also so 
that the government suspends the privatization process. Hernadez 
described as "regrettable" the position FENASEP has taken by not 
supporting the workers' movement, which according to him, 
includes Guatemala's 22 departments. "We are reaching a social 
and economic disaster due to government negligence," the union 
leader said. 
  Meanwhile, FENASTEG Secretary General Armando Sanchez also 
told ACAN-EFE that with the exception of the municipalities, the 
Finance [Ministry], the Judicial Branch, and the Labor and 
Social Security Ministry, the remaining government offices back 
the strike. Sanchez described the president's stance of not 
agreeing to the increase as "intransigent" and warned that they 
will not back down on their demands. 
  Labor and Social Security Minister Anabela Morfin also 
reiterated that her office will continue to open file cases on 
workers who go on strike to ensure that they are punished 
because "we cannot allow services to be affected."

<F P=106> [Speech by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio to </F>
business leaders; place and date not given; broadcast in 
progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] ...from the strategic point of view of the 
Presidency, it has not been a topic that has had any emphasis in 
my government. It has not been a topic in which I have blindly 
been determined to sign the peace agreement as my predecessor 
unfortunately did. We do not want to give false expectations to 
the population and encourage the guerrillas. That is what we 
did in the past. I believe international positions support us, 
and the government's peace plan is very clear in its objectives, 
especially in the development of the process. It is not that we 
are not in a hurry but, rather, we are not going to play to the 
tune of the guerrillas, who want to stand out before the 
international community. We believe, however, that the current 
conditions, especially the unfortunate situation in Mexico, have 
come to absolutely favor the situation in Guatemala. 
  I am going to travel to Mexico, possibly next month, because 
I have received an invitation from President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. I am taking advantage of this opportunity to tell you 
that I expect all the support and cooperation from you because 
we are going to [words indistinct]. In terms of economic 
issues, I expect to bring a delegation that is totally prepared 
to negotiate. Therefore, I expect support from you to enable us 
to take a delegation that can negotiate and prepare the economic 
future of this country with Mexico. The other goal is 
political. Within this general goal we would like to talk about 
the subversives in Mexico through the [words indistinct] and the 
signature of the peace agreements, at least the conclusion of 
the armed confrontation. 
  I am taking advantage of the fact that the most important 
goal is not the conclusion of the armed confrontation but the 
fight against poverty and the need to provide solutions to 
economic and social demands. We have to provide solutions now, 
at this time, as we are doing now through our participation and 
through decentralization, not only by providing potable water 
and electricity but by bringing hope because the people have 
lost hope. This is why I have begun visiting the poorest and 
most remote regions of the country. The president and the 
government has to give hope to the country's productive sectors. 
They must know that there is hope. Otherwise, we could face 
the problems faced by Mexico, such as poverty and extreme 
poverty. The demands made by the subversives and the groups in 
southern Mexico should be resolved before it is too late. 
  I was telling you about how the government will conduct its 
activities. But before this, I forgot to mention the other 
objective, which is that of reconciliation and the fostering of 
peace here in Guatemala. I have said it often in the interior 
of the Republic. We are the only ones who can revolutionize 
Guatemala, but it will be a moral and peaceful revolution. 
Those who have remained here and those who have suffered the 
effects of violence, poverty, extreme poverty, lack of security, 
and its consequences have to work for a reconciliation, the 
reconstruction of Guatemala, and the engendering of peace. This 
is what I told you -- that we are determined to work for a 
national peace plan as part of a process -- a process we hope 
can be completed as soon as possible from a humanitarian point 
of view. Nevertheless, from a strategic point of view, we are 
in no hurry if it is to become an advantage for the subversives. 
I told you that the five points I have mentioned will be to 
consolidate democracy and the state of law, fight poverty, 
increase production, protect the environment, and 
institutionalize modernization through austerity, honesty, and 
social participation. 
  As for the first topic -- the consolidation of democracy and 
the state of law -- I can mention the modernization of 
institutions, freedom of speech, free elections, balance of 
powers, and the subordination of the Armed Forces to civilian 
rule. These are things we can plainly mention. I say these 
things in front of the Armed Forces, in front of the Guatemalan 
Army. It is something that is understood, because there is a 
clear concept that this is most advisable for the Army. [words 
indistinct] for that institution and, therefore, for the 
government and the Guatemalan nation. That is why we speak 
about the subordination of the military to civilian rule, which 
is a slow process, but a process that has already begun. 
  As for the fight against poverty, it includes access to 
opportunities, the participation of the poor in social life, the 
participation of the poor in political life, improvement of 
markets, prevention of the creation of monopolies, protection 
for workers, consumer protection, and better organization of 
businesses. As for the preservation of the environment, we are 
going to combine environmental policies with technology and use 
resources to decrease poverty. As for modernization, we are 
going to improve the state's management capabilities, and we are 
going to work for efficient macroeconomic management, 
encouragement of private investment, promotion of foreign 
investment, and the country's advance into international markets. 
  I will not go into detail because I would be speaking for 
too 
long. Nevertheless, I would like to give a few examples. For 
instance, in the field of government social policies, the 
improvement of the government's working capacity, the 
decentralization of public services, and the strengthening of 
local governments will be priority concerns. The management of 
hospitals by a board of trustees is a fact. This is a decision 
made by this government. The state does not have enough funds 
to efficiently run hospitals. Hospitals are poorly run and 
there is corruption in the handling of hospitals. The solution 
is to have a board of trustees run hospitals and oversee 
privatizations. As for privatizations, fortunately this 
government has no problems in preventing monopolies. 
Privatizations are needed to make government enterprises more 
efficient. It is a way to reduce the state's debt. This is how 
I see it.

  [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez 
yesterday confirmed that some 250 Guatemalan Army soldiers are 
getting ready to participate in joint peacekeeping missions with 
UN military forces. At an official ceremony, the high-ranking 
military official disclosed that Julio Martinni, Guatemalan 
ambassador to the United Nations, made two requests in which he 
asked that Guatemala be allowed to join UN forces that provide 
social and defensive support to countries facing armed conflicts. 
  Enriquez said the Army is preparing four platoons comprising 
military policemen, civil affairs specialists, experts in 
psychological operations, nurses, and other specialists who will 
be able to join the UN peacekeeping forces at any time. He 
added that the military forces are currently capable of meeting 
the requirement of providing soldiers but that they are not 
capable of creating a logistical battalion in Guatemala, as 
requested, because of a lack of economic resources. 
  Minister Enriquez explained that those Guatemalans who will 
participate in the peacekeeping forces will remain on reserve or 
on waiting lists, beginning in March, enabling them to be ready 
whenever their help is needed. He added that this is the first 
time the Army will be taking part in such activities.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today justified the presence of 
the U.S. troops on Guatemalan territory that are participating 
in the Fuertes Caminos program. 
  The president justified the presence of 200 American 
soldiers 
who represent 10 percent of the total contingent that will be 
arriving in the Central American nation this year to participate 
in social welfare projects. De Leon regretted the involvement of 
Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian and 1992 Nobel Peace Prize 
winner, who sent a letter to President William Clinton urging 
him to reconsider the "current U.S. military policy toward 
Guatemala." 
  At a meeting with the press the president explained that 
joint projects are being carried out with the U.S. Government to 
improve the standard of living of residents in Salama, Baja 
Verapaz, which is located 150 km north of Guatemala City. 
  Nevertheless, Menchu pointed out that the presence of U.S. 
troops in Guatemala "is unacceptable," especially when one 
considers that the United States is a member of the Group of 
Friendly Countries and "must demonstrate neutrality at all 
times." Furthermore, it "complicates our reality and 
considerably hinders the process of demilitarizing Guatemala and 
its society." 
  The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala has announced that from 6 
January through the beginning of June 1994, 10 groups of 200 men 
each will be sent to Guatemala for training. For the Fuertes 
Caminos program the troops will use 150 vehicles including 
tractors, semi-trailers, trucks, bulldozers, perforation 
equipment, and jeeps for personnel transportation, as well as 
two helicopters for emergency medical evacuations. 
  De Leon Carpio expressed surprise over Menchu's position, 
saying that "she lacks the information" to oppose the Fuertes 
Caminos project, the purpose of which is to increase the 
well-being of the inhabitants of Salama, Baja Verapaz.

to fight the violence.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Ruiz Calderon] </F>
  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday said the 
first phase of the Great National Agreement (GAN), which deals 
with bringing together the first sectors to discuss the 
proposal, has been successful, given the positive response. 
  He highlighted the fact that "the organized private sector, 
the government workers, and the cooperative organizations have 
shown great will to collaborate. This forecasts a positive 
response from the other sectors of the community and, in 
general, demonstrates the achievements this government 
initiative has made." 
  Despite the president's optimism, however, the Labor and 
Popular Action Union, UASP, conditioned its participation in the 
GAN talks to several points brought onto the scene by the 
Executive Branch and asked for an open agenda. The private 
sector says that dealing with social and economic issues at the 
same time is an obstacle to the talks. 
  De Leon said that he will meet with members of CACIF 
[Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial 
and Industrial Associations] on Friday [18 February]. He will 
meet with cooperative organizations next week. He already has a 
positive response from various sectors. The president added that 
he has "not been able to hear the other sector's proposals 
because of the strike in which they are engaged. This does not 
mean there has not been a generally positive response." 
  The president concluded by expressing optimism. He believes 
the country will attain the goal of governability, which will 
allow us to set the foundation for social structure changes 
later on, "which is why the government will sign the agreements 
and abide by them."

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 10 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Army General 
Staff senior officers said on 9 February in La Paz that the 
budget cutback in the drug-trafficking interdiction programs in 
the coca-producing countries announced by the U.S. Government 
"is immaterial to the Bolivian Armed Forces." 
  The military sources told LOS TIEMPOS that this attitude is 
to be understood to the extent that "the Army, the Navy, and the 
Air Force have never actually received these funds." 
  The military sources supported their opinions by pointing 
out 
that the U.S. Army spent more than $5 million in the name of 
Bolivia under the excuse of carrying out civic actions in the 
town of Santa Ana del Yacuma in Beni Department in 1992. 
  The sources noted: "In fact, barely $250,000 was invested in 
building a school that year." 
  In the opinion of our country's military authorities, the 
cutbacks in this year's interdiction programs announced by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's administration "are a result of the 
U.S. Army's mismanagement of economic resources over the past 
few years." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] A drug trafficker's testimony is the cause of 
controversy in the political arena. The following is a report 
by Mario Espinoza, who will tell us about this and other issues 
such as the bid for the Cotapata-Santa Barbara road construction 
project and the government budget. 
  [Mario Espinoza] The testimony of drug trafficker Meco 
Dominguez, which was reported by the Fides news agency and 
carried by newspapers in La Paz and nationwide, has caused a 
true political earthquake. 
  The MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] has come out to 
defend its party members and former President Paz Zamora by 
stating that [former Interior Minister] Guillermo Capobianco has 
called a news conference this morning in Santa Cruz and is 
willing to subject himself to any investigation. 
  At any rate, we are facing a unique situation because the 
drug trafficker has caused a political earthquake by slandering 
respectable institutions such as the Bank of Santa Cruz. 
  Moreover, MIR President Oscar Eid Franco has denied 
Dominguez' charges. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified anchorwoman] As was reported by Mario 
Espinoza, 
drug trafficker Meco Dominguez has made charges against the 
private banking industry and the Armed Forces. A Fides news 
agency report reads, text, that for the first time a Bolivian 
bank has been charged in alleged involvement in money laundering 
activities. 
  The report adds that the bank, which has connections with 
U.S. and Panamanian banks, obtained the funds from the Colombian 
and Bolivian drug cartels. 
  Moreover, according to what the controversial Meco Dominguez 
told fiscal and police officials, the Monchego regiment has 
become a cocaine manufacturing center. 
  Regarding the alleged money laundering activities conducted 
by the Bank of Santa Cruz, Meco Dominguez alleges he held a 
meeting with bank officials in 1990. He added that in 1989, 
through Juan Carlos Pereira Paz, bank transactions were 
conducted with this gentleman for the cashing of six checks for 
$50,000 each for the Cali cartel.

<F P=106> [Relay from Santa Cruz by Marcelo Huanca Dorado] </F>
  [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] has reported 
that it has disbanded a gang of swindlers which reportedly 
earned profits totaling about $3 million. This [word 
indistinct] organization has been acting parallel to the FELCN 
for approximately the last four years. 
  This organization had its own informers, and its own 
clandestine barracks. Three of the organization's informers 
were arrested. Among them are a former policeman and a former 
FELCN member who had detailed knowledge of the drug traffickers' 
activities. Those arrested have been identified as (Roger 
Gandarillas), (Felix Flores Aldin), and (Walter Orellana). 
(Roger Gandarillas) is reportedly the leader of the 
organization, which allegedly was able to swindle about $3 
million from the drug traffickers. 
  This gang, organized after the Colombian drug mafias, was 
made up of people who had detailed knowledge of all drug 
trafficking activities. They had identified all persons 
involved in drug trafficking activities, and their movements. 
  The organization seized drugs but instead of delivering them 
to the proper government organizations, it kept the seized cargo 
for itself and later distributed it. 
  FELCN officials, who added that the investigations continue, 
yesterday invited reporters to one of the properties that was 
seized from this organization. The property is located on 
Francisco Mora Avenue.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Coca peasants in 
Cochabamba's tropical region on 9 February in La Paz said 
National Social Defense Secretariat and the Special 
Antinarcotics Force personnel scared their families and 
threatened to carry out actions to eradicate coca crops. 
  Guido Tarqui, national settlers secretary from the Bolivian 
Labor Federation, said that in the past few days the narcotics 
under secretary and a Coca Reduction Directorate (Direco) 
official threatened Chapare peasants, urging them to voluntarily 
eradicate their coca crops. 
  He said the two government officials openly threatened the 
peasants by telling them that "in case they do not follow the 
coca crops eradication plan, the National Social Defense 
Secretariat will begin carrying out direct interdiction actions 
in the area." 
  Tarqui said the two officials announced that more coca 
eradication employees are being taken to Chapare for the purpose 
of eradicating coca crops "by fair means or foul." 
  Tarqui said this attitude intimidates the peasants, which 
may 
lead to "clashes and the spilling of blood." 
  "The peasants are not willing to allow their crops to be 
eradicated without any consideration," Tarqui said, adding that 
"the only means of living for the area's peasants are coca 
leaves."

<F P=106> [Reports by Nicolas Sanabria Garron from La Paz and Luis </F>
Mayan from Cochabamba] 
  [Text] [Nicolas Sanabria Garron] Coca farmers have 
declared themselves in a state of emergency. Coca farmers have 
called for active resistance to avoid the forceful eradication 
of coca farms in the region. 
  (Cibar Victoria), second secretary of the General Trade 
Union 
Confederation of Peasant Workers, reported: 
  [Begin (Cibar Victoria) recording]: In keeping with the 
government's repressive guidelines, the government's repressive 
forces -- UMOPAR [Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas] and the 
DEA -- on 14 February at 0500 [words indistinct] eradicated five 
hectares of the sacred coca leaf. To conduct this eradication 
operation, the government forces arrested several fellow 
peasants in a violent and savage manner and are keeping them 
incommunicado. [end recording] 
  [Luis Mayan] Farmers from the (Villa Cunari) coca-producing 
farmers cooperative have decided to declare themselves in a 
state of emergency and general mobilization. The following is a 
report by peasant leader Valentin Gutierrez, who reports the 
assembly's conclusions. 
  [Begin Valentin Gutierrez recording] We have decided to put 
in force the self-defense committees and declare ourselves in a 
state of emergency and general mobilization at the grass-roots 
level. 
  This means we will not be responsible for any eventual 
conflict or clash that may be caused by the government's 
repressive forces. 
  The government will be solely responsible for any eventual 
conflict because coca producers have been willing to negotiate 
and have attended all negotiations called by the government. 
Therefore, the government is solely responsible for any 
eventual conflict. [end recording] 
  According to reports supplied to this radio station, we 
reassert that members of Dinaco [National Coca Control 
Directorate], Direco [Coca Eradication Directorate], UMOPAR, and 
inmates from the Chimore rehabilitation center continue to 
eradicate coca farms by force. These eradication operations are 
being conducted at the (?Sebastian Fundador) colony against the 
(?Ibircanzana) coca farmers cooperative where, according to 
peasant leaders, there was a clash and tear gas was used.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrea Dunningham] </F>
  [Text] As of 1995, Brazilian shipping companies that 
compete with U.S. ship-owning companies in maritime 
transportation between the two countries will face a serious 
disadvantage. The U.S. Congress has just approved, and 
President Clinton has sanctioned, a new law granting subsidies 
to private shipyards. For the next 10 years, 70 of the 151 
ships that comprise the U.S. merchant fleet will receive $2.1 
million per year to finance their operations. 
  This law is the most important piece of maritime legislation 
to be approved since the United States approved the first 
subsidy for the sector in 1936 (now they subsidize the salaries 
of the sector employees). The law was sponsored by Deputy Gerry 
E. Studds of the Democratic Party, Massachusetts. It was 
approved in Congress by 347 votes to 65. It seeks to stimulate 
naval construction in the country and to strengthen the U.S. 
merchant fleet which was reduced from 620 ships 28 years ago to 
151. 
  The subsidy will be granted to all merchant ships sailing 
under U.S. flag that are suitable for military use. The subsidy 
will help U.S. shipyards to make their shipbuilding prices 
competitive on the international market. If U.S. shipyard 
prices are higher than those of another country, the U.S. 
Government can also grant subsidies to shipowners who choose to 
have ships built abroad. 
  Sergio Salomao, president of the National Union of Maritime 
Navigation Enterprises (Syndarma), has said this new subsidy 
enables U.S. shipowners to make new investment, increase the 
level of their services, and reduce still further their freight 
prices which are already about 30 percent less than those of 
Brazilian companies.

  [Text] Brasilia, 18 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry has denied an alleged Venezuelan military foray inside 
Brazilian territory in the Amazon region. 
  Brazilian Foreign Ministry sources in Brasilia said the 
information regarding an incursion by Venezuelan National Guard 
troops to capture Brazilian "garimpeiros" (illegal miners) is 
"absurd." 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has not been informed about 
the possible detention of "garimpeiros" by Venezuelan 
authorities, even though the possibility cannot be ruled out, 
the sources added. 
  Entrepreneur Jose Altino Machado, who owns machinery for the 
illegal mining of minerals in the Amazon region, said that last 
week the Venezuelan National Guard entered Brazilian territory 
to capture 32 "garimpeiros" and the "garimpeiros" were later 
taken to the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ayacucho. 
  In the past few years dozens of Brazilian "garimpeiros" have 
been arrested by the National Guard on charges of illegal mining 
of gold and other minerals in Venezuela. On some occasions 
authorities were able to confirm reports of Venezuelan forays 
inside Brazilian territory. 
  Brazil and Venezuela share a common border 2,000 km long 
that 
is sparsely controlled, has minimal communications, and few 
settlements. 
  According to officials sources, the problem of illegal 
mining, the protection of indigenous populations, and the Amazon 
region's development will be discussed during an official visit 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco will make to Venezuela between 
3 and 5 March. 
  Franco will travel to Venezuela at the invitation of 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.

  [Text] Juiz de Fora -- Not only those on duty in Congress 
were called to mitigate the consequences of President Itamar 
Franco's behavior and comments these past few days. The 
president's friends also are trying to prove that Franco, 
secluded in Juiz de Fora, does not feel depressed by the 
consequences of his merry behavior during Carnival. 
  Telemig [expansion unknown] director Roberto Medeiros, who 
is 
one of Franco's closest friends, said: "The president is very 
happy; he is cheerful and in good spirits." 
  In the meantime, despite so much "happiness," Franco remains 
isolated in either his downtown apartment or his home in the 
Parque Imperial compound. In his apartment, Franco only 
received Secretary General of the Presidency Mauro Durante, 
adviser Saulo Moreira, his secretary Neusa Mitterhoff, and his 
friend Roberto Medeiros. On 18 February, as he left his 
apartment for another appointment with the dentist, Franco 
looked depressed. Franco spent some 130 minutes at dentist Luis 
Serrato's office, from where he went to his house located far 
from the downtown area. 
  Another friend of Franco's commented: "The president is no 
longer worried about what happened in Carnival. What worries 
him is the inflation rate, the serious national problems; that 
is why he looks serious." 
  Franco will return to Brasilia on 20 February, according to 
Acting Press Secretary Fernando Costa, who also denied the 
president met Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Juiz 
de Fora on 18 February.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Carlos Azedo] </F>
  [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] 
leadership is upset because President Itamar Franco -- while 
attending Carnival in Juiz de Fora on 15 February -- launched 
the presidential candidacy of [Finance Minister] Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso. The PSDB leaders believe this will only 
jeopardize the approval of the Social Emergency Fund. 
  Deputy Luiz Maximo (PSDB-Sao Paulo), the vice leader of the 
party bloc in the lower house, commented: "The president would 
do the country a favor if he remained quiet. There was no need 
for him to say what he did. Obviously, he has every right to 
express his choice, but launching the PSDB candidate is 
something that only concerns the party." 
  Senator Mario Covas, the party bloc leader in the Senate, 
was 
also upset by the president's comments because he believes they 
contradict the PSDB's strategy regarding the presidential 
succession and jeopardize the approval of the economic plan that 
will be voted for the second time by Congress next week. The 
PSDB candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo State -- who 
supports Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy whether the plan 
is approved or not -- said the PSDB should not voice an opinion 
on succession before 2 April; the deadline by which those who 
wish to run for election must resign from their public posts. 
  Federal Deputy Jose Anibal (PSDB-Sao Paulo) said the PSDB's 
strategy is to approve the plan and cooperate with the 
constitutional revision with a minimum agenda to guarantee 
essential reforms: Those involving tax, social security, 
political, and economic reforms. Only then will the party 
choose its candidate for the presidency of the Republic. 
  "All parties are taking the succession into account. I 
believe the plan should be approved and that a minimum agenda 
should be discussed despite the president's attitude," asserted 
Jose Anibal, minimizing the repercussion of Itamar Franco's 
comments. He said Carnival and the reaction of the minister 
have neutralized what the president of the Republic said.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul]), the rapporteur of 
the constitutional revision, on 17 February blamed President 
Itamar Franco for the possible problems he may encounter in 
getting the parties that guaranteed the passage of the Social 
Emergency Fund [FSE] in the first round of congressional 
balloting to support it in the second round. Jobim termed the 
president's launching of a ticket with [Finance] Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso as the presidential candidate and 
Deputy Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS) -- former social security 
minister -- as his running mate most untimely. 
  Jobim did not hide his annoyance with the president's 
position because all his efforts to lobby for the FSE in 
Congress -- and especially the PMDB (which vies with the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the same portion of the 
electorate) -- are centered on keeping support for the FSE 
separate from Cardoso's possible candidacy. 
  He said: It was not the right moment to talk about that. 
From a strategic standpoint, the president ought to have 
realized that he should avoid referring to candidacies now. 
During the first round of voting on the FSE, Jobim denounced 
the actions of Education Minister Murilio Hingel's advisers, who 
nearly sank the agreement worked out between Cardoso and the 
PMDB, the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the PSDB. 
  Jobim stated: Parties also have to decide whether they are 
interested in the country's situation or how they will fare in 
the election. 
  Jobim will not modify the text passed in the first round of 
voting last week. He commented that he intends to have the 
original FSE text voted through. He thus will propose rejecting 
the amendments introduced to the plan. The deadline for 
submitting amendments to the FSE, which would entail some 
modifications to the text approved in the first round, expired 
on 17 February. 
  Jobim said: There may be negotiations between parties, but 
we are very well disposed. 
  The majority of the 31 amendments introduced changes in the 
articles that deal with appropriations for education, housing, 
and health care. Jobim believes there is no need to modify the 
original text because Congress will be able to define new 
percentages to be appropriated for education when it votes on 
the law that will regulate the use of the FSE. He expects that 
the second round of voting on the FSE will take place on 23 
February. 
  He said: This is an odd struggle because congressmen may 
decide that afterward and they may even appropriate a 
considerably higher amount for education. 
  Jobim believes the FSE may be enacted at the end of the 
month 
if its text is not amended. He also agrees that the 
constitutional revision will have been concluded by 30 May. 
According to Jobim, there are enough proposals to establish an 
agenda for the constitutional revision; "only the political will 
of political parties is needed."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] candidate for 
the presidency of the Republic, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, was 
once again defeated last night -- this time by omission -- by 
the party's Executive Board. The national congressional bloc did 
not obtain authorization to participate in the constitutional 
revision process. In the meeting, Lula defended the idea of an 
autonomous position that would have given the party bloc the 
power to define a framework for participation with the contras 
[groups opposed to the revision] and decide on which points 
legislators could vote. But Lula did not even vote. He left 
before the meeting ended. Had he stayed and voted, the picture 
would have changed because the final vote ended up in a tie of 
eight votes for, eight against, and one abstention. 
  The tie left in effect a previous national Executive Board 
decision limiting the party bloc's participation to voting on 
the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) and attending negotiations on a 
maximum agenda to make sure that the revision ends by 15 May. 
  "The tense climate between the Executive Board and the party 
congressional bloc remains intact," PT Secretary General 
Gilberto Carvalho said, admitting to being surprised by the new 
impasse. 
  Deputy Jose Genoino (SP [Sao Paulo]) said the result is a 
disaster for the negotiations between party bloc members and the 
contras. 
  "They (contras) need to know whether they can count on our 
votes or not. Without a decision on this point the negotiation 
cannot progress," Genoino complained, adding that the decision 
will continue "tearing" the party bloc. 
  Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), congressional party bloc vice 
president, recognized that the difficulties for negotiations 
with the contras have increased, but said yesterday's tie shows 
that Lula's intervention has already helped change the internal 
crisis. 
  "We started losing by 15 to nil on this question. Then we 
lost by 15 to four, and now we got a tie," Eduardo Jorge said. 
  Lula also was defeated on the discussion of controversial 
items in the PT government platform. In order to please radicals 
and moderates, the moratorium stopped being explicitly mentioned 
as the path to negotiate the foreign debt, but it stayed 
camouflaged under a new definition defending the right of the 
future government to resort to a suspension of payments if 
creditors are inflexible. 
  Lula did not vote on this issue either. He left a message 
saying: "My position is to the left of the proposed draft." 
Federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), his economic adviser, 
not only voted in favor of the proposal but also spoke for it. 
State Deputy Ruy Falcao, who leads the radicals, said he finds 
no difference between a suspension of payments and a moratorium. 
  Lula also lost in the vote on Senator Eduardo Suplicy's (SP) 
minimum income proposal. The proposal, which would have been the 
basic item in the PT income redistribution program, was defeated 
by eight votes to seven, with four abstentions, obtained by the 
party economists' proposal. 
  The board also discussed the issue of the Armed Forces and 
approved a new draft where support for the Armed Forces' 
modernization prevails, but without making reference to military 
projects. 
<H5>  Criticism </H5>
  Lula criticized President Itamar Franco for his remarks 
supporting the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. 
  "As a citizen, Franco has the right to support any ticket of 
his liking, but as a president he has other responsibilities and 
needs to govern the country." 
  Lula then minimized the effect of Franco's remarks. 
  "The president is not wholly behind that ball; he was burned 
a little already."

  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- Aeronautics Minister Lelio 
Viana Lobo confirmed that the Brazilian Aeronautics Company 
(Embraer) privatization auction, scheduled for 24 March, has 
been postponed. According to the aeronautics minister, there are 
various problems now to complement the studies and decisions on 
the company's privatization process jointly studied by his 
ministry and the Finance Ministry. He noted: "All this budget 
and social function problem is strongly engulfing us." Embraer 
Superintendent Ozires Silva again stressed that the company's 
situation is very serious and requires a quick decision. 
  Embraer's directorate eagerly views the delay and 
confirmation of a new date, which still has not been set. Less 
than one month ago, the date was moved from 25 to 24 March. 
Ozires Silva emphasized: "Privatization represents the only 
short-term solution for Embraer." 
  In 1993, Embraer's sales were four times lower than its 
financial debt, estimated at $890 million. The Embraer director 
emphasized that it is necessary to guarantee the entry of income 
and manage a maximum debt of $200 million in order to again put 
the company on a sound footing and make it competitive and 
attractive for those interested in purchasing it. Nevertheless, 
the debt's capitalization systems still are being discussed by 
the federal government. 
  The only organization that benefited from the entire lack of 
decision on Embraer was the Embraer Defense Commission -- No To 
Privatization [Comissao de Defesa da Embraer -- Nao a 
Privatizacao], an organization of professional associations and 
trade unions. This organization's goals now have been enhanced 
because they are part of the campaign speeches delivered by PT 
[Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. 
  The Embraer Defense Commission -- No To Privatization has 
scheduled a meeting with Minister Viana Lobo early next week. 
During this meeting, an Embraer economic-financial feasibility 
study will be delivered and a retrogression in the company's 
privatization process will be discussed.

  [Text] Mangueira Hill slum had a tense day on 16 February 
as a result of the war staged by drug traffickers Polegar and 
Manino. The war started while the slum's samba group was 
beginning to parade along Marques de Sapucai Avenue. So far, 
seven people have been killed -- three of them belonged to 
Manino's gang and four to his rival Polegar's gang. The 
atmosphere of fear kept the Manguera Hill slum residents off 
their own samba rehearsal ground. Very few of them accompanied 
the vote counting on 16 February to choose the winner of the 
special samba group parade. 
  Some armed men freely circulated around the rehearsal ground 
and the neighboring alleys because there were no police 
patrolling the slum. An eyewitness, whose identity is being kept 
secret, testified at the 17th Police Precinct (Sao Cristovao 
District) on the war's details. According to the witness, 
Polegar -- who controls the part of the slum known as Chale -- 
planned to increase his territory as soon as the Mangueira Samba 
Group began parading. He planned to invade Manino's area -- the 
one known as Buraco Quente -- while everyone was attentively 
watching the samba group's performance during the parade. 
  Early on 16 February, 20 Polegar men wearing Civil Police 
jackets invaded the Buraco Quente area and killed three members 
of the rival drug trafficking gang. Manino answered the attack 
early the following morning, when four of Polegar's men were 
found dead.

  [Text] Mexico City, Feb 21 (AFP) -- During a formal event 
held in Mexico City today a group of Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) dissidents decided to back Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
[Party of the Democratic Revolution presidential candidate] as 
candidate for the presidency of the Republic, Marco Aurelio 
Sanchez, the spokesman of the dissident group asserted. 
  "We will not leave the PRI until our stay in the party is 
truly untenable," said the spokesman of the PRI dissident group, 
which is called the Progressive Democratic Current [Corriente 
Democratica Progresista]. Until they are expelled for breaking 
the party's bylaws, the PRI dissidents will try to find 
supporters for Cardenas within the government party, which has 
been in power for 64 years and whose candidate is former Social 
Development Secretary Luis Colosio. 
  Sanchez added that the dissident group has approximately 
20,000 members in Mexico City and the States of Mexico, 
Guerrero, and Aguascalientes, among others. He said the 
dissidents had decided to back Cardenas "despite pressures from 
the PRI leaders." 
  The elections will be held on 21 August, and it is expected 
that approximately 40 million Mexicans will cast their votes. 
  This is the second time Cardenas has run for the presidency. 
The first time was in 1988, when Cardenas headed a large 
movement that was formed after he left the PRI, where he had 
headed a democratic current for several months.

  [Text] Quito, 21 Feb (EFE) -- According to press reports, 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen dismissed Ecuadoran Information 
Minister Carlos Vera Rodriguez for showing disrespect for the 
command hierarchy by criticizing Vice President Alberto Dahik. 
  The president refused to confirm or deny such reports and 
noted that it will be Vera himself who will refer to this matter 
at a news conference that he will hold tomorrow, Tuesday. 
  Vera, a well-known journalist and radio and television 
producer in his country, urged Dahik to straighten up and not 
"spread rumors." Vera made this remark after the vice president 
announced that the government is studying the possibility of 
convoking a plebiscite on topics that have not been disclosed by 
government spokesmen yet. 
  The Ecuadoran vice president was elected to that post while 
ministers get appointed. According to television, radio, and 
newspaper reports, this explains the government hierarchy.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Feb (AFP) -- On 17 February, Jaime 
Yoshiyama Tanaka, president of the Peruvian Democratic 
Constituent Congress [CCD], said General Nicolas De Bari 
Hermoza, commander of the Armed Forces Joint Command and Army 
commander, "is innocent of the disappearance and deaths of the 
10 people at La Cantuta University." 
  During a news conference, Yoshiyama added: "The opposition 
is 
seeking to politicize the case by involving a general who has 
been very successful in the battle against terrorism in 
incidents in which he did not participate. Frankly, they are 
very mistaken in regard to Gen. Hermoza." 
  Yoshiyama, who by law is the vice president of the Republic 
but who does not perform the duties of the office, said the 
opposition is also attempting to involve high-ranking Army and 
intelligence officers in this case. 
  The CCD president also rejected statements being made by 
many 
people, including Catholic Church Bishop Augusto Vargas 
Alzamora, for military justice to impose the harshest punishment 
possible on those guilty of the disappearance and deaths of nine 
La Cantuta students and one professor. 
  "I believe a 20-year sentence for the guilty parties, as 
requested by the military prosecutor, is a drastic and severe 
sentence," the president of the CCD stressed. 
  The military prosecutor believes that six soldiers 
participated in the incident, and the punishment requested for 
them is between 15 and 20 years in prison each. The sentences 
requested for the other five soldiers, who are all charged with 
negligence, range from 30 days to five years in prison. 
  Since April 1993, the Peruvian opposition has been demanding 
"Hermoza's resignation so that justice can be meted out freely, 
because, as commander of the Armed Forces, the soldiers involved 
in La Cantuta case were under his command." Likewise, the 
opposition has also reiterated the charge made by Gen. Rodolfo 
Robles, who is currently in exile in Argentina. Gen. Robles has 
said "Gen. Hermoza is harboring" the death squad that carried 
out the killings at La Cantuta University in July 1992.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
guerrillas carried out another attack against U.S. interests 
today to protest the presence of a contingent of U.S. military 
engineers, a National Police spokesman reported. 
  The source said members of the Simon Bolivar National 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) detonated an explosive 
device at the American School parish in Cali, the third largest 
city in the country, resulting in no casualties but extensive 
property damage. 
  The attack, the second so far this week, destroyed windows 
in 
the school in the capital of Valle del Cauca Department, some 
400 km southeast of Santa Fe de Bogota, an official report 
stated. 
  Last Tuesday the rebels detonated an explosive device at a 
Mormon temple in Cali, causing extensive property damage. 
  The action is part of a campaign of attacks initiated by the 
rebels last January to protest the arrival of 150 U.S. Army 
soldiers from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, who are carrying out 
social projects in southwestern Colombia. 
  The CGSB issued a communique a few days ago saying all 
entities sponsored by the United States or by U.S. capital are 
considered military targets. Since that time, two seminarians 
from that country have been kidnapped and three Mormon temples 
and educational and financial centers in the largest cities have 
been attacked. 
  In the next few weeks, the Colombian Congress will 
investigate President Cesar Gaviria to determine if he did in 
fact violate the Constitution by authorizing the foreign mission 
to work in the country without permission from the Legislative 
Branch. 
  The police spokesman said security measures will be 
tightened 
at institutions or centers that are possible targets for attacks. 
  Moreover, rebel commando units torched four buses in 
Medellin, some 540 km northwest of this capital, which has 
frightened bus owners, many of whom have refused to provide 
service.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist 
People's Army (EPS), said yesterday that no deadlines are being 
imposed on the 3-80 Northern Front for the disarmament of its 
members. 
  "We are not putting them against the wall or imposing 
deadlines, but we hope it does not take too long because 
everything could fall apart," General Ortega said in a 
conciliatory tone after turning over a former military 
installation to the Nicaraguan Ecologist Brigades. 
  Ortega said, however, that the disarmament process of the 
rebels from the 3-80 Northern Front could begin in the next few 
days. 
  The 3-80 Northern Front staff sent the government a list 
with 
10 demands, including "the post of police chief in Jinotega and 
Nueva Segovia Departments, as well as in the Municipalities of 
Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, San Juan de Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, 
Ciudad Antigua, Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal, 
and Bocay." 
  According to the rebel leader's letter, the Army could 
continue to keep garrisons of up to 60 men in those 
municipalities, except Quilali. 
<H5>  No One Has Been Defeated </H5>
  The rebel leader Chacal also demands that the EPS return to 
its barracks and a subsequent demilitarization of northern 
Nicaragua. 
  The list of demands is signed by Esteban, Piloto, Franklin, 
Musun, Chele Gringo, and Rafael. The document also includes the 
creation of new settlements for development in Quilali and road 
repairs in the area. 
  The EPS chief said that once the rebel groups have disarmed, 
the only remaining troublesome groups will be the criminal 
bands, therefore there will be no reason to have EPS combat 
units in the area. 
  "We are willing to decrease the Army's military presence as 
long as they return to civilian life," Ortega said. 
  The EPS chief said: "Just as I told Talavera -- Chacal -- in 
the letter I sent him, no one is being defeated here. They will 
be returning to civilian life with dignity, and Nicaragua will 
be the winner." 
  According to Ortega, total peace will only be achieved by 
resolving the economic and social crisis. "If unemployment and 
poverty continue, peace will remain threatened," the military 
chief said. 
<H5>  Meeting Next Monday </H5>
  A meeting between the chiefs of staff and the government, in 
which Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command of the EPS, 
could participate, will be held next Monday in Ciudad Antigua, a 
government source told BARRICADA. 
  As for the controversial Military Organization Law, the Army 
chief said the draft bill is almost finished and will soon be 
turned over to the government for review.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal 
Gutierrez, who is the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] 
leader, noted yesterday that the announcement of the new U.S. 
drug enforcement strategy will cause political and social 
conflicts in our country. 
  The Chamber of Deputies president said the announcement of a 
reduction in U.S. cooperation in the field of alternative 
development will prompt "dissatisfaction" among coca producers. 
  Bedregal pondered: "We will have a very serious political 
conflict if the crops are reduced just to reduce them, without 
the proper alternative development planning. The poor coca 
producer, who is tied to the crisis in Bolivia, will be hard 
hit." 
  Bedregal wants the announcement handled "with much care," 
but 
announced that the discussions to approve the national budget 
will consider the issue when establishing our country's drug 
enforcement activities. He said the deputies may discuss this 
issue after the carnival adjournment. 
  Guillermo Richter, the Senate Government and Drug 
Trafficking 
Committee chairman, said he agrees that repression mechanisms 
should be "as efficient as possible" to prevent illegal 
activities. 
  Richter said: "I would have liked greater support in 
economic 
and financial terms -- not just from the Clinton Administration, 
but also from the international community -- to help our country 
and other states that are troubled by this scourge promote 
alternative development." 
  The U.S. Government's announcements mainly involve countries 
that produce raw materials to process drugs -- like Bolivia 
which produces coca leaves that are traditionally used for 
medicinal purposes, and cocaine. 
  While opinions on the U.S. President's announcement were 
voiced in Congress, executive branch sources linked to this 
issue -- the Ministry of Government and the Social Defense 
Secretariat -- did not comment. 
  Unofficial sources announced that the government will wait 
for the return of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who went 
to Oruro yesterday, before adopting a position or beginning 
discussions to establish the drug enforcement policy that will 
be implemented in our country.

  [Text] More than two years after the eruption of the 
Haitian political crisis, the international community, led by 
the United States, is relaunching negotiations in favor of a 
solution. For two weeks, the U.S. capital has been holding 
discussions. In Port-au-Prince, however, some political players 
are predicting new developments within the coming days. 
Following is a synopsis of the situation with Clarence Renois: 
  [Begin recording] In the 28th month of what is here and 
elsewhere considered an unprecedented crisis, the Haitian case 
seems to be rekindling interest in the eyes of the international 
community. Relegated to a number-three position of importance 
among the concerns of the world's great leaders, the Haitian 
case is gradually returning to a level of priority since the 
step taken by the American Center for Democracy, initiator of 
restarting Washington-Haitian negotiations. 
  In fact, for two weeks, the principal leaders of the Haitian 
parliament have been visiting the U.S. capital where senators 
and deputies have been working on writing a plan for a solution 
to the political crisis. Approved from the start by the United 
States, this plan also benefits from the firm support of the 
four countries, Friends of Haiti; and today, from the support of 
the United Nations, brought to bear by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The 
UN secretary general has thus quickly answered the letter from 
six Haitian legislators who were soliciting moral support from 
his organization. 
  Everything could lead us to believe that this latest attempt 
might be the good one if the intransigence -- the word is from 
the [U.S.] State Department --President Aristide's intransigence 
did not present an obstacle in the execution of the plan for a 
solution to the crisis. But careful! Besides the position of 
President Aristide, an unknown is the position of the military, 
concealed behind a complete, disconcerting silence. The military 
institution has said nothing about all these negotiations, at 
least not publicly or officially, while it is again a question 
of the anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief. 
  Deputy Samuel Madistin asked the judicious question, quote: 
Do six legislators have enough authority to force Gen. Raoul 
Cedras to respect what has not been respected in the Governors 
Island agreement, unquote. Another unknown in this situation is 
the position of some legislators who openly dissociate 
themselves from the initiative by their six colleagues. 
Furthermore, the crisis in the Senate of the Republic does not 
facilitate things either. 
  In any case, the coming days, even the coming hours, could 
be 
of importance because, FRAPH, [Revolutionary Front for Haitian 
Advancement and Progress] has launched an ultimatum to President 
Aristide, an ultimatum that expires today; and a senator of the 
republic has announced surprises for the coming hours. Today, 
once again, all eyes are turned on Washington, the capital of 
Uncle Sam, which for the past 28 months has been the center of 
political activities of the independent and sovereign Republic 
of Haiti. [end recording]

  [Text] The illegitimate office of the Senate of the 
Republic should meet with the Army chief, General Raoul Cedras, 
this afternoon. Let us listen to a report by our special envoy 
Gary Belizaire, live from the parliament. 
  [Belizaire] Lieutenant Gen. Raoul Cedras is expected this 
afternoon in the Senate of the Republic. The Justice, Interior, 
and Defense Commissions of the Senate have invited the Army 
commander in chief to provide explanations today of events such 
as those that occurred (?in the south) two weeks ago. If we are 
to believe what Senator Ebrane Cadet said, Gen. Cedras will be 
required to address the Senate about the upsurge of violence in 
the country. This invitation to Gen. Cedras proves that the 
parliament is working, added Sen. Cadet who did not explain 
whether this convening is part of the surprise he said would 
occur within 24 hours. 
  Meanwhile, the 18 January parliamentarians and the 
dissidents 
of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] are awaiting Gen. 
Cedras' arrival. The general will most likely attend the session 
because everything has already been arranged for the holding of 
this session. The electricity company of Haiti has provided 
power, whereas the area is usually deprived of electricity at 
this hour. Let us point out that the senators of the 
constitutionalist bloc are not present because they have not yet 
acknowledged the second office of the Senate of the Republic.

  [Text] The New Democratic Party [NDP] in St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines was returned to power in general elections held 
yesterday. As we heard this dispatch from (Andrea Braffitt), 
unlike the last general elections, the NDP did not secure all 
15, but this time 12 seats. 
  [Begin recording] [James Mitchell] What was begun here in 
North Leeward has continued and will continue, and this time and 
at other times, they will never stop this New Democratic Party. 
  [(Braffitt)] And this was precisely the case when the ruling 
New Democratic Party, with party leader James Mitchell, was 
reelected for a third consecutive term in St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines. An estimated 6 to 7 percent of the 72,000 persons 
eligible to vote turned out in Monday's general elections. 
  Last-lap campaign on Sunday was marked by violence. This 
time 
around, the NDP did not repeat the landslide victory as the 
opposition St. Vincent and the Grenadines Labor Party Movement 
for National Unity Alliance gained three of the 15 seats being 
contested. Successful opposition candidates are newcomer (Louie 
Streker) who won the Central Leeward seat from the NDP candidate 
Herbert Young. 
  [(Streker)] Our young people walk up and down and go to the 
politician's office and they make fools of them by telling them 
come back next week, come back the following week, and finally 
slip out of the back door. 
  [(Braffitt)] Vincent Beache, leader of the Alliance and 
former head of the SVLP in South Windward: 
  [Beache] And we know how enthusiastic you are and are you 
just waiting for the next 17 days or so to pass that you are 
gone have a new argument facer. All the newspapers says the sun 
is setting and certainly, come the 24th, that would be end of 
the sun because it would be eclipsed. 
  [(Braffitt)] And MNU leader, Dr. Ralph Gonsalves, in North 
Central Windward: 
  [Gonsalves] Joshua build and [name indistinct] build. 
Mitchell ain't build. For ten years today, know what Mitchell 
say, not last year but just the one before, he say his 
government is not in power to build houses for poor people. He 
say you want build house, you must go bank and borrow money. 
[applause] 
  [(Braffitt)] The Caribbean News Agency reports that some 
observers believe that the three seats won by the opposition 
party are a message to the NDP that there is some 
dissatisfaction with how it had run the affairs of the country. 
  [Mitchell] It was NDP before and it will be NDP, it will be 
NDP [repeats], it will be NDP [repeats]. 
  [(Braffitt)] The NDP is at the helm once again. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Commerce Secretary 
Jaime Serra Puche has denied the North American Free Trade 
Agreement discriminates against investors because the opening 
process for sectors is reflected in the Foreign Investment Law. 
  When he inaugurated the Mexican-German Business Meeting in 
Mexico City, Serra Puche asserted that the new Foreign 
Investment Law is applicable for all international investors, 
including the Germans, without any type of discrimination. 
  Serra Puche explained to the German businessmen that in the 
years to come there will be another Mexico "with the capacity to 
access other markets held by no other country in America. From 
Mexico, there will be free access to American, Canadian, and 
Central American markets," as well as the possibility of 
entering North, Central, and South American markets without 
paying duties, he said. 
  The official said foreign investments have broken all the 
records in Mexico. He noted that the country received $15.6 
billion in investments in 1993, while just in January 1994, 
investments had reached $2.370 billion. He emphasized that 
"Mexico has been gaining ground in the race to attract foreign 
capital and to use its own savings." 
  German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt and Tyll Necker, 
president of the German Industrial Confederation, support 
Mexico's membership to the OECD as a full-fledged member. He 
trusts that Mexico, in the short run, will become the 
"bridgehead" in uniting Latin American countries to enable them 
to join international development. 
  The German minister also asked the Mexican Government to 
implement the Foreign Investment Law changes to expedite his 
country's participation and to give preference to German 
investors. He highlighted that no country has managed to take 
such an important leap in such a short time as Mexico has, which 
after several years of fiscal deficit has managed to obtain a 
surplus and to decrease inflation. 
  German Minister Rexrodt recognized the importance of the 
Mexican-German double taxation agreement, which will increase 
Germany's commercial participation. German investment ranks 
second in Mexico, a country that is Germany's second commercial 
partner in Latin America with nearly 19 percent of the trade 
volume after Brazil.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish on 30 
January publishes on page 8 a 1700-word interview with former 
Economy Minister Roberto Alemann by Ana Gerschenson. According 
to Alemann, who is an economist, membership in NAFTA would not 
be a good thing for Argentina. He asserts that the United States 
wants his country to join the hemispheric trade bloc because 
Argentina represents a large market for U.S. goods and because 
Argentina does not have the problems that plague Mexico. Alemann 
points to an unidentified study which states that the 
incorporation of Argentina into NAFTA would mean, in present 
worth, a $900 million increase in U.S. exports to Argentina as 
opposed to an increase of less than $100 million in Argentine 
exports to the United States.

exports during January 1994 totalled $207 million, a $5-million 
increase over the same period in 1993. Once again, tourism and 
exports of nontraditional goods led the way despite a fall in 
the export of traditional goods and assembly plant products. 
Revenues from tourism totalled $54 million during January 1994 
representing a 30 percent increase with respect to January 1993. 
Excluding tourism, export revenues totalled $152 million, 5 
percent less than the $160 million received during January 1993.

  [Text] Panama City, 22 Feb (AFP) -- Today, Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister George Mamedov favored a "peaceful solution" to 
the Cuban crisis, and said his country could be "very useful" in 
a negotiated settlement in the island. Mamedov, who arrived in 
Panama on Monday for an official three-day visit, told the press 
the Cuban Government's decision to invite the opposition to a 
political dialogue was "very correct." 
  Mamedov, who, today, signed an agreement of understanding 
and 
political consultation with Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose 
Mulino, said: "Russia can be very helpful in solving Cuba's 
problems." 
  Mulino told reporters that Panama "looks favorably on" the 
position of the Cuban Government, which recently invited 
approximately 80 groups of exiled Cubans to a meeting to be held 
in Havana by late April. "We hope all involved parties can 
attend and the Cubans can attain a Cuban-style solution," he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Marisol Marin] </F>
  [Text] Cienfuegos, Cuba, 20 Feb (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina, 38, seems firmly determined to break 
ministry traditions with the use of his own style that sometimes 
surprises others, but which, he says, obeys the need to launch a 
"diplomatic offensive." 
  At the end of a tour of Cuban central provinces, Robaina 
explained to a group of newsmen that "Cuba is not just Havana; 
we must show the world what the rest of the country is, and for 
that, we must wage diplomacy in accordance with our times." 
  For the second time since he was appointed minister, a 
little 
less than 1 year ago, this time, Roberto Robaina invited the 
diplomatic corps accredited in the island to go on a three-day 
tour through Villa Clara, Sancti Spiritus, and Cienfuegos 
Provinces. With the minister leading them, the ambassadors 
visited everything from a military industrial plant to a mule 
breeding farm, peasant communities, child care centers, an 
agricultural school, an imposing raw sugar storage center, among 
other things. 
  Robaina insists that all of this is necessary because 
"Cuba's 
image abroad is frequently distorted, and that is why we must 
show the world the truth of our situation." In this manner, the 
ambassadors learned that the Armed Forces has not only reduced 
its expenses but it is using part of the military industry for 
civilian purposes in order to make some business and obtain 
benefits. 
  At the "Comandante Ernesto Guevara" military enterprise in 
Villa Clara Province, General Luis Perez Rospide explained that 
this factory not only produces conventional armament and 
cartridges, but also kitchen equipment for tourist installations 
as well as plows and wagons for farmers' use. The general 
emphasized that this industry is open to foreign investment and, 
of course, to the possibility of forming a mixed association for 
obtaining technology, market, and capital. "What I need are 
clients," said the general, "and we are willing to manufacture 
any product here which is within our possibilities and which is 
good business." 
  The diplomats were then taken to a peasant community in the 
Escambray mountain range where they received a long explanation 
of what the Turquino Plan for mountain agriculture is, which -- 
according to the people in charge of this program -- has 
obtained "great results" and prevented migration from the 
mountains to the cities. Obviously, the speakers were always 
local authorities who occasionally made some criticized the 
inefficient work of past times when Cuba was closely linked to 
the former USSR, and they always concluded with some statement 
along the lines that "we will get ahead." 
  In Cienfuegos, one of the most beautiful and developed 
cities 
of the island thanks to the established industrial capacity, 
even though many industries remain idle, the diplomatic corps 
specifically asked about the fate of the Electronuclear Plant, 
the construction of which was halted a little over 18 months ago 
due to a lack of resources from both Russia as well as Cuba. 
Manuel Menendez Castellanos, party secretary in the province 
said "that plant is a plum," after explaining that there are "at 
least 30 countries" interested in that installation because "it 
has been proven to be well built and in excellent condition." 
Menendez went on to say "the problem is that a large investment 
must be made and the negotiations are very complex," but he did 
not explain which the countries have been contacted. 
  The tour not only included visits and explanations, but also 
nights for dancing in which the ambassadors danced up a storm. 
Even the foreign minister showed he could move to the rhythm of 
salsa music like any other Cuban. His demonstration was brief, 
but sufficient. "Believe it or not, these things ease tensions 
and relations," a Robaina adviser told the newsmen. 
  At the end of this tour, some said it was worthwhile 
because, 
in general, the chiefs of diplomatic missions are too secluded 
in Havana while others, a few of them, thought it was a waste of 
time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Rebelde </F>
journalist Roberto Cavada; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] As our listeners will recall, our colleague Jose 
Mejia recently interviewed OAS Secretary General Joao Baena 
Soares on this same newscast. On that occasion, Baena Soares 
confirmed to Mejia, and of course the millions of Exclusivo 
listeners, his proposal, before a special session of the OAS in 
Mexico, that Cuba's return to such an important continental 
forum be discussed. 
  In an exclusive [interview], Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina has given the Exclusivo newscast his opinion on this 
matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] There is a much more fundamental 
problem involved. We... [rephrases] I mean, we were expelled. It 
is up to those who expelled us to say whether or not they think 
the conditions exist. We have always had our own opinion on that 
expulsion, and about the cause that [word or words indistinct]. 
If the countries and the basic scene from which we were expelled 
consider that it is time for Cuba... [changes thought] but not 
because it has lost or gained any conditions, or credibility. 
(?If) that is not the (?cause), but rather because they think a 
country such as ours should not be absent from an institution of 
that type, an institution with such characteristics -- which is 
what we think -- it is not Cuba that is going to set up 
obstructions. 
  I am grateful for the pronouncement that has been made, and 
I 
think it is also part of the new space, the space that Cuba -- 
through its work, and through its truth, and through its virtues 
and defects -- has opened up for itself in the America to which 
we belong. 
  [Cavada] And how does Cuba feel about the proposal of 
Gaviria 
as president of the OAS? 
  [Robaina] I think that a country that is not in the OAS does 
not have the right to an opinion regarding who is the best or 
worst candidate. It seems to me that we are all at present 
looking at the possibilities; and President Gaviria is 
undoubtedly a person who is concluding a mandate, concluding a 
responsibility. He is a person with a history, a point of 
reference, and some results. I am absolutely convinced that the 
members of that institution will know how to evaluate who the 
best person for president is. [end recording] 
  Those were exclusive statements by Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Gonzalez regardng opinions expressed over this 
same newscast by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares having 
to do with his proposal that the return of Cuba to such an 
important continental forum be discussed. 
  This is Roberto Cavada wishing you a good evening, Cubans.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina toured 
tobacco-growing areas of Pinar del Rio in the company of foreign 
journalists accredited in Cuba. They were received by students 
and workers from the Federico Engels Pre-University Vocational 
Exact Sciences Institute, with whom they discussed the teaching 
system used at this center as part of the revolutionary 
education [program], linking study with work. 
  In foreign policy we work from the basis of what is done in 
the interior of the country, and tobacco is one of the principal 
scenes. That is why we are here -- said Minister Robaina, upon 
visiting tobacco fields in San Juan [y Martinez] and San Luis 
Municipalities. On that occasion, he and those accompanying him 
spoke with mobilized workers, volunteers, and Havana students 
who are fulfilling their phase of the School-in-the-Fields plan. 
  This province produces 70 percent of Cuba's tobacco, a 
product that brings approximately $100 million to the the 
national economy. This year, the people of Pinar del Rio have 
planted 1,800 caballerias of tobacco, from which they expect to 
harvest approximately 470,000 quintals of a quality far higher 
than that seen in recent times. 
  After spending an entire day with us in Pinar del Rio, these 
colleagues of the press have had an opportunity to get to know 
the reality of the Cuban people more closely.

  [Text] Mexico will advocate the elimination of the U.S. 
blockade of Cuba because it feels the measure is prejudicial to 
our population. During a private appearance before the foreign 
relations board of the standing committee of the Congress of the 
[Mexican] Union, Mexico's designated ambassador to Cuba briefly 
discussed the principal objectives of his work program in Cuba. 
In this connection, he emphasized that it is necessary to 
increase commercial and financial relations between the two 
nations, especially in sectors that are priority sectors for 
Mexican investment, among which are: basic industry, health, 
communications, construction, foodstuffs, and the hotel 
industry. The designated ambassador said the Mexican Embassy 
will need to stimulate, create, promote, and manifest projects 
for joint activity in whatever promotes sources of reciprocal 
exchange and consolidates and expands Mexico's presence on the 
Cuban market.

  [Text] Repatriation and expediency of visa procedures were 
the main issues discussed at the Second Cuban-American 
Professionals and Entrepreneurs Seminar with Cuban officials 
which began on 21 February in Havana. The participants, who have 
come from the United States, have numerous questions on the 
possibility of the gradual expansion of ties between Cuba and 
the Cuban community abroad. The increasing number of people 
wanting to travel to Cuba was discussed, as well as the growth 
in the number of people abroad who are against the economic 
blockade. 
  Jorge Gomez Barata, an official of the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of Cuba, spoke at the meeting about the 
willingness of Cuban authorities to show greater flexibility on 
emigration issues and stressed that one of the duties of the 
state is to ensure the security and tranquility of the 
population; hence, the existence of controls and requirements. 
  This is the second meeting of its kind with members of this 
group. The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member 
of the Politburo, and Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban 
Institute of Friendship with Peoples.

  [Text] The Nico Lopez refinery's catalytic cracking 
[craqueo catalitico] plant resumed operations this week. This is 
the plant responsible for refining the largest quantity of 
gasoline in the country. Nevertheless, the problems extend 
beyond this factory, and [fuel] availability remains low. 
  From the very beginning of the year, fuel availability 
plummeted due to trade delays and the shutdowns in the nation's 
production plants. The latest situation at the Nico Lopez plant 
occurred because of a lack of input. However, once one 
difficulty is solved, others arise, such as the very important 
need for maintenance, which is a year behind schedule because of 
lack of financing. 
  According to the director of Cupet [expansion unknown], the 
gasoline situation today depends on the nation's financial 
situation. 
  [Begin Cupet director recording] Essentially, there is a 
financial problem that causes the availability of fuels to be 
considerably below the real demand today, below the amount 
needed to accomplish the economy's essential activities -- 
activities essential to both the economy and the population. The 
difficulties make it impossible for us to ensure a certain 
stability regarding the time and quantities in which the various 
fuel supplies are guaranteed for the nation's different 
activities. [end recording] 
  What is happening regarding gasoline is also the case for 
kerosene and liquified gas. Availability levels have dropped 
considerably. In 1989, the amount of fuel oil was over 6 
million, while in 1993, it exceeded only 3.5 million. [sentence 
as heard] 
  As for liquified gas, 135,000 metric tons were distributed 
in 
1989, while in 1993, there were only 59,900. Likewise, last 
year, only 299,000 tons of kerosene were distributed, compared 
to 613,000 in 1989. It was predicted that distribution levels 
would improve in 1994 due to important intergovernmental 
agreements, international price adjustments, and particularly, 
economizing. Nevertheless, the anticipated response has not been 
forthcoming during these first two months [of 1994]; and both 
private and state [enterprises], including priority sectors, 
have been affected. 
  In order to predict what will happen in the future, one 
would 
have to make so many suppositions when only time itself will 
tell. What is true, however, is the nation's financial 
instability. We will be able to solve the fuel problem to the 
extent that financial instability is resolved.

  [Text] A National Revolutionary Police [PNR] patrol unit in 
Havana was one of the Interior Ministry bodies selected to hold 
a workers assembly. Lack of controls at state enterprises and 
units, profiteering, pilfering, and illegal sales of products 
were among the recurring issues debated in an effort to 
contribute to streamlining our economy and fostering the fight 
against crime. 
  [First unidentified speaker] "The reason I stress the 
population's support of the police is that these people are 
selling things and are contributing, to some degree, to 
increased need in the population. The population wants to eat 
sandwiches and can find none. The state has no means of 
providing them. These people are selling guava sandwiches and 
thus the population's need is satisfied. We are not against 
this. But what is the price of that guava sandwich? Some may 
think this does no harm; but not everyone is able to pay 20, 30, 
or 40 pesos for a ham sandwich or 50 pesos for a rice and pork 
boxed lunch. I believe that the first thing the population has 
to do is to support the police in this effort. We ought to 
arrest these people who are selling products at elevated prices. 
People in the streets tell me: I am not a policeman. Perhaps 
not; but as a revolutionary, you are also a policeman." 
  [Second unidentified speaker] "We all have to realize that 
cheese sandwiches take flour. Who produces flour? The state 
alone. Therefore, that person is profiting by selling the bread 
made by the state. I get a tiny piece of bread and, as a 
revolutionary, have to be happy with it. I am a revolutionary. I 
am a communist. I must be satisfied with that piece of bread 
that is my ration. We do not have the resources to distribute 
bigger portions. I give my little piece of bread to my son to 
take to school so he can get through the day. How come these 
people are selling bread? I have to fight these people, just as 
I do those selling pizzas. I arrest them and cannot shirk. 
Where did he get the flour when the pizzerias are closed 
because of the shortage of flour? Where did he get the flour? 
The state is the sole producer of flour. Only the state produces 
bars of soap. So all those people selling those products on the 
streets are doing so at the expense of the state. I agree with 
what the comrade said earlier: What we need is control." 
  [Third unidentified speaker] "I believe that if we arrest 
all 
these people....[changes thought] despite some saying that they 
are small fry, we still have to arrest them. Some say, catch 
them at the factory; but these people have already dodged 
factory controls. Let us arrest them. We have a 24-hour-a-day 
presence on the streets. I believe that in the end this 
contributes to the distribution of soap, flour, bread, pizza, 
and everything else to the people. I believe that we cannot lose 
a single day, although some feel this should be the 
responsibility of other bodies. No, this is everyone's task and 
we all must support it." 
  [Fourth unidentified speaker] "The state has to take control 
in Jaguey. People say that entire plantations of oranges are 
rotting. People are going there to profit from that. Who owns 
that product? It is a state product that the state could sell to 
the population and recover its investment. Who is making money? 
The bandits in the streets who have the resources the state 
lacks. This is a measure the state ought to take." 
  [Fifth unidentified speaker] "You visit Guira and find 
plantains rotting on the ground. You ask the manager why there 
are no plantains in Havana when they are rotting here. He 
answers that there is no transportation. This is a shame. Anyone 
can go to Guira and carry home a bag of plantains; otherwise, 
they rot on the ground. However, the local patrolman confiscates 
the plantains and fines the person 40 pesos. [Inaudible rebuttal 
by another speaker] No. One has to keep the worker in mind. We 
know who is a worker and who is a profiteer. We have to feel for 
the worker who goes there to get a bag of plantains to feed his 
family, not for the person who day after day fills the trunk of 
his car to sell them in Havana." 
  With political courage, Havana's provincial patrol unit 
policemen discussed shortcomings they need to overcome. 
  [Sixth unidentified speaker] "Is this not included in the 
Official Gazette? Is this not a crime of profiteering? Just as 
the PNR does nationwide, I go and arrest this individual 
carrying 60,000 pesos in the trunk of his car. We check his file 
and find that he has an criminal record and no job. Hence, where 
does the money come from? Why is he not indicted? Why he is not 
tried for profiteering when that is a crime?" 
  The opinions expressed by the members of Havana's provincial 
police patrol unit do not differ from those expressed everyday 
by Cuban workers, because they are an integral part of the 
people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>
  [Text] The parliaments in the workplace convened by Cuban 
labor unions to analyze economic issues have entered their final 
stage. They have resulted in an abundance of reflections, 
suggestions, and very interesting critical assessments, all of 
which have been aired in a climate of free participation by the 
workers. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the Cuban labor union 
movement began consulting with its rank-and-file on how the 
nation can increase work efficiency and resolve its internal 
finances. It is estimated that by the end of the process -- 
early March -- a total of 3 million workers will have 
contributed their points of view. One of the most prominent 
matters, and one that has been reiterated in thousands of 
parliaments in the workplace held up until now, is related to 
the harmful impact of excessive personnel in factories, 
workshops, and service centers. Excessive personnel works 
against efforts to reduce costs and to increase profitability. 
  True, there is concern about the ultimate fate of workers 
who 
are declared redundant, because these workers may have become so 
involved with their jobs and with their coworkers that they may 
not want to change jobs. Nevertheless, beyond this 
understandable situation, the truth is that no Cuban fears being 
fired as a result of measures aimed at rationalizing the work 
force. The nation's authorities and the labor unions agree on 
the need to find alternative formulas to avoid the abandonment 
of one single Cuban. 
  Along these lines, ideas have been discussed on organizing 
courses to retrain workers, as well as on assigning excessive 
personnel to farming or housing construction duties. Maybe, 
because they feel secure in terms of their future, the 
participants in the parliaments in the workplace have so far 
agreed that the country cannot continue having exaggerated 
personnel rosters in the majority of its centers of production. 
The attendees, amid heated labor union discussions, have 
suggested solutions, some of which could possibly be applied by 
company administrators. 
  Meanwhile, the nation's authorities are not sitting back, 
and 
certain practices are being tested, as with the publishing house 
in the eastern municipality of Palma Soriana. After the 
production of books was halted because of a lack of paper, the 
publishing house assumed alternate tasks and retained its work 
force. Now it is making a profit. As long as there are 
resources available, the Cuban Government will encourage such 
emergency formulas in order that the unavoidable process of 
personnel rationing does not turn into unfavorable remedies for 
the workers.

  [Text] This year will be marked by economic policies 
changes and restructuring but will not be worse than 1993, 
according to Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister president of the 
State Committee for Finances. Rodriguez gave a special address 
to a packed room at the Convention Center where the Computing-94 
International Fair and Conference were inaugurated. This event 
is of great interest to a large number of specialists. 
  Rodriguez said that 1994 should not experience further drops 
in production and that the national economy will perform better, 
even if it is not marked by recovery. Following the hour-long 
address, Rodriguez answered participants' questions. He added 
that every adjustment process is painful but that Cuba is trying 
to make things as fair as possible and is particularly ensuring 
that it has as much support as possible. Rodriguez added that 
this explains the workers assemblies being conducted by the 
Cuban Workers Federation and its unions. 
  Rodriguez reported that as of 1993, there were 112 foreign 
investment agreements, one-fifth of which are joint enterprises, 
particularly in tourism and basic industry.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 17 and 22 
February. 
  Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 17 February reports that Manuel 
Hermoso, head of the autonomous government of the Canary 
Islands, will arrive in Havana on 18 February for a visit both 
friendly and official. He will be accompanied by a businessmen's 
delegation. Hermoso and Pedro Chavez, president of the 
Provincial Assembly of the People's Government of Havana City 
Province, are to sign a cooperation agreement. After meeting 
with the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Small 
Farmers, and other organizations, Hermoso and the delegation 
accompanying him are scheduled to leave for Venezuela on 23 
February. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 17 February reports the 
following: Cuban biotechnology specialists have made, from 
marine microorganisms, a compound that can biodegrade oil spills 
in the sea. Among the advantages of this compound is the fact 
that it can be stored for use when needed. Specialists say the 
Cuban biological compound is very different from existing 
compounds . 
  The four-star, 140-room Farallon del Caribe Hotel has been 
officially inaugurated at the Marea del Portillo tourist hub in 
Granma. Cubanacan president Abraham Maciques highlighted the 
hotel's importance to the region's economic and social 
development. "The tourist complex is run by the Canadian firm 
Commonwealth Hospitality, whose president was present at the 
inauguration." With the opening of the new hotel the tourist 
complex has a total of 280 rooms. The Marea del Portillo and 
Punta de Piedra Hotels are also in that area. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 18 February reports that the 
Cuban Hydrography Institute, in cooperation with several 
scientific institutions, has collected a large amount of data 
through the embankment works carried out in the northern part of 
Ciego de Avila and Camaguey. With these data the institute has 
published an oceanographic atlas of extremely good quality which 
was submitted to the third congress of marine science. According 
to Engineer Angel Luis Chirino, one of the authors of the atlas, 
the oceanographic atlas of the waters of the Sabana-Camaguey 
archipelago is the result of more than 20 years of research by 
the Cuban Hydrography Institute. This atlas reflects the 
ecological changes caused by the embankment works carried out in 
the zone and all the oceanographic variables of temperature, 
currents, salinity, and tides. He added that more than 20 
researchers participated in this work. More than 100 km of 
rockfill embankments are being built in the archipelago to 
facilitate exploitation of area resources for tourism purposes. 
  Radio Reloj at 2049 GMT on 18 February reports that the 
Fantastico travel agency, "which has up to now operated as a 
Cubanacan travel agency," hopes to bring 300,000 tourists to 
Cuba this year and collect $11 million dollars. "Its new name 
aims to give an image of the agency's plans. In the last period, 
the agency served over 240,000 visitors and took in over $8 
million." The travel agency's manager said Fantastico maintains 
relations with 60 agencies and tour operators worldwide, and has 
60 tour circuits throughout Cuba, which over 20,000 summer 
vacationers took last year." He added that the agency offers 15 
to 20 options at every Cubanacan forum, and can handle an 
average of 80 operations daily. 
  Radio Reloj at 2035 GMT on 21 February reports that Ciego de 
Avila Province has had a record grapefruit harvest during the 
1993- 94 harvest period, thanks to microjet irrigation. The 
province harvested 14,501 tons of grapefruit. Fields using the 
microjet irrigation system had yields of 16 tons per hectare. 
Over 200 hectares using the microjet system went into production 
during the last campaign. The grapefruit was processed in the 
town of Ceballos. 
  Radio Reloj at 2037 GMT on 21 February notes that the 
workers 
of Ciego de Avila made and recycled approximately 200,000 spare 
parts in 1993, most of them destined for cane sector equipment 
to be used in the current sugar harvest. 
  Radio Reloj at 2039 GMT on 21 February announces that the 
first plant in Villa Clara for recycling batteries began 
operating on 21 February in Camajuani Municipality. The plant 
can deliver approximately 200 batteries per month, and is 
located within the bus rebuilding facility belonging to the 
People's Government transportation sector. The plant cost 31,000 
pesos, and the equipment was taken from other workshops. Ernesto 
Suarez, secretary of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government, inaugurated the plant. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 21 February reports that 
five railway cars are being built for a new train that is to 
link the cities of Holguin and Las Tunas. The passenger cars 
used in Holguin's intercity trains are made from old bus bodies 
on platforms that were formerly used to transport merchandise. 
The new cars are to be finished before 24 February. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 22 
February reports that Brazilian businessmen, managers of firms 
in the Brazilian states of Parana and Minas Gerais, who visited 
Cuba at the end of January said on 21 February that they see 
ample possibilities for doing business with Cuba, which is 
currently obtaining good results from its economic policies. 
These Brazilian managers expressed their satisfaction with the 
contacts regarding investments made in Havana at the end of 
January. "According to the daily paper JORNAL DO BRASIL, the 
firms are interesting in forming joint organizations with Cuban 
state enterprises that are making effective moves."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmentas from San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas; from the "Panorama Newscast" -- live] 
  [Text] Representatives from the Mexican Cardenist Party 
[PCM], Labor Party [PT], Mexican Democratic Party [PDM], of the 
Democratic Revolution Party [PRD], two factions of the PRT 
[Revolutionary Workers Party], one representative from the PRI, 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party], and one representative from 
the Mexican Green Ecologist Party this morning met with the EZLN 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army] delegation that is attending 
the meetings for peace and reconciliation. 
  The party leaders went to the cathedral of San Cristobal de 
las Casas and talked for 30 minutes with the EZLN members led by 
Subcommander Marcos to express their support for the agreements 
to be reached during these peace talks. 
  PCM Secretary General Jorge Amador Amador spoke about the 
dialogue they held with Subcommander Marcos and the rest of the 
EZLN delegation: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did the party 
representatives make any specific proposal to the EZLN delegates? 
  [Amador] I think that the most important aspect of this is 
the fact that these political organizations are willing -- 
according to its strength and convictions -- to support the 
agreements to be reached during the peace and reconciliation 
meetings. I believe all of the organizations present here 
emphasized their support. The EZLN representatives repeatedly 
demanded this support, which they need. We left open the 
possibility that we might hold bilateral meetings and that as 
the talks advance, we will be kept informed of the results, we 
will be consulted, and naturally we will be able to give our 
points of view, if requested. 
  [Reporter] With whom did you meet? 
  [Amador] We met with the entire delegation of the EZLN led 
by 
Subcommander Marcos. 
  [Reporter] What was his message? 
  [Amador] He requested that we understand and value their 
struggle, that we express our solidarity, and that we help them 
get ahead. [end recording] 
  Also present at this meeting, among others, were: PDM 
President Marcelo (Gargiola); Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the 
Green Ecology Party; Everto Castillo and Mario Saucedo, for the 
PRD; and PRI party member Alfredo Rojas Diaz Duran, on a 
personal basis.

  [Text] Chilpancingo, Mexico, 22 Feb (AFP) -- About 700 
members of the 500 Years of Indian Resistance Council of 
Guerrero [Consejo Guerrerense 500 Anos de Resistencia Indigena] 
began a march to Mexico City to demand a solution to their 
claims and in support of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
(EZLN). 
  The Indians, which make up the four ethnic groups that live 
in the 34 municipalities in Guerrero State, left Monday night 
with signs that read "Indians, never again second class 
citizens," "For a court that judges violations to Indian human 
rights," and "Solidarity with the noble and fair cause of our 
Chiapas brothers." Included in their requests, the demonstrators 
demand compliance with the EZLN demands for democracy, justice, 
and liberty; autonomy for the Indian peoples; the creation of a 
state fund for the development of their peoples; and that the 
state satisfy the needs of employment and services. 
  The Guerrero Indians and other Indians who have arrived from 
different parts of the country, on 3 March will participate in a 
Mexico City rally and they have requested an audience with 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  Yesterday the EZLN and the government began their first 
peace 
talks in San Cristobal de las Casas, in the southern State of 
Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmiento following a news conference </F>
by EZLN leader Subcommander Marcos in San Cristobal de las Casas 
on 22 February -- the second day of peace talks between the EZLN 
and the Mexican Government; from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] The second meeting between EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] delegates and Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis with media representatives began at 1845 on 
the second day of negotiations. The talks are part of the peace 
and reconciliation negotiation process taking place at the 
Cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is now being 
called the Cathedral of Peace. 
  Yesterday, Subcommander Marcos, who heads a group of 19 EZLN 
delegates, said his group will present to Peace Commissioner 
Camacho Solis its list of demands. Today, Subcommander Marcos 
affirmed that the dialogue for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas is on the right track. 
  [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] We want to tell the 
people of Mexico, as well as tell the peoples and governments of 
the world -- and we want to tell you, representatives of the 
national and international media -- that the dialogue is on the 
right track. We have found people are listening to us, and we 
have seen a real determination toward achieving a solution. 
  Here, I want to address the concern that has been expressed 
over our masked faces and our weapons. We do not understand the 
concern with our faces, because before 1 January [the start of 
the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas] our faces did not exist for you. 
The faces of Ramona, Felipe, David, Eduardo, and Ana Maria did 
not exist for this country on 1 January. Nevertheless, if you 
want to know whose faces are behind the ski masks, it is very 
easy -- simply pick up a mirror and look into it. 
  We want to tell you -- and we want to tell those who have 
told the truth, not those who have followed the path of lies -- 
that if the killing has indeed stopped, it is thanks to you and 
the people behind you. We ask, as brothers, that you continue 
to tell the truth, and, if possible, we ask those of you who 
have been telling lies to please stop lying. 
  We want you to support this ongoing dialogue. We want you to 
report plainly what we are saying. What we are saying is the 
truth. It is not good to seek two interpretations when only one 
exists. This could bring about more problems in the future. 
  As I explained to you before, we are not carrying weapons 
out 
of mistrust for the government but, rather, for fear of those 
forces whose interests have been affected by our movement. We 
think that on this second day, after our main demands have been 
listed -- yes, they have been pondered by the peace commissioner 
-- we are moving toward seeking avenues that might allow us to 
reach specific accords. Also, the committee asked me to clearly 
state the following: It is ready to seek another alternative, if 
this is possible, and to seek your advice and support in this 
search for peace -- a peace with dignity -- for which we are 
hoping. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro; from the "Acir Radio News" </F>
newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Announcer Jose Cardenas] Jorge Madrazo, National 
Human Rights Commission [CNDH] president, has called a press 
conference to present a preliminary report on the results of 52 
days of investigations on the respect for human rights in 
Chiapas, specifically in the area of the armed conflict. We now 
go to Oscar Navarro with the details. 
  [Navarro] Just as you said, Jorge Madrazo, after presenting 
his preliminary report on the events of Altos de Chiapas, has 
said the CNDH has stated it has received and begun to 
investigate 218 complaints involving 727 individuals. Of these, 
20 are due to acts perpetrated by the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army [EZLN]; seventy-six are against members of the 
Mexican Army; four are against personnel from the Attorney 
General's Office; three are against employees and state 
government officials, and one is against the municipal 
presidents of Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Tenejapa. 
  In a lengthy communique, Ombudsman Jorge Madrazo has stated 
the CNDH has 218 case files regarding, among others, 56 murders, 
30 cases of aggression, 427 kidnappings and disappearances, 25 
cases of torture, 80 for illegal arrest, four for illegal 
property confiscation, two for intimidation, two for robbery, 
and four for air strikes. I believe we should hear what Jorge 
Madrazo had to say about the air strikes. 
  [Begin Madrazo recording] It has been initially determined 
the projectiles used where the CNDH conducted its investigation 
are known as rockets. Their destructive capability, given the 
expansive range and effects of fragmentation, is less than that 
caused by what is commonly known as a bomb. [end recording] 
  [Navarro] Madrazo added 404 cases of missing people have 
been 
solved; twenty-three are still pending. He also highlighted the 
fact that 20,000 people have fled from their homes in the areas 
where the EZLN is operating. There have also been reports of 
abuse against Indians. Let's listen to the report on deaths in 
the before mentioned municipalities. 
  [Begin Madrazo recording] There were a total of 40 deaths; 
of 
these, 20 were identified as civilians; six were government 
troops, and 14 were unidentified individuals who have not yet 
been claimed and who could very well be EZLN members. This has 
not been confirmed. The total number of deaths reported at the 
CNDH is 145, including 14 members of the Mexican Army and 38 
public security personnel. [end recording] 
  [Navarro] The ombudsman explained CNDH intervention will not 
cease when the investigations conclude. The commission has 
agreed to establish a permanent program for Altos de Chiapas and 
the surrounding jungles, which will be to attend to the 
consequences in which the conflict will surely result. 
  Madrazo concluded the CNDH has determined that several 
Indian 
chiefs, who in addition to demanding that the commission leave 
the Chiapas region, could jeopardize the peace process, just to 
defend their selfish interests.

  [Text] Mexico City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico will 
maintain its policy of asylum and respect for human rights of 
immigrants, but will not allow the use of its territory as a 
springboard for Cubans trying to go to the United States, a 
diplomatic source said today. 
  Carlos Alejandro Tello, the designated Mexican ambassador to 
Cuba, said Mexico "will maintain its policy rejecting the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba, implemented more than 30 years ago, and 
will advocate its elimination because it harms the Cuban people." 
  Asked if the Mexican Foreign Secretariat has asked its 
diplomats to report on the Chiapas situation in the countries 
where they are accredited, Tello said "we were instructed to 
tell the truth from the start of the incidents." He added that 
"if I am confirmed as ambassador to Cuba, I will do as I did in 
Moscow; I will say it is a local problem, a Mexican problem. 
There should be no foreign intervention and a political solution 
will be sought through dialogue." 
  He said he has received no special instructions for carrying 
out his duties in Cuba. "Mexico will not only maintain the 
excellent and solid relations that currently exist, but will 
strengthen them by redoubling efforts in the areas of tourism, 
oil, and industry," he stressed. 
  Tello, who has been the Mexican ambassador to Portugal and 
Russia, among other positions, expects to be confirmed 
ambassador to Cuba by a Congressional plenum on Wednesday [23 
February].

<F P=106> [Report by "zz": "Minister Rexrodt Expresses Recognition </F>
for Mexico's Policy of Opening Up"] 
  [Text] Mexico City -- On the occasion of the opening of 
the Technogerma '94 fair, Federal German Economics Minister 
Guenther Rexrodt described Mexico's opening up to the rest of 
the world as "a courageous and correct decision." Rexrodt said 
that "over the past few years, Mexico has prepared for the leap 
into an industrial society." 
  In his opening speech, Rexrodt recalled the tradition of 
German industrial exhibitions in Mexico. The first large-scale 
industrial fair was staged in Mexico City exactly 40 years ago, 
in 1954. The choice of Mexico for Technogerma 1994 is a signal: 
As the fair only takes place every three to four years in an 
important partner country "with which economic and technological 
cooperation should be particularly enhanced," this now "opens a 
new chapter in German- Mexican economic relations." 
  The German economy can build on a solid base in Mexico: For 
some years now, the country has been the biggest purchaser of 
German goods in Latin America. In 1992, the volume of bilateral 
trade reached 5.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Federal 
Republic's trade surplus amounted to DM2.5 billion. However, in 
1993, the exports to Mexico and imports of Mexican goods into 
Germany both declined: "All possible efforts must be made to 
reduce the growing bilateral trade deficit (Mexico) with 
Germany." 
  Rexrodt urged the Mexican export industry to use the 
opportunities presented by the German market with its 80 million 
consumers. "Display presence instead of abstinence." Germany 
is the second largest investor in Mexico after the United 
States. That stems not only from the German investment capital 
flowing into Mexico, but also from the fact that a high share of 
the profits earned in Mexico are reinvested. 
  "NAFTA, which was formed recently," said Rexrodt, referring 
to the North American Free Trade Zone, which was established on 
1 January 1994, "will encourage the development of much closer 
ties between the two North American states and Mexico, and that 
will result in an increase in investment." The Federal Republic 
hopes that a German-Mexican treaty on the protection and 
promotion of investment will have a positive effect. Bonn is 
exchanging ideas about such a treaty with the Mexican 
Government. The "Report of the Year 2000 Commission," which was 
presented in Mexico City also describes new areas for 
cooperation between Germany and Mexico. 
  In his opening speech, Rexrodt also stated that there was 
"enormous potential for economic growth" in environmental 
protection. In Germany alone, the market for goods that are not 
harmful to the environment amounts DM40 billion a year. The 
market is growing at a rate of between 6 and 8 percent. NAFTA 
will present Mexico new challenges in this very area of 
environmental protection. 
  Rexrodt praised the policies aimed at promoting stability 
being pursued by President Salinas de Gortari and his 
government: "The Mexican economy has come out of the painful 
and difficult adjustment process stronger." This path is "an 
essential condition for overcoming structural difficulties, 
achieving further economic growth, and thus, above all, for the 
political stability that is so important." 
  This year's Technogerma has far more to offer than its 
predecessors, stressed Rexrodt. There will be a symposium 
covering such topics as the transfer of knowhow, background 
information on "Germany as a center of industry," and a series 
of side events to promote cultural exchange. "Technogerma," 
said the economics minister, "will enhance Mexican-German 
relations in the political and cultural field too."

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has said that the 
charges made by the former guerrillas are unfounded inasmuch as 
the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] is doing exemplary work. 
According to Cristiani, there is no room in the country for 
electoral fraud, which is why he is questioning the FMLN's 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] complaints of 
irregularities and delays in the electoral phases. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] Actually, there is an Onusal [UN 
Observers for El Salvador] contingent here that is already 
observing the electoral process, not just election day. It 
seems ridiculous to us that anyone should raise accusations of 
fraud at this time. It seems that they are already predicting 
the results. [end recording] 
  Representatives of the former guerrillas met with the UN 
secretary general to voice their discontent over the delay in 
delivering voter identification cards to the former areas of 
conflict, where the FMLN claims most of its supporters live. 
Cristiani has a very personal interpretation, which is similar 
to the interpretation of the party that took him to power. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] The TSE's work is open to the 
public, and there are UN observers. Could it be that they want 
to justify what they are already predicting will take place; 
that is, that they will not win the elections? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Lemus from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Oscar Santamaria has accused the 
political left of creating an atmosphere of instability to 
hinder the election chances of the progovernment party. 
  Presidency Minister Dr. Oscar Santamaria reported that 
protests by different groups are being sponsored by leftist 
parties to harm the government. Santamaria added that the 
leftist parties are seeking electoral benefits by promoting 
demonstrations and creating an atmosphere of instability prior 
to the next elections. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] [words indistinct] this time 
that we have learned leftist sectors are promoting actions to 
destabilize the country and capitalize on those actions in the 
20 March elections. We believe that this is not the right way 
of doing things at this time, because now more than ever the 
country requires stability and peace. 
  The people want to express themselves publicly by peacefully 
exercising their right to vote, as opposed to previous electoral 
processes which were marred by violence. We must not let 
ourselves be deceived by these demonstrations, which many times 
exceed the realm of social protest. Such social protests are 
valid all over the world, provided that public order and public 
security are maintained. [words indistinct] generate violence. 
We believe this is not a good example for our people. 
  All actions that are aimed at vindicating a group's rights 
can be made without resorting to violence. We believe that 
staging marches, public demonstrations, and protests for the 
sake of staging them -- without any justification -- should not 
be done at this time, because we are working through other 
actions and convictions to consolidate peace. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Santamaria stated he does not know anything 
about steps taken by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] at the United Nations, adding that the peace 
process is not [words indistinct]. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] [words indistinct] FMLN which 
are the product of their visit. It is doing this in a 
unilateral manner and as part of its relationship with the 
United Nations. I do not know the reasons behind the visit of 
FMLN representatives to the United Nations. 
  I stated that in the United Nations there is the belief that 
we must continue working in situ, namely in El Salvador, as part 
of the commitment each party has. The FMLN has always wondered 
about what will happen with the peace accords after this 
administration leaves office. This is apparently part of the 
FMLN's concern, and I understand this, as well as that the FMLN 
wants to discuss the elections with the UN secretary general. 
Nevertheless, we are in no way saying that the accords face a 
crisis. [end recording] 
  Santamaria gave the aforementioned statements after 
presiding 
over the graduation ceremony of 337 students of the National 
Public Security Academy who will join the National Civilian 
Police.

<F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Minister of the Presidency Oscar Alfredo Santamaria 
today denied that the government received any official document 
sent by the UN secretary general on nonfulfillment of the peace 
agreements. 
  During this past weekend, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] coordinator Shafik Handal reported that Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali told a delegation of former guerrillas who were 
visiting the United Nations that he had sent a letter to 
President Alfredo Cristiani in which he asked him to accelerate 
the application of some agreements, such as the deployment of 
the PNC [Civilian National Police], the former fighters' 
rejoining civilian life, and the transfer of land. 
  A UN spokesman recently notified an FMLN delegation that 
traveled to the United Nations that Butrus Butrus-Ghali had sent 
a letter to President Cristiani requesting that he make use of 
his power with the same interest so that some pending agreements 
related to the PNC and the transfer of land be implemented. 
However, the minister of the presidency denied this report. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] We have not received any 
notification from the UN secretary general. [end recording] 
  Santamaria explained that the government, the FMLN, and 
Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] are working on a new 
schedule with regard to the deployment of the PNC. The official 
added that nonetheless, the PNC issue is moving ahead well with 
regard to deployment. He also said that it is false that the 
government is not interested in fulfilling its commitments. 
  [Begin Santamaria recording] The United Nations has made no 
such statement. All I can say is that at the end of its 
transition period, this government is committed to having 
concluded and implemented all of its agreements. Naturally, 
some of them will continue, because some agreements are 
scheduled to be concluded after the transition period. [end 
recording] 
  Nonetheless, Dr. Santamaria admitted there are some delays 
in 
the programs to have the former fighters rejoining civilian life 
related to the transfer of land. According to him, this is due 
to the lack of financial support which the international 
community had promised to solve.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 22 
February. 
  The board of directors of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) 
decided yesterday to cut the required legal reserve by two 
points from 36 to 34 percent for commercial banks and from 17 to 
15 percent for savings and loans associations. The legal 
reserve has remained at 36 percent since September 1993, when it 
was cut from 42 percent. The 42-percent rate was set in July 
1993 as part of an economic measure to slow the rise of the 
lempira. In announcing the new legal reserve, BCH Vice 
President Daniel Figueroa indicated that the objective was to 
send a positive message to all productive sectors and thus 
create a suitable equilibrium between the banking system's 
active and passive interest rates. The BCH vice president also 
said that in the medium term banks will increase their 
short-term interest rates either by increasing their savings 
rates or by cutting loan rates. (San Pedro Sula LA PRENSA in

  [Text] The legalization of capital punishment as a penalty 
for kidnapping is basically a good thing, President De Leon 
Carpio has said in response to questions posed to him yesterday 
at a breakfast with industrial representatives of the Chamber of 
Industry of Guatemala [CIG]. 
  De Leon Carpio said: In line with the situation Guatemala is 
facing, I will not commute the death penalty if it is applied 
against kidnappers. The appeal for commuting the death sentence 
is unfair in this case. Kidnapping is one of the most abhorrent 
crimes and it must not go unpunished. I am ready to present a 
draft bill to Congress to reform the Penal Code and the law. 
  He added: We are preparing a draft bill that contributes to 
stopping the wave of kidnappings unleashed in Guatemala -- a 
bill that would prove to be a high risk element for those who 
commit this crime. 
  Meanwhile, Jose Gutierrez, president of the Chamber of 
Industry of Guatemala, stated that the security issue has become 
a major concern of all Guatemalans, adding that slayings, 
kidnappings, and assaults have grown to frightful levels. 
  "The destruction of the national infrastructure has surfaced 
once more; again we are living amid the chaos of insecurity and 
terrorism, which have harshly struck the Guatemalan family, the 
economy, and the contry's stability," the industrialist remarked. 
  In his speech, the president of the Republic said the role 
of 
his government is focused on laying the foundations for changing 
our country through appropriate measures that will permit 
national development. 
  De Leon Carpio stressed the need to share responsibilities, 
because the future of Guatemala is a duty of all citizens, 
government, businessmen, union members, cooperative members, and 
other sectors. The Great National Accord establishes the goal 
of achieving governability [gobernabilidad] without resorting to 
force. 
  President de Leon invited the Chamber of Industry to form a 
delegation to accompany him to Mexico. In Mexico, De Leon will 
conduct economic talks designed to benefit industry and the 
population in the wake of NAFTA's going into force in January. 
  Finally, the president explained that he will soon appoint a 
Guatemalan ammbassador to GATT, because this is of vital 
importance to the economic and productive development of the 
country. 
<H5>  Industrialists Undertake Path of National Rescue </H5>
  Juan Jose Gutierrez affirmed: We industrialists view 
President de Leon as a capable and honest man with the 
sufficient determination and moral capacity to change the course 
the country is following. We are confident the president is 
ready to make the necessary decisions and implement the 
necessary measures, no matter how difficult they may be. 
Guatemalan industry supports De Leon and is at his side to 
begin the long path of national rescue -- a task we deem to be 
the responsibility of all Guatemalans. 
  Gutierrez added: A country can achieve development through a 
process of industrialization. As Guatemalan businessmen, we 
clearly understand our role and commitment to Guatemala. Our 
sector is making long-term plans; it is carrying out large 
productive investments and capital investments. It generates a 
significant amount of jobs and has the most skilled workforce in 
the country. 
  The industrialist added: We sometimes have criticized the 
government and listed our demands, but we also have made 
specific proposals to resolve the nation's problems. A 
macroeconomic policy is necessary to promote productive 
investments instead of speculative investments, as well as to 
generate healthy and sustained growth. This will permit us to 
make up the great amount of the time we have lost. Our economy 
is tainted and distorted by corruption, the large fiscal 
deficit, high interest rates, the foreign debt, the 
concentration of foreign currency, and the subsidizing of the 
exchange rate. 
  According to Gutierrez, foreign trade requires special and 
responsible treatment. Trade policies have to be guided to go 
hand in hand with achieving the highest levels of productivity 
and competitiveness. As a country we must avoid being run over 
commercially due to nonreciprocity in our trade relations with 
other countries, Gutierrez stressed. 
  The country's infrastructure network is very weak, 
especially 
in areas such as energy, telecommunications, roads, ports, and 
airports. These problems compete directly against the country's 
efficiency, productivity, and development possibilities. The 
solution, as we have said before, is to do away with the 
monopoly of these services and allow free competition to make 
them efficient and profitable, he said. 
  The CIG president said that contraband has become one of the 
biggest stumbling blocks for national production. Without 
strong and effective actions against this crime, many industries 
and businesses have no hope of surviving in the market for much 
longer. 
  The labor outlook is dismal due to the high rates of 
unemployment and underemployment, which can only be fought by 
creating conditions that restore confidence to investors and 
encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, he concluded. 
<H5>  Effort and Commitment, Requirements To Be Guatemalan </H5>
  According to the Commitment 1994 video exhibited during the 
meeting between the president and the industrialists, "today 
more than ever, everyone's efforts and commitments are 
necessary, because if we are going to call ourselves 
Guatemalans, we must justify this." The documentary highlights 
the importance of improving Guatemalans' quality of life through 
an efficient program that directs public investments and 
expenditures toward the reduction of problems in education, 
health, and security. It suggests implementing a decentralized 
and regionalized education program and increasing construction 
of housing and latrines in poor villages in the area of health 
to define basic sanitation programs. 
  The economic aspect is dealt with by the documentary in a 
detailed fashion, stating that Guatemala needs sustained, 
accelerated economic growth, which is achieved through fiscal, 
monetary, exchange, and credit policies that encourage real and 
productive investments, generating health and sustained 
employment. 
  The documentary stresses the need to repay the public debt 
in 
advance in order to eliminate excess circulating currency. The 
authorities should privatize public utilities, improve tax 
collection, modernize customs services by decentralizing them in 
order to eliminate corruption, and rationalize public 
expenditures. 
  Regarding exchange policies, the documentary says that 
foreign exchange concentration should be eliminated and that the 
market should be allowed to set the exchange rates. A foreign 
trade and long term investment policy must be defined to allow 
successful entry into the international market. To this avail, 
specific funds should be assigned within the government's budget 
which will permit the negotiation of free trade treaties. 
  As for competitiveness, it is necessary to improve the 
infrastructure. At a Central American level we must promote a 
0-percent tariff on raw materials and capital assets. 
  In view of the demands to form trade blocs, it supports the 
idea of being competitive by guiding the technical training of 
workers toward greater productivity and efficiency, which means 
reorganization of the Intecap [Technical Institute for Training 
and Productivity] is necessary. It also states that breaking up 
the monopoly of services provided by the Guatemalan Social 
Security Institute is necessary. 
  According to the Commitment 1994 video exhibited during the 
meeting between the president and the industrialists, "today 
more than ever, everyone's efforts and commitments are

services for employees.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Belizean troops 
have raided Guatemalan territory, demanding peasants from this 
country abandon their lands in the northern border areas, local 
Guatemalan authorities charged today. 
  "The soldiers gave us a 15-day deadline to fall back; or 
otherwise suffer the consequences," said Carlos Ovando, mayor of 
the Guatemalan hamlet of Los Dolores in northern Peten 
Department. The official told the Guatemalan Congress that 
Belizean soldiers threatened to kill the peasants in the area if 
they remain in the border region. Ovando asked for the 
Guatemalan Government's intervention to exercise greater control 
along the border in light of what he labeled a Belizean invasion. 
  Last year in October, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry 
confirmed that Belizean soldiers had raided Guatemalan territory 
on several occasions; however, the Belizean Government ruled out 
an "erosion" of diplomatic relations. On 16 February, residents 
of the De Melchor de Mencos municipality in Peten, approximately 
10 km north of here, charged that soldiers from the neighboring 
nation had entered Guatemalan territory, destroying maiz and 
rice fields. 
  Guatemala maintains -- since the time Belize was a British 
colony -- a demand on this territory that gained its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1971.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemala's economic developments monitored through 
22 February 1994. 
  The Central Bank has reported that Guatemala's 27.49 percent 
interest rate is the highest in Central America. In addition, 
the interest rate on certificates of deposit increased from 
18.34 to 18.36 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1835 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  In January, $298 million were purchased and entered the 
Guatemalan banking system. This figure represents more than $10 
million above the sales figure. The sources of U.S. dollars 
were exports, tourism and travel, insurance, transfers, private 
capital donations, and public sector loans. (Mexico City NOTIMEX 
in Spanish 0208 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  After talking with businessmen, President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio has announced plans for the construction of a privately 
owned seaport, which would compete with the state-owned port 
system. De Leon Carpio, however, declined to mention the port's 
location and the name of the enterprise that will build and 
manage it. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 17 Feb 94) 
  According to the Bank of Guatemala, which cites a report 
released by the Energy and Mines Ministry, the country's oil 
production increased to 2.346 million barrels, 415,000 more 
barrels than in the same period of 1992. Exports reached 2.093 
million barrels, which represents an increase of 25.8 percent.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sergio Caramana, </F>
representative of the International Commission of Support and 
Verification-OAS, by station announcer in Managua on 21 
February; from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We have Dr. Sergio Caramana on the line 
from the CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and 
Verification-OAS] office. Doctor, we understand the meeting 
scheduled for Monday has been postponed. What can you tell us 
about this? 
  [Caramana] Greetings to listeners of Radio Corporacion. Yes, 
what happened was we have been working to smooth out some small 
problems and obstacles to holding this meeting since last 
Thursday. That is why this meeting could not be held today. But 
I want to inform you and the audience of Radio Corporacion that 
the determination of the members of the Northern Front, the 
Army, and government remains unchanged. They are determined to 
peacefully resolve this issue through negotiations. The meeting 
is scheduled for the middle of this week in the Quilali area. 
  [Announcer] Doctor, will you present specific points at this 
meeting? 
  [Caramana] Basically the government and its institutions 
will 
present a series of broad proposals and programs to resolve or 
address the causes that result in the uprising of different 
groups and sectors of Nicaraguan society. I believe there is a 
clear awareness to go to the root of the problem this time so as 
to provide an in-depth and complete solution. We hope all 
sectors involved are seriously committed to this line of thought. 
  This is not a matter of having a particular group surrender 
its weapons as a daily thing in Nicaragua, but basically 
tackling the in-depth problems. Among the basic demands is the 
issue of security, which is very important and fundamental to 
all this, and the issue of credits, production, social, health, 
education, and emergency fund projects, which are needed in 
these forgotten areas. 
  [Announcer] Doctor, we understand the meeting was postponed 
due to the very military presence that will be used to settle 
this situation. 
  [Caramana] Listen, that is not the reason why the meeting 
was 
postponed. In reality, we are coordinating the work and planning 
of this meeting, which is very important, with government 
authorities, military authorities, and members of the 3-80 
Northern Front. I want to clearly state that all the parties are 
demonstrating goodwill to get to that meeting and agree to the 
requests made by the 3-80 Northern Front. 
  [Announcer] Doctor, El Chacal's [Jose Angel Talavera] group 
seems to be ready to disarm itself. What is the situation of 
other groups, such as those led by Nortiel and El Charrito? 
  [Caramana] Well, we have not received requests from those 
groups for a possible demobilization. Consequently, I cannot 
tell you what those two groups' intentions are. It has been 
said, however, that some of the rearmed groups you just 
mentioned may be included in this negotiation. 
  I believe the possibility of peacefully resolving, not 
violently or militarily, the conflict in the northern region 
will be an important sign for all sectors in the mountains, 
especially the areas where the post-war population is residing. 
I think we must seriously work to resolve this problem in an 
honorable manner for all the parties involved, a solution with 
real social justice. 
  [Announcer] Can you say whether there have been clashes in 
the north the last few days? 
  [Caramana] No, thank God the truce has been respected. The 
cease-fire has been respected. Thank God there has been no 
incident or loss of human life to regret. I believe the truce 
and cease-fire are, in reality, the first step of the 
negotiations. They have an extraordinary value in the sense that 
no more Nicaraguans are dying. No Nicaraguans from the Army, 
rearmed groups, or civilian population -- many times people 
suffer from cross-fire confrontations in these situations -- are 
dying. 
  [Announcer] Doctor, what can you tell us about the Cobra-93 
clandestine group? 
  [Caramana] Well, all I know about this group I get from the 
news reports and some reports from indirect sources. These 
groups and some other recompa groups are moving about the 
country. I think it is appropriate to call the authorities' 
attention to closely monitor these groups so they do not become 
an obstacle to the peace process under way in Segovia. I hope no 
incident occurs in this regard. 
  [Announcer] Doctor, would you like to say anything else to 
the listeners of "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast? 
  [Caramana] I would like to add that we are facing a big 
challenge. I am optimistic about it. But my optimism is moderate 
in the sense that the resolution of this process does not depend 
on CIAV-OAS, it depends on the Nicaraguan players of the 
conflict, namely the government, Army, and members of the 3-80 
Northern Front. 
  I believe we have the basic raw material to begin these 
talks, which is the goodwill of these sectors to settle the 
conflict peacefully. We reject a violent solution of this 
dispute. In this regard, we are motivated to cooperate in a 
vigorous and complete manner in this process. 
  [Announcer] I thank you very much, Dr. Sergio Caramana.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 22 
February. 
  The Central Bank of Nicaragua announced that annual 
accumulated inflation reached 10.58 percent during the last 12 
months and that the cordoba had fallen 6.55 percent with respect 
to the U.S. dollar. According to the Central Bank, the 
aforementioned levels are in accordance with monetary adjustment 
policies applied by Violeta Chamorro's administration to control 
inflation, which reached 55,000 percent in 1990, the highest in 
the world. In January 1993, Nicaragua's economic authority 
decided to implement a 20.34-percent "macrodevaluation" of the 
cordoba and establish a 1 percent monthly fluctuation mechanism. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2105 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  Oscar Aleman, director of the Foreign Trade department of 
the 
Economic and Development Ministry (MEDE), announced that 
Nicaragua had decided to stop granting licenses for the 
importation of Costa Rican dairy, canned, and grain products 
until that country decides to lift its import restrictions on 
similar items from Nicaragua. Aleman said the decision does not 
constitute a trade war but is a "tit for tat" situation because 
while Nicaragua allowed the unrestricted entry of Costa Rican 
goods, that country did the opposite. The foreign trade 
director added that before making the decision, the economy 
minister had contacted his Costa Rican counterpart and requested 
unrestricted passage for Nicaraguan goods. The Costa Rican 
minister explained that the call for restrictions was made by 
the private sector for reasons of competition. (Managua

<F P=106> [Article by James Aparicio] </F>
  [Text] An investigation conducted by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA 
disclosed that General Ruben Dario Paredes and Ruben Dario 
Carles, presidential candidate and former comptroller, have made 
a pact to include former Panama Defense Forces [FDP] officers in 
his movement and discredit opposition candidate Perez Balladares. 
  Paredes, the man who closed the media and imposed censorship 
on 31 July 1982 with his famous phrase "as of now," negotiated 
with Carles for an advisory position on public security matters 
as well as for the creation of a support group. 
  Paredes has called at least three meetings with former 
officers, among them Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Delgado, Lt. Col. 
Carlos Arosemena King, Lt. Col. Juan Antonio Guizado, Major 
Severino Mejia, and Arrigo Guardia, one of the main promoters of 
Carles' candidacy. 
  Mitchel Doens, first assistant secretary of the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that his 
group knows about these meetings and asserted that there is a 
"fallacy campaign" promoted by Paredes and Carles' electoral 
team. 
  According to Doens, "the main goal (of the campaign) is to 
spread the rumor that the PRD wants to reestablish the army and 
that it has made a secret pact with former FDP officers." 
  "Carles' and Paredes' goal is to keep the PRD from attaining 
power," Doens said. 
  When Perez Balladares launched his presidential campaign he 
said that he would not make changes to the current Public Force, 
that he would make the Public Force more professional, and that 
under no circumstances would he incorporate the former FDP 
officers into that force. 
  Last week Doens sent a letter to Stanley Muschett, president 
of the Peace and Justice Commission, warning him that a campaign 
was being prepared and that it "is based on false documents, 
slanderous statements, and even offenses against the candidacy 
of Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares." 
  According to Doens, they are planning to make public an 
alleged pact "between Dr. Perez Balladares and officers of the 
defunct FDP to reestablish militarism in Panama." 
  "Everyone knows our candidate's position. He has stated 
quite clearly that he will respect the current structures of the 
Public Force and will not reinstate any former officer who was 
not already an active member of the force on 1 January 1994," 
Doens recalled. 
  Doens reminded Muschett that the PRD will continue to 
respect 
the Santa Maria La Antigua Political Parties Pact that was also 
signed by the coalition that supports Carles. 
  "Our goal (the PRD's) is to follow that ethical line, giving 
priority to the debate of the problems of the Panamanian people 
and suggestions for the solution of these problems," Doens said, 
adding that the Peace and Justice Commission must not allow 
itself to be surprised "by those who are bent on violating the 
agreements they promised to respect."

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter from Ruben Dario Carles, presidential </F>
candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, to LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA] 
  [Text] Dear Sir: 
  In today's, 17 February, edition of LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA 
and 
with a boldfaced headline, you published as true rumors claiming 
that there is a conspiracy "to promote a fallacy campaign 
against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]" and that I am 
involved. 
  All these rumors seem to be supported by a meeting I had a 
couple of months ago with former General Ruben Dario Paredes at 
his request. Gen. Paredes was interested in talking to me about 
his ideas on national security regarding the future protection 
of the Panama Canal. It goes without saying that I far from 
share the ideas of the aforementioned officer on national 
security and that I have never been associated with or served 
under him at any time in my life. That, however, did not keep 
me from listening to what he had to say. 
  The PRD was organized as a party under the sponsorship, 
protection, and support of the military dictatorship to serve as 
its political arm. The PRD fulfilled this role until 20 
December 1989. During the dictatorship, the leaders of the PRD 
rose to their positions within the party cadres after proving 
themselves unconditional servants of their military chiefs. Now 
that the dictatorship they served so submissively has been 
overthrown, they are trying to discredit me by linking me in 
some way to their former masters with whom they were closely 
involved. 
  If the former officers of the defunct Defense Forces wanted 
to discredit the members of the PRD who are so fearful of them 
today because of what the former officers know about them, they 
would not need me. All the former officers have to do is go 
public with all they know about the activities of their 
unconditional servants of the past, when they very 
enthusiastically formed part of the dictatorship which they bent 
over backwards to serve. The officers who were members of the 
military leadership know very well and have firsthand 
information about the stories and adventures of those who served 
as the civilian instruments of the regime. The best thing that 
could happen would be for the Panamanian people to find out what 
really went on. To do this, the former officers do not need my 
advice or recommendations. 
  I would appreciate your publishing this letter with the same 
emphasis given the "news" item to which I am referring. 
  Sincerely yours, 
  Ruben Carles, presidential candidate

  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Delgado Diamante yesterday 
said Torrijist military men "have made no pact" with the 
opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), nor have they 
met with Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles. 
  In statements to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Delgado admitted 
that 
a group of former officers of the defunct Panama Defense Forces 
(FDP) met with retired General Ruben Dario Paredes to analyze 
"the country's problems, among them the public security 
problem." Delgado insisted that "none of the meetings (with Gen. 
Paredes) has been in favor of Carles or against Ernesto Perez 
Balladares." 
  However, several sources have informed LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA 
that Paredes tried to promote an association of former military 
men who would support Carles, the presidential candidate for the 
Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), the Civic 
Renewal Party (PRC), and the National Renewal Movement (Morena). 
  Approximately 25 former officers attended the meetings with 
Gen. Paredes, among them Daniel Delgado Diamante, Carlos 
Arosemena King, Virgilio Mirones, Major Severino Mejia, and Maj. 
Juan Antonio Guizado. 
  Yesterday on Radio Ancon, Gen. Paredes denied reports 
published in the 17 February edition of LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. 
However, he did admit that he met with Carles for 45 minutes. 
According to Paredes, it was "a regrettable lie published by LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA." 
  Delgado said the former officers are worried about the 
increase in crimes, kidnappings, drug trafficking, vandalism, 
and the failure of the current Public Force, but warned that 
they, the officers, are conceptually "Torrijists." "We continue 
to be Torrijists because we believe the ideas promoted by 
Torrijos are the appropriate answer to the country's problems," 
Delgado stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by James Aparicio] </F>
  [Text] Retired General Ruben Dario Paredes has confirmed to 
LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that he has met with presidential 
candidate Ruben Carles, at the request of Dr. Arrigo Guardia 
[National Integration Movement national coordinator], to discuss 
issues related to security, the future of the police corps, the 
penitentiary system, and intelligence organizations. He has 
also expressed regret over the "electoral mediocrity" of the 
former comptroller general and his main advisers. 
  In a letter sent to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Paredes has 
admitted he met with Carles and Guardia on 15 January for what 
he called "a working meeting." 
  In a telephone conversation, Paredes has denied he is 
involved in a plot against the opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), "because nobody catches me making a 
slander campaign against anybody." Paredes added: "I would not 
lose my time doing this." 
  In a letter sent to the Justice and Peace Commission last 
week, Mitchel Doens, PRD first assistant secretary, charged 
Carles' team was preparing a slander campaign by reporting the 
opposition PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares had a pact 
with former military personnel to reinstate the Defense Forces. 
Perez Balladares announced there will be no Army in Panama, and 
Carles denied the alleged slander campaign against the PRD. 
  Paredes has expressed regret, however, that Carles had 
denied 
the alleged "working meeting" as if "one stinks." He added: 
"When the news broke out and caused its effects, Professor 
Carles and two of his closest advisers were struck with 
political panic and instead of rising up to the situation and 
admitting we did discuss public security issues, which are a 
real problem, they descended down to the levels of electoral 
mediocrity." 
  Why were Carles and his advisers so afraid of our meeting 
being made known, and what compelled them to take such an 
irregular attitude? Paredes asked himself. He has expressed 
regret that "a candidate with Professor Carles' potential of 
success has made such a mistake, which will surely be punished 
at the ballot tables." 
  According to Paredes, "this mistake (Carles') will 
contribute 
in defining the candidates' positions and will benefit the 
country and voters, because it reduces the possibility of making 
a wrong choice."

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 15 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem stated that the government will start to pay the "social 
debt" by establishing the Social Development Secretariat. He 
pointed out that this new secretariat will have enough financial 
resources at its disposal to implement aid programs for the 
community. 
  Menem made these remarks on 14 February when installing Luis 
Prol [former under secretary general of the presidency] in 
office as the new social development secretary. Menem noted 
that Prol "does not face an easy challenge," but he asserted 
that he "will not be short of money." [passage omitted] 
  It was unofficially reported that $300 million will be 
appropriated initially for the new secretariat and "cash in 
hand" from the other ministries will subsequently be earmarked 
to reach a total of $900 million. The secretariat will answer 
directly to the president. 
  Menem ordered that funds from ministries' budget allotments 
classified as "surplus" be transferred to the new secretariat, 
which will then earmark them for social programs to be 
implemented in the forthcoming months. 
  Prol reportedly will be in charge of managing the funds 
collected from the National Lottery -- some $100 million, which 
he will be able to use at his discretion. 
  The new secretariat will be in charge of managing social 
programs undertaken by the government and "monitoring" their 
progress. 
  Prol will take on the administration of some 60 social plans 
and programs the federal government had entrusted to five 
ministries, like intensive training programs (PIT) and the 
upgrading of squalid rural schools, among others. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
this morning stated that any new trial of the military officers 
who ruled Argentina between 1976 and 1983 "would be double 
jeopardy" and noted that the presence in Argentina of Italian 
judges to investigate alleged cases of torture of Italian 
citizens "is pointless." 
  Menem said: "As everyone here knows, we have an amnesty law, 
a due obedience law, court sentences, and a pardon decree" and 
thus this is "a closed matter." 
  Menem made these remarks shortly before leaving for Ecuador 
where he will be received by President Sixto Duran-Ballen, with 
whom he will sign several bilateral integration agreements. 
  In an unscheduled news conference at the military sector of 
the Aeroparque metropolitan airport, Menem said he finds it 
strange for "Italy to try to meddle in these affairs" now that 
"several years have elapsed since the time of repression in our 
country." 
  "Those cases to which the double jeopardy principle is 
applicable cannot be reopened," Menem said. 
  He said that the subject "has been artificially 
resurrected," 
adding that the presence of Italian judges in Argentina "is 
pointless at this time." 
  Asked by reporters if the Italian judges could request the 
extradition of former de facto President Jorge Rafael Videla, 
Menem said: "No, they have no right to do that because he has 
been sentenced and pardoned." 
  Menem reiterated that the government has great interest in 
the approval of the labor reform bill being discussed in 
Congress. 
  At 0702 this morning Menem left for Ecuador where he will 
sign several bilateral integration agreements and, on 21 
February he will go to Colombia to meet with President Cesar 
Gaviria.

  [Text] Federal Court Judge Gustavo Literas on 16 February 
reversed his decision to hear the testimony of relatives of 
Italian citizens who were kidnapped, tortured, and made to 
disappear during the last military dictatorship. At the request 
of attorney Julio Castro, he disqualified himself to continue 
hearing the case and transferred the dossier to the Federal 
Court, which now must appoint a new judge. 
  Literas' unexpected change of mind put an end to the hopes 
of 
the Italian court officials who had arrived in Buenos Aires to 
investigate the case of the missing people and hear the 
questioning to be conducted by the Argentine federal courts. 
This was the mission of Rome's Judge Antonio Capiello and 
attorney Antonio Marini, who arrived in Argentina on 14 February 
after the Italian courts had sent the Argentine ones a rogatory 
letter, to which Judge Literas -- head of Federal Court No. 10 
-- had initially agreed. 
  On 16 February, a few minutes before the court hearing was 
to 
begin and the first witnesses summoned by the court had arrived 
(among them Peronist leader Dante Gullo), the judge told the 
Italian officials that the hearing had been suspended. 
  The judge's unexpected decision is threatening to become an 
international scandal. Rumors spread on 16 February stated that 
the Italian court officials were planning to hold a news 
conference on 17 February because they had been told that the 
court's unexpected decision was more the result of political 
pressure on Judge Literas' court than of difficulties arising 
during the lawsuit. 
  Meanwhile, the first protests against the Argentine court 
decision began in Rome. Sandro Sessa, head of the League for the 
Rights of Peoples, said that in Italy the lawsuit against the 
accused military "will not stop just because it had been 
suspended in Buenos Aires." 
  On 14 February, Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief 
of the Joint Staff, sent Defense Minister Oscar Camilion a 
report conveying to the government the Argentine Armed Forces' 
"uneasiness and concern" over the presence of Italian court 
officials in Argentine courts.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Feb (NA) -- Minutes before 
announcing his decision to not participate in his party's 
internal elections scheduled for 20 February, Senator Fernando 
De la Rua said: "We cannot participate in the internal UCR 
[Radical Civic Union] elections because the National Board has 
issued a proscriptive resolution impeding the elections, and 
this is a dishonor to the entire party." 
  De la Rua, who made the announcement during a brief news 
conference at the UCR Buenos Aires precinct, said the crisis 
affecting the UCR causes him "great bitterness." He also 
harshly criticized the UCR National Board because "it proscribed 
the Movement for Participation and does not understand that 
party unity is achieved through differences of opinions." 
  De la Rua explained that he decided to withdraw the Movement 
for Participation list from the party elections "because of the 
proscription issued by the UCR National Board." He added that 
to continue with the campaign for the Constituent Assembly 
elections scheduled for 10 April "would be a contradiction" 
because the party faction he heads "never approved the Olivos 
Pact." 
  De la Rua added: "The UCR National Board resolution is an 
official party statement and its enforcement is compulsory. It 
compels us to proscribe ourselves because we have always 
rejected the basis of the Olivos Pact." 
  He referred to the [Raul] Alfonsin faction as "those who 
left 
us out of the referendum issue" and reasserted that "we had more 
than 30,000 signatures supporting the holding of the referendum." 
  Minutes after making this statement to the press, De la Rua 
went to the first floor of the building where the UCR Buenos 
Aires precinct headquarters are located to address about 200 
members of the party faction he leads. 
  Escorted by UCR leaders Felipe Figuerero and Roberto 
Clienti, 
Fernando De la Rua, leader of the Movement for Participation, 
asserted that his decision to not include his name on the list 
of candidates "is based on ethical reasons." He again 
criticized the resolution that compels party candidates to 
adhere to the Olivos Pact because "it is a manipulation of the 
party grass roots" 
  Clearly alluding to the Alfonsin-led faction, he said: "They 
have locked up the ballot boxes but we will not surrender 
because the UCR will overcome this crisis." 
  De la Rua's brief speech was followed by his supporters' 
chants of: "We are proscribed for not signing the pact but we 
are a majority in the capital." 
  Felipe Figuerero, president of the UCR Buenos Aires 
precinct, 
spoke after De la Rua. After explaining that this was "the most 
painful" day in his party life, Figuerero formally proclaimed 
the Movement for Commitment headed by Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus 
Rodriguez as the single UCR list in the capital. 
  The document approved by the majority of the Electoral Board 
explains that the Movement for Participation list was not 
included because of "the regrettable situation raised by the 
official and compulsory enforcement of the UCR National Board 
resolution." 
  The resolution, signed by the majority of De la Rua's 
followers, adds that "The Movement for Commitment is the only 
one that has met all the requirements to be officially 
proclaimed."

<F P=106> [Interview with former President Raul Alfonsin by Analia </F>
Argento; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The former president maintains that Senator Fernando 
de la Rua is on the road to "political suicide," and that he 
will not be able to run "even for mayor." For the time being, in 
his view, only Angeloz is in a position to head the ticket in 
1995. He considers Angeloz a "progressive" who contradicts 
himself. The leader of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), in an 
exclusive interview with LA PRENSA, says he believes the 
inflation index announced by the Economy Ministry. He 
acknowledged that memories of hyperinflation weigh heavily on 
the Radicals, and that "some people believe we want Menem to be 
reelected," but "we will vote for our own candidate." 
  Perhaps because throughout their history, the Radicals have 
suffered the consequences of personality cults and 
antipersonality cults, former President Raul Alfonsin does not 
mention by name the targets of his harshest criticism. When he 
met with LA PRENSA, the mere mention of Senator Fernando de la 
Rua was enough to get him riled. 
  [Argento] How concerned are you about De la Rua's decision 
not to support the constitutional reform? 
  [Alfonsin] I think it is a truly serious problem for the 
Radicals. This amounts to an incredible insubordination. I know 
of no precedent for anything like this. The delegates from the 
federal capital went to the convention in Santa Rosa, they 
discussed their positions, they voted, and they lost. Now they 
are refusing to accept the resolution that was passed there. 
This is a very divisive attitude that has no place in any 
political organization. If everyone in the provinces decided to 
do the same thing, the Radical Civic Union would be gone within 
a year. So it makes no sense to be doing this; it is the product 
of an attitude that is absolutely unacceptable in any 
people-oriented organization. What we are witnessing is the 
political suicide of Fernando de la Rua, no doubt about it. 
  [Argento] Why suicide? 
  [Alfonsin] Well, because he will have to run in an election, 
win an election in which no one knows what will happen, and then 
face an election in the worst possible position, worse even than 
the way he went into the last election, thanks to his ineptitude. 
  [Argento] De la Rua says that the party members in the 
capital oppose reelection. 
  [Alfonsin] What has that got to do with anything? We will 
see 
which slate wins the internal elections. The party has its 
structure, its organization; the members in the capital elected 
delegates, who went to the National Convention, and the other 
provinces had a different opinion that prevailed. That is 
democracy; anything else is a parody of democracy. 
  [Argento] Might there be sanctions? 
  [Alfonsin] I will let the episode run its course, and then 
we 
will see. But no one here is going to play at breaking up what 
the capital really wants. 
  [Argento] How can it be that you were able to engage in 
dialogue with President Carlos Menem, but you cannot reach an 
agreement with one of your fellow party members? 
  [Alfonsin] And...if dialogue is possible with those who are 
different, surely it is much more difficult because we are more 
alike (maybe). Those of us who abide by the same philosophy must 
be much more careful with each other. I am willing to talk; I 
will not refuse to talk to anyone. I am the chairman of the 
national committee and I am willing to talk, but I am also ready 
to enforce the resolutions passed by the party. 
  [Argento] Why do you think De la Rua adopted this attitude? 
  [Alfonsin] You would have to ask him that question. This is 
an unprecedented situation in the UCR. In 1957, the party split 
in two because a certain resolution passed by the National 
Convention was not accepted. But within the party, nothing like 
this has ever been seen. 
  [Argento] Is there a chance of a schism? 
  [Alfonsin] No, I hope that, at least on this, he does not 
continue forward. He should see how people from all the 
provinces come up to me and say, "What is happening, how is it 
possible for this man to conspire against the possibilities for 
a Radical victory?" Not only in the capital, but in the country, 
because the statements he has made in the dailies of Buenos 
Aires, or on the radio or on television, are seen in all 
provinces of Argentina. 
  [Argento] When you ran for the presidency of the party, you 
said you were going to make the UCR's discourse more uniform. 
You seem to be having a tough time doing that. 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, I think it will be tough, but give me time. 
  [Argento] What makes you trust the ruling party now, when a 
year ago you were saying that this government "is tyrannical and 
is putting the squeeze on the governors"? 
  [Alfonsin] We have turned to the reform precisely because it 
is a means of preventing any tyrannical inclination or 
authoritarian streak, of attenuating the powers of the 
president, achieving greater legal security, making republican 
controls more effective so as to prevent corruption, achieving 
more federalism, and all that. We trust them because the law is 
structured in such a way that everything we want is voted on at 
the same time as the issue of reelection because some people 
think we want reelection. We do not want it; we will vote 
against the president. We will have our own candidate. 
  [Argento] Are you making that clarification because of the 
insistent rumors about a joint ticket between the Justicialist 
Party (PJ) and the UCR? 
  [Alfonsin] No, because we conducted a survey in which we 
came 
out better than we expected in voting intentions in Greater 
Buenos Aires, but it is very bad that people do not understand 
this. And it is only natural, because this does not take 
people's needs into account. The primary obligation of 
politicians is to explain what this reform is all about. Some 
people were saying they thought we were supporting the president 
on reelection. 
  [Argento] What will you do to change that impression? 
  [Alfonsin] In general, people in Greater Buenos Aires (who 
may not be well informed because they have other concerns) 
thought differently. So we need to clarify the situation. The 
first campaign we need to launch is to explain what it is all 
about. 
  [Argento] Speaking of things you have in common with the 
government, there is also talk that Cesar Jaroslavsky could be 
Menem's cabinet chief. 
  [Alfonsin] No, that is a lie. We will not allow him to. 
  [Argento] Since the pact, some people have been thinking: 
What is the difference between Menem and Alfonsin? 
  [Alfonsin] No, that is a captious question. I defy you to 
find a political party that has been as firm in its statements 
of opposition as we have been since the pact was signed. 
  [Argento] As the first candidate for the constituent 
assembly, what will you do to defeat Governor Eduardo Duhalde? 
  [Alfonsin] We will defeat him because people may criticize 
us 
for the economy, for example. Stability is not at issue here. 
They also criticize us for other things, but when people want to 
safeguard their freedom, their dignity, and their national 
institutions, they think of the Radicals. I think they also feel 
that I did a good job in consolidating democracy, regardless of 
other errors and misjudgments. Just as we consolidated democracy 
then, now what we want to do is draft a better constitution. 
  [Argento] Is there any chance of reaching an agreement with 
the government on other issues, such as labor reform? 
  [Alfonsin] They would have to change a lot of things, 
because 
the way it is now, it is unconstitutional, in my opinion. 
<H5>  Hyperinflation </H5>
  [Argento] Your internal adversaries attributed the 3 October 
defeat to the "specter of hyperinflation" in your government. 
  [Alfonsin] That may be, of course. The business of 
hyperinflation was very harmful. But the economic problem is not 
at issue here. 
  [Argento] And in 1995? 
  [Alfonsin] Since I will not be a candidate in 1995, there 
will be no problem. 
  [Argento] But what if your party loses again? They could 
blame you again. 
  [Alfonsin] Let them keep on saying it, even if I have 
changed, they will remember, even if I die, they will remember 
it just the same. 
  [Argento] The inflation rate in January was just 0.1 
percent. 
What do you think? 
  [Alfonsin] I think it is the result of a great depression in 
demand, and that is not consistent. Of course, we favor 
stability; it can be no other way. But if you depress demand, 
there can be no inflation. And with real wages falling and 
unemployment rising, demand is obviously depressed. 
  [Argento] Do you believe the figures released by the 
Ministry 
of Economy? 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, in general I do. With the proviso, though, 
that there are figures for the more affluent and figures for the 
less affluent, and the one for the less affluent is always a 
point or so higher. 
  [Argento] Why do you usually aim your criticism at Cavallo 
and not Menem, if the minister says that the economic plan is 
the president's? 
  [Alfonsin] My criticism has never been personal, never in my 
life. I got angry with you once because you portrayed me as 
fighting with the president and you criticized me for that. Now 
people criticize me for not criticizing him. I have always 
questioned government policies, and the ones I disagree with the 
most are the social policies they advocate, and the idea of 
making the most disadvantaged sectors bear the brunt of the 
crisis. And fundamentally, the liquidation of all the regional 
economies, which I had always warned about. 
  [Argento] What will be the outcome of that situation? 
  [Alfonsin] I think serious measures have to be taken. We are 
going to hold a seminar to which we will invite the most diverse 
business and labor sectors, to study the issue. We will hold it 
in Viedma. 
  [Argento] Is that not a wink at Massaccesi? 
  [Alfonsin] No, no, it is a pleasure for us to go to the 
place 
that someday will be the capital of the Argentine nation. 
  [Argento] Are you persisting with that plan? It was very 
expensive. 
  [Alfonsin] Expensive? Nonsense, that is just one of those 
stories people tell. Houses need to be built everywhere, and you 
build houses where the people are. If people go from one place 
to another, they build schools and hospitals in the new place, 
just the same. 
  [Argento] Ministries and other public buildings would also 
have to be built. 
  [Alfonsin] And we paid for all those buildings and then some 
by selling the Japanese Embassy, $300 million at the exchange 
rate of the time. 
  [Argento] So if the Radicals were in power, you would 
continue that project? 
  [Alfonsin] I would, but since I am not going to be the 
candidate, I do not know what the new Radical president will do. 
<H5>  Presidential Timber </H5>
  [Argento] The next presidential candidate will have to have 
your support. To whom will you give your blessing? 
  [Alfonsin] Not mine, he will need that of the entire party. 
Whoever is the Radical candidate must enjoy the support of the 
party, but after the internal elections, I hope no province will 
get the idea of holding a plebiscite to decide whether or not 
they support him (he laughs)! 
  [Argento] Who will be the UCR's next presidential candidate? 
  [Alfonsin] I do not know. At present, I get the impression 
that Eduardo Angeloz is in the best position. But that is all, 
the best position. I do not know. 
  [Argento] Angeloz considers himself one of the most 
progressive leaders of the party, citing the health plan that he 
is implementing in Cordoba. Do you agree? 
  [Alfonsin] I think he is governing Cordoba in a progressive 
way, although sometimes I may disagree with some of his 
statements; they are not consistent with his progressive 
government. But after all, that is his business. 
  [Argento] What about De la Rua? 
  [Alfonsin] De la Rua is committing political suicide. He 
will 
not even be able to run for mayor of Buenos Aires. De la Rua has 
destroyed himself with these positions. 
  [Argento] When will you retire from politics? 
  [Alfonsin] We shall see. I have been told that I cannot say 
when. 
<H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>
<H5>  "War" of Signatures Launched </H5>
  At this point, no one will venture to guess the final 
outcome 
of the crisis in the Radical Party in the capital, where the De 
la Rua and Alfonsin camps have grown further apart. While some 
people (just a few) advocated a compromise, the election 
campaign was practically launched yesterday. 
  Two days after the antireform camp of Fernando de la Rua was 
thwarted in its attempt to call a referendum, De la Rua and 
Alfonsin followers went out yesterday to walk the precincts and 
collect signatures to support their respective positions. 
  Thus, De la Rua walked the streets of Flores while his 
followers urged people to sign up to support the referendum on 
the reform. Ballot boxes were set up at tables located on the 
busiest corners so that citizens could express their opinions on 
the reform that was agreed to. 
  At the same time, the Alfonsin supporters of the Ateneo del 
Centenario, headed by Jesus Rodriguez, hit the pavement to begin 
collecting signatures to call for a referendum to determine the 
membership's opinion of the agreement forged by the De la Rua 
camp and the Buenos Aires PJ to allow former Senator Juan Trilla 
to chair the Deliberative Council, in response to their 
adversaries' initiative. 
  The charter of the UCR in the federal capital states that a 
referendum may be held if two-thirds of the total number of 
delegates or of the Metropolitan Convention vote in favor of it, 
or if 10 percent of the party members in the district sign 
petitions calling for one. At present, that means that about 
22,000 signatures must be gathered. 
  The strategy of the De la Rua supporters, who are in the 
majority in Buenos Aires, is to place a question about support 
for the reform on the ballot to elect delegates to the 
constituent assembly on 20 February. If more than 10 percent of 
the votes cast oppose the reform, the results will be binding, 
and the national convention's decision to support the agreement 
will be overturned. 
  De la Rua contended that "we are getting off to a good start 
in this campaign, because we see that people are asking for our 
help to make the UCR a true opposition party. They want to have 
a chance to express their opinions on the matter." The Buenos 
Aires senator demanded that the head of the party, Raul 
Alfonsin, "respect the opinion of the members of the Radical 
Civic Union in the federal capital, whom we want to represent." 
<H5>  Corrientes </H5>
  Meanwhile, in Corrientes, the Radical Integration Line, 
headed by Deputy Nestor Lino Golpe, decided to run its own 
candidates in the internal elections to make up the list of 
delegates to the constituent assembly. They stated that they 
would oppose the Olivos Pact, signed by President Carlos Menem 
and Radical leader Raul Alfonsin.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Feb (NA) -- On 18 February, Pablo 
Challu, executive director of the Argentine Industrial Center of 
Pharmaceutical Laboratories (CILFA), emphasized that if the law 
on pharmaceutical patents is approved it does not necessarily 
mean that Argentina will be able to join NAFTA, as U.S. 
Ambassador James Cheek has indicated. 
  Challu reiterated his warning that if Congress approves the 
patents law the United States wants, the prices of medicines 
"will go up 300 percent." 
  He explained that CILFA, the umbrella organization of 
Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, disagrees with Ambassador 
Cheek about this condition he is trying to impose because "first 
the terms on which Argentina will be able to join NAFTA must be 
established." 
  Challu was talking about Ambassador Cheek's statement to the 
effect that congressional approval of the law on pharmaceutical 
patents was an essential requirement for Argentina to join the 
trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  The pharmaceutical industry leader compared the ambassador's 
conditions to "a theater where people are asked to buy their 
ticket first and then it is decided whether they will be 
admitted and under what conditions." 
  Challu also explained that CILFA "supports the amendment of 
the law on patents," but the organization disagrees with the 
U.S. ambassador "on two or three items" of the law. 
  "Cheek wants exclusive rights, that is, a monopoly for 
companies that develop the products, and we believe it is better 
to pay them royalties while retaining the freedom to market and 
produce these products," Challu said. 
  He added that CILFA also disagrees with the length of time 
the law will be in effect. 
  Challu stressed that the disadvantages consumers of 
pharmaceutical products would face if the law on patents is 
approved, such as significant price increases, is "a vital 
issue." 
  He said: "Unlike the case in the United States, which has a 
monopolistic system, free competition allows many companies to 
produce the same goods. If there is only one company that 
produces certain goods, it will be able to time the marketing of 
its product to its own advantage." 
  One of CILFA's main arguments against the approval of the 
law 
on patents is the marked price increase that medicines will 
experience if the law goes into effect.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Feb (EFE) -- The Colombian 
Foreign Ministry today confirmed Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, a 
U.S. citizen of "Colombian origin" who the U.S. Government says 
is allegedly involved in espionage, worked for the Foreign 
Ministry between April 1982 and December 1983. 
  A Colombian Foreign Ministry press communique stated Mrs. 
Casas, "prior to her marriage, worked for the Foreign Ministry 
in the post of civilian attache 1 EX in the Colombian Embassy in 
Mexico." 
  It was reported in Washington today Casas worked as a "paid 
CIA agent in Mexico, where she worked as a cultural attache in a 
foreign embassy." The U.S. Justice Department announced on 21 
February the arrest of Casas and her husband, Aldrick Ames, a 
high-ranking CIA official, for allegedly spying for the 
dissolved Soviet Union and Russia. It is said they were "double 
agents," because they also "sold information" to the Russian KGB 
since 1985 for $1.5 million. 
  The Foreign Ministry added in the communique issued in Santa 
Fe de Bogota that "the Colombian Government is waiting for 
official confirmation about Mrs. Casas' alleged links to the 
U.S. CIA during the time when she worked as an official of the 
Colombian Embassy in Mexico."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian 
guerrillas have released six of the eight politicians kidnapped 
last weekend in central and southeastern Colombia, official 
sources reported today. 
  Colonel Edgardo Cuellar, police commander in Meta 
Department, 
said that among those released is Jorge Perez, the ruling 
Liberal Party's candidate for the Chamber of Representatives who 
was kidnapped last Sunday on a highway in the area. According 
to the source, the candidate is the bearer of a message from the 
guerrillas to the Colombian Government in which the guerrillas 
ratify their support for regional peace dialogues as an 
instrument for ending the armed conflict in this South American 
country. 
  Leovigildo Criollo, Perez' campaign coordinator, and Jose 
Lozano, mayor of Puerto Rico, Meta Department, were also 
released with Perez. "They treated us well. They only wanted 
to send a message of peace to the government," Lozano told local 
media. 
  Also released were city mayors David Delgado of Alejandria 
and Jaime Alonso Cano of Santo Domingo as well as John Jairo 
Duque, president of the Santo Domingo Council, all of whom had 
been kidnapped earlier by members of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and were released in San Rafael, 
Antioquia Department. 
  The Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board, which groups 
the two largest rebel groups in the country, began an offensive 
early this year to sabotage the legislative and presidential 
elections scheduled for March and May, respectively. As part of 
this offensive, tens of political party offices have been 
destroyed and five candidates to parliament and four mayors have 
been kidnapped in Antioquia, Tolima, Cundinamarca, Arauca, and 
Meta departments. 
  President Cesar Gaviria's administration announced that in 
view of the guerrilla offensive, the authorities have redoubled 
surveillance of the political groups and increased the corps of 
bodyguards for the various candidates. In addition, it warned 
that the wave of attacks will not intimidate the population, nor 
will it suspend the elections in any part of the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A poll paid for by the Bavaria Firm and conducted by 
the National Consulting Center among 7,550 people gives 
presidential candidate Ernesto Samper the advantage over 
candidate Andres Pastrana. The latest poll conducted by the 
National Consulting Center and reported today by Caracol shows 
that presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano has a five-point 
advantage over Andres Pastrana in the first president election 
and a seven-point advantage in the runoff election. 
  This poll, conducted between 3 and 8 February, days before 
the official announcement of the Pastrana candidacy, also 
includes other candidates. Some 38 percent of those polled said 
they would vote for Ernesto Samper, 33 percent said they would 
vote for Pastrana, 11 percent for Antonio Navarro Wolff, 4 
percent for Miguel Maza Marquez, 3 percent for Enrique Parejo, 3 
percent for Regina 11, 1 percent for Rodrigo Marin, and 1 
percent for Juan Diego Jaramillo. 
  In the runoff election, 50 percent of those polled said they 
would vote for Ernesto Samper and 43 percent favored Andres 
Pastrana. In the poll, interviewees were also asked about the 
Liberal Party [PL] consultation. Samper came in first with 59 
percent, while De La Calle came in second with 12 percent. 
  Amid this myriad of figures, candidates, polls, surveys, and 
elections, some people remain confused. To better inform the 
public, five elections will be held this year. The election to 
select congressional and presidential candidates for the PL will 
be held on 13 March. The first round of presidential elections 
will be held on 8 May; the runoff presidential election is 
scheduled for 29 May. The elections for governors, deputies, 
councilmembers, and local administrative boards will be held on 
30 October. This will be the end of a long political year.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Conservative Party national convention announced 
today from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada Convention Center in 
Santa Fe de Bogota that Andres Pastrana Arango had been selected 
the party's candidate for president. Representatives of the 
party's various factions, as well as former President Misael 
Pastrana, Senator Enrique Gomez, and former Minister Cornelio 
Reyes, announced the sectors' agreement. 
  Nearly 3,000 of the 4,000 accredited convention delegates 
cast their votes at the country's 34 voting sites. All except 
one voted for Pastrana and approved a proposal giving the 
candidate a free hand to designate his candidate for vice 
president. The National Salvation Movement released a 
communique, signed by Gomez, asking the Conservative Party to 
join a crusade to restore morality. Reyes delivered the opening 
speech: 
  [Begin Reyes recording] The candidate we will support -- and 
he has said this with commendable clarity -- will not be the 
champion of any particular faction, but an apostle of national 
reconciliation. [end recording] 
  Former President Belisario Bethancur delivered a message 
emphasizing the national nature of Pastrana's candidacy. Former 
Foreign Minister Rodrigo Lloreda also attended the convention. 
  [Begin Lloreda recording] The country has a great 
opportunity 
to overcome the darkness of corruption. [end recording] 
  Everything was ready very early at the convention, which 
this 
time resembled the great U.S. conventions. Old and experienced 
party members met to proclaim a single person as candidate. 
That is why there were no ballots, as the statutes stipulate, 
only a ballot to vote for Andres Pastrana. The convention opened 
with the entrance of former President Pastrana. He could not 
contain his eagerness and excitement and nearly cried when he 
referred to his son. 
  [Begin Misael Pastrana recording] The people who walk with 
he 
who walks with his own destiny are not mistaken. [end recording] 
  Although everything was prepared, time caught up with some 
in 
the afternoon. Official delegate Antonio Alvarez Restrepo 
raised his voice when he saw that the sound system was off. Now 
former candidate Rodrigo Llorente and the women who showed off 
their hats were seated in the front. Computers worked full 
steam ahead to tabulate the results of the voting in the 
departments, and the organizers did not allow anyone to enter 
the headquarters ahead of schedule. It took 12 hours to erect 
the stage to present a light, sound, and color show to proclaim 
Pastrana as the party's presidential candidate. The men 
responsible for this work are the same ones who produced the 
show to launch his campaign.

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast; all figures as </F>
heard] 
  [Text] CROMOS Magazine and the Caracol Radio Network hired 
the National Consultation Center to conduct a survey on 10, 11, 
and 12 February. A total of 280 men and 311 women were polled 
with 352 interviews conducted at the middle socioeconomic level, 
66 at the upper level, and 182 at the lower level. When asked 
if they favored the presence of U.S. engineers in Juanchaco, 34 
percent of the respondents said yes and 54 percent said no. 
Asked if they were familiar with the State Council's opinion on 
President Gaviria's decision to allow the military engineers in 
Juanchaco, 73 percent said yes and 27 percent said no. Asked if 
they agreed or disagreed with the State Council's position, 37 
percent said yes, 32 percent said no, and 4 percent either did 
not answer or did not know. 
  When the 600 Colombians were asked if they had heard, 
watched, or learned of the president's strong reply to the State 
Council, 71 percent said yes and 29 percent said no. Asked 
whether they agreed or disagreed with the president's reply, 27 
percent said they agreed, 40 percent said they disagreed, and 4 
percent said they did not know or did not answer. 
  When asked the final question of whether their image of 
President Gaviria was positive or negative, 54 percent said it 
was positive, 41 percent said negative, and five percent said 
they did not know or refused to answer. 
  Despite criticisms in the past few weeks for flying a 
folkloric musical group in the presidential plane to celebrate 
his wife's birthday and the controversy elicited by the U.S.

<F P=106> [SEMANA Interview with Conservative Party presidential </F>
hopeful Andres Pastrana Arango; place and date not given: 
"Pastrana Speaks Out"] 
  [Text] Only hours before formally announcing his 
presidential candidacy and following months of silence, Andres 
Pastrana agreed to an interview with SEMANA in which he spoke 
about Gaviria, the new right, the economic liberalization 
[apertura], the Cali Cartel, kidnappings, relations with 
Venezuela, and his father, former President Misael Pastrana. 
  [SEMANA] It has been said that your campaign will target a 
small number of basic issues. Which ones? 
  [Pastrana] When I launch my campaign, I will tell the 
country 
what the main issues of my government program are. They are 
seven in number and special emphasis will be placed on social 
issues. On 10 February, Colombia will realize that it is a 
serious, solid program that will propel the country into the 
21st century. My platform will seal my ineludible commitment to 
Colombia. 
  [SEMANA] Why did you wait so long before launching your 
campaign? What benefits do you think can be derived from making 
it a lightning campaign, as many call it? 
  [Pastrana] It is not a lightning campaign. Every political 
campaign has its time. In Europe, campaigns last 30 days. Please 
remember that I do not aspire to any candidacy in the 
preliminary campaign. I am a candidate for the May elections, 
not the March or October elections, as others claim. I am not a 
person who improvises, much less makes casual promises. I am a 
man of my word, a man who keeps his commitments. That is why I 
took several months to draft the government program that I shall 
submit to the Colombian people for their judicious examination, 
months that I spent listening to and learning from others. I 
toured the country and concluded that I share a common vision 
with the people concerning our country's most urgent problems 
and the course it must take. 
  [SEMANA] Why do you think the Colombian people should back 
you in the presidential elections? 
  [Pastrana] Because I am familiar with and know in what 
direction the country should be headed. I have experience and 
keep my commitments, as I have demonstrated in my public and 
private life, in the practice of journalism, and in my terms as 
mayor and in the nation's Senate. They should back me because I 
will seek to surround myself with the best people without 
distinction as to party, race, creed, or social status. Finally, 
I believe firmly in Colombia and will not fail Colombians in my 
pledge to implement my government platform. 
  [SEMANA] Your adversaries criticize the great influence 
which 
they believe your father, former President Misael Pastrana, has 
on you. How are your relations with him and how dependent on him 
are you? Do you think you would be a candidate if you were not 
the son of a former president? 
  [Pastrana] My relations with my father are excellent. I have 
said so before and I repeat it now. What is more, I admire, 
respect, and love him, as do the rest of my brothers and 
sisters. Nevertheless, we are different persons living in 
different times. We have disagreed on many occasions in public 
and in private. He has been a harsh critic of some acts of 
government that I have backed. He condemned the president's 
candidacy for the Office of Secretary General of the OAS. In 
contrast, I supported it, deeming it a positive thing for 
Colombia. He is very respectful of my opinions and my way of 
looking at politics, and I respect his equally. 
  As for the second question, I am not one for responding to 
mere conjectures. Nevertheless, you can be sure that I 
definitely would have been a candidate. My responsibilities in 
the public sector have always been backed by the people's votes. 
  [SEMANA] There are those in this country who think that 
Cesar 
Gaviria has already carried out enough reforms in the legal, 
political, and economic areas, and that it is up to his 
successor to administer those changes and stabilize the rules of 
play. Do you share that vision? 
  [Pastrana] I share the vision which President Cesar Gaviria 
has of the country. The reforms initiated by his administration 
are a starting point. While Colombia has made a major shift, it 
will be up to the next president to consolidate processes, 
introduce adjustments, and carry them out in the face of many 
problems with innovative, realistic ideas. 
  [SEMANA] The issue of the guerrillas remains on the agenda. 
Do you think that after an attack such as the one on the 
minister of finance and a slaughter of poor people like that 
carried out by the guerrillas in Uraba, it is possible to reopen 
the doors to dialogue and a negotiated settlement? 
  [Pastrana] Colombia has had important lessons in how to 
handle the guerrilla problem. By my very nature, I support 
reconciliation. I am not one of those who close a door and throw 
away the key. And yet, I shall not allow peace to become a "leg 
up" for continuing the war. We have become accustomed to 
governments that swing back and forth between war and peace. If 
there is any one thing that we Colombians must bear in mind, it 
is that it is not the government that is waging the war. The 
National Government has an obligation to defend the life, honor, 
and property of all Colombians, independently of what friendly 
or barbarous acts the guerrillas and criminals commit. It has no 
choice. That is why there can be no argument about strengthening 
the military forces and intelligence units. 
  [SEMANA] Do you think that the solution to the stalemate in 
these negotiations could be the beginning of regional dialogues, 
as the guerrillas are asking? 
  [Pastrana] The president is the one responsible for 
maintaining law and order. He has a constitutional mandate that 
he must heed, enforce, and not delegate. Otherwise, we would end 
up dividing the country unnecessarily. I do not even want to 
imagine that one of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia] fronts could be slaughtering children in Cauca while 
another is attending a political cocktail party in the capital 
and all under the same central command! And yet, regional and 
local authorities do play a key role in ensuring the 
pacification of the country. They know the factors of violence 
in their region better than anyone else. It is therefore their 
duty to support the government in enforcing law and order, to 
advise and heed it, without this turning into a license for 
entering into a dialogue with the guerrillas behind the 
president's back. 
  [SEMANA] Will you keep the office of minister of defense in 
the hands of a civilian or, on the contrary, do you intend to 
name one of the highest-ranking officials of the Armed Forces, 
as has been done in the past? 
  [Pastrana] I like the institution of the civilian minister 
of 
defense very much and it has functioned well, even better in the 
hands of persons like the husband of the manager of my campaign. 
  [SEMANA] What do you think of the contacts which the Office 
of Prosecutor General has maintained with the attorneys of the 
Cali Cartel? Do you think it would be meaningful, as has been 
proposed during those contacts, to reach an agreement with that 
group implying that their leaders could serve their prison 
sentences in their own homes? 
  [Pastrana] I do not favor allowing prison sentences to be 
served at home. That is an absurd idea that would never have 
entered my head. The policy of bringing criminals to justice 
cannot become a policy of bringing justice to the criminals. The 
government's efforts to reduce violence cannot lend themselves 
to improvisations or an under-the-table manipulation of our 
system of justice. 
  [SEMANA] What is your opinion of the antikidnapping norms, 
particularly the debate generated by a decision of the 
Constitutional Court and by Dr. Carlos Upegui to the effect that 
relatives of kidnap victims should not be prevented from 
bargaining over their ransom? 
  [Pastrana] I am convinced that there is no argument, not 
even 
one that could grow out of possible political agreements with 
guerrilla groups, that would justify granting pardons or amnesty 
for that atrocious crime. There is no justification for 
kidnapping and those who engage in it must know this 
unequivocally. We cannot make progress toward eliminating it if 
we do not establish certain concrete guidelines once and for 
all. We cannot yield to blackmail. 
  I was a sponsor of the antikidnapping law in the Senate and 
unreservedly backed the measure of the Free Country Foundation. 
Now that we know the Court's ruling, which substantially limited 
the range of the law, we must think of effective alternatives in 
order to fight the kidnapping industry without wavering. I am 
happy that Carlos Upegui is free and I am sure that he 
repudiates this crime of lese humanite as I do. 
  [SEMANA] You are considered a leader of the new right. Along 
that line of ideas, what do you think should be the future of 
the policy of economic liberalization [apertura] and 
privatizations? 
  [Pastrana] That is an outdated label in a world where action 
speaks louder than words. Rhetoric has to take a back seat. We 
live in new times and accomplishments take priority. I am not of 
the new right, nor am I a neoliberal, as some insist on calling 
me. I believe in sustained economic growth capable of 
guaranteeing a better distribution of income and a substantial 
improvement in the standard of living of the Colombian people. 
  Along that line of ideas, the future of the policy of 
economic liberalization will depend upon providing our 
productive sector with better tools so that it may be more 
efficient and competitive and thus generate productive jobs. A 
joint effort is required in which both the government and the 
private sector assume their responsibilities. The latter cannot 
do it alone. It has already done a great deal and now it is up 
to the government to do likewise. 
  Privatizations are not a panacea. They are not inherently 
good or bad. I think they are a good idea if they guarantee 
efficiency in the case of public services and an interesting 
alternative for generating resources that will enable the 
government to properly meet its social obligations, obligations 
that it can neither postpone nor delegate, such as education, 
security, and justice. 
  [SEMANA] Speaking of privatizations, do you think they 
should 
continue to be carried out by auctions? 
  [Pastrana] Whatever procedure is followed must be 
transparent. However, I do not agree that the most important 
thing is to obtain the highest price. In some cases, it may be 
important for the enterprise being privatized to have a leader 
who can impose efficiency. In other cases, there may be a 
greater possibility for many Colombians to participate and thus 
democratize property. That is a debate which has not yet taken 
place in Colombia and which the recent Court ruling puts on the 
carpet. 
  [SEMANA] Another latent proposal is the possibility that 
Colombia may join the ranks of the Free Trade Agreement that now 
involves Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Will you back 
that initiative? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, I would. The Free Trade Agreement offers us 
great possibilities and opportunities and it would therefore be 
desirable to be part of it at the earliest possible date. 
Nevertheless, I do not think we are at the top of the list of 
candidates, which means that what is most important is to make 
the most of the time available and adequately prepare to enter 
that market with a solid, competitive industry. 
  [SEMANA] One of the most important decisions that you will 
have to make in the weeks ahead is the name of your running 
mate: the vice presidential candidate. What qualifications will 
he have? Will he be a liberal or a conservative? Will he be 
young like you or an older person? 
  [Pastrana] It changes daily. I will make that decision later 
on. 
  [SEMANA] If you win the elections, you will certainly govern 
with a Congress having a Liberal majority. How do you expect to 
handle that situation, based on your conservative background? 
  [Pastrana] I shall try to form a consensus on the major 
national issues. We shall first determine which are the priority 
issues in my government program that require the approval of 
Congress. They will be solid projects that I am sure will enjoy 
legislative support. While partisan forces play a preponderant 
role in Congress, I am confident that there will be more 
congressmen who prefer the country's welfare over their efforts 
to obstruct the work of the government. 
  [SEMANA] You recently had a number of contacts with 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. Do you think your good 
relations with that leader, whom many identify as 
anti-Colombian, can help resolve the dispute over the Gulf? 
  [Pastrana] Without question, the fact of having good 
personal 
relations with President Caldera can help improve the climate of 
understanding between our countries and even smooth the way to a 
resolution of the problem of the dispute, which does not mean 
that our friendship is the decisive factor. 
  [SEMANA] Colombia has never had a president who has not 
served as minister. Do you not agree that missing that step 
hurts you? 
  [Pastrana] It is generally agreed that the Office of Mayor 
of 
Bogota is the second most important post in the country. In 
addition to administrative management, the experience I gained 
in handling times of crisis brought on by the onslaught of the 
drug terrorists taught me important lessons. Having served as 
mayor of Bogota, with the commitment implied by election by the 
people, far exceeds the responsibility of any ministry. 
<H5>  [Box, p 31] </H5>
<H5>  Andres' "Staff" </H5>
  1--Luis Alberto Moreno: General campaign coordinator. With a 
degree in Business Administration from Atlantic University [as 
published] (United States), this former minister of development 
is a talented, discreet man and the "guru" of the Pastrana camp 
ever since serving as manager of "TV-Today News." Some view him 
as the political genius who "thought up" Andres. 
  2--Francisco Lloreda: Pastrana's private secretary when the 
latter was mayor of Bogota. In charge of coordinating 
operations. A graduate of the Javerian School of Law who 
specialized in Public Administration at the University of 
Colombia and who has a background in journalism at Cali's EL 
PAIS, the daily newspaper published by his father, Rodrigo 
Lloreda. Simple, serious, and circumspect, if Pastrana should 
become president, "Kiko," as he is called, would be the 
government's "Miguel Silva." 
  3--Claudia de Francisco: She has been and remains a 
"workaholic." Her resume contains such posts as vice president 
for marketing of the Bank of Colombia, the Office of Secretary 
of Finance of the District, and the post of manager of the 
Bogota Telephone Enterprise. Now, as administrative coordinator 
of the campaign and wife of Minister of Defense Rafael Pardo, 
she has become a bridge between "Pastranism" and "Gavirianism." 
Or the reverse.... 
  4--Maristella Sanin: Close to Pastrana on the Senate bench 
of 
the New Democratic Force. In this campaign, she focuses her 
efforts on political support. A graduate of the Javerian School 
of Law, she is backed by her experience, not only in Congress, 
but also at the head of the Labor Ministry. 
  5--Diego Pardo: Although no longer the young blade that he 
was while serving as mayor of Bogota, this cachaco 
retains his fire, coordinating the Youth movement with Andres. 
In addition to serving as burgomaster of the country's 
capital--briefly--this graduate of the Javerian School of Law 
with a Master's from SMU in Dallas (Texas) served as director of 
CAR [Bogota Plain and Ubate and Chiquinquira Valleys Autonomous 
Regional Corporation] and superintendent of Exchange Control. 
  6--Carlos Duque: Adviser for communications, image, and 
publicity, he is also the man who practically revolutionized the 
image of political publicity in Colombia. The author of the 
first--and famous--poster for Luis Carlos Galan. 
  7--Juan Hernandez: Has been with Pastrana since the 
University of the Rosary, where they were classmates at the 
College of Jurisprudence. Served as councilman of Bogota, 
secretary of government during the Pastrana mayoralty, and 
consul in Houston (Texas). Heads the Multipliers Program. 
  8--Efrain Marin: Press director. Was on the staff of newsmen 
at "TV-Today News." 
  9--Gloria Isabel Ramirez: Publicity coordinator. 
  10--Marta de Arevalo: Volunteer coordinator. 
  11--Gustavo Pombo: Appointed to coordinate the campaign 
launching ceremony and the accompanying falderal. 
  12--Hernan Beltz: Financial coordinator. Civil engineer, but 
with an important career in the public sector (served as 
director of the National Planning Department and minister of 
public works), he was a member of the conservative board of 
directors of the Tequendama line. A personal friend of Alvaro 
Gomez.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor of SEMANA by Prosecutor General </F>
Gustavo de Greiff] 
  [Text] In these remarks, Mr. Editor, I refer to the note "A 
Terse Send-off" in the "Confidential" column and the account 
titled "De Greiff vs. Reno" in issue No. 611 [18 January] 
  1. It is absolutely untrue that there are differences 
between 
the government, "which maintains a tough stance," and the 
Prosecutor General's Office, "which is ready to give in to a 
substantial degree." There are no differences between the former 
and the latter. With respect to the Prosecutor General's Office, 
it is not a matter of giving in or not giving in. The Prosecutor 
General's office must follow a set of judicial procedures, in 
strict compliance with the law, and cannot be prejudicial So, 
this terseness has its origin in this circumstance and not in 
the differences invented in your "feverish" imagination 
  2. It is absolutely untrue that I told Mrs. Reno that "the 
situation with the Cali cartel could be resolved by pardoning 
its principle leaders." I cannot grant pardons. You, and the 
source who was the originator of this information, should know 
this. Allow me to recommend that you exercise caution with this 
source because this person either harbors bad intentions in 
giving you false information or is very poorly informed. 
  Furthermore, the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] has 
officially told me that none of its agents said what you 
attribute to "authorized spokespersons" from that agency of the 
U.S. Department of Justice. Stop the irresponsible journalism!!! 
  [Signed] Gustavo de Greiff R., Prosecutor General

<F P=106> [Response to Prosecutor General De Greiff's letter from the </F>
SEMANA editorial staff] 
  [Text] With regard to the first information, related to the 
differences between the national government and the Prosecutor 
General's Office regarding the surrender of persons linked to 
the Cali cartel, those differences are part of the public domain 
and have been reported by various communications media. In the 
recent past, even high-level government sources from the 
Prosecutor General's Office itself have described in detail to 
this magazine discrepancies of this sort with the government 
regarding the case of the Cali cartel. In addition, the week 
before last this disagreement was confirmed once again to SEMANA 
by a high-level source from President Gaviria's cabinet. With 
respect to the reports on differences between the Colombian 
Prosecutor General and his counterpart in the United States, 
these reports have been confirmed both by sources in the U.S. 
Government and by Colombian cabinet ministers. Thus, Mr. 
Prosecutor General, it is not a question of either inventions, 
or feverish imaginations, or irresponsible journalism.

<F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has dismissed 
Information and Tourism Minister Carlos Vera, because the 
president said the minister failed to show respect for the 
command hierarchy by criticizing Vice President Alberto Dahik. 
Carlos Vera Rodriguez ordered Dahik to toe the line and refrain 
from launching trial balloons after the vice president stated 
the government is studying the possibility of calling a 
referendum on topics government spokesmen have not yet 
disclosed. Vera referred to the burning topic this noon when 
he hosted a news conference that was broadcast nationwide on a 
radio network. The minister officially announced his 
resignation from the post he has held since the start of 
conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen's government. In announcing that 
he was stepping down, Vera stated: The president felt a way to 
resolve the situation my remarks caused was to ask for my 
resignation, and I immediately agreed. 
  [Begin Vera recording] It is necessary in this country to 
display constant loyalty and to demonstrate with deeds and 
renouncements, not just with mellifluous or questionable phrases 
or poses. It is necessary to etch that word in capital letters; 
it is necessary. The same applies with the words understanding, 
friendship, gratitude, and frankness. That is why today when I 
conclude my work I do so in a manner that should be done--with a 
president of the caliber of Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  I begin with my thanks, with a tight summary of results, and 
my best wishes of good luck. I will later refer to the 
president's decision to request my resignation and my decision 
to heed his request immediately. I again begin by thanking him 
for the confidence and support he gave me by entrusting upon me 
this responsibility to continue the work of Pedro Zambrano, 
whose untimely death, which could have been avoided [words 
indistinct] of Ecuador prompted me to accept this challenge. 
Before, I had encouraged him to join the task of supporting a 
new course, something that ultimately cost him his life. 
  I could not help but sacrifice my prestige, comfort, and 
economy to act according to his struggle and task. [end 
recording] 
  Vera publicly criticized Vice President Alberto Dahik, who 
in 
the last few days announced the government's intention to 
convene a popular consultation to propose various constitutional 
reforms. Dahik made the announcement without President 
Duran-Ballen's authorization, creating a state of confusion 
within the government and sparking reactions from different 
sectors in Ecuador. 
  President Duran-Ballen said the issue of a possible 
plebiscite is only under consideration. 
  Vera said during a news conference: I do not consider it a 
lack of respect to request respect for a right exclusive to the 
president. He should be the first to announce such an important 
matter as a plebiscite. 
  Several papers published today reported that Vera had become 
a strong Dahik opponent due to the differences between the 
officials on economic policies. 
  Vera, a 39-year-old reporter, had orchestrated 
Duran-Ballen's 
political campaign, which took him to the Ecuadoran presidency 
for the 1992-96 term. The former information minister also said 
Leon Herrera, National Radio director, and David Andrade, 
information under secretary, had placed their post at the 
executive's disposal. I have asked them to remain in their 
posts until the new minister replaces them, Vera said, stating 
he would return to journalism. 
  The government is still undecided about who will replace 
Vera; therefore, David Andrade, information under secretary, 
will remain in charge.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, President Alberto 
Fujimori disavowed the involvement of members of the Peruvian 
Armed Forces command in the kidnapping and murder of nine La 
Cantuta University students and a professor. The president also 
described the sentence handed down on Monday against 11 Army 
officers accused of the July 1992 disappearance of 10 civilians 
from the "Enrique Guzman y Valle" University also known as La 
Cantuta as "drastic and exemplary. We hope the sentence, which 
is in accordance with the law, will serve as an example so 
despicable human rights violations will not occur again in the 
future," the president stated after accusing some "political 
sectors" of attempting to harm Peru. 
  Fujimori pointed out that isolated cases such as La Cantuta 
must not, in any way, undermine the anti-terrorist strategy his 
administration is undertaking, and warned that "this policy will 
continue until subversive groups have been beaten." He insisted 
this strategy must continue to prevent limiting the Armed Forces 
in its determination to confront terrorism. 
  With respect to the approval of the controversial law 
transferring the missing La Cantuta civilians case to military 
jurisdiction, President Fujimori reiterated that the military 
courts "are the best guarantee" to ensure that those responsible 
will be penalized. 
  Yesterday, the Supreme Military Justice court sentenced one 
general, one colonel, one captain, and four junior officers to 
sentences ranging from one to 20 years imprisonment. The 
military court also exonerated another colonel and left the case 
pending against a lieutenant who is a fugitive. The military 
court also determined that neither the Army command or the 
National Intelligence Service (SIN) were involved in the case, 
and ordered that once the corresponding appeals had been 
evaluated, the case should be filed and the controversial 
process should be closed forever. 
  Political opposition sectors insist that General Nicolas de 
Bari Hermoza, president of the Armed Forces Joint Command as 
well as Army chief, and Vladimiros Montesinos, the controversial 
presidential adviser and SIN official should have both been 
included in the court proceedings. Fugitive Gen. Rodolfo Robels, 
who is self-exiled in Argentina since May 1993, identified 
Hermoza and Montesinos as leaders of a paramilitary commando 
group responsible for masterminding the massacre of the La 
Cantuta students and professor. 
  "I flatly deny that orders were ever issued by the Armed 
Forces command" to kidnap the university students, the president 
insisted in stating that "some sectors are trying to politicize 
this issue in order to hurt the country." 
  Heriberto Benitez, one of the three lawyers for the 
relatives 
of the missing civilians, disagreed with the way the military 
court conducted the case, and he believes there were numerous 
irregularities. Nevertheless, Benitez said he hopes that in the 
future a new congress and a new judicial branch will review the 
case and prevent the guilty parties from benefiting from a 
presidential pardon in the short run. "This is a process, which 
for us as plaintiffs, has not concluded yet since the appeals to 
the Supreme Court for the case to be returned to a civilian 
court are still pending." 
  He stated it is not a matter of the victims' relatives being 
satisfied with the sentences, regardless of whether they are 20 
or 40 years imprisonment. This is a case that must be dealt with 
publicly in order for it to serve as an example to prevent any 
officer from repeating La Cantuta crime in the future. 
  Meanwhile, Jorge Avendano, dean of the Lima Bar Association 
[CAL] filed a motion of unconstitutionality against the bill 
that approved the transfer of the La Cantuta case to military 
jurisdiction. The CAL lawyer pointed out that the document, 
filed before the Supreme Court of Justice's Court of 
Unconstitutionality, seeks to invalidate the so-called "La 
Cantuta" bill since he believes the norm "is not valid, and 
nonexistent also." He said the previously mentioned bill 
violates several legal principles. At any rate, he disclosed 
that with a sentence already having been rendered by a military 
court, "it will be very difficult to return it to civilian 
jurisdiction."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments through 22 February: 
  Through a decree published in the official government 
gazette, the Energy and Mines Ministry has officially outlined 
its agreement to guarantee and promote investments. The 
agreement's eighth clause indicates that government guarantees 
will cover 15 years, starting from the date of crediting the 
investment. Such investments must be approved by the National 
Mining Directorate. (Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in 
Spanish 1800 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  The Central Reserve Bank has reported that Peru's net 
international reserves fluctuate between $1.7 and $1.8 billion. 
Those figures represent the highest reserve level in recent 
years, bank officials added. (Lima Global de Television Network

  [Text] The spread of coca plantations to southern Peru and 
the processing of cocaine paste have increased drug trafficking 
near Bolivia and Brazil. It necessarily follows that cocaine 
should get to consumer markets via new routes. 
  This information -- which was provided by an international 
probe into narcotics control -- together with the analysis of 
the data submitted by drug enforcement agencies in Paraguay have 
led to the conclusion that our country would be the new cocaine 
route. 
  The National Police's Narcotics Department and the National 
Narcotics Directorate [Dinar] are investigating this new route 
and all the evidence seems to indicate that the drug enters the 
country via the Paraguay River and is transported to a port, 
possibly Concepcion, or another located further upstream. 
  The National Police's Narcotics Department has sent 
personnel 
to Fuerte Olimpo to check a shipment of Brazilian cigarettes 
that were consigned to our country from Zarate Port, Bolivia. 
  This drew the attention of the police authorities as the 
expense involved in transporting the cigarette shipment via the 
Transchaco Highway to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and from 
there to Zarate Port, where it is loaded into a motorboat that 
goes downstream in the direction of Concepcion is totally 
unjustified. 
  Following the exodus of authorities from Bahia Negra, the 
place is an ideal "post" for drug traffickers to send cocaine -- 
which presumably comes from Colombia rather than from Santa Cruz 
de la Sierra -- to the Pedro Juan Caballero cocaine cartel. 
  This new, small-scale cartel allegedly used this route to 
bring 150 kg of cocaine hydrochloride into the country at the 
end of last week. The Dinar and the National Police's Narcotics 
Department are currently delving into this issue. It is 
surmised that the shipment is already in Pedro Juan Caballero, 
the capital of Amambay Department. 
  There are concrete data to the effect that chemical products 
for processing cocaine are given in exchange for the drug. 
Ether, acetone, and hydrochloric acid come from Brazil through 
Bella Vista and are transported to Concepcion, from where they 
are allegedly shipped to Bolivia. The lack of transport, 
communications, and checkpoints enables the drug traffickers to 
continue their business unhampered.

  [Excerpt] The passage of the Executive Branch's partial 
veto of the law on the Council for Magistrates by the Chamber of 
Deputies on 18 February did not come as a surprise to anybody. 
Following the acceptance of the veto, Congress enacted the law 
without Articles 42 and 47, which had been vetoed by the 
executive branch. 
  Even though according to standard procedure, the partial 
veto 
-- which already had been approved in the Senate -- had to be 
discussed in committee, Colorado Party Deputy Bernardino Cano 
Radil moved that the matter be discussed in a plenary session 
and his motion was adopted. 
  In light of the arguments made during the debate, deputies 
agreed to accept the president's decision to veto two articles 
of the law and the latter was carried with unanimous approval. 
  As of the moment it is notified of the enactment of the law 
by Congress, the Executive branch has 20 days to promulgate and 
publish the law, but, according to what congressmen pointed out, 
the Executive branch is expected to deal with the issue in an 
urgent manner so as to establish the Council for Magistrates as 
soon as possible. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 19 February, PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal 
Party] leader Domingo Laino announced that if the serious social 
problems are not solved the party will form an opposition front 
that will tighten its stance and make concrete demands through 
mobilizations. This announcement marks the end of the 
Governability Pact between the opposition and national 
government. 
  Laino said there is a time for everything, and the 
opposition 
has patiently waited long enough to see if the government would 
improve things but unfortunately it continues to be partial, 
represents a single party, has not allowed the opposition to 
participate, and has not shown any political will to fight 
corruption. 
  Laino also said the party would seek new paths other than 
the 
Governability Pact to speed up the country's democratization 
because it believes the social situation in Paraguay is 
unsustainable. 
  The former "authentic" presidential candidate said the 
government has no political will to respond with due dignity and 
respect to social demands and charged that corruption continues 
to plague the state apparatus. 
  Laino added: "We believe that with only a 30 percent success 
in the struggle against corruption we already would have enough 
money to buy land and invest in the construction of hospitals 
and schools, which is precisely the key to the challenge we are 
facing." 
  The opposition leader said the current social situation is 
too serious; therefore, one cannot think about long term 
socioeconomic plans because in the long term we will have all 
died. In our case, we cannot even talk about a medium-term 
plan, only of a national emergency plan. Laino added that the 
social situation is absolutely serious and if the government 
does not respond to the demands now, we are going to find 
ourselves in a situation that may turn the current system not 
only unstable but also make the country ungovernable. 
  Laino then insisted again that the Paraguayan opposition 
must 
start thinking about changing its own policy regarding the 
government because it already has waited long enough and cannot 
continue waiting another seven months, and that the executive 
branch should be aware of this because "our attitude has always 
been responsible, sensible, but there are no signs of a solution 
to the social problems."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following reports are reactions to 
statements by Domingo Laino, leader of the Authentic Radical 
Liberal Party, PLRA, that the governability pact has been broken. 
  Asuncion HOY in Spanish, in its 21 February issue, carries 
on 
page 3 an unattributed 200-word article quoting Christian 
Democratic Party President Miguel Angel Montaner denying the 
breaking of the governability pact. He says: "`To the contrary, 
the pact has been greatly strengthened; on 19 February, for 
example, the multiparty negotiating board met in San Bernardino 
to discuss how to face the social problems.'" 
  The same newspaper, on pages 22 and 23, carries another 
300-word unattributed article quoting Colorado Party President 
Eugenio Sanabria Cantero saying: "The possible breaking of the 
governability pact announced by PLRA leader Domingo Laino was 
not the result of an argument in the multiparty negotiating 
board," whose members met on 19 February in his house in San 
Bernardino and "where the issue was not mentioned at all." 
Sanabria Cantero, who learned of Laino's statements through the 
newspapers, said the multiparty negotiating board will meet 
again on 21 February to discuss the subject. 
  Also on 21 February, Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish publishes 
on page 6 a 500-word unattributed article quoting several 
politicians. Enrique Gonzalez Quintana, second president of the 
Colorado Party, says: "With or without a pact, the Colorado 
Party will solve the social crisis." PLRA Deputy Francisco Jose 
de Vargas states: "The real opposition members will not change 
their policy because they always fought corruption." PLRA Deputy 
Blas Llano says the "governability pact may have broken because 
it did not accomplish anything." PLRA Deputy Luis Delorme states 
that Laino "changed his attitude regarding the governability 
pact because he realized that it is not working." Presidential 
social adviser Oscar Paciello said he does not believe the pact 
should have been broken "because some of the opposition members 
are very optimistic about it."

  [Text] Brasilia -- After surviving several crises and 
threats to leave the government, Justice Minister Correa is 
again enduring pressures. Because of the several glasses of 
whiskey he had at his box at the Sambodromo carnival parade 
ground in Rio de Janeiro, Correa ended up annoying the military, 
the church, and Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
himself, who was also irritated by the behavior of his party 
colleague. Planalto Palace advisers find the behavior of Correa 
-- who had to be carried from the Sambodromo box by aides and 
security personnel -- to be way out of line with his ministerial 
rank. 
  According to the above advisers, it will be incumbent upon 
Henrique Hargreaves -- chief of the president's civil household 
-- to talk with Correa to ask him to resign. In light of the 
fact that Franco himself has had his image tarnished by the 
scandal provoked by model Lilian Ramos, the presidential 
advisers would like to spare him the embarrassment of having to 
fire a minister who had had a drink too many in a public place. 
  In military circles, where Correa has fallen from grace 
since 
January when in an interview he said that Franco had resisted a 
coup attempt by retired officers, his getting drunk at the 
Sambodromo was the last straw. The military dissatisfaction 
with Correa was at the center of a meeting held last week by 
General Fernando Cardoso, chief of the president's military 
household, with the president of the Republic. 
  Correa has not done too well in other government areas 
either. In the P.C. Farias case, he had several head-on 
collisions with the Federal Police [PF] and ended up by being 
forced to accept Colonel Wilson Romao as the PF director. 
  Both in Congress and at the PF, Correa's weekend drinking 
had 
become common knowledge long before the Sambodromo scandal. 
Politicians said that Correa used to arrive at meetings smelling 
of whisky when he was vice president of the Congressional 
Investigating Committee in the P.C. Farias case.

<F P=106> [Article by Pamela Nunes and Marta Salomon] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- The vote on the Social Emergency Fund 
(FSE) scheduled for 23 February could be postponed due to 
President Itamar Franco's disastrous behavior in the past few 
days and the excitement created by the approaching electoral 
campaign. Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] is 
threatening to review the PFL [Liberal Front Party]'s support 
for the government only a few days before the decisive battle to 
approve the economic plan in Congress. "The government has 
suffered a serious credibility crisis," the governor said on 18 
February. "This is why we must renegotiate the pact that made 
possible PFL support for the FSE." 
  The PFL was one of the main parties responsible for a full 
plenary session during the first voting session on the FSE, when 
the government amendment was approved. This is why ACM's threat 
carries a strong risk that the decisive voting session might be 
postponed. "It can be delayed, yes," the governor admitted. In 
order to have the amendment approved in the decisive session the 
government needs the votes of 293 legislators, which requires 
broad support. This support was weakened recently by Itamar 
Franco's behavior during Carnival and his remarks in favor of 
the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso for 
the presidency. 
  FSE resources are essential for the government to balance 
the 
public deficit and begin the second stage of the plan providing 
for the implementation of the Real Value Unit (URV). Political 
parties are aware of the consequences if the plan is not 
approved by 10 March, when the deadline for negotiating the 
foreign debt with the IMF expires. But many politicians are 
willing to delay a vote on the plan to prevent the minister from 
running for the presidency. Tarcisio Delgado (PMDB-MG [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party- Minas Gerais]), leader of the largest 
bloc in Congress, is facing the possibility of a vote on 23 
February with "moderate optimism." Today the PMDB will have a 
meeting with all its deputies and senators to reevaluate its 
support for the government. The mood of the party turned more 
serious after the president's support for Cardoso's candidacy 
because the PMDB is reluctant to approve measures offering 
electoral profit to the minister. 
  The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] already has announced 
that it will again insist on the approval of measures keeping 
funds for education and housing intact. That could represent a 
loss of $2 billion for the FSE. The party will try to close an 
agreement with rebellious PMDB legislators that might make the 
life of the government miserable. That alliance is supported 
even by some groups inside the PFL, which is also against 
Cardoso's candidacy. On 18 February, legislators again could not 
gather enough numbers for a quorum for a session. There were 40 
deputies on the premises and only 18 of them went to the 
auditorium to ask if there was going to be a session.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said yesterday that the government will not change the 
composition of the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) that will be 
voted on in the second round on 23 February. Asked about the 
opposition of Ministers Murilio Hingel (Education), Henrique 
Santillo (Health), and Leonor Franco (Social Welfare) to the 
composition of the fund, Fernando Henrique Cardoso said that 
those who are against it should resign. 
  If any minister works against the economic plan, he should 
have the courage to resign, said Cardoso after holding a 
confidential meeting with President Itamar Franco at the 
Brasilia Air Base. 
  Cardoso alerted President Franco to the problems in having 
the emergency fund approved and to the need for the government 
to firmly maintain its proposal. 
  Cardoso said: "The government is united. The creation of the 
fund is a government decision." 
  He reiterated to the president -- as he did last week during 
the carnival celebration -- that it would not be wise to make 
any concessions on the cuts made to the budget to create the 
emergency fund. The president organized a meeting with the 
ministers who were dissatisfied with the economic team but he 
later cancelled the meeting. 
  The ministers of education, health, and social welfare 
worked 
with Congress to change the composition of the fund because they 
want a higher budget for their ministries. Minister Cardoso, who 
was irritated by the ministers' behavior, did not give in to the 
pressure and President Itamar did not disavow him either. 
  Cardoso said: "There is nothing to negotiate in the 
proposal. 
The government will not give up the goal of zero deficit. As 
Congress already approved it in the first round, I do not 
believe it will change its point of view either because it is 
hot or it is cold." 
  Constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim 
(PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do 
Sul] said he rejected the 31 amendments to change the fund's 
composition, thus keeping the proposal approved in the first 
round.

  [Excerpts] Health Minister Henrique Santillo denied having 
threatened to resign and said he is not playing the role of a 
blackmailer by asking that more funds be allocated for health. 
  Santillo said he is not planning to leave the government 
because he is not against approval of the Social Emergency Fund, 
FSE. He asserted that he did his best to convince congressmen to 
increase health allocations in 1994, but did not speak against 
the FSE. He added that as soon as the FSE is approved, he will 
again talk to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and 
President Itamar Franco and try to obtain more budget resources: 
first, for the hospital assistance program and then for other 
Health Ministry programs. 
  Santillo refuted rumors that he was planning to leave his 
position, and added that he will remain at the head of the 
Health Ministry until the end of his mandate. [passage omitted] 
  Education Minister Murilio Hingel said he does not oppose 
the 
FSE, and he does not plan to leave his position because he 
believes in the plan proposed by the government. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- The behavior of President Itamar 
Franco while watching the samba groups on the carnival parade 
ground and his withdrawal to Juiz de Fora during a delicate 
political situation could have provided fuel for a new crisis, 
even during carnival. Meanwhile, on 18 February the Sao Paulo 
Stock Exchange, which is one of the organizations that best 
reflects the feelings of society, suffered a jolt: a drop of 
almost 10 points. Are Franco and model Lilian Ramos to blame? 
Partly. According to a market expert, the stock market fell 
because in the morning of 18 February there was a rumor that 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso went to Juiz de Fora 
to submit his resgination. 
  The rumor did not turn into reality but the reaction of the 
stock market shows that Finance Minister Cardoso has become a 
more important point of reference than the president. Even if 
President Franco and Minister Cardoso were prisoners in the same 
boat, they would be treated by Congress as separate forces, as 
happened on 17 February when Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul], the 
rapporteur of the constitutional revision, criticized President 
Franco for proposing Cardoso's presidential candidacy. According 
to Jobim, the president's proposal obstructs the negotiations 
for voting on the Social Emergency Fund. [passage omitted] 
  The presence of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the 
government today is what gives perspective to society. He 
represents initiative, he gathers power around him, and even his 
personal contacts with Franco give support to the president. 
  These are compliments but they are the type of comments that 
leave the minister concerned and the president annoyed. Of the 
four finance ministers in the country in the last 16 months, 
Cardoso is the one who has been able to maintain cordial, frank, 
and constant relations with Franco for the longest time. 
[passage omitted] 
  He represents power and work. While Franco remained in Juiz 
de Fora, Minister Cardoso was one of the four ministers working 
in Brasilia on 18 February and preparing his agenda for the next 
day. With one hand on politics, he articulated the voting of the 
Social Emergency Fund to be held on 23 or 24 February. With the 
other hand on the economy, he was preparing the very complex 
monetary transition to the URV [Real Value Unit].

<F P=106> [Article by Miriam Leitao] </F>
  [Text] The IMF mission is returning to Brazil this week but 
the experts are pessimistic in view of the problems they are 
finding in the Brazilian accounts. At the end of the first 
verifications they made of the Brazilian public accounts last 
week, they came to the conclusion that not even the zero 
operational deficit was achieved. The operational deficit 
includes financial spending, and to have a zero deficit it is 
necessary that the country achieve enough primary surplus to 
compensate for paying the debt interest. 
  The government promised to achieve the zero operational 
deficit. The IMF really wants an operational surplus that, 
honestly speaking, is an unobtainable goal. But according to the 
verifications made by the IMF team, not even the promise made by 
the government is being fulfilled despite all the effort for the 
fiscal adjustment being debated in Congress. 
  There is a good possibility that the Social Emergency Fund 
will be approved in the second round this week. Even the 
opposition congressmen admit they will have problems in bringing 
the 293 deputies needed to debate any amendments. The economic 
team only admits one problem: If new negotiations are needed, 
the government has nothing to yield. 
  The team is preparing charts to clarify the Social Emergency 
Fund's final version. So many changes were made that even the 
deputies who take care of this matter in detail are confused 
about how the fund is made up. The charts will be distributed to 
the deputies by leader Luiz Carlos Santos. 
  If this effort does open the way for an agreement with the 
IMF, part of Finance Minister Cardoso's strategy will be ruined.

<F P=106> [Interview with ABC Metal Workers Union President Vicente </F>
"Vicentinho" Paulo da Silva, by Liliana Pinheiro; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Pinheiro] How do you evaluate the country now 
that carnival is over? 
  [Paulo da Silva] You mean after the president flirted with a 
girl without panties? Without being falsely moral, I was 
ashamed. 
  Regarding the government, we will continue to criticize what 
we have always criticized. The measures being prepared offer us 
no guarantees. Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso makes more 
mistakes than the ministers of the military regime. He knows 
that easy measures like increasing taxes are not enough. Such 
measure will appease the crisis only for a few days. 
  [Pinheiro] Has the government taken too long to react? 
  [Paulo da Silva] Look at the car industry agreement which 
obtained a collective commitment and which created jobs. 
Unfortunately the agreement was not repeated in other 
industries. The government has been very shortsighted because 
it could have made everyone committed to the development of the 
country. 
  [Pinheiro] What does the labor movement expect from the 
creation of the URV [Real Value Unit]? 
  [Paulo da Silva] To establish salaries based on a URV 
calculated from the previous month's average price increases 
represents a salary squeeze. In our case we would loose one 
month's salary increase which amounts to 40 percent. What can 
the URV do against inflation? Does this mean the government 
will create a currency that can be manipulated, that will not 
take into account price increases? Will salaries be controlled 
by this currency? The government cannot do this. This could 
worsen the already poor distribution of wealth in Brazil. It is 
condemning those in the slums to stay in the slums. Beside 
this, there is no mechanism forcing the businessmen to establish 
their prices in URV. 
  [Pinheiro] What if salaries are related to the previous 
month's average price increases? 
  [Paulo da Silva] We will hold an assembly next 25 February 
to 
discuss the salary campaign. If a salary squeeze is imposed on 
us, a general strike will have to be considered at a national 
level. 
  [Pinheiro] A national general strike? 
  [Paulo da Silva] We cannot allow society to again pay for 
the 
bankruptcy Brazil has been led to. I am speaking of the 
workers, the small businessmen, who pay more taxes than big 
businessmen, than everybody else. 
  [Pinheiro] You will probably win the CUT [Sole Workers 
Center] elections in three months. Will your administration be 
marked by large mobilizations? 
  [Paulo da Silva] The CUT cannot lose its great weapon which 
is its mobilization capability. Negotiation is worthwhile only 
if you are strong. Current conditions to defend the workers are 
concrete. The government better not fool around. Remove our 
accomplishments and see what happens. Perhaps because of its 
immaturity, the government is overlooking the labor movement's 
mobilization potential. 
  [Pinheiro] The Union Force is also calling for a strike. 
Could labor unions unite in a national strike? 
  [Paulo da Silva] The CUT will not negotiate with [Labor 
Force 
President] Luiz Antonio de Medeiros. There are different 
interests and total antagonism. There is a possibility of 
dialogue but with serious people of the Labor Force. Medeiros 
is losing credibility. [passage omitted] 
  [Pinheiro] You will support Lula [Workers Party President 
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] for president. Is the labor union 
structure part of this support? 
  [Paulo da Silva] The labor union cannot remain isolated from 
national changes. It must not favor a party but it can be 
politicized. We will call the candidates we like and place our 
support at their disposal. The labor union will not lend money 
to any political party but we are free to politically support 
Lula, just as Medeiros is free to support Collor or Maluf.

  [Text] Orestes Quercia disclosed the tone of his campaign 
for the presidency of Republic. 
  During a meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] regional leadership in Sao Paulo, Quercia said he will 
not play nice during the campaign, and on 21 February he already 
started attacking his possible adversaries in the presidential 
succession. 
  The main targets of Quercia's attacks were Deputy Antonio 
Britto, Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes, and Mayor Paulo Maluf. 
  Quercia's candidacy enjoys the support of most of the 
members 
of the regional PMDB leadership; however, he does not have the 
support of the federal bloc nor of the deputies who back 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho.

  [Editorial Report] Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese on 20 February publishes on page A12 a 700-word 
article by Gabriel Nogueira entitled "Deputy Denounces Air Taxi 
Companies." 
  The author bases his article on a report by Deputy Jose 
Dirceu based on Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI, and 
Federal Police investigations of the Paulo Cesar, PC, Farias and 
budget corruption schemes. 
  The author says the creation of "air taxi companies has 
become one of the most lucrative ways to launder money earned 
irregularly. Most large construction companies involved in the 
PC and budget scandals have planes registered as air taxis, 
which are used by legislators and public company executives in 
exchange for favors and in order to evade taxes." 
  The author says most companies use the legal benefits of 
current legislation granting tax exemptions to air taxi 
companies and facilitating the remittal of dollars abroad 
through leasing operations. 
  The author says: "Dozens of people open ghost companies 
abroad in the name of figureheads to purchase planes in the 
international market. Jose Dirceu says that once this is done, 
the local company makes a contract with `the foreign company' 
for a rental operation (leasing) and starts legally remitting 
large sums of money abroad." The author says an additional 
advantage is that the law allows companies to deduct the amount 
paid for renting the planes from their tax reports. 
  The author says: "Civil Aviation Department, DAC, rules that 
regulate the operation of these planes are not respected and 
transgressors go unpunished because of the lack of supervision. 
There is no control over the millions of dollars sent abroad 
through false plane leasing operations." 
  The author says that "besides the famous cases of Brasil Jet 
and Mundial Aerotaxi owned by Paulo Cesar Farias," Deputy Jose 
Dirceu mentions the Taming company owned by Mendes Junior 
Construction Company, Aerotaxi Pampulha owned by Andrade 
Gutierrez Construction Company, Wanair owned by Cowan Company, 
the plane fleet owned by Tratex Construction Company, Crasa Taxi 
owned by CR Almeida Company, Morro Vermello owned by Camargo 
Correa Construction Company, Embrataxi owned by former Minas 
Gerais Governor Newton Cardoso, and the Plata company owned by 
economist Jose Carlos Alves doe Santos.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Congressional leaders will today make a 
new effort to guarantee the amendment of the Constitution. 
Leaders of the parties that endorse the amendment will meet 
this morning with PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
Senator for Paraiba Humberto Lucena -- the president of the 
Constituent Congress -- in another attempt to design a minimum 
agenda for the debates that will follow the voting on the Social 
Emergency Fund (FSE). The leaders want, as of March, voting 
sessions to be held on weekends. This afternoon they will set 
31 May as the new deadline to conclude the work by the 
Constituent Congress following a request by Federal Supreme 
Court (STF) justices and by Attorney General Aristides Junqueira 
as a precondition for immediate promulgation of the FSE bill. 
  During the meeting, PMDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Nelson 
Jobim, rapporteur of the Constituent Congress, will once again 
call on party leaders to mobilize their blocs. Jobim complained 
that party blocs -- especially his own -- are indifferent toward 
the amendment. He is annoyed with some PMDB sectors who are 
negotiating with the "contras" over a minimum agenda for the 
amendment, which will reportedly exclude modifications in the 
Economic Order chapter. PFL [Liberal Front Party] Deputy for 
Pernambuco Inocencio Oliveira -- the president the Chamber of 
Deputies -- said if this chapter is excluded, the amendment 
process will not take place. "The PFL, PPR [Progressive Renewal 
Party], and the PP [Popular Party] will not participate under 
that condition," he warned. 
  Deputy for Santa Catarina Luiz Henrique, the president of 
the 
PMDB, today will meet with the "contras" -- the PT [Workers 
Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PSB [Brazilian Socialist 
Party], and PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil] -- to agree on a 
minimum agenda that might be endorsed by those parties and by 
the PMDB. Germano Rigotto, the PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do 
Sul -- one of the lawmakers who wants to exclude the Economic 
Order chapter from the minimum agenda -- has said that if there 
is no negotiation, the amendment will remain stalemated. He 
added that the PFL, the PPR, and the PP are wrong when they say 
the amendment will be meaningless without modifications to the 
Economic Order chapter. He stated: "The country's problems are 
not related to monopolies or to restrictions on foreign capital, 
they are related to the tax system, the social security system, 
the electoral system, and the budget." 
  PPR Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Adylson Motta -- the vice 
president of the Constituent Congress -- who witnessed the PMDB 
preparations, said: "Once the FSE bill is approved, the 
government will leave the amendment process." PFL and PPR 
lawmakers share this feeling of distrust. Jobim is not very 
certain of the participation of the PMDB and the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] in the amendment work once the second 
phase of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's plan has 
been approved. PFL Deputy for Bahia Luis Eduardo Magalhaes -- 
the PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies -- wants to take 
advantage of today's meeting to make government leaders formally 
promise that they will work for the amendment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario </F>
Cesar Flores by Tania Monteiro; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Monteiro] Won't President 
Itamar Franco's decision to start Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's presidential campaign threaten voting on the 
Social Emergency Fund [FSE]? 
  [Flores] I believe the president would like to see Cardoso 
elected. There are different opinions on whether this was the 
appropriate moment for Franco to comment on the issue, and I do 
not want to go into this discussion. I do not believe, however, 
that Franco did that to focus the country's attention on 
something other than the economic crisis. I believe he talked 
about the issue because deep inside this is what he wishes. 
  [Monteiro] His comments, however, had a different effect in 
Congress. 
  [Flores] Congress reacts to everything. Those who oppose the 
approval of the FSE and some items of the constitutional 
revision supported by the economic team will use the opportunity 
to oppose the plan. I earnestly believe that Cardoso's possible 
presidential candidacy may become a reality. Nonetheless, we 
cannot agree with those who use this possibility as a reason to 
create difficulties in the debate and approval of the 
constitutional revision issues. This is against the country's 
interests. 
  [Monteiro] Would you vote for Fernando Henrique Cardoso? 
  [Flores] I will not answer that question. 
  [Monteiro] Your talks with Workers Party congressmen have 
been prompting rumors that you might run with Luis Inacio Lula 
da Silva. 
  [Flores] No one has ever discussed that with me. I have 
never 
been asked about this possibility, directly or indirectly. From 
the candidacy viewpoint, this would be legally impossible 
because I am not affiliated with any political party. This is 
foolish speculation. 
  [Monteiro] Would you vote for Lula? 
  [Flores] One only chooses a candidate when the electoral 
scenario is defined. Lula probably will be a candidate, but I do 
not know who will be the other candidates. The problem is that 
the Brazilian electoral process has a few inconveniences that 
create a dramatic situation at the moment of casting a vote. 
Instead of voting for someone I believe to be the best 
candidate, I am forced to vote for the person who will be less 
harmful to the country. So far, this is the way I have been 
making my choices and this is bad for the political system. 
  [Monteiro] How do you evaluate the country's current 
situation? 
  [Flores] Personally, I believe that if we do not overcome 
the 
constitutional revision bottleneck, we will lose control. There 
is imbalance between what is asked from the government and the 
government's capacity to answer the requests. This imbalance has 
to be overcome in the constitutional revision. We cannot ask 
from the government more than it has to give. If we continue to 
ask the government for more than it has to give -- we are 
witnessing this in the areas of social security, health, and 
education -- we will end up in a very difficult situation. I 
don't know what will occur. I believe, however, that emergencies 
end up creating solutions. Therefore, if the governability 
crisis becomes worse, we will have emergencies and the pressure 
exerted by them will bring about solutions, which will be 
political solutions. 
  [Monteiro] Could the solution be a military one? 
  [Flores] Absolutely not. A military solution is impossible 
in 
today's Brazil.

<F P=106> [Article by Deborah Berlinck] </F>
  [Text] Geneva -- Shrimp fishermen in northeastern Brazil 
will have to change their fishing nets. The problem is not 
quality, but the fact that U.S. scientists believe these nets 
kill turtles. The United States has a solution: a law banning 
the importation of shrimp from countries that use this type of 
nets. If this law is implemented against Brazil, fishermen in 
the northeast will loose $30 million per year. 
  This situation makes one wonder who establishes the trade 
rules and international environmental patterns. This question 
prompted environment ministers from 25 countries to meet on 17 
February at the United Nations to discuss a basic issue: How to 
harmonize the freeing of world trade with the preservation of 
the environment. The meeting, which was headed by Brazilian 
Environment and Legal Amazon Region Minister Rubens Ricupero, 
failed to provide an answer. 
  The developing countries reached at least two clear 
decisions: They will not accept the preservation of the 
environment as a pretext for new barriers on exports of poor 
countries. Any decision in this direction must be taken at 
multilateral forum to avoid, for example, a country like the 
United States unilaterally deciding what sort of net is best for 
fishing shrimps in Brazil. 
  In this specific case, Ricupero maintains that the 
fishermen, 
afraid of being unable sell their catch to the U.S. market, are 
prepared to pay up to $10,000 for the TED [expansion unknown] 
type of net (which has a device to free turtles) and thus 
increase the cost of their catch. Fishermen in southern Brazil, 
who do not export to the United States, see no reason for 
change. The minister disclosed that a recent survey in the 
northeastern region revealed that during 4,000 hours of fishing, 
only two turtles were caught by the nets currently used in 
Brazil. 
  Widespread complaints that rich countries are using trade as 
a tool to impose their environmental patterns prompted the 
ministers to discuss another issue: In the event of a conflict 
like that of the northeastern shrimps, who will decide if the 
U.S. argument is right or wrong? Currently nobody has that 
authority, not even the UN environment agencies, not even the 
GATT. 
  Brazil and several other countries agree that the UN 
Environment Protection Program should arbitrate: Faced with a 
commercial conflict within the GATT involving an environmental 
aspect, the organization would give a decisive scientific 
opinion.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- The government has decided not to 
continue waiting for the Constituent Congress. It has reported 
on its plans to control, through a draft bill, the use of the 
150-km-wide strip of territory along the Brazilian border with 
other countries. In accordance with the project the Strategic 
Affairs Secretariat sent to congress, any initiative for the 
border strip will have to be discussed first with the Executive 
Secretariat of the National Defense Council. [passage omitted] 
  The draft bill sent to Congress by the government 
establishes 
that the National Defense Council will have to make all 
decisions about the border strip area: be it about the purchase 
of buildings by foreigners, the demarcation of indigenous land, 
scientific expeditions, the installation of television and radio 
services, and the admittance or work of religious missions and 
nongovernmental organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Luis Garasino from Brasilia] </F>
  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has described as 
"delirious" the opinion of a Sao Paulo newspaper stating that 
the purchase of 36 Skyhawk fighter-bombers by Argentina upsets 
the regional strategic balance and puts the Brazilian Air Force 
in a position of inferiority. 
  Camilion told CLARIN that, even if the neighbor countries do 
not purchase any materiel, when the Skyhawks join our country's 
Air Force "they will barely be enough to reestablish a sort of 
regional air balance." 
  The defense minister -- who is on a five-day visit to Brazil 
-- believes it is a "very personal" opinion of the O ESTADO DE 
SAO PAULO editorialist, an opinion "that is not shared in any 
way" because "I have not received any direct or indirect 
expression of concern from the Brazilian Government areas that I 
have toured so far." 
  Camilion met Army Minister General Zenildo Gonzaga Zoroastro 
de Lucena, with whom he discussed the possibility of Brazilian 
officers joining the Argentine peacekeeping forces that are 
operating in Croatia, Cyprus, and Mozambique. Camilion will be 
received by Brazilian President Itamar Franco today. The 
Brazilian Government is concerned because some 600 U.S. soldiers 
will be deployed in Paraguay as of May. 
  During Camilion's meeting with the Army minister, they also 
discussed an increase in the exchange between the two armies at 
the level of company grade officers from operational units. 
Discussing the border security issue, Minister Camilion noted: 
"The Brazilians envy our national border police and regret the 
fact that they do not have a coast guard corps like our coast 
guard." 
  During these talks it became obvious that the southern 
border 
does not represent a concern for the Brazilian military, which 
has initiated a redeployment of their forces toward northern 
Brazil and the Amazon region. It also became obvious that 
Brazil is worried about drug trafficking but is reluctant to 
join transnational strategies to struggle against this scourge.

Russian banking delegation, representing 10 financial 
institutions, arrived in Sao Paulo in early February with the 
objective of learning a little bit of the know-how [previous

  [Excerpts] The president of the second office of the upper 
chamber, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, returned to the country on 
20 February after a trip of nearly eight days to Washington. I 
did what I could for the country; I have no further comments to 
make. These are the words he used while addressing the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] At least one chance must be 
given to the discussions I started while I was out of the 
country. We must give these discussions a chance to succeed. We 
are going to continue to work not only to find the ideal 
solution to get the country out of the crisis but.... This is 
all I have to say, I will no longer answer questions. 
  [Unidentified journalist] You said at the beginning that.... 
  [Unidentified journalist, interrupting] What was the subject 
of the discussions you held in Washington? 
  [Sansaricq] I have no more comments to make; I have no 
further comments. [passage omitted] 
  [Journalist] ...the country has the right to know what its 
president went to do in the United States. 
  [Sansaricq] Listen, I was off on a trip to the United 
States. 
I did what I could for the country. We have to wait for the 
results. 
  [Journalist] What did you do exactly, Senator? 
  [Sansaricq] I cannot answer questions. The first secretary 
[of the Senate office, Sen. Ebrane Cadet] is there; he heard my 
briefing [last word in English] on the results of my trip on 20 
February. He can answer the questions. It is a team effort. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Sen. Cadet did not provide precise information on the 
question and contented himself with stating that the country 
would experience some surprises within fewer than 24 hours. 
  Rony Mondestin says he is amazed at the label, intransigent, 
attributed to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This label would 
be more suitable for General Raoul Cedras, according to the 
senator of the North. 
  Meanwhile, Dejean Belizaire thinks the Governors Island 
agreement is outdated. Sen. Belizaire asks the Haitian head of 
state to fill the political vacuum. The following is a report by 
Daly Valet: 
  [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "Sen. Mondestin 
asserted that he does not have many problems with the plan being 
discussed in Washington but he has reservations as to the 
sequence of this plan. Like the president of the country, Gen. 
Roul Cedras should resign from the Army before the head of state 
appoints a new head of government. [sentence as heard] [passage 
omitted] 
  ``Dejean Belizaire, the president of the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion, has a different opinion than that of 
Sen. Mondestin. Belizaire thinks the president of the country 
should agree to the plan proposed to him and appoint a new head 
of government as soon as possible. Contrary to Sen. Mondestin, 
Belizaire says he opposes Gen. Cedras' resignation from the 
Haitian Army:'' 
  [Belizaire] "If I had agreed with the departure of the 
general, I would have already asked for that. I know very well 
that the Governors Island agreement is something that has 
already been exhausted. We are no longer within the scope of the 
Governors Island agreement. But I believe that today an action 
must be taken. That action is that President Aristide is 
supposed to appoint a prime minister. Let him appoint his prime 
minister. Then, after the government is established, we will see 
how we will settle the other questions." 
  [Valet] "Unlike Bernard Sansaricq, the other Senate 
president, that is, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the other quaestor, 
namely Julio Larosiliere, have not yet entered Port-au-Prince. 
  ``We can inform you that Robert Malval's resigning 
government 
has refused to acknowledge both the signature and the authority 
of the office headed by Sen. Sansaricq.'' [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega; from the </F>
"Evening Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] General Barry McCaffrey, a veteran of many wars, has 
just become the new chief of the U.S. Southern Command, 
replacing another general, George Joulwan. In his assumption of 
command speech, the new chief of this strategic territory stated 
among other things that terrorism and drug trafficking continue 
to undermine Latin American democracies. One can expect almost 
anything from a U.S. general (?on active duty) except that he be 
so misinformed. Perhaps, however, McCaffrey's remarks were part 
of the profession of faith of the bullheaded U.S. military, 
whose only current mission seems to be meddling in the internal 
affairs of other countries while always seeking a pretext to 
conceal the ploy. 
  What fundamentally undermines the democracies in America is 
the indiscriminate implementation of neoliberal policies that 
have plunged the people into edginess over poverty and the 
possibility of losing their jobs. Despite being elements of 
destabilization, terrorism and drug trafficking have less 
bearing on the internal situation of the Latin American nations 
than the adjustment plans. Moreover, if indeed drug trafficking 
and terrorism stemming from drug trafficking played a key role 
in destabilizing governments, countries such as the United 
States would carry a large share of the responsibility, 
primarily because U.S. drug demand is the greatest in the world. 
  One really has to read between the lines in McCaffrey's 
speech -- mainly when he says his purpose in the Southern 
Command is to continue establishing ties of cooperation in the 
entire Latin American region to promote and consolidate 
security. In general terms, those ties of cooperation take the 
form of dispatching U.S. troops from the Southern Command, which 
is headquartered in Panama, to various countries. Once there, 
they conduct missions of repression, such as the ones conducted 
periodically in Bolivia and other nations to eradicate the coca 
crop. 
  More often that not, U.S. soldiers conduct these tasks in 
the 
company of local troops. This is often a mere formality, 
because the one taking the lead in planning the repression is 
the U.S. side. In recent years, however, U.S. Army troops have 
tried to disguise their interventionist ploys using the pretext 
of social assistance -- namely, the construction of bridges and 
roads and the repair of this or that rural school, tasks that do 
not hide their true intentions. Today, under different 
pretexts, U.S. troops are deployed in remote and rugged areas of 
Latin American nations. The speech about cooperation does not 
deceive anyone today, because the United States has always had 
the ambition to control everything in our nations. 
  In addition, Gen. McCaffrey, whose past is linked to U.S. 
military intervention in Vietnam and Iraq, knows he is the 
appropriate figure to hold the post of chief of the Southern 
Command. Fortunately, the meddling incursions of the U.S. 
military from the Southern Command will exist for only five more 
years, because on 31 December 1999, the Torrijos-Carter treaties 
signed in 1977 should begin to take effect, which will put an 
end to the U.S. presence in Panama and will return the nation's 
interoceanic waterway to the Panamanians.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Four 
of the nine parties registered in Mexico have sent 
representatives to observe the development of the peace talks 
which began today to seek a political solution to the conflict 
in the southeastern State of Chiapas. The Mexican Democratic 
Party (PDM), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party (PVEM), and Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party (PFCRN) sent delegates to San Cristobal, 
PDM leader Marcelo Gaxiola stated. 
  The dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis, peace 
commissioner 
for peace, and the armed group that appeared in Chiapas on 1 
January began Monday morning at the Cathedral of San Cristobal, 
1,200 km southeast of Mexico City. 
  In San Cristobal, Gaxiola announced a possible "private" 
meeting between representatives of the four parties and the 19 
delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
attending the negotiations to learn about the armed group's 
demands. That meeting, Gaxiola added, would be attended only by 
one representative of the four parties, under the promise of 
respecting security instructions established for the meeting. 
  The four represented parties accepted an invitation made 
last 
week by the armed group to eight of the nine registered 
political parties to send delegates to follow the development of 
the peace talks. The PDM, excluded in the original invitation 
made in one of the communiques sent by the armed group to the 
press, was included in a later message, in which the EZLN 
presented an apology for the "omission." 
  On 27 January, delegates from the four parties signed, 
together with four other parties, a document entitled 
"Commitment for Democracy, Peace, and Justice" to promote 
democratic advancement and the reincorporation of the armed 
group into the country's politics. 
  The progovernment Institutional Revolutionary Party reported 
it expects to learn further details of the peace talks to issue 
a statement about the invitation, which was turned down by five 
political parties. The Popular Socialist Party, which did not 
sign the commitment, the National Action Party, and the 
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution declined the 
invitation because they think their struggle is political and 
unrelated to the armed alternative. The Labor Party initially 
expressed its support for the invitation, but it has abstained 
from sending delegates to San Cristobal, where the dialogue is 
being held, 51 days after the start of the conflict began with 
the takeover of towns by the armed group.

  [Text] Managua, 21 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Official sources have 
confirmed that the first direct meeting between the Nicaraguan 
Government and 3-80 Northern Front's [FN 3-80] recontra leaders, 
which was scheduled for today, Monday, has been postponed for a 
few days. Sergio Caramana, coordinator of the International 
Commission of Support and Verification-OAS (CIAV-OEA), confirmed 
the postponement to ACAN-EFE. Caramana is participating in the 
talks that will lead to the disarmament of the FN 3-80, which 
comprises mostly 400 former contra fighters. 
  Recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias "El Chacal" asked 
that this first direct meeting with the government to be 
postponed until next week. The meeting will define the 
disarmament process for the rebels operating in the northern 
region of the country. According to official sources, "El 
Chacal" justified his request by indicating that there is still 
a heavy Army presence in the northern regions bordering Honduras 
where the recontras focus their operations and where the first 
negotiation meeting was to be held. 
  The redeployment of Army forces from these areas, where 
heavy 
fighting occurred in January, was one of the rebels' demands for 
talks to begin. The recontra leader also said there were other 
minor reasons for postponing the talks, including a lack of 
communication with the rest of the FN 3-80 high command. An 
official source told ACAN-EFE that Talavera is asking for six 
more days because he has been unable to contact all of his 
forces, and therefore they do not know enough about the 
government's disarmament proposal. 
  The meeting between the government and the recontras was 
scheduled to take place in Ciudad Antigua, near Honduras, with 
the presence of a mediating commission composed of 
representatives from the Catholic Church and the OAS. Caramana 
said: "We are all working to try and overcome these last minute 
glitches." He added that despite the postponement it is the 
express will of the government and the rebels to bring the armed 
conflict, that continues to harm Nicaragua, to an end. 
  Sandinist Deputy Carlos Gallo, president of the 
Congressional 
Human Rights Commission, told ACAN-EFE the rebels have presented 
last minute demands for their disarmament. According to Gallo, 
the "recontras" demanded the creation of a safety zone or 
enclave and the concentration of military forces in 12 northern 
municipalities to be located in Nueva Segovia, Esteli, 
Matagalpa, and Jinotega. All of these communities are located 
along the Honduran border. 
  The rebels also said talks will begin seven days after the 
military redeployment process is complete. Gallo, speaking with 
ACAN-EFE, said this new element brings the talks to a 
standstill. An official source explained that members of the 
mediation commission were discussing the new conditions with the 
government and a formal response to the recontra's proposal will 
be released shortly. 
  The Army and the rebels each called their own cease-fire on 
10 February to allow the disarmament negotiations to begin. The 
recontra problem surfaced in 1990, shortly after President 
Violeta Chamorro took office. Several thousand of the 22,000 
demobilized contras took up their weapons again because the 
government failed to fulfill the demobilization agreements. 
  According to official sources, approximately 800 rearmed 
rebels, including recontras, former Sandinist soldiers known as 
recompas, and common criminals, are operating in the north and 
central regions of the country.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
allegedly held a telephone conversation with Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro. During the conversation, which lasted several minutes, 
the two leaders discussed the situation of their respective 
countries and, particularly, the commercial blockade against 
Cuba. 
  This information was published today by the Buenos Aires 
daily AMBITO FINANCIERO, which also said the contact had been 
made by a relative of Menem, of Syrian origin, who lives in 
Havana. 
  According to the press report, Menem spoke to his relative 
and after the protocol greetings, she said, "I will put you on 
to a friend" and Castro's voice appeared on the other end of the 
line. 
  Relations between Menem and Castro remain distant because 
the 
Argentine president criticizes his Cuban counterpart for not 
calling elections in the island so its inhabitants can elect 
their leaders.

  [Excerpt] Quito, Ecuador, 18 Feb (EFE) -- Argentina's 
President Carlos Menem today denied meeting ecently with Cuban 
head of state Fidel Castro. Menem said bilateral trade 
relations amount to the wine and champagne he sends the Cuban 
president and the Cuban cigars Castro sends him in return. 
  Answering an Argentine reporter during a news conference in 
Quito, Menem said: "The dialogue in question, by phone, with 
Commander Fidel Castro did not occur. I do not know where the 
story came from." 
  The president said his love for Cuba and the Cuban people is 
well known, as are his differences with Castro. 
  "Our relations are cutting and dry when we meet. I ask him 
to democratize Cuba and he says Cuba is already democratic. We 
do not agree. But beyond our differences, we are friends. He 
sends me Cuban cigars and I send him wine and champagne. That 
is the only trade exchange we have with Cuba," Menem said, 
laughing. 
  He added, however, that his country is currently purchasing 
Cuban meningitis vaccines and that some Argentine entrepreneurs 
are selling some products on the Caribbean island. 
  "The U.S. blockade is imposed exclusively by the United 
States. Cuba has a more or less fluid exchange with the rest of 
the world," Menem added. 
  "I speak with Commander Castro during Iberoamerican summits, 
but not on the phone," Menem insisted. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Itamar Franco, who spent a week out of 
Brasilia, returned to his office in Planalto Palace but his stay 
in this capital will be short because he is scheduled to make 
four trips in the next 10 days. 
  Presidential spokesman Francisco Baker denied the president 
of the Republic is thinking of resigning to run for election. 
  Baker remarked that Franco cannot run for a seat in the 
Senate, as a Brasilia daily reported last weekend, because he is 
not affiliated with any political party. Moreover, the deadline 
to become affiliated expired in early January. 
  President Franco will only be at Planalto Palace a few days 
this week because on 24 February he will travel to Caxias do 
Sul, where on 25 February he will open the grape harvest. On 26 
February, he will travel to Porto Alegre, where he is scheduled 
to meet Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares; from there he 
will go to Canoas, where he will dedicate the expansion of the 
(Aupec Pascualinho) refining plant. On 27 February, Franco will 
travel to Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, to attend the 
launching of General Motors' economy model, (Costa). 
  Franco will return to Brasilia on 28 February after the 
launching ceremony, but he will only remain here a few days. 
  On 3 March, he is supposed to leave for Guaira, near 
Caracas, 
Venezuela to discuss issues related to border affairs, gold 
diggers, and the preservation of the environment.

  [Text] Diplomats who attended the ALADI [Inter-American 
Integration Association] meeting of foreign ministers in 
Montevideo on 11 February told EL OBSERVADOR that the Brazilian 
proposal to establish a South American Free Trade Zone met with 
a cold reception. 
  The proposal was officially announced by Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim. It calls for the gradual lifting of 
customs tariffs in South American countries until a total 
liberalization of regional trade is achieved by 2005. 
  The same sources added that although the Brazilian proposal 
was not rejected, there was no enthusiasm for this new Latin 
American integration proposal in the short term. 
  The foreign ministers of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] countries will discuss this issue in their next meeting 
scheduled for March in Buenos Aires. They will also discuss the 
state of negotiations toward a common Mercosur customs tariff 
and the Brazilian proposal. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu did not comment on 
the issue but specified that the Brazilian proposal does not 
contradict Mercosur. 
  The foreign ministers attending the ALADI meeting avoided 
any 
specific comment on the eventual establishment of free trade 
zone in the short term. They reasserted their willingness to 
strengthen regional integration. 
  In a speech he delivered on 11 February at the ALADI 
meeting, 
the Argentine representative stressed the need to strengthen 
Latin American integration. He specified, however, that 
subregional organizations must first be enhanced. 
  If the Brazilian proposal is to be implemented on the same 
terms as those explained by Foreign Minister Amorim, 
negotiations should be undertaken this year so that the 10-year 
timetable for the elimination of custom tariffs may begin by 
1995.

  [Editorial Report] Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish on 16 
February publishes on page 40 a 500-word unattributed article 
which views an ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
report on foreign trade and social and economic indicators of 
its member countries. The article notes that ALADI global 
exports grew by 5 percent last year -- totalling $122 billion -- 
represents "a 76-percent increase compared to 1986." The 
article continues: "Notwithstanding this sharp increase" ALADI 
exports still represent 3.2 percent of world exports, "which 
have remained static for the last seven years." 
  The article reports that imports increased 8 percent in the 
same period -- totaling $135 million -- and that ALADI countries 
always registered "a balance of trade surplus" until 1992, when 
they registered an $8-billion deficit. 
  The article comments: "ALADI's leading economic partners are 
the United States, which accounts for 37 percent of all exports; 
the EEC, with 23 percent; and Japan, with 6 percent." Trade 
within ALADI member countries accounts for 15 percent of total 
exports. 
  ALADI's chief exports are manufactured goods, food, 
beverages, and tobacco. The ALADI report states that member 
countries' GDP grew by 3.3 percent in 1993 and that per capita 
GDP amounted to $2,150. 
  The report concludes: "The economies of most countries of 
the 
region registered, for the third consecutive year, an increase 
in activity, a relative stability in domestic prices, an easing 
off of their debt service, and a considerable inflow of foreign 
capital."

  [Text] On 22 February, Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban Ambassador 
in Geneva, accused the United States of manipulating freedom of 
expression with its monopoly of media outlets. During the 50th 
session of the UN Human Rights Commission, the Cuban diplomat 
gave the example of the exposure to radiation on unsuspecting 
subjects. Over a decade ago experiments were conducted on 
retarded individuals. This was only made known last month. Perez 
Novoa stressed that there are no guarantees that other human 
rights violations cases are kept quiet within the so-called 
freedom of speech of the United States. 
  The UN Human Rights Commission has yet to vote on racism and 
xenophobia, increasing phenomenons in Europe.

  [Text] While participating in the ceremony marking the 
fourth anniversary of the Cuban-Chinese friendship cooperative 
for agriculture and livestock production in the municipality of 
Cifuentes in Villa Clara, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Xu Yicong 
said that bilateral relations with Cuba are developing 
satisfactorily for both countries. We have many reasons to seek 
the strengthening of Cuban-Chinese relations of friendship and 
cooperation, because the two countries have the same principles 
and ideals uniting us closely, Xu Yicong said. 
  The Chinese ambassador added that political relations 
between 
the two countries are also growing closer every day, trade is 
increasing, and economic cooperation is developing quickly. He 
said that the Joint Commission for Cuban-Chinese Cooperation 
will meet in March in Havana to study trade prospects between 
the two nations. 
  In Santa Clara, Xu Yicong visited the installation of what 
will be the largest Cuban bicycle factory with Chinese 
technology. This factory will be able to produce 150,000 units 
annually.

  [Text] Before leaving our country for Venezuela, Manuel 
Hermoso Rojas, president of the government of the autonomous 
community of the Canary Islands, signed a cooperation agreement. 
  A letter of intent, which represents great prospects for the 
possibility of developing cooperation in various areas, was 
signed today at the Minrex [Ministry of Foreign Relations] by 
Manuel Hermoso Rojas, president of the government of the Canary 
Islands, and Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the 
Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers. 
  The agreement provides for the display and trade of products 
and for support to Cuba for the development of its activities in 
Spain and the European Economic Community. Referring to the 
significance of the agreement, Hermoso Rojas said: 
  [Begin recording] Today we are signing an agreement which 
concludes one more of the many talks we have been holding over 
the past few days concerning possible cooperation between Cuba 
and the Canary Islands. I have to say that every time we had to 
discuss a concrete issue, immense possibilities for cooperation 
emerged. The great tradition prevailing between the peoples of 
Cuba and the Canary Islands has been maintained. The people of 
the Canary Islands have been something peculiar to Spain in that 
they have been known as the islanders of Cuba [sentence as 
heard]. And we islanders have come with the purpose of 
cooperating. The agreements are no longer restricted to culture, 
but are also extended to the universities, to commercial 
relations, and, I hope, they will also be extended to the area 
of tourism. [end recording] 
  Before the signing of the agreement, the president of the 
Canary Islands Government held a meeting with Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina, during which they discussed subjects 
of mutual interest.

  [Excerpts] After an official six-day visit to Cuba, Manuel 
Hermoso Rojas, the president of the government of the autonomous 
community of the Canary Islands, and his delegation departed 
today for Venezuela. At the Jose Marti International Airport, 
the Canarian delegation was greeted by Jose Ramon Fernandez, 
vice president of the Council of Ministers, and Vice Foreign 
Minister Isabel Allende Karem. Jose Antonio San Gil, Spanish 
ambassador to Cuba, and other Cuban personalities were also 
present at the ceremony. [passage omitted] 
  The last day of President Manuel Hermoso Rojas' official 
visit to Cuba began early in the morning at the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations. The visitors were met by Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina, who conversed with the visitors. 
President Manuel Hermoso Rojas thanked him for the hospitality 
shown during his visit and expressed a desire to meet with 
Robaina in the Canary Islands. Afterwards, Manuel Hermoso Rojas 
and Jose Ramon Fernandez signed a letter of intent which, among 
other items, includes the development of bilateral trade and the 
search, by Canarian authorities, for financing for financial 
projects in Cuba. In that area, next month, the Canarian 
Government will send a group of specialists to evaluate possible 
schemes of cooperation with Cuba. 
  In a news conference, President Hermoso Rojas referred to 
the 
possibility of cooperation between the governments of Cuba and 
Canary Islands: 
  [Begin recording] The Canary Islands is an enclave with very 
important ties with all of Europe. We believe that the Canary 
Islands can be an important platform of distribution to Latin 
America and Cuba of not only Canarian production but all 
products that could be received from Europe. The Canary Islands 
have industries that, because of the traditional characteristics 
of the Cuban and Canarian people, will allow for good contacts 
and business relations, especially in the 
agricultural-industrial sector. [end recording]

participants in the fourth Cuban-Spanish bilateral committee of 
economic cooperation. This committee will make use of innovative 
means to increase economic relations -- specifically, in the 
granting of credits, on the Spanish side -- and the 
diversification of areas in which permission for investments are 
granted in Cuba, including mixed enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  The bilateral committee is responsible for establishing the 
path of trade between the two countries. Tonight the committee 
has come out in favor of intervening in the balancing of the 
internal finances of our country. In our opinion, the response 
of our entrepreneurs should be greater imagination and 
aggressiveness.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Carlos Martinez 
Salsamendi, the president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, has 
reported here that Cuba registered more than 500 foreign 
corporations and 112 joint enterprises as of the end of 1993. 
Martinez Salsamendi said that 78 new corporations joined the 
chamber last year. He made the announcement during a meeting 
with businessmen from the Canary Islands. The business leader 
also said that 28 of the joint enterprises are engaged in 
tourism activities. 
  During the meeting, the businessmen and entrepreneurs from 
the Canary Islands expressed their interest in doing business 
with Cuba. The group is accompanying President Manuel Hermoso of 
the Government of the Canary Islands, who began a six-day 
official visit to Cuba on Friday. This is the third trip by a 
Spanish autonomous government leader to the island, following 
tours by Gallaecian President Manuel Fraga Iribarne and Asturian 
leader Juan Luis Rodriguez Vigil in 1991.

Forces to support the conservation of unused agricultural 
equipment. In this extensive territory that comprises five 
provinces, thousands of tractors and trucks that have been 
paralyzed because of the lack of fuel and spare parts or as a 
consequence of the recent transformations that have taken place 
in agricultural industry will be properly maintained to prevent 
their deterioration and to ensure operation when circumstances 
permit. Contacts have been made between delegations of the 
Ministry of Agriculture in Matanzas, Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, 
Sancti Spiritus, and Ciego de Avila, so that, in the near 
future, classes can be held to demonstrate the proper 
maintenance of agricultural equipment.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], which 
comprises naval, air, and land forces, has decided to achieve 
self-financing without neglecting their combat capabilities. In 
this regard, the initial results reflect the future fulfillment 
of this goal. 
  For three decades, the FAR obtained all of its weapons, 
spare 
parts, and training by way of donations or purchases at modest 
prices. The collpase of the Soviet Union, however, eliminated 
the main source of supplies to the Cuban armed institution. In 
light of this, the FAR's High Command had to draw up emergency 
plans to continue operating without greatly affecting the 
nation's diminished budget. The past three years have marked a 
time of hard work for the FAR to place itself in an adequate 
position to resolve the harsh limitations of resources that the 
nation in general is facing. 
  As a first step, the High Command designed a program to 
reduce surplus equipment and to rationalize several types of 
armed forces, particularly the air forces and Cuban 
Revolutionary Navy forces that have been incorporated into the 
ground forces. Under the guidance of the High Command, experts, 
and its best technicians, the FAR initiated a conservation 
process by which a sizable number of rifles, aircraft, and other 
materiel were demobilized and subsequently preserved. These are 
being kept in appropriate places until the nation can purchase 
the necessary fuel. 
  The High Command also encouraged the search for initiatives 
among lower and mid-level officers to use the remaining supplies 
to keep the equipment combat ready. This, however, is being 
carried out with a minimum of fuel, lubricants, ammunition, and 
spare parts. Meanwhile, the FAR developed the production of food 
supplies, except for salt and sugar. Currently, it can be said 
that all of the units in the nation are self-sufficient in rice, 
an indispensable item in every Cuban's diet. 
  Our nation's military personnel are also very involved in 
mariculture in an attempt to secure sources of protein in their 
daily diets, in addition to the cultivation of plants for 
therapeutic uses that make up 70 percent of the medicines used 
by the units. In this way, the Cuban FAR is trying to become 
one of the less costly institutions of its type in the world for 
the public [word indistinct]. This will help reduce 
expenditures in the Cuban state's limited budget.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Political, Economic Situation and Finances"; </F>
for related reporting on this topic see FBIS-LAT-94-016 p. 3] 
  [Text] The first discussions have begun among labor union 
leaders and workers to analyze the country's economic situation 
and the way the resulting financial imbalance is affecting it. 
  In this process, it is clear that the basic intent is to 
examine, from the standpoint of each workplace, the true causes 
of economic inefficiency and its impact on the financial 
imbalances, and to suggest methods of combining economic and 
political considerations in the actions the country must 
undertake. 
  Stimulated by the call of their union leaders, the workers 
must be cognizant of their active role in the country's economic 
reorganization, and must be willing to accept the financial 
measures that are ultimately adopted, even if they involve some 
sacrifice. 
  It is obvious in these discussions that the most important 
thing in our economy is to be efficient in every possible way, 
and the only reasonable means of achieving that goal is to cut 
costs, boost labor productivity, and get the most out of the 
inputs we have. 
  With the authority of those who do not abandon their posts, 
the speakers are demanding more than ever before that we 
maintain a high degree of labor discipline, which at a time like 
this depends on attitude, awareness of social duty, and 
patriotism. What is at stake, more than anything else, is the 
defense of the workers' most genuine interests. 
  We must not wait for any external measure, but must adopt 
those measures we can implement right now to make our economy 
more effective. Those measures are in areas where we have raw 
materials and where the productive processes have not been 
halted and top-quality service is being provided for the 
country: the sugar harvest, sugarcane and agricultural 
production, fishing, mining and mineral processing, tourism, 
pharmaceuticals, science centers, and vital activities such as 
health and education, among others. 
  Few imaginable financial proposals do not involve real or 
apparent conflicts of interest or differences of opinion. 
  Thus, when a worker proposes to raise the prices of certain 
products, another worker may remind him that there are 
relatively low wages in a wide range of occupations, while a 
third may argue that it would be better to accept increases in 
certain items that the family budget can afford rather than 
having to pay for vital services such as education and health, 
which are difficult to pay for on an individual basis. 
ks it is better to give subsidies to low-income people than to 
subsidize the sale of products at below-cost prices, another 
will explain how difficult and complex such subsidy mechanisms 
are. 
  Among the workers' concerns are the intolerable presence of 
crime, its relationship to the black market, and its impact on 
social and labor discipline. The workers want to find ways of 
eliminating the theft and diversions that are driving up costs, 
demoralizing the collectives, and enriching money hoarders and 
traffickers. They demand that the authorities take drastic 
measures that will set an example at all levels. 
  In connection with the above, they have expressed the need 
to 
readjust and properly enforce the financial requirements for 
collections and payments between enterprises. The present 
situation is in fact promoting a lack of discipline and may 
actually cover up crime. In any event, the workers and their 
unions must monitor efforts in the field to solve this problem. 
  Another frequent topic of discussion is the tax system: what 
it consists of, how it may be expanded, what economic activities 
may be sources of additional funding for the state, and how 
citizens can increase their support for it. 
  These and other issues are debated. The fact is that the 
workers are fully involved in the consideration and solution of 
the problems that affect them the most. 
  After four years of heroic resistance, the people of Cuba 
are 
entering a phase that is in significant ways more aggressive in 
the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of the fatherland and 
the socialist nature of the revolution. 
  It is hoped that in 1994, signs of economic recovery will be 
seen in some vital activities and areas of production, thanks to 
the process of financial adjustment based on a high degree of 
political consensus. 
  Once again, we hail the wisdom of the National People's 
Government Assembly in postponing decisionmaking and 
categorically denying that the intent is to formulate a 
so-called "packet of measures." 
  The truth is that the idea of a "packet of measures" smacks 
of Third World capitalism, of neoliberal policies under which 
the workers wake up one day to the news that prices have 
skyrocketed, enterprises are being privatized and half the 
employees are to be laid off, wages are falling, and social 
benefits have been abruptly eliminated. 
  Reality forces us to make an economic adjustment, but we 
will 
do it in the socialist way, the Cuban way, with democratic 
formulas that are truly unimaginable for other societies. 
  We are aware, of course, that the harsh situation of an 
economy that has had to withstand devastating blows, as ours 
has, causes many people to lose their patience and to yearn for 
"rescue measures." 
  Considering the complexity of our problems, however, we 
realize that it is naive to expect that measures can act like a 
magic wand, graciously granting every wish. 
  We urgently need to improve our economic efficiency, but we 
must not rush into technical solutions without first reconciling 
them with their political repercussions. 
  Hence the importance of continuing to expand and improve 
this 
democratic and educational process that is so aptly named the 
Workplace Parliament, without allowing the slightest hint of 
ritual or formalism to taint it. 
  The workers' voice must be heard loud and clear everywhere. 
  It is imperative that management be forthcoming with 
accurate 
information so that the economic and financial situation of each 
workplace can be assessed. 
  Trade union leaders must devote their energies to carrying 
out this lofty political task, the true path to the economic 
efficiency that Cuba needs to triumph.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Packet of Measures We Should Adopt"; for </F>
related reporting on this topic see FBIS-LAT-94-016 pp. 4, 5] 
  [Text] The Cubans, who, as we have said more than once in 
these editorials, possess wonderful virtues, may sometimes allow 
themselves to be overcome by a defect summed up in the popular 
expression, "lamp in the street, darkness at home." 
  Thus, there now may be labor collectives full of the most 
diverse and well-reasoned opinions on the steps our government 
should take to straighten out the country's finances, yet they 
have given little thought to the problems, weaknesses, and 
errors that plague their own daily work. 
  This seems to be a good time, then, to emphasize the 
importance of the first point on the agenda of the Workplace 
Parliament assemblies. It is none other than the economic and 
financial problems of each particular place. We have already 
observed in the initial preparatory meetings a tendency to 
devote less energy and time to debating internal affairs, and to 
pay more attention to the exchange of opinions on what the 
entire country should be doing. It would be a mistake to be 
taken in by the false notion that the second point is more 
important, while the first one is just a formality with no 
practical purpose. 
  The financial imbalances that currently affect the national 
economy can only be solved by taking action on both sides of the 
supply-demand pair, and it is in workplaces where supply is 
created. It is also there, given the difference between what is 
spent and what is received from selling services or products, 
where the scale can be tipped toward one side or the other of 
the aforementioned pair. 
  Thus, the most decisive measures will not be the general 
ones 
taken to eliminate the consequences of the financial imbalance, 
but rather those that are undertaken to eliminate the cause of 
it, which is basically the fact that in the past few years there 
has been much more money than goods circulating in the national 
economy. If we were to take only general measures to reduce 
excess demand by removing money from circulation, we would not 
solve the underlying problem. The real solution lies in 
achieving a proper balance between what is produced and what is 
spent at the workplace. 
  For this reason, it would be illogical to have a brilliant 
discussion at an enterprise, establishment, or shop, with 
impressive knowledge of the cause and laudable proposals for 
what the country should do to improve its finances, and then to 
have a discussion of internal affairs that involved no pain and 
no gain, or rather, more pain than gain. 
  Just as we reject the idea of a "packet of measures" hitting 
the entire national economy at once, with equal fervor we appeal 
today to all workers, to their union leaders, and to managers to 
draw up their plans for the economic and financial 
reconditioning of each unit. 
  For this purpose, any self-respecting management should 
present to the assembly a true economic analysis of the 
operation of the workplace, including specific proposals for 
making improvements. 
  This report should not be written by anyone other than the 
principal administrator of the unit. 
  The purpose of the report is to spark a debate and to 
propose 
courses of action. Therefore, the kind of account that is full 
of incomprehensible jargon and weighed down with details that 
hide the essential truth, the kind that is bred naturally by 
incompetence, is to be avoided. 
  These reports should avoid taking a tone of either self-pity 
or praise; otherwise, the assemblies would become mere 
recitations of calamities, or celebrations of partial success. 
In neither case would they address the issue of what could have 
been done better and what failed to be done. 
  We caution that, from the standpoint of the workers and 
their 
union representatives, efficiency is not always indicated by the 
fulfillment of the plan. We know full well that there are plans 
that are rotten with paternalism, whose figures take into 
account not only limitations on raw materials, energy, and labor 
resources, but also major components of administrative 
inefficiency that we are trying to combat. 
  It is important for workers, when discussing the first point 
on the agenda of the Workplace Parliament assemblies, not to 
allow the debate to get off track and focus on the impact other 
workplaces have on their own. In one of the initial meetings, we 
saw workers bitterly blaming the suppliers of a certain raw 
material, while little or nothing was said of the well-known 
fact that large quantities of that valuable and scarce resource 
tend to be lost somewhere between the warehouse and the assembly 
line. 
  These discussions also must be protected from the tendency 
to 
complain about the prices that are paid for certain goods and 
services. Without denying that there are errors in the setting 
of some prices, the fact is that real efficiency is not achieved 
by demanding better prices, but by cutting costs. 
  And it is precisely this issue of costs, together with the 
quantity and quality of production and services, that should lie 
at the heart of the plan to be adopted at each workplace to 
improve economic efficiency. 
  It is possible that not every place will have a cost system 
that allows for an analysis based on the economic performance of 
a workplace. Therefore, the first agreement, the first measure 
that must be taken in these places, is precisely to create such 
an instrument to at least indicate the principal expenditures 
involved in every peso of goods produced. Beyond the limitations 
imposed by the current economic situation in many centers, what 
lies behind those unmeasured expenses is order or disorder, 
discipline or laxity, rigor or leniency, controlling resources 
or diverting them, talent or mediocrity in the administration, a 
spirit of struggle or a sense of indifference, responsibility or 
negligence, shoddiness or excellence. 
  Hence the importance of the first point on the agenda of the 
Workplace Parliament assemblies that will take place in tens of 
thousands of production or service units. 
  If each one of these places takes a step forward, a great 
deal of progress can be made merely by compounding positive 
actions. 
  Then the influence of the overall measures, those taken all 
over the country, will be felt in the best possible way. These 
measures can be truly effective only if action is taken in the 
workplace.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has declared that the 
FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] is denouncing 
the electoral process because it feels it will be defeated in 
the general March elections. It is unacceptable that they are 
denouncing at this time the possibility of fraud in an event 
which, like the elections, is still being organized. "We are all 
observing how the Supreme Electoral Tribunal is working and to 
report fraud is rather ridiculous. I am inclined to think that 
what the FMLN is seeking is international publicity," the 
president stated. 
  Cristiani recalled that the Mission of UN Observers for El 
Salvador (Onusal) is overseeing the process. "Perhaps the FMLN 
already feels defeated," he stressed. Meanwhile, Cristiani 
rejected FMLN statements that the government had not consulted 
with it on the recent Peace Culture Forum. FMLN Coordinator 
Shafik Handal said "the Peace Culture Forum, organized by the 
government in coordination with UNESCO, lacks legal validity 
because the FMLN was not taken into consideration during its 
planning." 
  President Cristiani stressed that "the government did not 
need to consult with a particular sector on all its actions. In 
the case of the FMLN, consultations could have been made during 
the peace negotiations, but that is over now. FMLN members have 
formed a political party, like other groups, and must act 
accordingly. Let Shafik Handal make a big fuss, poor Shafik, but 
the government should not have to inform him of every one of its 
actions," the president highlighted. 
  Cristiani pointed out that the organization of the Peace 
Forum was supported by different groups. He added that even an 
international assembly held last year in Salvador Bahia, Brazil, 
agreed to support El Salvador in holding that event. Cristiani 
made the aforementioned statements at the Camino Real Hotel, 
after participating in the inauguration of the National Seminar 
of Science and Technology, organized by the National Council of 
Science and Technology with the assistance of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of El Salvador.

  [Excerpts] (Francisco Jovel Roberto Roca), one of the 
highest leaders of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front], has claimed that weapons seized from the FMLN during the 
war have turned up in Chiapas State, Mexico. In addition, he 
noted his concern that those weapons will fuel crime and 
international gunrunning. "We continue to insist the government 
has not given a satisfactory explanation of the weapons, 
thousands of rifles and other war material, it seized from the 
FMLN, which the Army has not shown nor have they allowed the 
government to have some control over the number of weapons," 
Roca indicated. Regarding FMLN concerns, he said "for us, that 
is very dangerous because we have learned that weapons of that 
kind were found in Chiapas. Weapons that the Army reported 
capturing from the FMLN have turned up elsewhere. We are 
concerned that those weapons are serving to fuel gunrunning in 
the region." [passage omitted] Roca affirmed international 
institutions share the FMLN concerns. "We have talked at length 
with different government representatives. We insist, however, 
that the Salvadoran Government, in a stubborn manner that does 
not contribute to peace, is refusing to allow an inspection of 
those weapons." FMLN leaders dismissed reports it supplied 
weapons to Mexico's Zapatist National Liberation Army. [passage 
omitted] 
  Roca also denied there are armed groups unhappy with the 
elections results. Commenting on this matter, he noted that 
"they can say anything, but the truth has prevailed over any 
kind of campaign they may conduct along those lines. There are 
no weighty reasons that can justify the government's 
speculation. It will be just the opposite because the elections 
will hand the FMLN a significant share of institutional power, 
if not the majority, in the political environment, and just 
about all those who were active during the war and the many 
thousands who have joined the FMLN now as a political force know 
that." 
  Roca reiterated that the weapons topic is "simply and 
plainly 
a propaganda tactic used to hurt the Front at the polls. In 
fact, they, the ones who are orchestrating this campaign, know 
full well that what they are saying is a big lie, but these 
people are used to conducting campaigns on what they refer to as 
psychological warfare. They have not given up on that effort, 
which is regrettable, is it not?"

  [Text] Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN 
secretary general, yesterday said that the international 
community's contribution is important to the solution of a 
conflict or the strengthening of peace. 
  Nevertheless, he added that internal efforts should also 
exist, such as the strengthening of civilian society through the 
mobilization of intellectuals, the establishment of independent 
and impartial media, associated networks for education in human 
rights, and the formation of democratic citizens. 
  At the outstanding congress "International Contribution for 
the Culture of Peace," Perez noted that foreign contributions 
should not only be through the sending of peacekeeping forces, 
rather it should also include assistance to the communities for 
economic, social, and cultural development. Last Wednesday Dr. 
Perez, who was honored with the "Jose Matias Delgado" order by 
President Alfredo Cristiani for his contributions to peace in El 
Salvador, said: "True peace can only be based on the 
elimination of the injustice that unleashed and later fueled 
violence." 
  During his speech, the Peruvian recalled the occasion when 
the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front] concluded their negotiations in New York on 31 December, 
20 minutes after his mandate as UN secretary general expired. 
Several weeks later, this led to the signing of the Peace 
Agreements in Chapultepec, Mexico. Perez explained: "What is 
currently needed is for El Salvador to immediately become the 
spokesperson for peace beyond its borders and to use the painful 
memories of its own sufferings to help other nations avoid or 
remedy the same. It is not a matter of denying the existence of 
or the unavoidability of differences. Rather, it is a matter of 
showing the bloody world of the former Yugoslavia, or the Middle 
East, or Africa, that peace is the sole viable solution; not the 
peace of the cemeteries nor of tyrants." 
  The former UN secretary general noted that the true 
international contribution to the culture of peace is the one 
that shows respect for human rights founded on justice, liberty, 
coexistence, and civil cooperation. 
  The First International Forum on the Culture of Peace held 
in 
the country between 16-18 February, assembled 14 nations that 
are currently engaged in armed conflicts as protagonists, 80 
nations as observers in addition to local and foreign 
organizations. The event -- organized by the government and 
UNESCO -- was a success despite the inconveniences, Cecilia 
Gallardo de Cano, education minister said yesterday. "In 
education and culture one cannot be totally satisfied, but we 
are excited because it surpassed all expectations. What is 
important is that a culture of peace be created," she added. 
  The forum was criticized by some opposition political 
parties 
as they considered the date on which it was held was not timely 
as the elections are at the doorstep and because of the 
limitations imposed on the media.

<F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Opposition deputies today agreed that the U.S. 
Congress' decision to withhold economic aid for El Salvador 
Congress is unfair. Congressman John Joseph Moakley announced 
that the United States will withhold $20 million of annual aid 
to pressure the Salvadoran Government to investigate a sizable 
swindle conducted by a domestic bank. 
  The opposition deputies do not agree with the U.S. Congress' 
decision to withhold aid in light of a swindle that took place 
in a domestic bank more than six years ago. Jorge Avear of the 
PDC [Christian Democratic Party] and Guillermo Guevara of the 
MAS [Authentic Christian Movement] agreed that it is regrettable 
that a private matter has a bearing on such U.S. decisions, 
because this falls outside the purview of foreign policy. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] What happens in a 
bank is clearly a financial matter; it is not related to the 
central government's actions. It does not seem logical to me to 
say that because this incident took place and has not been 
cleared up that economic aid should be suspended. It is not 
fair, suitable, or appropriate for an entire nation to be 
punished by denying the aid it needs because of a private matter 
that, to a great extent, is criminal in nature. [end recording] 
  The $30 million swindle took place at a domestic bank when 
the PDC was in power. In the case, the swindle involved a 
number of companies, including some shrimp harvesting companies, 
that received credits without giving any guarantees when the 
financial system was controlled by the state. This situation 
prompted the suspension of U.S. aid to El Salvador, according to 
Congressman Moakley. Deputy Juan Jose Martell said this 
situation exposes a larger problem. 
  [Begin recording] [Deputy Juan Jose Martell] [words 
indistinct] a problem, $20 million are retained. Our nation's 
problem is a banking system that does not operate properly. [end 
recording] 
  In Martell's opinion the swindle places the national 
financial system -- which, by the way, he does not consider 
reliable -- in a difficult position. According to Martell, this 
is not the first time that incidents such as these have taken 
place, recalling the fraud committed by [word indistinct] 
against the Salvadoran banking system.

  [Text] On Tuesday at the cathedral of San Cristobal de las 
Casas, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and members of 
the Zapatist National Liberation Front [EZLN] continued their 
negotiations behind closed doors. The dialogue is moving forward 
and the prospects for resolving the conflict are good. 
  At a news conference, San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
announced the EZLN had presented its list of demands to the 
federal government's representative, who in turn provided broad 
answers. Ruiz, however, did not disclose any of the EZLN's 
specific requests. 
  Meanwhile, Subcommander Marcos explained the reasons for his 
struggle. He criticized society for having forgotten the Indian 
community and asked society to remain at the EZLN's side. 
  When his turn came to speak, Commissioner Camacho said the 
only way to resolve Chiapas' problems is by strengthening the 
Republic's institutions. He pointed out that a peaceful solution 
for Chiapas will be found in new answers for the state, not only 
for the EZLN but for society as a whole.

  [Text] Subcommander Marcos has admitted he is the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] general commander. Well, at 
least this is what Manuel Camacho [the commissioner for peace 
and reconciliation in Chiapas] called him. Commander Marcos, or 
subcommander if you prefer, who has become a full-fledged 
legend, today answered questions posed by domestic and 
international reporters during a news conference that lasted 
nearly two hours. 
  Today, Commander Marcos got up early, invited radio 
reporters 
to come over to the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, and 
talked with them from 0700 to 0900. The subcommander said he 
would talk about any issue presented by reporters, but he ended 
up saying what he wanted. He asserted that the achievement of 
democracy in Mexico has to start with the will of the entire 
nation and that national issues cannot be agreed upon at the San 
Cristobal de las Casas bargaining table. In this way, the 
subcommander changed his position from the one he held after the 
first peace and reconciliation meeting. At that time, and 
contrary to Camacho's position, Marcos stated that 
national-level issues would be included in the agenda. It seems 
Camacho has won yet another point.

  [Text] Federico Reyes Heroles, editor of the monthly 
magazine ESTE PAIS, recently sent us the results of a public 
opinion poll sponsored by the magazine he heads together with 
Mr. Miguel Basanes. According to the poll, which was prepared by 
the Mexican consulting firm Moti, four basic questions were 
posed to people throughout the Mexican Republic. The poll was 
conducted in the Federal District, Monterrey, Guadalajara, 
Tijuana, and Merida 
  The questions included: 
  1. Who do you prefer most, Manuel Camacho Solis or Luis 
Donaldo Colosio? 
  2. What is your opinion with respect to Zapatist National 
Liberation Army leader Subcommander Marcos? 
  3. Which of the presidential candidates do you expect to 
vote 
for on 21 August 1994? 
  4. Do you believe the people's vote will be respected in the 
upcoming elections? 
  This random-sample poll was conducted on 11 February, and, 
according to the fax sent by Federico Reyes Heroles, the 
interviews were conducted in person and publicly. The poll was 
sponsored by the monthly magazine ESTE PAIS, and it included 
interviews with 320 people. The margin of error is 
approximately 6 percent with a 90 percent statistical 
reliability. 
  Let us take a look at what the public had to say with 
respect 
to the four questions I already mentioned. 
  First, who do you like the most, Camacho or Colosio? In 
addition to this question, the respondents were also asked to 
which political party they belonged or sympathized most. Nearly 
43 percent of those who selected Luis Donaldo Colosio replied 
that they were members or supporters of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], while 23 percent indicated that they 
liked Camacho as well as Colosio. In addition, 18 percent 
pointed out that they preferred Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Meanwhile, 
11 percent of those who said they were PRI members or supported 
the party stated they did not like either man. 
  Of the 320 people polled, there were also those who said 
they 
were either supporters or members of the National Action Party 
[PAN]. Here, we begin to observe drastic changes in preferences 
toward Camacho and Colosio. Of the PAN members interviewed, 18 
percent expressed more inclination toward Manuel Camacho Solis, 
while 16 percent stated their preference for Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. At the same time, 34 percent of the PAN members 
interviewed expressed equal support for both men, while 32 
percent said they did not support either. 
  Finally, 17 percent of the PRI members and supporters polled 
said they preferred Camacho, 11 percent said they preferred 
Colosio, 23 percent said they liked both men equally, and 43 
percent indicated they did not like either. 
  The poll also included some citizens who did not identify 
themselves with any political party. Of this group, 16 percent 
said they preferred Luis Donaldo Colosio, 12 percent selected 
Manuel Camacho Solis, 34 percent said they liked both men 
equally, and 30 percent said the did not approve of either. 
  While it is quite interesting to note how the Mexican people 
feel with respect to Manuel Camacho Solis and Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, according to this poll released by ESTE PAIS magazine, 
there are still three more questions to consider. 
  The people polled were also asked their opinion of 
Subcommander Marcos. Overall, 30 percent of those interviewed 
said they held a poor opinion of Subcommander Marcos, 27 percent 
said they did not have a good or bad opinion, 24 percent said 
they had a favorable opinion, and 19 percent said they did not 
know. 
  With respect to the third question of how each person polled 
would vote on 21 August, 35 percent said they did not yet know 
or did not want to say, 33 percent said they planned to vote for 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, 17 percent said they planned to vote for 
PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos, and 14 percent said 
they intended to vote for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution. 
  What is really interesting in all of this is that, if we 
compare this poll with earlier polls, we observe several things: 
First, Luis Donaldo Colosio's popularity has increased from 28 
percent to 33 percent. Second, PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de 
Zevallo's popularity has increased dramatically from 11 percent 
to 17 percent. Meanwhile, Cuauthemoc Cardenas' popularity has 
fallen noticeably from 11 percent to 14 percent. I repeat, all 
of this is in relation to an earlier poll conducted on 11 
February. 
  In conclusion, let us examine the results of the final 
question as to whether or not the election results will be 
respected. What do you think the people answered? Of those 
polled, 43 percent indicated that they did not believe the 
election results would be respected, 34 percent said they 
believed the results would indeed be respected, 17 percent did 
not answer, and 8 percent said they did not know. Interesting, 
huh?

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 22 
February. 
  At a meeting with Mexican and foreign businessmen in 
Guadalajara, Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra said that foreign 
investments in Mexico in the past five years amount to over $40 
billion. He noted that in 1993, $15.6 billion entered Mexico in 
the form of capital investments. (Mexico City Canal 13 
Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  According to financial experts, in the past five years, the 
purchasing power of the Mexican currency dropped by 65.7 
percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2042 GMT 15 Feb 94) 
  According to a report presented by the Finance and Public 
Credit Secretariat, in 1993 Mexico had an 
8.243-billion-new-pesos surplus, or 0.7 percent of the GNP. 
This allowed the government to reduce its public debt. (Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 16 
Feb 94) 
  According to a report by Finance and Public Credit 
Secretariat, Mexico's foreign debt at the end of December 1993 
was $78.747 billion. This represents 21.4 percent of the 
country's GNP. The foreign debt of the public sector was 
reduced by $346.2 million. The domestic debt was $40.8184 
billion, showing a 24.4 reduction when compared to December 1992 
figures. Government expenditures on the social sector at the 
end of 1993 were $34.265 billion -- 10 percent more than the 
previous year. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2053 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has reported that 
Mexico's trade deficit decreased by 15.1 percent in 1993 as a 
result of an increase of 12.2 percent in Mexican exports. 
According to that office, in 1993, Mexico exported products 
worth $51.833 billion and imported $65.368 billion. The 
country's oil revenue in 1993 was $7.365 billion, or 
11.3-percent less than in 1992. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0916 GMT 
19 Feb 94) 
  The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat reported 
today that during the month of January, Mexico attracted foreign 
investments amounting to $2.37 billion, a figure without 
precedent in the country's economic history. The United States 
was the main foreign investor, accounting for 71.5 percent of 
the total. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0011 GMT 20 Feb 94) 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has reported that 
Mexico's GNP grew by 0.4 percent in 1993, the lowest growth in 
the past five years. The mining sector grew by 1.1 percent and 
construction by 3.1 percent. The manufacturing industry's 
growth rate was minus 1.5 percent; textiles, clothes, and 
leather was minus 7.4 percent; and the timber industry was minus 
10.1 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1816 GMT 21 Feb 94) 
  Official sources reported today that in 1993, the average 
daily marketing of Mexican oil-by-products was 1.4394 million 
barrels. This represents a 1.3-percent increase over the 
previous year. A report by Mexican Petroleum indicates that the 
daily marketing of gasoline was 488,600 barrels; diesel, 
240,800; liquid gas, 245,600; and aviation fuel, 42,700 barrels. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0118 GMT 21 Feb 94) 
  It was reported in Mexico City on 21 February that in 1993 
Mexican Petroleum obtained a daily average of $6.485 billion 
through the sale of its three types of oil. The Istmo type 
produced $1.555 billion, with the daily sale of 262,300 barrels; 
the daily sa?e of Maya type oil was 856,700 barrels, for $3.574 
billion; and an average daily production of 218,500 barrels of 
the Olmeca type, which is sold on the American continent, 
produced $1.356 billion. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0328

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the 
Honduran Armed Forces, did not conceal his displeasure yesterday 
with questions by certain reporters, whom he accused of reliving 
the era of "witch hunts" and of allowing themselves to be used 
for political purposes. 
  Discua Elvir arrived late in the afternoon at the Foreign 
Ministry's "Jose Cecilio del Valle" Building to attend an 
interview with representatives from the Organization of 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries who have filed a complaint against 
Honduras for the incursion of Honduran-flagged ships in other 
states' waters. 
  When he arrived at the Foreign Ministry, Gen. Discua Elvir 
answered the reporters' questions quite politely, but when they 
asked about the fisheries problem he said: "We have always had 
problems with unauthorized boats and complaints of illegal 
fishing." 
  Nevertheless, when asked questions he did not like Gen. 
Discua Elvir became visibly annoyed, especially when they 
involved Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, his schoolmate 
from the sixth graduating class at the "General Francisco 
Morazan" Military School. Romero was recently recommended by 
President Carlos Roberto Reina for the post of commander of the 
Presidential Honor Guard; furthermore, the president himself 
hinted that Romero would be promoted to general in order to 
occupy the post. 
  Gen. Discua downplayed the importance of the honor guard 
chief's appointment, arguing that "he is an officer like any 
other officer and that such changes are normal. Any Tom, Dick, 
or Harry could hold the post; it is totally unimportant," he 
stressed. "I repeat, I do not know what you intend to 
accomplish with questions like these," he said in an angry 
voice, thereby casting doubt on Col. Romero's promotion by the 
National Congress. "If it materializes it will be just another 
promotion," he said.

  [Text] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces, admitted the Honduran 
Telecommunications Enterprise [Hondutel] transferred 36 million 
lempiras to the Armed Forces. He said the money was used to pay 
soldiers and other personnel's salaries. He explained that when 
Callejas took office, soldiers had 1.5 lempiras a day to use for 
food, adding that "Callejas left us with 2.5 to three lempiras 
to use for food." He said the increases had been made with 
insufficient funds in the defense budget. Then the National 
Congress authorized the Treasury Ministry to transfer the 
Hondutel funds. 
<H5>  Other Transfers </H5>
  Although he gave no names, Gen. Discua insisted the Hondutel 
funds were transferred to other government agencies to 
supplement end-of-the-year budget shortages. He added that the 
transfer was approved by the Legislative Branch as a round 
figure. The officer explained that the military institution is 
not interested in purchasing Hondutel because it cannot do so 
with its budget. Nevertheless, he recognized that he could 
invest his earnings in the corporation, just as the Military 
Procurement Institute would, if it ever has the funds to do so. 
<H5>  Misunderstanding </H5>
  Gen. Discua believes there is a misunderstanding regarding 
this transfer, "which is casting doubt on the military 
institution." He believes Manuel Zelaya, director of the 
Honduran Social Investment Fund, "was caught off guard with an 
unfounded report." He said: "I think Mr. Zelaya was somewhat 
misinformed and did not go to the Treasury Ministry or the 
National Congress." He then affirmed there is no fault in this 
transaction as everything was carried out through the Treasury 
Ministry. 
  He indicated the disclosed reports have two purposes: one, 
to 
gain political notoriety, and two, to highlight the 
privatization of Hondutel. He said: "We should speak clearly 
about this issue and not deceive the Hondutel employees or the 
union. This process is directed at privatization and we must say 
so clearly."

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Yesterday, deputies approved a draft 
bill authorizing the National Congress and not the Executive 
Branch to make any modifications to the customs valuation 
factor. Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse himself 
presented the draft bill to the legislators, and he immediately 
appointed an advisory commission for its approval. 
  Flores Facusse explained that according to Article 205 No. 
35 
of the Constitution, only the National Congress is empowered to 
assess taxes and contributions, as well as public expenses. 
Nevertheless, Article 3 under Decree 18-90, better known as the 
"swindle package," instituted by former President Rafael 
Leonardo Callejas, states the customs valuation factor, when 
applied in the calculation of duty tariffs on imports, exports, 
and other assessments, modifies tariffs and the budget, 
therefore this factor must be approved by the National Congress 
beforehand. 
  Flores Facusse said the effects of an increase in the 
customs 
valuation factor are mostly negative for most of the Honduran 
population because it not only increases the cost of finished 
products, but raw materials, intermediate products, and capital 
goods as well. On 3 March 1990, he proposed that Article 3 of 
Decree 18-90 be modified by adding a final paragraph that says: 
"any modification to the customs valuation factor requires prior 
National congress approval." 
  After Flores Facusse read the draft bill, he appointed an 
advisory commission composed of Alberto Rencoco, Maria de la Paz 
Rivera, Marco Antonio Andino, Soad Salomon de Facusse, and 
Johnny Handal. Flores Facusse hesitated for a moment as he did 
not know whether to call a recess or adjourn for the day. 
Finally, he decided to call a 20-minute recess, which actually 
lasted for almost an hour, to allow the advisory commission time 
to express its opinion regarding the project Flores himself has 
presented. 
<H5>  The Decision </H5>
  The members of the advisory commission stated their points 
of 
view and recommended the draft be approved as presented by 
Flores Facusse. Among other considerations, they said that when 
Decree 18-90 was approved, it established that import taxes, 
included in the Import-Export Tariff and other such taxes, would 
be determined after converting the value in foreign exchange to 
its equivalent in lempiras and applying a valoration factor 
based on the exchange rate set periodically by the Central Bank. 
The text of Article 3, however, does not say who the competent 
authority is to set the customs valuation factor. The board of 
directors of the Central Bank can only set the currency exchange 
rate. 
  Additionally, when the valuation factor is set or increased, 
there is also a change in the taxes applied to imports and 
exports. This, of course, becomes an increase in revenues which 
modifies the General Revenue and Expense Budget in the form of 
revenue and taxation from imports and exports. Both of these 
changes can only be made by the National Congress. 
  When the session resumed and just before the draft was to be 
discussed for the first time, Santiago David Amador, the leader 
of the Liberal Party faction, presented a motion to approve the 
draft in one session, eliminating the other two. He said this 
would benefit the majority of the Honduran people. "This is a 
political National Congress, friendly yet not submissive. It is 
different from previous years; it will not approve everything 
the executive branch sends," he stressed after warning that 
"these are gentle warnings." 
  When it came time to vote, the only ones who did not raise 
their hand were Liberal Party deputies Gautama Fonseca and Fredy 
Miralda. Fonseca said he had privately told Flores Facusse his 
opinion, which he preferred not to present to the plenum. 
Miranda said this had been a hasty decision. 
  In order for the text of the decree to be final, Facusse 
appointed a Style Commission composed of Hector Ramon Trochez, 
Donaldo Reyes Alvear, and Sandoval Cabrera. The National 
Congress president then closed the session and called another 
session for yesterday afternoon, basically to ratify the minutes 
of the morning session. 
  Although the session was scheduled for 1430, it was actually 
called to order at 1600 [2200 GMT]. During the debates, several 
deputies commented that this was an attempt to strip President 
Carlos Roberto Reina of part of his powers. Flores Facusse, 
meanwhile, left the hall using a tunnel that leads straight to 
his office and called a surprise news conference. 
  Reaction to the National Congress' decision came after a new 
adjustment to the customs valuation factor went into effect on 
Tuesday. The factor was increased from 6.2 lempiras to the 
dollar to 7.27. The decree has no effect unless it is published 
in the Gazette. When they try to modify the valuation factor, 
the National Congress will have to give the final approval. 
  The Treasury Ministry has been responsible for setting the 
customs valuation factor since July, and before that it was the 
Central Bank.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Some 3,000 
Guatemalan Government employees have blocked access to the 
National Palace, where they gathered today to demand that 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio agree to personally negotiate a 
40 percent salary increase. 
  About 30 labor leaders have entered the Presidential Palace 
in hope of seeing De Leon, whom they have asked to meet with 
them to discuss the two-week-old conflict involving some 200,000 
government employees. Meanwhile, another group of workers has 
peacefully occupied the building that houses the Central 
American Parliament to request that organization's mediation in 
seeking a resolution to the labor conflict that has entered its 
third week. 
  Armando Sanchez, secretary of the National Federation of 
State Workers Unions (Fenasteg) who is inside the palace, told 
the press he will not leave until he receives an answer from the 
president. The police have not intervened, but several units 
have been deployed to control the demonstrators who marched 
earlier through several streets in Guatemala City. 
  Government employees have partially paralyzed several state 
services, including health services, by staging intermittent 
work stoppages since the beginning of the month to demand a 40 
percent pay raise and to demand the abolition of plans to 
privatize certain state-owned companies and services. 
  Labor leaders headed by Armando Sanchez have detained 
several 
government employees, among them National Police Director Mario 
Cifuentes. The labor leaders are not allowing anyone, including 
reporters, to enter or leave the palace, and dozens of reporters 
have surrounded the building. 
  Cifuentes told the press that the removal of the labor 
leaders is being considered, but he is awaiting orders from 
ranking government authorities. Meanwhile, Sanchez warned, "We 
will not leave until we receive a positive answer to our just 
demands or until the president promises to hold a direct 
dialogue." 
  Hector Luna, secretary general of the Presidency, met with a 
commission of union workers to hear to their opinions, and he 
told them that De Leon is not in Guatemala City. 
  According to Sanchez, the measures are intended to press for 
a 40 percent salary increase and to reject a government-offered 
bonus of 360 quetzales a year (approximately $62) -- a bonus 
Sanchez calls an "affront" to the workers. 
  Nery Barrios, one of the top leaders of Labor and Popular 
Action Union (UASP), told ACAN-EFE that the organization decided 
to take to the streets and occupy these offices to support the 
demands of the government workers in light of the government's 
"hardening" position. According to Barrios, UASP, which belongs 
to Fenasteg, and the Union of State Workers support the 
government workers and remain committed to the call for a 
nationwide strike. 
  During the demonstration, the workers accused President de 
Leon Carpio of being "subservient and taking up arms," as well 
as having "betrayed" the trust given to him when he took office 
in June 1993. 
  "As long as there is social injustice, the people will be in 
the streets. Ramiro de Leon, you will be leading the people to 
their graves," shouted workers in front of the palace where they 
are demanding the president's resignation. 
  Barrios explained that in addition to a 40 percent salary 
increase, the forceful measures are intended to oppose 
government-announced sales of state-owned assets. The strike 
has paralyzed 95 percent of the public administration, according 
to the leader of UASP, an organization that claims 1 million 
members. 
  "We will not end the strike as long as our demands are not 
met, because the people are starving to death," Barrios insisted. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ana de Molina reiterated today 
that the government is willing to hold talks, but she clarified 
that the government does not have funds to meet the demands for 
salary hikes.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Fenasteg [National Federation of State Workers 
Unions] leaders today made their way into the National Palace 
and thus far have occupied the building's first and second 
floors. 
  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who was not in the palace 
at 
the time of the occupation, said he will take strong action 
against individuals who disrupt public order. In statements at 
the La Industria park, where he inaugurated the Catholic Fair, 
de Leon said that he may momentarily order the labor leaders' 
dislodgement from the palace. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon] I will not tolerate illegal 
actions. This government has been characterized as weak and 
indecisive but I am going to prove now that it is a government 
that bases its actions on the law. If their actions are illegal 
I will request that they be legally dislodged from the National 
Palace, which is a public building, and I will take drastic 
action. This is not the way to resolve problems. 
  Take for example the case of Fenasep [National Federation of 
Public Employees Unions]; we are talking with them, reasonable 
proposals have been set forth, they have proposed creative 
solutions and we have made counterproposals. This is the 
civilized, orderly, intelligent, nonradical way of dealing with 
and resolving Guatemala's problems. It is illegal for them to 
occupy the National Palace and I am going to contact 
Chimaltenango immediately to ensure that legal actions are 
implemented. If the labor leaders are conducting themselves 
illegally, if they are perpetrating a crime, I will have no 
other choice but to take action. 
  I do not take action under pressure. I sit down and talk 
because I have always been a man with a democratic spirit and 
attitude and I am still proving this. However, I will not 
tolerate the perpetration of acts that are classified as crimes 
and if they are perpetrating a crime I will order the Attorney 
General's Office to use a legal order if necessary to dislodge 
the labor leaders. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is your reaction to the charges 
of repression leveled against you and your government by Health 
Ministry employees today in response to yesterday's arrest of 
certain (?Health Ministry) employees? 
  [De Leon] Their arrest was not an act of repression. 
  The law states that anyone who commits a crime must be 
arrested. They flagrantly committed a crime yesterday and for 
this reason they were arrested. A judge released them later. 
This is as problem of another branch. We are going to continue 
filing charges and calling for administrative and criminal 
sanctions because it is unfair for the Guatemalan people to 
suffer as a result of illegal actions. 
  Public services are deficient and now more than ever because 
of the irresponsible attitude of persons who, instead of 
resorting to dialogue, as the government is doing, adopt illegal 
positions and carry out criminal actions such as those of 
yesterday. The National Police have been given orders and they 
have the legal responsibility of arresting and taking these 
persons to court. We will continue doing this until these 
persons realize that the government is not weak, that the 
government acts according to the law, and we will continue doing 
this. 
  [Reporter] What are you going to do now that Fenasteg and 
Fenasep have said that the workers do not accept the 
government's proposals? 
  [De Leon] We can continue talking with Fenasep and with 
whoever may want to continue talking. Fenasteg has never talked 
with us. Its radical attitude has existed from the beginning. 
We are just waiting for the strike to be declared illegal to 
take legal action on this. The government has the political 
will to resolve the problem but it does not have the money. 
They are demanding a 40 percent salary increase. There are 
150,000 or 200,000 public employees. Not all of them are 
backing this illegal strike, true. There are also 8 million 
Guatemalans who live in poverty. I am obligated to them. I 
cannot turn my back on those who live in extreme poverty, on 
those who do not even enjoy the privilege of holding a job. 
Approximately 50 percent of Guatemalans do not have jobs, do 
not have any kind of salary. Public employees have a salary 
that deserves to be increased, but under different conditions. 
  In the Health Ministry there is a 130-million-quetzals 
deficit. We are trying to pay that. We owe money to suppliers. 
We have a fiscal deficit of 900 million quetzals, and a 
floating debt of 1.2 billion quetzals. 
  I will continue working in accordance with the state's 
financial possibilities. In the face of that 50 percent of the 
population who live in misery, in extreme poverty because they 
do not have a job, bureaucrats want a 40-percent increase. This 
is impossible. 
  [Reporter] How will the Constitutionality Court resolution 
on 
a tax law affect the government's budget? 
  [De Leon] The ruling by that court has further deteriorated 
our financial situation. The ruling deprives the state of 600 
million quetzals. This has made the state's financial situation 
more difficult. We are adopting measures to recover the 600 
million, but while we do this, the deficit grows and it is 
impossible to yield to irrational demands. 
  If they want pandemonium, a crisis, more chaos, then I will 
adopt measures in line with such intentions for illegal actions 
and public disorder. [end recording]

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central 
American Parliament (Parlacen) appointed today a mediation 
commission to help resolve the conflict between the government 
and its employees. The employees, who have been staging partial 
strikes for the past two weeks, requested Parlacen's mediation. 
  The Parlacen Information Office reported the commission 
members are: Guatemalan Deputies Vinicio Cerezo, Eduardo Meyer, 
and Manuel Conde and Marco Tulio Castillo, who is a Honduran and 
president of the [Parlacen] labor, union, and social issues 
commission. 
  Parlacen President Jose Francisco Guerrero, a Salvadoran, 
met 
with the government employees who had requested the mediation 
and offered to talk to Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio. 
  The request for Parlacen's mediation, which the executive 
still has not yet accepted, is another action taken by the 
strikers to pressure the government into accepting their demands 
for a 40-percent wage hike. 
  Approximately 30 leaders of the National Federation of State 
Workers Unions (Fenasteg), which represents approximately 
180,000 employees, remain in the government office waiting to 
meet with De Leon Carpio, who is not at the Presidential Palace. 
Fenasteg Secretary Armando Sanchez has said they will not 
abandon the palace or allow personnel to enter or leave the 
building until they get a positive response.

<F P=106> ["Report from the National Palace" by unidentified reporter; </F>
from the "News Patrol" newscast -- live relay] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Today's news has centered on the peaceful 
occupation -- at least peaceful so far -- of the National Palace 
by government workers who belong to Fenasep [National Federation 
of Public Employees Unions]. The Fourth District judge was 
unable to enter the National Palace because of the crowd outside 
the building. Tight security measures have been implemented and 
the doors to the building have been closed. Meanwhile, the 
government minister, along with several of his associates, 
remains in his office inside the building. 
  The workers, Fenasep members, announced a few minutes ago 
that the president of the Republic has authorized the attorney 
general and government minister to hold talks with them. 
Nevertheless, this is opposed by the majority of the workers. 
Here is government worker Armando Sanchez who is outside the 
palace. 
  [Sanchez] [passage indistinct] 
  [Reporter] In addition, we also want to report that besides 
the five diplomats we mentioned in an earlier report who are 
inside the National Palace, the Paraguayan Ambassador Gilberto 
Caniza also finds himself trapped inside. These diplomats, 
along with those people who went to the National Palace today to 
carry out normal business and reporters who normally cover 
events at the palace, have been prevented from leaving. This is 
also true of officials who went to the Foreign Relations 
Ministry today to attend a diplomatic event that has been 
canceled in the wake of this situation.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan 
National Federation of State Workers Unions [Fenasteg], which 
began a 72-hour strike today to demand a 40-percent salary 
increase, has demanded the resignation of President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio. 
  Fenasteg has also demanded the intervention of the 
Inter-American Human Rights Court to guarantee the security of 
40 workers who, as of this morning, seized the government house. 
  Fenasteg leader Armando Sanchez, who leads the 40 workers 
who 
are occupying the National Palace and another 5,000 workers who 
are demonstrating in the outskirts, has told NOTIMEX they will 
not leave the building. 
  Sanchez has blamed De Leon, who took power on 6 June 1993, 
for the situation of "ungovernability," the wave of violence and 
insecurity, and the economic, political, and social crises 
Guatemala is facing. 
  Sanchez has said: "Guatemalans are disappointed with the 
current government. Everyone has made a mistake by believing 
Ramiro de Leon was going to be a fair president who would 
readdress the country's fate." 
  Sanchez has said there is a consensus regarding De Leon's 
resignation. He has said: "As the situation is progressing in 
Guatemala, any sector might try to overthrow de Leon." 
  Sanchez explained the national strike is aimed at pressuring 
the government into complying with its promises to overcome the 
levels of poverty affecting 8 million people in Guatemala. 
  Sanchez said a group of 100 workers has met with Jose 
Francisco Guerrero, president of the Central American Parliament 
[Parlacen], whom they asked to form a commission to mediate in 
the labor conflict. 
  The committee members are reportedly Sergio Ramirez, former 
Nicaraguan vice president; a Honduran delegate; Vinicio Cerezo 
Arevalo, former president of Guatemala; and members of the 
Parlacen Board of Directors. 
  The union leader said a communique will be sent within the 
next few hours to the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, asking them to intervene and 
attempt to try and convince De Leon Carpio to soften his 
position. 
  Sanchez, in an interview at the National Palace, said a 
motion was also presented in Geneva, Switzerland, demanding 
respect for labor and human rights in Guatemala. 
  About 100 policemen have surrounded the building, while some 
40 members of the Presidential General Staff, geared with gas 
masks, are awaiting orders to evict the union members. 
  Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, Government 
Ministry 
personnel, and National Police Director Mario Cifuentes, among 
others, are inside the building. 
  De Leon Carpio is touring Chimaltenango, some 57 km west of 
the capital.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (DPA) -- Chilean 
Ambassador to Guatemala Christian Bisquert and Paraguayan 
Ambassador to Guatemala Gilberto Caniza are being held hostage 
in the Government Palace in Guatemala City after the palace was 
occupied today by a group of union members demanding that 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government increase their 
wages. 
  Along with the two diplomats, about 1,000 others are also 
being held hostage at the palace. Some 700 of these people are 
employees of various government ministries that have offices in 
the palace, and the rest were people visiting the various 
offices. The Chilean and Paraguayan ambassadors were at the 
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, which is housed on the first floor 
of the Government Palace, when the siege began. [passage omitted]

  [Interview with Adolfo Reyes, Guatemalan deputy government 
minister, by Julieta Cardenas at the National Palace in 
Guatemala City--live] 
  [Text] [Cardenas] Here is a last minute report: The problem 
created by the Fenasep [National Federation of Public Employees 
Unions] leaders has begun to be solved. Deputy Government 
Minister Adolfo Reyes explains the agreements reached tonight 
inside the National Palace. Can you explain the agreements to 
our listeners? 
  [Reyes] It is fortunate that once again through dialogue-- 
without any violence and in compliance with the law and 
Constitution--we have done our work. We have met with the five 
Fenasep leaders who are here in my office. We are drafting a 
document that includes a point on the resumption of talks; this 
will take place on 1 March, starting at 1500, when the president 
will hold a special meeting with them. Other points are 
nonviolence and a revision of dialogue. They have maintained 
their request for a 40-percent salary increase. 
  In addition to the people gathered outside the main square, 
there was no violence, fortunately. The police are remaining 
watchful, protecting the people, and preventing incidents. When 
we sign this document, which we hope will be in the next 10 
minutes, the union leaders promised us they will withdraw 
peacefully. We will meet again on 1 March at 1500. That is all 
I have to say. 
  [Guatemala City Cadena de Emisoras Unidas in Spanish at 0155 
GMT on 24 February cites Fenasep leader Armando Sanchez as 
saying: "We are going to proceed to leave the building, because 
we reached an agreement to meet in a new process of negotiation 
with the government on 1 March."]

<F P=106> [Report by Gonzalo Marroquin] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala City, 19 Feb (AFP) -- The unexpected 
reorganization of the military leadership in Guatemala might 
have been prompted by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's and an 
Army group's wish to facilitate peace negotiations with the 
guerrilla groups, it was stated today by the media and military 
sources. 
  President de Leon announced on Friday the dismissal of 
National Defense Chief of Staff Jose Luis Quilo and the 
appointment of General Marco Antonio Gonzalez as his 
replacement, in an unexpected action that provoked numerous 
rumors in the Guatemalan capital. De Leon appointed Gen. Carlos 
Enrique Pineda to the post of assistant chief of staff. 
Gonzalez is considered the president's "trusted man" while 
Pineda is a commander with a well-known background as fighter in 
the low-intensity war that has prevailed in the country for 33 
years. Given his post, Pineda must join the government peace 
commission that will resume negotiations with Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrilla commanders in 
March. 
  The government meeting with the URNG, to be held in Mexico 
City, was initially scheduled for the second half of February. 
However, it was postponed until the UN Human Rights Commission, 
currently gathered in Geneva, issues a resolution on Guatemala. 
  The morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE today reviewed the 
changes 
that occurred in the military leadership, terming them 
"encouraging signs" of the government's "positive" attitude. LA 
REPUBLICA said the removals represent a "rearrangement" of 
currents within the Army and they are linked with the peace 
negotiations. According to analysts, the less "harder" line 
within the Armed Forces has been strengthened by the movements, 
but those analysts do not dare speculate if the initiative came 
from the presidential office or the military barracks. 
  Military commanders have officially termed these movements 
as 
"routine" although a military source consulted by AFP admitted 
there are "divisions" within the corps on the position that 
should be assumed in the negotiations with the URNG rebels. A 
controversy recently arose regarding the guerrilla demand to 
create a Truth Commission, similar to the one which last year 
investigated war crimes in El Salvador and provoked the fall of 
the country's highest ranking military leaders, who were charged 
with numerous human rights violations. 
  Guatemalan Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez said "the 
Army's activities can be verified at any moment;" adding the 
commission was not necessary. He said such an investigation 
would be used to discredit the military corps and it would 
increase divisions among the Guatemalan people. Enriquez said 
the guerrilla group will also have to answer for its crimes, 
including the deaths of U.S. Ambassador John Gordon Mein and 
German Ambassador Karl von Spreti in the 1960's, and journalist 
Isidoro Zarco, owner of the morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE, in 
the 1970's.

  [Text] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will 
make a four-day private visit to France beginning 26 February. 
Notable activities during the visit will be meetings with French 
President Francois Mitterand and Foreign Affairs Minister Alain 
Juppe. This is what the Haitian Embassy in Paris said on the 
evening of 22 February. President Aristide will participate in 
an international colloquium for the fight [as heard] of Abbot 
Pierre, the founder the (Emaus) Charity Association organized 
under UNESCO. 
  Mr. Aristide, who was overthrown by a military coup d'etat 
in September 1991, rejected last week a plan, presented by 
Haitian parliamentarians, to unravel the current crisis. This 
plan, which is implicitly supported by UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali and which enjoys the support of Washington, 
provides notably for the appointment of a new prime minister, 
the early retirement of Army Commander in Chief General Raoul 
Cedras, and the installation of a new government of concord.

  [Text] Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said on 21 
February that he was greatly saddened by the murderous wreck of 
a boat carrying Haitian refugees off the Bahamas. Only three 
persons survived the 20 February wreck of a ship carrying 
between 20 and 40 Haitians, according to U.S. authorities. Five 
bodies, including those of a woman and four children, have been 
recovered. 
  In a communique, President Aristide, who is in exile in 
Washington, called on the international community once again to 
reinforce the sanctions against Haiti to compel the military to 
leave power. The sanctions are necessary and should have been 
applied a long time ago, the Haitian president wrote. Those who 
are supporting democracy in Haiti should show firmness, asserted 
President Aristide, adding that the authors of the coup d'etat 
must not be rewarded for barbarous actions.

  [Excerpt] The Parliamentary Bloc of the National Front for 
Change and Democracy, BP-FNCD, is searching for unity. The 
principal leaders of the bloc who are currently in Washington, 
officially invited the members and political allies to join the 
party's leadership in its new position. In a letter addressed 
to the legislators in favor of the return of President Aristide, 
the bloc is inviting them to reunite, to close ranks in order to 
pursue together the struggle for democracy. This letter is 
addressed particularly to Senator Yvon Gislain and two FNCD 
deputies who approved a first plan for a solution to the crisis, 
siding with some legislators from the opposition. One FNCD 
ally, Deputy Samuel Madistin, who severely criticized the plan 
supported by the Americans and the United Nations also rose up 
against the initiative of the legislators without a mandate who 
are trying to involve the Legislative Branch as a whole. Deputy 
Madistin ascribes this plan to a vast international plot.

  [Excerpts] According to Deputy Jean Mandenave, who is 
supporting the president's stand on the possible appointment of 
a prime minister, the reactivation of the Governors Island 
agreement is the only solution. Deputy Mandenave condemns the 
international community which is putting pressure on President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide while the Army is acting as it wishes, at 
the same time labelling the parliamentarians' trip to Washington 
as a dilatory maneuver. 
  [Begin Mandenave recording in Creole] [passage omitted] I 
remain convinced that it is necessary to have a government that 
is not a government of resignation. The current government has 
resigned. A government cannot spend all its time dealing with 
the day-to-day business of the state. But the path must be 
cleared before the president appoints a prime minister. General 
Cedras must step down first. Everybody knows that the Malval 
government failed because the Army and the Revolutionary Front 
for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti members prevented it 
from functioning. [end recording] 
  Furthermore, Deputy Mandenave says he is expecting nothing 
positive from the dismissal [corrects himself] sorry, from the 
other office of the Senate at the initiative of Sen. Dupiton. 
In the opinion of Deputy Mandenave, that is nothing more than a 
meeting between friends. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Mediator Dante Caputo supports the settlement 
plan to solve the Haitian crisis, presented last week in 
Washington by Haitian legislators of various leanings. This 
miniplan is not global, he says, and does not replace the 
Governors Island accord; but it constitutes a significant 
development because it was suggested by both opponents and 
supporters of Aristide. This statement was made by Caputo during 
a press conference on 22 February at the UN Headquarters. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that this plan, which was rejected by 
President Aristide, is supported by the United States and 
provides for the nomination of a new prime minister, the 
anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief, and 
amnesty for the military who overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
September 1991. 
  In a letter addressed on Sunday to the UN Security Council, 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly supported the 
plan of the Haitian legislators. Caputo said that he was waiting 
for President Aristide's response to the legislators' initiative 
that was communicated to the UN secretary general during the 
past weekend. However, during a meeting in Washington with the 
legislators last week, President Aristide had rejected the plan 
which does not set an effective date for his return to power. 
  Some of his concerns are totally legitimate and we think 
that 
the international community could answer to them, states Caputo. 
  The mediator noted Jean-Bertrand Aristide's cooperation 
while 
specifying that the president in exile is concerned about the 
means implemented in order to overcome the deadlock and the 
necessity to avoid the kinds of experiences which in the past 
did not yield the expected results, he said. 
  On 21 February, President Aristide once more asked the 
international community to reinforce the sanctions against Haiti 
in order to compel the military to leave power. 
  Mediator Caputo considered that the international sanctions 
are a means to favor a solution to the crisis and not a solution 
in themselves. However, he added that if the nondemocratic 
sectors in Haiti continue to block the situation, new sanctions 
will probably be imposed by the Security Council.

  [Text] A new element was introduced on 22 February in the 
Haitian political crisis. The National Front for Change and 
Democracy, FNCD, made public in Washington on 22 February a 
proposal for a solution to the crisis. A plan issued after a 
plenary session by some parties and organizations close to the 
FNCD was thus presented to the UN secretary general. In this 
document the FNCD legislators repeated, but in a different 
order, the priorities and the steps necessary to put an end to 
the political crisis. The FNCD plan, which does not indicate a 
specific date for the return of President Aristide, provides in 
point seven the process for his return. Regarding the 
nomination and the installation of a new prime minister, the 
FNCD advocates in this plan, first a vote on some essential laws 
including the one on amnesty and the retirement of General Raoul 
Cedras. In presenting this plan on 22 February, Senator Turneb 
Delpe, the FNCD spokesman, guaranteed that a large sector of 
national political opinion supported him. Senator Turneb Delpe 
presented the various points of this plan advocated by the FNCD: 
  [Begin recording] [Delpe] A vote on the laws: a) Amnesty; 
b) Separation of the police from the Army; c) international 
cooperation; 1.2 [number as heard]: anticipated retirement of 
Gen. Raoul Cedras; 1.3: Nomination and ratification of a new 
commander in chief of Haiti's Armed Forces; 1.4: Nomination 
and ratification of a new prime minister; 1.5: Formation of a 
government of national concord; 1.6: Suspension of the 
sanctions; 1.7: Return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; 
1.8: Lifting of the sanctions. Resolution 2: A delegation 
of political leaders and FNCD legislators will go to Washington 
to promote this realistic compromise to President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide and the representatives of the international community. 
[Reporter Clarence Renois, in Creole] Senator Delpe, did you 
discuss this plan with President Aristide and what is his 
position on this proposed plan? [Delpe, in Creole] We did not 
make the plan public yet because we wanted to discuss it with 
him. Generally speaking, we can say that he does not have much 
objection to it, although he has his own opinion. When he 
examines it he thinks that there will be some sequences he 
disagrees with, since he feels that the anticipated retirement 
of Gen. Raoul Cedras must come before the nomination and 
ratification of a prime minister. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] A cessation of activities is imminent at Radio 
Lumiere. The very high cost of oil products has prompted the 
officials of Radio Lumiere to consider ceasing all activities 
within two weeks. On 22 February, officials of the Protestant 
radio station commemorated its 35th anniversary by calling on 
evangelical Christians to make financial contributions so the 
radio station can continue its broadcasts. Raymond Exume, 
general manager of the satellite stations of Radio Lumiere, says 
he considers a shutdown of Radio Lumiere a failure that will 
have consequences for the entire Haitian evangelical community.

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio today said that if former 
diplomat Maria del Rosario Casas is guilty of any crime, she 
should stand trial before a U.S. court. Casas was arrested 
yesterday in the United States and charged with spying for the 
former USSR. 
  Casas, who was born in Colombia, and her husband, Aldrich 
Ames, a high-level employee of the CIA for more than 30 years, 
were arrested in the state of Virginia. They were accused of 
having sold secrets to the KGB, the former Soviet secret 
service, since 1985 for a total of $1.5 million. 
  The 41-year-old Colombian became a U.S. citizen after 
marrying Ames, 52. She was a cultural attache for the Colombian 
Embassy in Mexico in 1983 when she met the American. 
  The Colombian foreign minister said Maria del Rosario Casas 
"worked at the Foreign Ministry more than ten years ago. She 
was an intelligent official; she studied at Andes University, 
taught at the institution, and did her job well." 
  Sanin added: "After that, there was no news about her." 
Sanin said the U.S. Government has not yet asked Colombia for 
any information about the former diplomat. 
  Maria del Rosario Casas' involvement in this espionage case 
has caused commotion throughout Colombia, whose laws recognize 
dual citizenship. She was an outstanding teacher of philosophy 
and language and was taking graduate classes at Georgetown 
University. 
  In voicing his regret over the incident, Prosecutor General 
Gustavo de Greiff said that if the charges are proven, Maria del 
Rosario Casas will have committed "treason against the 
fatherland, which is sacred."

  [Text] The Colombian Foreign Ministry issued a communique 
tonight requesting official information from the United States 
on the services provided by Maria del Rosario Casas to the CIA 
in Mexico. The ministry is also requesting information on why 
Aldrich Ames, her husband, went to Colombia. In addition, the 
Foreign Ministry asked the prosecutor general and the attorney 
general to investigate Maria del Rosario Casas' conduct. 
  On this same issue, Noemi Sanin, Colombian foreign minister, 
has already offered the U.S. Government her full cooperation 
with the investigation into Maria del Rosario Casas' involvement 
in the case, the most talked-about spy case in recent times. 
Meanwhile, the Registrar's Office has disclosed the 
identification card of the accused. 
  The Foreign Ministry received orders today to maintain under 
strict reserve the curriculum vitae of Maria del Rosario Casas 
du Puy, Colombian Mata Hari captured by the FBI in the United 
States. She is accused of spying for Russia. This is Casas du 
Puy's photograph when she applied for a diplomatic post in 
Mexico. [video shows photograph of Maria del Rosario Casas] 
Here is what Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin has said: 
  [Begin Sanin recording] She is a well-known person from an 
established family. We hope, due to her background, she will be 
found innocent of the charges; if not, she must surrender to 
justice, because the accusations of the crime she has allegedly 
committed are very serious. [end recording]

  [Text] Bogota, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Authorities have reported 
that Jaime Orejuela Caballero, one of the most important bosses 
of the drug-trafficking Cali cartel, a man wanted by the United 
States, was arrested Tuesday by the Colombian police in a Cali 
neighborhood. According to Cali Police Chief General Jose 
Eustasio Reyes, his men captured 50-year-old Orejuela Caballero 
while he was driving his automobile in a Cali suburb. 
  Orejuela, who was transferred by plane to Bogota, is wanted 
by Interpol and could be transferred to the United States 
although no official announcement has been made about 
extradition plans. Gen. Reyes reported that a New York City 
court has filed an arrest warrant for the Colombian mafia boss, 
who is accused of possessing, producing, and distributing 
cocaine in New York City. He faces other charges also. 
  A few hours before the arrest, Colombia's Prosecutor General 
Gustavo De Greiff said in the city of Medellin, which is the 
headquarters of another notorious drug-traffic cartel, 
negotiations for the surrender of Cali cartel chiefs are under 
way. The prosecutor general said the possible surrender of 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales, 
two alleged bosses of the Cali cartel, is being negotiated. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez told De Greiff in a letter 
that he is afraid there could be "legal maneuvers" behind the 
efforts of the drug-traffickers' attorneys, which are geared 
toward allowing the authorities to investigate the accused, then 
finding them not guilty due to a lack of evidence in Colombia. 
  According to the U.S. DEA, the Cali cartel is Colombia's 
most 
important mafia group, more important than the almost dismantled 
Medellin cartel, which controls 80 percent of the cocaine 
shipments to the United States.

  [De Greiff] Yes, these are the two people who have appointed 
lawyers with whom we are advancing the process. You can be sure 
that I am confident, and the lawyers have said as much, that the 
process will not be limited to these two people but involve many 
others who unfortunately have engaged in drug trafficking. 
  [Reporter] Will they be the first ones? 
  [De Greiff] That is correct. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] Are we going to be having 
announcements as happened in the past with Pablo Escobar? 
  [De Greiff] Pardon me? 
  [Second reporter] Will we be having announcements of 
surrenders, as happened with Pablo Escobar in the past? 
  [De Greiff] I hope not, because they know and must keep in 
mind that as long as they do not surrender, we are going to 
continue pursuing them. Ultimately, they will meet with either 
Escobar's fate or the fate of those who have surrendered to 
justice. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Melisa Soto from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera today signed an order 
dropping charges against Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Arias 
Cardenas and nine [number as heard] other officers who 
participated in coup attempts on 4 February and 27 November 
1992. Here is Melisa Soto with details. 
  [Soto] The officers who received the presidential pardon are 
Lt. Col Francisco Arias Cardenas, Major Marisela Arevalo, Lt. 
Ramon Rodriguez Chasin, Aviation Lt. Juan Carvajal Mas, 
Technical Sergeant 3d Class Tony Armas, Army Captain Frank 
Rafael Morales, Army Capt. Juan Carlos Hidalgo Pandare, Lt. Jose 
Gregorio Vielma, and Lt. Jose Felix Alvarez. All of them were 
tried and convicted and are now serving sentences in the San 
Carlos Garrison and Lino de Clemente Battalion, except for Lt. 
Col. Arias Cardenas, who is still confined in a military 
hospital after undergoing dental surgery. 
  It is also worth noting that today Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez 
Frias did not appear at the military court as is customary. 
According to his legal advisers, who are also temporarily 
serving as the attorneys for General Carlos Diaz Rangel [name 
and title as heard], Chavez will not appear in court to be 
handed a warrant for his arrest [as heard] because he feels the 
proceedings contain a series of irregularities. As his advisers 
explained, the president is being deceived because some of the 
convicted officers have received manipulative offers to get them 
to request discharges, including offers of scholarships and cash. 
  [Begin recording] [Defense attorney Tomas Noriega, 
identified 
by caption] We feel that this officer, or, rather, these 
officers who have come to talk to Major Carlos Diaz Reyes about 
this subject are hampering his right to a defense, and the 
position of these officers undermines the defense of those 
patriots who rebelled against corruption and the awful situation 
in the country. The time that has passed since then has proven 
-- and President Caldera has admitted this -- that if it had not 
been for the 4 February events, he would never have been elected 
president. 
  [Defense attorney Jesus Bello, identified by caption] In 
public remarks made during the election campaign, and later 
after being elected president, Dr. Caldera offered to release 
these officers without any conditions or restrictions. This is 
why I feel the president must know that these officers fulfilled 
their duty. He must also know that his public promises, as well 
as the promises he made over the telephone to Col. Chavez and 
Maj. Diaz Reyes when they were held in Yare -- promises that he 
would release them once he was elected -- are the reason why the 
people are still clamoring for their release, and the president 
must heed the people and help these officers be reincorporated 
into the National Armed Forces. [end recording] 
  [Soto] According to Lt. Col. Chavez Frias' legal advisers, 
other officers who are being tried for the 4 February and 27 
November coup attempts have received similar promises.

  [Text] Caracas, 19 Feb (EFE) -- Today, Major General 
Egberto Artuza Delgado, National Guard [GN] commander, reported 
the Venezuelan Armed Forces are prepared to defend sovereignty 
in the face of a possible attack by Colombian guerrillas on 
border towns. The high-ranking officer said the GN, the Navy, 
and the Army have beefed up security in Casdualito, the 
Venezuelan town bordering Colombia, in anticipation of a new 
guerrilla attack. "We are absolutely sure they will carry out 
future attacks against our installations and we are ready for 
that," he asserted. 
  Artuza Delgado said the civilian population of the southwest 
region of Venezuela can rest assured the Armed Forces will 
safeguard their physical safety and will protect their 
properties. Meanwhile, the GN commander reported that this 
Venezuelan force had not arrested the Brazilian gold prospectors 
and also denied entering the Brazilian territorial space. 
  The general remarked the Venezuelan Armed Forces respect the 
borders and are perfectly aware of their location. He added that 
in the last operation conducted in the area bordering Brazil, 
Venezuelan military authorities destroyed 88 "gold prospecting" 
camps and 11 rafts used by the illegal miners. The officer 
concluded that "the illegal Brazilian miners, who profit from 
the illegal exploitation of our land, want to create friction at 
the international level so as to weaken the work being done at 
the border."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments through 22 February: 
  According to a poll conducted by the Central Statistics and 
Data Processing Office, OCEI, 17.4 percent of the active young 
population is unemployed, which equals 340,677 youths. 
Statistically, Venezuela still has a high proportion of youths, 
with persons between the ages of 15-24 making up 48.7 percent of 
the population. The overall unemployment rate is 6.6 percent. 
(Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p 12) 
  There has been a drastic and unprecedented drop of two and 
one- half points in the foreign debt bonds since midday on 14 
February. They now stand at 67.50 points, which translates to 
losses of approximately $2 billion. Traders say this is 
basically due to three factors: Standard and Poor's 
announcement that Venezuela has been reclassified as a country 
of great investment risk; the U.S. inflation rate announcement, 
which affects U.S. 30-year bonds, which in turn affects 
Venezuelan collateral bonds; and a domino effect in various 
banks following the weekend news on financial system 
destabilization. (Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 15 
Feb 94 p 15) 
  The administration of outgoing President Ramon J. Velasquez 
reports that during 1993 capital and investment expenditures 
amounted to 212.049 billion bolivares, equivalent to 19.3 
percent of total expenditures. During the same period, 33.1144 
billion was authorized for debt repayment, which represents 3 
percent of total expenditures. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 
15 Sep p e-12) 
  The OCEI reports that the value of imports dropped 13.3 
percent to $10.986 billion in 1993, compared to $12.672 billion 
in 1992. Imports for December dropped 17.7 percent compared to 
November and 28.3 percent compared to December 1992. (Madrid 
EFE in Spanish 0001 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
  Banco Union President S. Henry Benacerraf has denied reports 
from Colombia that Banco Union in Venezuela, as well as its 
branches abroad, are experiencing problems and facing an 
intervention process. Benacerraf said "the institution is 
experiencing its best times ever." The bank president added 
that Banco Union is "third in productivity." Benacerraf said 
that in 1993 the Union Bank recorded a 1.753-percent increase 
compared to figures for 1992. Benacerraf believes that the mix 
up occurred last week after an intervention in the Union Federal 
Bank in the United States was announced. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 17 Feb 94 p 11) 
  The OCEI reports that nontraditional exports reached $222 
million in January, which represents a 19-percent increase over 
January 1993 exports. On the other hand, the December 1993 
export figures were 26.7 percent higher than the January 1994 
figures. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 18 Feb 94 p 
16)

<F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has dismissed 
Information and Tourism Minister Carlos Vera, because the 
president said the minister failed to show respect for the 
command hierarchy by criticizing Vice President Alberto Dahik. 
Carlos Vera Rodriguez ordered Dahik to toe the line and refrain 
from launching trial balloons after the vice president stated 
the government is studying the possibility of calling a 
referendum on topics government spokesmen have not yet 
disclosed. Vera referred to the burning topic this noon when 
he hosted a news conference that was broadcast nationwide on a 
radio network. The minister officially announced his 
resignation from the post he has held since the start of 
conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen's government. In announcing that 
he was stepping down, Vera stated: The president felt a way to 
resolve the situation my remarks caused was to ask for my 
resignation, and I immediately agreed. 
  [Begin Vera recording] It is necessary in this country to 
display constant loyalty and to demonstrate with deeds and 
renouncements, not just with mellifluous or questionable phrases 
or poses. It is necessary to etch that word in capital letters; 
it is necessary. The same applies with the words understanding, 
friendship, gratitude, and frankness. That is why today when I 
conclude my work I do so in a manner that should be done--with a 
president of the caliber of Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  I begin with my thanks, with a tight summary of results, and 
my best wishes of good luck. I will later refer to the 
president's decision to request my resignation and my decision 
to heed his request immediately. I again begin by thanking him 
for the confidence and support he gave me by entrusting upon me 
this responsibility to continue the work of Pedro Zambrano, 
whose untimely death, which could have been avoided [words 
indistinct] of Ecuador prompted me to accept this challenge. 
Before, I had encouraged him to join the task of supporting a 
new course, something that ultimately cost him his life. 
  I could not help but sacrifice my prestige, comfort, and 
economy to act according to his struggle and task. [end 
recording] 
  Vera publicly criticized Vice President Alberto Dahik, who 
in 
the last few days announced the government's intention to 
convene a popular consultation to propose various constitutional 
reforms. Dahik made the announcement without President 
Duran-Ballen's authorization, creating a state of confusion 
within the government and sparking reactions from different 
sectors in Ecuador. 
  President Duran-Ballen said the issue of a possible 
plebiscite is only under consideration. 
  Vera said during a news conference: I do not consider it a 
lack of respect to request respect for a right exclusive to the 
president. He should be the first to announce such an important 
matter as a plebiscite. 
  Several papers published today reported that Vera had become 
a strong Dahik opponent due to the differences between the 
officials on economic policies. 
  Vera, a 39-year-old reporter, had orchestrated 
Duran-Ballen's 
political campaign, which took him to the Ecuadoran presidency 
for the 1992-96 term. The former information minister also said 
Leon Herrera, National Radio director, and David Andrade, 
information under secretary, had placed their post at the 
executive's disposal. I have asked them to remain in their 
posts until the new minister replaces them, Vera said, stating 
he would return to journalism. 
  The government is still undecided about who will replace 
Vera; therefore, David Andrade, information under secretary, 
will remain in charge.

  [Text] Quito, 19 Feb (DPA) -- While the opposition 
strongly criticizes the government's plans to call a plebiscite 
on constitutional reforms, President Sixto Duran-Ballen has 
severely chided his political adversaries and charged they are 
obstructing changes "out of pure hatred." "Without any support, 
my government is changing this country and giving it an 
efficient and productive economic structure," said the 
72-year-old president, who described his rivals as "the crazy 
opposition." However, Duran-Ballen did not confirm the 
plebiscite, suggested by Vice President Alberto Dahik the 
previous evening, to solve the problems of governability caused 
by a political structure that furthers conflict between 
government branches. 
  The suggestion made by Dahik, who is considered to be the 
liberal government's ideologue, unleashed a wave of criticism 
and charges that the government is trying to alter the ongoing 
electoral process and avoid a defeat which, according to the 
polls, will be overwhelming. The government's acceptance rating 
is under 10 percent, thus, it can be anticipated that the 
opposition will obtain a large majority of the 65 deputy 
positions -- in the 77-member Congress -- to be renewed on 1 May. 
  The opposition-controlled Congress has halted the bills 
presented by the government to change the economic structure, 
which is very centralized presently. "They are damaging the 
country, not me. They, however, care nothing for the country," 
Duran-Ballen stated when he commented on the "perverse 
obstructionism." 
  Despite the blocking of the bills, the government has 
announced it will start to privatize some of the 167 public 
firms this year. This action is part of the "Modernize the 
Government" program which will also reduce the number of 
bureaucrats and fiscal expenses. "We will continue the program 
until 1996" (when his term ends), reiterated Duran-Ballen today. 
"The crazy opposition will not stop us," he added.

  [Editorial Report] Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish on 22 
February publishes on page 6 a 700-word article by Carlos 
Mariano Godoy and Noelia Villalba describing a police clash with 
peasants near Simon Bolivar, in Caaguazu Department. 
  The authors say that "several peasants were beaten with 
truncheons and four policemen were injured with stones" during a 
confrontation between the departmental National Police and 
peasants closing Highway 3. The article says the peasants were 
protesting for better prices for their products and against the 
arrest last week of some peasants in Campos Morombi, San Pedro 
Department. 
  The article states: "About 50 policemen arrived in the area 
at 1045 and disbanded the demonstrators occupying the highway 
without using any type of arms." However, the peasants began 
throwing stones when police removed tree trunks from the 
roadway. Police then reacted and beat some of the peasants with 
truncheons. The peasants, however, closed the road again soon 
afterward and threw stones at some passing vehicles. 
  The authors say the impasse continued until Caaguazu 
Governor 
Mario Soto Estigarribia and national Deputy Silvio Ovelar came 
to talk with the peasants, promising to address their grievances 
and to arrange a meeting with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
  The authors say peasant leader Jose Ruiz Diaz addressed his 
fellow peasants, saying: "We will leave the highway now and go 
home to take our arms in order to get ready for tomorrow," 
because if President Wasmosy does not agree to our demands "we 
will close the highway again" and "we will fight the police with 
the same weapons they use against us."

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondents" Nestor D. Escobar </F>
Franco and Jorge Caceres] 
  [Text] Coronel Oviedo -- After almost three hours of 
negotiations between peasant leaders and President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, there are no prospects for finding a solution to the 
social demands since the two parties did not reach concrete 
agreements. President Wasmosy accused Deputy Hermes Chamorro of 
being a "communist" during the meeting held in the Coronel 
Oviedo departmental Government House on 22 February. Wasmosy 
made the accusation when Deputy Chamorro demanded that exporters 
of agricultural products like him (Wasmosy) give up a minimum 
part of their profits in favor of the peasants to find a 
solution to the conflict. 
  Chamorro said this request caused an immediate reaction by 
the president, who accused Chamorro of taking a position typical 
of populists and that he was revealing his ideological 
inclination toward communism. 
  Chamorro replied that the accusation of being a communist is 
completely irresponsible and absurd, thus playing down the 
accusation. Chamorro came with the peasant leaders to meet 
Wasmosy, who was accompanied by Ministers Raul Torres 
[agriculture], Carlos Podesta [interior], Nicanor Duarte Frutos 
[education], and Candido Nunez Leon [health]. 
  Chamorro said: "I made the request because I know there are 
exporters of agricultural products who advocate an increase in 
the price of cotton but Cadelpa [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] is 
exerting tremendous pressure on its members to keep their prices 
at the same level." Chamorro added that Wasmosy supposedly 
advocates free competition but in practice, "when they have to 
put that principle, that philosophy, in practice they get 
together and make decisions by a majority. The president is part 
of that clique running the cotton business. Only someone who is 
blind cannot see the peasants' painful situation." 
  Rafael Ruiz Diaz, peasant leader in the Simon Bolivar 
district, said the peasants came out of the meeting with Wasmosy 
disappointed because no agreement was reached and they only 
received promises. Ruiz Diaz said the president practically 
indicated that this case is not in his hands, but he will try to 
find a solution. Ruiz Diaz added that this was not the answer 
they expected. Ruiz Diaz also said, in Guarani: "He clearly 
told us that the government has enough force to prevent road 
closures and to take other measures of force. But we, the 
peasants, are ready to face the government if necessary." 
  He said Wasmosy told them they can sell their cotton freely 
but that the Brazilian buyers, in this case, will have to pay 
the appropriate taxes at the border to take the product. 
  He revealed that the peasants want [words indistinct] 
guaranies per kilogram of cotton, the release of the San Pedro 
peasants under arrest, the distribution of land, and guarantees 
for the land's exploitation. Regarding the peasants under 
arrest, they received the promise they would be released next 
week. 
  Ruiz Diaz said Wasmosy told them that "if we resort to 
force, 
the peasants do not have a chance." Ruiz Diaz then said, in 
Guarani: "As Paraguayans and peasants, no one will run away from 
anyone. There is no such thing as being afraid of each other." 
He reiterated that the peasants will not give in to their 
demands and the peasants have more than enough energy. He said 
[in Guarani]: "There is no such thing as being afraid of each 
other."

  [Text] The Governability Pact Inter-party Board last night 
issued a communique in which it urges the government not to 
resort to the easy alternative of repression in response to 
popular demonstrations which have been silenced for so long. 
Reasserting its continued commitment to seek solutions, the 
Inter-party Board supports the demands of peasants. Moreover, 
it denied that the Inter-party Board had experienced a crisis. 
  After almost four hours of negotiations, Vice President 
Angel 
Roberto Seifart read a communique through which the Inter-party 
Board members reassert their determination to continue to seek 
solutions to national problems. The communique adds that they 
support the demands by peasants to increase cotton prices for 
the current harvest. 
  The communique adds that the Governability Pact seeks to 
prioritize all technical studies that urge the government to 
grant needed financial increases for farmers. 
  They express their hope that the establishment of the Social 
Development Council, which was proposed by the Inter-party 
Board, will be an effective way to solve overall social problems 
and to implement social welfare policies, and not just to solve 
current problems. 
  The communique urges the national government not to resort 
to 
foolish repression in answer to popular demonstrations which 
have been silenced for so long without first exhausting the 
possibility of dialogue as a way to find solutions to the 
demands. The communique states that the Inter-party Board is 
willing to mediate. 
  The Inter-party Board members call for an urgent meeting 
with 
the president to discuss the extent of Decree 436/93 issued on 
25 September 1993 establishing restrictions on the free 
marketing of cotton. This meeting will probably be held 
sometime this week. 
  Asked about the role of the Governability Pact within the 
Social Development Council, Vice President Seifart said it will 
continue to work because political parties will play a relevant 
role in this new council. 
  Seifart denied that the Inter-party Board experienced a 
crisis. He said that some political party leaders have refered 
to the current situation. PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal 
Party] leader Domingo Laino explained the extent of his 
statement, stating he never mentioned the possibility of 
breaking the Governability Pact, rather of making demands on the 
government. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives from several 
political parties, including Miguel Angel Montaner (PDC) 
[Christian Democratic Party]; Victor Sanchez Villagra (PRF) 
[Febrerista Revolutionary Party]; Juan Carlos Galaverna and 
Eugenio Sanabria Cantero (ANR) [National Republican Association 
- Colorado Party]; Domingo Laino and Juan M. Benitez Florentin 
(PLRA), among others.

  [Text] Marxist-Leninist followers on 19 February 
commemorated the 66th anniversary of the founding of the 
Paraguayan Communist Party [PCP], recalling the many 
persecutions of the party and the deaths of various leaders 
during the military dictatorships. The political association's 
leaders expressed their commitment to the peasant and labor 
masses during all the ceremonies and acts celebrating their 
anniversary during the week, which concluded on 19 February with 
a political activity at the Salesian school. 
  Socialism as a political and economic alternative for 
Paraguayan society and the responsibility of the leaders of the 
various progressive organizations in the creation of better 
living conditions for peasants, workers, and other social groups 
were the most-discussed items during two panel-debates at Viola 
House during the week. All the activities were organized by 
members of the PCP, which celebrated its 66th anniversary on 19 
February. 
  Two commemorative activities were organized 19 February: 
During the first ceremony a flower wreath was laid at the Ortiz 
Guerrero-Flores public square in Jose Asuncion Flores' honor at 
1000. During the ceremony PCP leaders outlined the participation 
of the creator of the Guarania [Paraguayan music] in Communist 
Party activities. The central activity, which had a political 
and cultural tone, was carried out at the Salesian Sacred Heart 
of Jesus School at 2000. Speaking on the occasion were PCP 
President Ananias Maidana, Febrerista Revolutionary Party 
President Victor Hugo Sanchez, political expert Line Bareiro, 
and others who expounded on the critical situation of poverty in 
the country and proposed a further unity of leftist forces and 
progressive organizations in actions seeking to better organize 
groups affected by the present socioeconomic situation. 
<H5>  "Socialism Has Not Died" </H5>
  Maidana held a news conference. He said Marxism has a lot to 
contribute to the country's new era. "Those who say that 
socialism has died have bad intentions or do not know anything 
about the historic process of peoples development," Maidana said. 
  "A form of socialism has died, yes, but we know that the 
greater victories in favor of the most unprotected groups of 
society have been achieved following pressure exerted by society 
in demand for respect for their rights. The achievements in the 
area of social rights were not won by just conservatives and 
reactionaries," Maidana said. 
  Asked about the PCP position regarding private property, 
Maidana said that at present "we are not against private 
property, but we favor the idea that land should be in the hands 
of those working it, which in this case are the peasants."

  [Text] The three prison police agents seriously wounded 
last night during an attack by a terrorist group on the General 
Manuel Bulnes Prison Police School, located at Carmen and 
Ventura Lavalle Streets, remain in serious condition at 
Carabineros Hospital. 
  The attack occurred at 2310 on 22 February, as was reported 
by Cooperativa's newscast. 
  According to witnesses, a terrorist unit driving two 
vehicles 
fired at the school, seriously wounding three officer trainees 
returning to spend the night at the barracks. The three were 
shot several times. 
  The officer trainees were identified as Nicolas Rusich 
Rojas, 
20, who was wounded in the thorax, left leg, and right arm; 
Gonzalo Hermosilla Grisama, 21, who suffered a serious bullet 
wound in the middle of the right leg and other scratches 
produced by splinters; and Raul Eduardo Arellano Blanco, 21, who 
was shot in the right arm, right cheek, and left leg. The three 
trainees were lucky to survive. 
  So far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but 
police speculate that they might be members of the Lautaro 
terrorist group considering their modus operandi and the type of 
semiautomatic weapons used during the attack. This is the second 
attack in less than 24 hours in reprisal for the transfer of 45 
terrorist prisoners from the former San Miguel prison and 
preventive detention center to the so-called maximum security 
jail. The first attack affected a Carabineros station in Nueva 
Espana, in the Paradero 22 area on Ochagavia Avenue. On this 
occasion, one worker was shot. Now three prison police agents 
have been seriously wounded. 
  However, these were not the only incidents because last 
night 
the terrorist group also placed a bomb in front of Socialist 
Party headquarters at 36 Concha y Toro, in central-western 
Santiago. A specialized police unit deactivated the bomb, which 
allegedly had been placed to protest the eviction by Carabineros 
of terrorist prisoners' relatives who tried to take over the 
site for a couple of hours. 
  Carabineros Investigative Police so far have not been able 
to 
locate the vehicles used by the terrorists in their attack 
against the prison police school. Let us recall that less than a 
year ago terrorists also attacked the Prison Police Security 
Directorate, on (Carmen Conde) and Lavalle Streets, also in 
reprisal for the situation of these terrorist prisoners.

  [Excerpts] Two bombs were planted this morning at political 
party offices in downtown Santiago. The first bomb was 
discovered at 0845 at the Christian Democratic Party central 
headquarters on the Alameda [Avenida Bernardo O'Higgins], 
between Lord Cochrane and San Ignacio Streets at the Eduardo 
Frei Montalva building, which is close to the microenterprise 
building of the Development Bank located at 1436 Avenida 
Bernardo O'Higgins. 
  A suspicious package was found behind a magazine stand. 
According to the first reports, the package had six ammonium 
gelignite sticks wrapped in newspaper. The bomb was discovered 
by Carabineros after they had received a report from a woman 
working in the magazine stand. 
  The case was immediately reported to GOPE [Special Police 
Operations Group], whose personnel came to the area to 
deactivate the bomb. 
  Minutes later a bomb explosion was reported at the Socialist 
Party headquarters at 36 Concha y Toro Street in central western 
Santiago. The bomb caused moderate damage, breaking windows and 
destroying part of the building's cornice. [passage omitted] 
  Let us recall that a bomb was planted at the same Socialist 
Party office late last night. Last night, however, the bomb was 
immediately deactivated by building guards and by Carabineros. 
The Socialist Party has thus suffered two attacks in less than 
12 hours. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Patricio Aylwin pardoned Jorge Marin 
Correa by commuting his sentence to banishment in Belgium. He 
was condemned to 18 years of imprisonment for his participation 
in the robbery of a Lautaro bakery. 
  Marin Correa, one of nine political prisoners still jailed 
in 
the Santo Domingo prison, was not informed of the decision until 
22 February despite the fact he was scheduled to travel this 
morning. He told the press that he disagreed with his banishment 
because in one year he could have obtained his freedom under 
probation or night imprisonment. 
  Despite pleading innocent, he reaffirmed his support for the 
struggle against the military regime. Aylwin still has six 
pending pardon requests, including the most contentious ones 
related to Hector Maturana Urzua, Juan Ordenes Narvaez, and 
Hector Figueroa Gomez, who were sentenced to life imprisonment 
for their participation in an attack against General Pinochet. 
Miguel Angel Colina, Marco Antonio Mardone Villarroel, and Jorge 
Escobar Diaz also are awaiting pardons.

  [Text] The UDI [Independent Democratic Union] has 
criticized the president-elect's predisposition toward 
reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. The UDI, which 
recalled that the Cuban regime has denied freedom to its people, 
demanded that Chilean authorities express their solidarity with 
that suffering, and abstain from supporting a government that 
violates human rights. 
  Deputy-elect Ivan Moreira said there are clear indications 
that the future Chilean Government will attempt to reestablish 
the relations. Among such indications he mentioned the visit to 
Havana by Senator Carmen Frei and Deputy Eugenio Ortega, and the 
meeting they held with Fidel Castro, which Moreira considered 
extremely serious. 
  [Begin Moreira recording] We therefore believe that the 
symptoms that we have described -- the visit to Cuba by Senator 
Carmen Frei and Deputy Ortega, the invitation extended to a 
high- ranking Cuban Government official [not further 
identified], and also the visit that a Christian Democratic 
Party delegation will reportedly pay to Cuba in March -- are 
tremendously serious. All this means, to a considerable extent, 
that the future government of Mr. Frei has the will or intends 
to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. We categorically 
oppose this. [end recording] 
  Moreira added that it is advantageous to maintain 
consular-level relations, but reestablishing diplomatic 
relations would be equivalent to attaching legitimate status to 
the Cuban regime, at a time when this country has a chance to 
return to democracy. 
  [Begin Moreira recording] This measure would give legitimate 
status to this regime, and we are not willing to give legitimate 
status to Fidel Castro. Unfortunately, Latin America and Chile 
apparently do not remember things, forgetting the situation that 
we suffered in the 1970's. [end recording] 
  UDI leaders finally said that their party will do everything 
in its power and will use all legitimate influences to avoid 
reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. 
  As a political party, the UDI will work in the eyes of 
people 
through Congress, and will contact all public offices.

  [Text] Santiago, 22 Feb (EFE) -- Chilean Consul to Havana 
Benjamin Concha reported that Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage 
has been invited to attend Eduardo Frei's inauguration in 
Santiago on 11 March. 
  Lage, who is responsible for the Cuban economy, visited 
Chile 
last year. President-elect Eduardo Frei then invited him -- as 
well as singer Silvio Rodriguez -- to attend the inauguration, 
EL MERCURIO reported today. 
  Deputy Gutemberg Martinez reported on 21 February that, 
within the framework of the visits exchange program, the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC] -- which is the Chilean ruling 
party -- will send an official delegation to Cuba and that he 
will head the delegation. 
  The deputy added that the trip probably will take place in 
March, and United Labor Confederation [CUT] President Manuel 
Bustos and PDC ideologist Jaime Castillo Velasco also will be 
members of the delegation. The CUT is the main Chilean labor 
union. 
  Deputy Martinez explained that the trip's objective is to 
check on the enforcement of human rights in Cuba and on whether 
a democratic transition process is really under way in the 
country. 
  The administration to be headed by Frei is analyzing the 
possibilities of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba. 
  Since 19 July 1991, Chile and Cuba have had diplomatic 
relations only at the level of consulates. 
  Some Chilean entrepreneurs already are doing businesses in 
Cuba. Carlos Cardoen, for example, has hotels and agricultural 
products companies in Cuba.

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma this 
afternoon disclosed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's official response to the invitation conveyed to him by 
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin to attend the Chilean 
presidential inauguration. 
  Sanchez de Lozada says that it is not still advisable for a 
Bolivian president to attend an official ceremony. He added 
that his wife Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada will 
represent him. 
  Silva Cimma read to the press Sanchez de Lozada's reply: 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] He says that for reasons that 
are not beyond President Aylwin's illustrious acknowledgement, a 
visit by a Bolivian president to Chile to attend an official 
ceremony is not yet advisable. He has, however, empowered his 
wife, Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, to represent 
him as a proof of his consideration and personal esteem toward 
their excellencies President Aylwin and President Frei Ruiz 
Tagle. [end recording] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also conveyed thanks for the invitation 
conveyed to him by his Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin, and 
wished the best success to future President Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle. 
  Silva Cimma said it is not suitable to speculate on this 
response which, according to him, does not affect bilateral 
relations. 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] I hope this letter will not 
lead to speculations, considering that the reply to the 
invitation was made in a very delicate way and in terms that I 
think are self- explanatory. Therefore, I am simply announcing 
the official report, and that is it. [end recording] 
  Diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were 
disrupted 
after the Pacific War of the last century, when Bolivia lost its 
outlet to the Pacific Ocean.

  [Text] Pedro Lizana, president of the Industrial 
Development Association, Sofofa, presented a sort of protest to 
Foreign Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico in regards to 
measures adopted by Mexico against our country due to alleged 
unfair trade practices involving fishmeal. 
  Lizana and Corpesca [Fishing Corporation] leaders met Diaz 
Albonico to express their total annoyance at the measure, which 
Lizana characterized as discriminatory, because the Mexicans 
have made a basic mistake in definition by believing that anyone 
can dump a raw material such as fishmeal. 
  Asked about Mexico's intentions, Lizana said: 
  [Begin Lizana recording] Well, we cannot judge a country's 
possible intentions when adopting certain measures. But it is 
clear, since we are talking about a product freely traded in the 
world market, that when you leave one supplier out you let 
another supplier in. [end recording] 
  Under Secretary Diaz Albonico was also consulted on the 
issue. He said that on 18 February he met Mexican Foreign Under 
Secretary (Rosario Grin) to discuss the discriminatory character 
of the measures adopted by Secofi [Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat]. 
  [Begin Diaz Albonico recording] The measures are 
discriminatory for two reasons. First, because they only punish 
Chilean products; and second, because the tariffs or quotas 
established for the products are much steeper than the tariffs 
that existed before the signing of the economic cooperation 
agreement. [end recording] 
  Diaz Albonico said the previous tariff on fishmeal was 15 
percent while today it is nearly 24.8 percent, adding that this 
is discriminatory. 
  According to Diaz Albonico, the Mexican under secretary 
showed concern about the problem and talked with Secofi 
officials about it. Chilean authorities expect Secofi officials 
will be able to visit Chile and investigate the matter at the 
beginning of March in order to solve the problem before Eduardo 
Frei's inauguration. Diaz Albonico said the Mexican under 
secretary believes there is political willingness to drop the 
sanction, which is absolutely provisional, and that Chile has 
made Mexican administrative authorities aware that the country 
does not implement any dumping practices.

  [Text] Chilean Air Force [FACh] Commander General Ramon 
Vega has confirmed that the replacement of the old Hawker 
Hunters with newer combat planes has become a real "necessity" 
for the FACh. In an interview with EL MERCURIO, Vega said he is 
not concerned by the recent purchase of 36 combat planes by 
Argentina because "they should modernize their air materiel just 
as I have the duty to keep the Chilean Air Force completely 
operational." 
  Last week, following long negotiations, the U.S. Government 
authorized the sale of the A-4M Skyhawk bombers to Argentina. 
They will be equipped with more modern radar systems than those 
originally installed. 
  Vega said: "On the orders of their respective authorities, 
they are replenishing their inventory." 
  According to British sources during the Falklands war 
(1982), 
Argentina lost 103 airplanes, among them 26 Mirages, 31 
Skyhawks, 23 Pucaras, and 18 helicopters. 
  Vega said the FACh is concerned about current technological 
demands. It believes the expeditious replacement of the old 
Hawker Hunter fleet, which is still in use, is a necessity. 
  He said: "This in no way means an arms race. It is the 
result of real operational need." 
  Vega added: "Moreover, we have very good ties with air 
forces 
of other Latin American countries, as shown by the participation 
of Argentine, Peruvian, and Brazilian planes in the upcoming 
Fidae [International Aerospace Fair] 94, which is a good sign of 
the understanding and rapprochement, and of the projects we 
share, with bordering countries." 
  Vega said vast new ties have been established, which can be 
expanded even further through the implementation of projects in 
areas of common interest. 
  He said: "It is good for us to talk with our peers because 
the main challenge that faces us is the acquisition of 
scientific and space knowledge, which demands joint training." 
  Asked about the choice of planes to replace the 10 Hawker 
Hunters which have been in operation since 1967, General Vega 
said there are advanced studies on a definitive model. 
  Without disclosing any names, he said this change does not 
mean the FACh budget will not be met or that new expenses will 
be generated because previous studies took into consideration 
these expenses and national defense costs. 
  Chile purchased 53 Hawker Hunter planes. Despite excellent 
combat performance they are not equipped to carry missiles or 
modern bombs. 
  Their basic characteristics (speed, height and flight 
autonomy) are comparable to the A-4 which Argentina has in its 
inventory since 1970, but they lack the electronics and radar 
systems of the Argentine Skyhawks. 
  Vega said: "The FACh cannot lose the two groups of Hawker 
Hunter jets that are out of service. We know that -- for 
reasons of the budget -- it is almost impossible to replace this 
number of planes, but we are negotiating to recover at least one 
of these squadrons." 
  The FACh commander said there are several interesting 
choices 
on the international market and the issue has already been 
discussed with the defense minister "with positive results." 
  Asked about the possibility of purchasing Russian-made 
planes, which are currently very cheap, Vega implied that the 
idea is very remote. He said such a purchase would cause a 
drastic technological change and, consequently, high expenses in 
personnel training and the purchase of new equipment. 
  He added that the FACh has always opted for the most 
economic 
solutions for the country, prioritizing -- for example -- 
modernization programs over purchasing new material. 
  Vega stated: "It is a good solution because, like computer 
systems, airplane systems evolve very fast but the shell does 
not. In this way we modernized the entire electronic equipment 
of the Mirage 50 and the F-5E planes, thus increasing their 
operational life for several years." 
  One solution apparently being studied for the replacement of 
the Hawker Hunters is to buy more F-5E planes, which can be 
refurbished at a low cost. 
  Regarding his trip to the United States, which is scheduled 
for 20 to 26 February, Gen. Vega said he will visit the U.S. Air 
Force Aerospace Command. 
  He said: "We want to expand our knowledge in this field and 
to promote some kind of support so as to start our own programs." 
  Vega said the future of all nations lies in space and that 
it 
is necessary to promptly undertake studies in this area. 
  He said: "We must acquire this technology immediately 
because 
this is where the future lies." He did not deny the possibility 
of contacting Russian experts. 
  Vega added: "We are not planning to train an astronaut or a 
cosmonaut. This would be a very big step and we must first 
overcome many stages. The first is to establish a training 
program for our people in new terminology and systems. We want 
an experimental program to enable us to become better acquainted 
with this new technology, and we want to establish a specialized 
FACh department." 
  Vega said that a "political decision" is needed prior to the 
implementation of this long-term project. 
  He said: "With this support, we can fulfill the dream of 
building an experimental satellite within 10 years."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alvin Alaniz Gonzalez] </F>
  [Text] Based on Article 25 of Law 28, the Statute on the 
Autonomy of the Atlantic Coast Regions of Nicaragua, a law still 
unregulated, the Atlantic Coast received a green light for 
embarking upon the 42-day-long election campaign with the 
presence of the eminent magistrates of the Supreme Election 
Council, headed by its chairman, Dr. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren. 
  During the opening ceremony that began after 1500, a little 
over an hour later than scheduled and even so not graced by the 
sacred words of our national anthem, Dr. Fiallos Oyanguren 
summoned the 14 political groupings that will participate in the 
election jousts ending on 27 February of this year to conduct a 
high-minded campaign free of the violence that he said would 
only usher in death. 
  However, what can we coastal dwellers expect of this 
election 
campaign that is now officially under way? 
  Speaking for myself, I believe a great deal. Enjoying the 
right to exercise suffrage, we shall be able to elect those who 
for four years will sit in our regional legislative body, the 
Autonomous Regional Council. 
  Nor is that all. The wide diversity of candidates among whom 
the coastal people may choose will enable them to determine for 
whom they should vote. 
  It is not simply a matter of candidates, but also of the 
parties that back or represent them. That is why it is necessary 
to express opinions about some of them so as to provide another 
perspective. 
  The people, particularly along the Atlantic Coast, need to 
be 
told very little about the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN). They need only to be reminded of the years during which 
it was in power, of the barbarities committed against our 
people, the suffering of the mothers, the hunger, death, and 
despair. Furthermore, its candidates include members of the 
fortunately now defunct Ministry of Interior. 
  The Central American Unionist Party (PUCA), a party with 
minimum strength in the region and which in the 1990 elections 
received all of 120 votes. Throughout these years, its presence 
on the Coast has been little or nil. 
  The Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN), a party that tries to 
sell the idea that it is the representative of the working 
class. However, what can we expect of a party whose top leader, 
Dr. Gustavo Tablada, betrayed the Nicaraguan people by forming 
the sadly famous "Center" group and, in a vile alliance with the 
Sandinists, assumed the presidency of the National Assembly? 
  In the case of the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC), 
one 
cannot speak of betrayal, for it has been a force that has 
opposed the current co-government on the national level. 
However, since this contest is merely regional, one must note 
that its "leaders" are not even from the Coast, nor do they 
enjoy the sympathy of the voters. 
  The Nicaraguan Christian Social Party (PSC) is in truth a 
party that is not representative and that enjoys no popular 
support. 
  The Nicaraguan Democratic Party (PADENIC) presents itself to 
the people with some new faces and others that belonged to other 
parties. It attacks the administrative corruption that 
unfortunately besets certain government agencies, but without 
presenting any real alternatives to the problems of the Coast. 
  The Democratic Action Movement (MAD) is known in Bluefields 
as the Group of the 20 because that was the approximate number 
of persons who greeted its top leader when he visited our port 
city. 
  It could once have been said of the Nicaraguan Resistance 
Party (PRN) that it had the support of a large sector of the 
population, but when it incorporated into its ranks individuals 
who had held public posts, it did not do so in the proper manner 
and has thus lost support and strength. 
  Let Us Save the Atlantic Coast (DEX) is a movement that 
wants 
to save the Coast, but is running candidates in only one of the 
15 districts. 
  The people view the Authentic, Autonomous Coastal Movement 
(MAAC) as a movement having close ties with the Sandinists and 
are therefore reluctant to give it their trust. 
  Yatama is a party that lost its identity from the moment it 
made a pact with the Sandinists, a party in which one cannot 
have confidence because it generated a lack of stability in the 
region. 
  The Coastal Democratic Alliance (ADECO) is the work of the 
governor and deputy from the "Center" group, Dr. Alvin Guthrie 
Rivers, who with four years in the regional government is 
running in order to solve the problems of the Atlantic Coast. It 
is not very difficult to find persons among its members who are 
highly unpopular with the people. 
  The Conservative Popular Alliance (APC) is a party which on 
the national level turned its back on the people and has become 
involved in the activities of the illegal National Assembly. 
  The National Opposition Union (UNO), after serious research 
and consultations with the people and based on the real problems 
and needs of the people, presents new faces, persons with proven 
honesty, capabilities, and a firm willingness to make progress 
in our region. It is doing its utmost to achieve full 
application of Law 28. 
  It should be stated that, just as it has demonstrated on the 
national level, the UNO [National Opposition Union] has not been 
able to govern in our region either. On the contrary, government 
has been in the hands of persons who have taken advantage of the 
administration of public service to get rich illicitly, so that 
the UNO is now seeking to take over the government and restore 
the people's confidence. 
  It is the voters who will have the last word and who, in the 
secrecy of the voting booths and advised only by their 
conscience, will know how to make their votes count.

  [Text] After the elections of 25 February 1990, the date on 
which the people elected the president and vice president of 
Nicaragua, the representatives to the National Assembly, the 
members of the regional councils of the Autonomous Regions of 
the Atlantic Coast, and the members of the municipal councils 
(in the latter case, only on the Pacific Coast), we, the 
citizens and residents of the Atlantic Coast, were the first 
Nicaraguans to participate in an election campaign and later, in 
elections for members of the regional councils, in the RAAN as 
well as the RAAS, which make up the Atlantic Coast with 
approximately 50 percent of the national territory and 10 
percent of the national population. 
  It should be noted that in the RAAS, for the purpose of 
elections, Article 84 of the existing Election Law divided our 
region into 15 districts. By means of universal, equal, direct, 
free, secret voting, the people will elect three councilmen in 
each until 45 members have been chosen to make up our Regional 
Council, this in accordance with Article 19 of Law 28, known as 
the Statute on the Autonomy of the Regions of the Atlantic Coast 
of Nicaragua. One unique feature is that in Zone 8, which 
includes Haulover, Rocky Point, Laguna de Perlas, Raitipura, 
Kakabila, Set Net, and Tasbapauni, the first candidate on all 
the lists presented by the political parties, alliances, and 
associations supported by the people must be Misquito. In Zone 
9, which includes the Corn Islands, the first candidate must be 
Creole or "Criollo" or, as they say on the Pacific Coast, a 
Black candidate, a term that is pejorative in our region. 
  In Zone 10, which includes the mouth of the Rio Grande, the 
first candidate must be a Sumo. In Zone 11, made up of Brown 
Bank, La Fe, San Vicente, Orinoco, Marshall Point and Wawashang, 
the first candidate must be a Garifono. In Zone 12, which 
includes the area of the Rama and the communities of Ramacay, 
Turswani, Dukunu, Cane Creek, Punta Aguila, Monkey Point, and 
Wiring Cay, the first candidate must be a Rama. Finally, in the 
area of El Tortuguero, the first candidate must be a Mestizo. 
The purpose of all this is to guarantee the presence on the 
Regional Council, which is the highest legislative authority by 
virtue of its resolutions and ordinances, of the six ethnic 
groups that survive in our region and that are, in sum, the 
following: the Mestizo, Misquito, Creole or Criollo, Sumu, 
Garifon ethnic groups, or peoples and their branches, who 
obviously wish to join in the development of the Atlantic Coast 
by preserving their own culture. 
  In my opinion, the Supreme Election Council, together with 
the regional, municipal, and communal authorities, continue to 
conduct a civic crusade to see that all participants respect the 
existing Election Law, the regulation of election ethics and the 
statute on autonomy. They do so in order that the elections on 
the Atlantic Coast, which are obviously a prelude to the 
national elections in 1996, will become a civic event in which 
voters may freely debate their ideas and in which our people may 
vote for the government platforms that are the best supported 
and most viable. In other words, they wish to ensure that 
persuasion and conviction take the place of the threats and 
coercion of decades past and thus continue to build in practice 
the state of law that we coastal residents and Nicaraguans in 
general have dreamed of for centuries, bearing in mind the words 
of Jose Marti to the effect that men who love build and those 
who hate destroy. We coastal dwellers must not hate one another, 
when the idea is for all of us to join together in solving our 
problems: the lack of infrastructure, jobs, food programs, 
housing construction, clothes, medicine, health centers, and 
education, all in keeping with our social realities.

  [Text] A religious leader, a Sandinist politician, and the 
president of the republic are the figures who command the most 
support and elicit the least opposition from the Nicaraguan 
people, according to the poll that M&amp;R Consultores conducted 
between 18 and 23 December 1993. 
  Cardinal Miguel Obando was viewed favorably by 71 percent of 
the respondents, followed closely by Sandinist leader Dr. Sergio 
Ramirez Mercado with 66.4 percent. 
  Sixty-five percent of the 697 persons polled by M&amp;R 
Consultores had a favorable opinion of the president of the 
republic, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
  "What do you think of these well-known figures?" the 
pollsters asked, going down a list of political, religious, and 
business leaders. 
  In the political sphere, 47.7 percent of the respondents had 
a favorable view of the secretary general of the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front], Daniel Ortega, while 48.7 percent 
had an unfavorable opinion of him. 
  General Humberto Ortega, the chief of the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army], was regarded favorably by 44.5 percent of the 
697 respondents and unfavorably by 50.4 percent. 
  In addition, 54.3 percent described the standing of 
Managua's 
mayor, Arnoldo Aleman, as "very good" or "good," while 40.8 
percent said it was "poor" or "very poor." 
  According to M&amp;R experts, the margin of error of this 
poll is 
just 4 percent, which is acceptable for this kind of survey. 
<H5>  Ranking of Politicians and Deputies </H5>
  "Who was the best politician?" was another question, and 
27.3 
percent replied "no one." Some 14.3 percent chose Daniel Ortega; 
11.5 percent Arnoldo Aleman; 6.6 percent Antonio Lacayo; and 5.5 
percent Sergio Ramirez. 
  Just 1.4 percent leaned towards Alfredo Cesar; 0.6 percent 
chose Ramiro Gurdian; 0.3 percent Moises Hassan; 0.3 percent 
Francisco Mayorga, and 0.1 percent Luis Sanchez. 
  In answer to the question "Who was the best deputy in 1993?" 
a significant 22.5 percent said "no one," while 35.7 percent 
said they were "not sure." 
  In any case, Sergio Ramirez, the deputy who heads the 
Sandinist bloc, did the best in this regard, being so regarded 
by 13.8 percent of the respondents. He was followed by Alfredo 
Cesar with 5 percent, Miriam Arguello with 2.9 percent, and 
William Ramirez with 1.6 percent. 
  Another question was "Who was the outstanding woman of 
1993?" 
The respondents mentioned President Chamorro, Conservative 
leader Miriam Arguello, human rights defender Dr. Vilma Nunez de 
Escorcia, and TV host Karen Santamaria. 
  Some 11.9 percent of the respondents voted for Chamorro; 5.7 
percent for Arguello; 4.4 percent for Nunez de Escorcia, and 4.2 
for Santamaria. It bears noting that 11.2 percent replied "no 
one," and 30.6 percent said they were "not sure." 
  According to 60 percent of the respondents, the best public 
official was "no one." Some 10.8 percent mentioned Managua mayor 
Arnoldo Aleman as a fine public official, and 6.6 percent chose 
Antonio Lacayo, the minister of the presidency.

<F P=106> [Article by Adolfo Miranda Saenz] </F>
  [Text] I am motivated to write on this issue because three 
prominent liberals have discussed it recently: the president of 
the PLIUN [Independent Liberal Party for National Unity], Dr. 
Alfonso Moncada, in an article on LA PRENSA's opinion page; Dr. 
Guillermo Selva, a director of the PLI [Independent Liberal 
Party] in an interview with LA PRENSA; and the president of the 
PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal Party], Dr. Arnoldo Aleman, on 
Radio Corporacion. 
  As the president of the PLIUN, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, says, 
with the collapse of socialism the liberal principles that exalt 
man are gaining more currency than ever. Humanist liberalism. 
The social liberalism that advocates equal opportunity, social 
and economic justice, truly fraternal relations among the 
members of society, and broad freedoms. 
  I am talking about progressive, revolutionary liberalism 
(even though at times these words may seem discredited), which 
has nothing to do with the economic neoliberalism that makes the 
poor poorer. Now that socialism has failed, progressive, 
revolutionary liberalism is one of the hopes for the world's 
poor. 
  Nicaragua needs such progressive, revolutionary liberalism. 
Regrettably, however, the PALI [Liberal Party] (which has no 
further names and sports a plain red flag with neither symbols 
nor letters) is split and thus unable to develop its full 
potential. We must seek liberal unity. 
  I will mention Dr. Moncada once again, acknowledging that he 
is right when he says that liberal alliances can be established 
with parties that have a liberal ideological foundation even 
though they do not call themselves liberal. I am thus 
enthusiastic about the fact that the PLIUN, the PUCA [Central 
American Unionist Party], and the PJN [National Justice Party] 
(which is predominantly Evangelical Protestant) are coming 
together to seek solutions to the nation's problems. Unity for 
change. 
  But this does not rule out efforts towards unity among all 
liberals. I thus would like to bring up once again a point on 
which Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and Dr. Alfonso Moncada agree: a 
liberal plebiscite. 
  The liberal rank and file need to be summoned to a 
plebiscite 
from which will emerge a broad-based convention that will unite 
the Liberal Party (without any other names, with a single flag 
and a single anthem: the "Beautiful Sovereign"). Each liberal 
faction or group would run its slate of candidates for 
convention delegates in each municipality, and the delegates 
would then be chosen in proportion to their vote so that all 
groups (PLIUN, PLI, PLC, PALI, etc.) would be represented 
proportionally no matter how small they may be. 
  But let us not forget our brothers in the PUCA and the PJN. 
Their liberal roots run deep and are long-standing. Ever since 
Zelaya and even before it there has been a strategic liberal 
identification with the Morazan Central Americanists and the 
Evangelical Protestants, and thus we will have to include them 
in any plans for liberal unity. All the more so now that they 
have joined with the PLIUN in seeking political solutions to the 
problems of our people. 
  Nonetheless, what the head of the PLI, Dr. Guillermo Selva, 
said also makes a great deal of sense. Although there would be a 
plebiscite for total unity, that would take time and cost money. 
This is why I agree with him that the first step would be to 
form the Liberal Federation with all liberal parties or parties 
holding a liberal philosophy, without exclusions, and on an 
equal footing (until we count heads to find out how strong each 
group is). 
  Why wait any longer? Yours truly is a member of the PLIUN 
but 
not an officer. At least not now. I am thus publicly challenging 
the Boards of Directors to see which one will take the 
initiative and, paying more attention to common ground than 
differences (which we naturally have, since there are "wings" or 
"factions" in every party), invite the others to begin talks 
towards a Liberal Federation. Like many other liberals, I am 
ready to work and contribute in whatever modest way I can to 
achieve liberal unity. 
  But the floor now belongs to party officials like Dr. 
Virgilio Godoy, Dr. Arnoldo Aleman, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, etc. I 
am issuing the challenge...let us see who takes it up. 
  Let me go somewhat further. We must do more than seek 
liberal 
unity. For the good of Nicaragua each political family must seek 
its own unity. The Conservatives. The Marxists. The Social 
Christians. This would strengthen Nicaragua politically, because 
it is absurd for such a small country to have so many parties.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sergio Ramirez] </F>
  [Text] I have the feeling that as 1994 opens we are on the 
verge of some further positive political developments. I am not 
going to emphasize the demise of what used to be UNO [National 
Opposition Union], which had been expected for months. It is the 
future of the national political understanding that I must 
discuss. 
  First of all, it is healthy for Nicaragua that the hub of 
consensus-based political decision-making will from now on be 
the National Assembly. The blocs that seek to give the country a 
stable framework will do a great deal there to further such 
stability. We can be sure of that. 
  Moreover, I do not foresee any new crisis in the Assembly, 
like those of recent years, that might hamper or disrupt 
national life. The Assembly will operate normally, with equally 
normal annual elections of authorities, from now until 1996. We 
can also be sure of that. 
  The Assembly is going to pass the constitutional reforms 
before May 1994; they will be substantial and profound and will 
be designed to strengthen the system of democratic 
participation, the balance between the branches of government, 
the judicial system and the electoral system, and the 
transparency and integrity of public service. 
  These reforms will also give the Assembly new functions in 
decision-making on fiscal policy and in the ratification of 
international financial agreements, as well as in the 
appointment of judges, the comptroller, the attorney general, 
and a new and much needed post, the attorney general for human 
rights. 
  The idea is not to turn the Assembly into a substitute for 
the Executive Branch. That would be preposterous and tactless. 
The Executive Branch must preserve intact its powers to run the 
government. The idea is, however, that the issues affecting 
citizens ought to be aired in the Assembly, the national public 
forum par excellence, and that the citizenry ought to know in 
advance what is involved when, for example, a tax is going to be 
imposed or a commitment signed with a financial body such as the 
IMF. These reforms of the constitution will not have to include, 
as some would like, express bans on certain individuals holding 
public office or running for elected office just because they 
have family ties with the president of the republic. As they 
have been proposed so far, such bans smack of revenge. And 
constitutions cannot be reformed on the basis of first and last 
names. This has been one of our past vices and ought to remain 
buried in the past. 
  The National Assembly, with the political consensus of its 
deputies, must also make headway in passing laws of great 
national significance that have to be enacted in 1994, such as 
the Labor Code, the Law of Military Organization, a Tax Code, a 
Fisheries Law, and a Law Against Drugs, among others. The 
country can be sure that its Assembly will be a political hub, a 
hub of consensus, and will pass laws that benefit the nation. 
  The time has now come to forge national political accords 
that have weight and substance. Parties cannot keep on playing 
the "thumbs down on him" game or go around threatening to expel 
others, as the parties that remain in what used to be UNO are 
now doing. That indeed is preposterous. Those who want no 
agreement have expelled those who do. 
  The Christian Democrats showed exemplary courage in deciding 
to join the National Assembly when they did. Other parties, the 
APC, the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement], and most of the 
deputies of the PSD [Democratic Social Party], are now walking 
into the Assembly with their heads held high, aware of what they 
are doing. Theirs too is a courageous decision. 
  Why? Because they are walking in to help the country get 
moving, not to continue thwarting and delaying national 
solutions. Let those who remain on the outside, screaming and 
threatening, stay there. Less and less attention will be paid to 
them. 
  The point now is to work and build. We are starting the year 
off on this positive note. And I am sure that it will last and 
that it will bear fruit.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Emigration a Cause for Concern"] </F>
  [Text] A sensational series of special reports produced and 
published simultaneously by BARRICADA and LA NACION several days 
ago confirms that Nicaraguan emigration to Costa Rica is a 
worrisome social phenomenon, owing both to the extent of the 
problem and to its immediate and short-term implications. 
  This wave of emigration, unlike the one in the 1980's, is 
due 
neither to political nor ideological factors. Its causes are 
entirely socio-economic. 
  Some 150,000 Nicaraguans have emigrated to our next-door 
neighbor, whether legally or by sidestepping border posts, 
solely because despair "abounds" and jobs "are scarce" here. 
  "Why should we come back?" Nicaraguans ask. The backdrop to 
this question is significant. It unquestionably suggests that 
they see neither a present nor a future in our country. As far 
as they are concerned, there are not even remote prospects for 
improvement. 
  This in itself ought to prompt in-depth reflection by the 
government and multilateral financial organizations, inasmuch as 
it confirms that economic policy over the past three years has 
been on the wrong track. 
  In addition, this emigration shows that political and armed 
confrontation is doing irreparable harm to the country and, 
therefore, that a national understanding leading to a period of 
peace and stability is urgently needed. All political forces and 
all segments of society bear some degree of responsibility in 
this regard. 
  Nicaraguan and Costa Rican authorities met last week in 
Costa 
Rica to hammer out a joint migration policy that would put an 
end to the wave of deportees and "rejects." The effort is a 
praiseworthy one, inasmuch as abuses are being committed. It 
still remains to formalize this joint policy, however. 
  The Nicaraguan Government has requested an "immigration" 
amnesty for the thousands of our citizens who remain in hiding 
in Costa Rica, but the authorities there do not "look favorably" 
on the request, particularly because Costa Rica is in the home 
stretch of a general-election campaign. 
  Emigration is an issue with major human implications, and 
therefore both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican society urgently need 
to develop an awareness of it. Otherwise, it would be neither 
unusual nor unlikely for xenophobia to begin emerging in Costa 
Rica against Nicaraguans. That would be a serious and dangerous 
development for our brothers.

<F P=106> [Part two of two-part article by Reinaldo Antonio Tefel] </F>
  [Text] Some people's concept of renewal is similar to that 
of the revenge-minded extremists who belonged to what was known 
as UNO [National Opposition Union]: the ostracizing and 
destruction of adversaries. They do not share the culture of 
dialogue and consensus. Others conceive of unity as a 
"straitjacket" to prevent renewal; they are mired in the past, 
having turned into pillars of salt. 
  Neither concept is acceptable. Both seek the destruction of 
Sandinism and any other group, as is happening with the former 
UNO. This dichotomy must disappear and give way to a sincere, 
dialectic, and transparent relationship based on the founding 
element, on new and 100-percent democratic bylaws, and, above 
all, on observance of these bylaws. 
  The founding element that unites us all is the historic 
legacy of Sandino, an element that belongs to all Nicaraguans, 
not just Sandinists. This historic Sandinist legacy leads us to 
the ongoing civic struggle for the "effective democracy with 
social justice" that Sandino dreamed of. The new program that 
the Special Congress will pass must interpret and update 
Sandino's dream. 
  Today I will attempt to outline some basic ideas for the new 
democratic structure that could be embodied in the new bylaws if 
the Sandinist people and the Special Congress reach a consensus 
on them. 
<H5>  The Current Congress, Out of Step </H5>
  The first issue that arises can be seen in the major 
question 
that Erick Aguirre posed in EL SEMANARIO: "A new Congress in an 
old bottle?" We all know that the current Congress is out of 
step and that some of its members are not involved in politics. 
Is this Congress capable of undertaking sweeping renewal? 
Wouldn't it be better if the Sandinist Assembly passed the new 
bylaws provisionally so that they could ultimately be passed, 
rejected, or amended by the Special Congress? If this were 
possible, all of its structures could be completely renovated, 
from top to bottom, in accordance with the provisional bylaws. 
  If the feeling is that legally this cannot be done or that 
there is not enough time to do so, then the new national 
authorities that are chosen at the Special Congress should serve 
only during a transition period ending at the Regular Congress 
of 1995. I raise this possibility for debate at the Sandinist 
grass roots. 
  Now then, what do I think are the basic ideas for achieving 
democratic renewal amid unity through the bylaws and through the 
election of national authorities? 
<H5>  Suggestions </H5>
  1. A transparent, fair electoral process in which all 
Sandinists take part and in which it is impossible to hand-pick 
representatives must be guaranteed. The elections must be public 
and held in jurisdictions of appropriate size: in small 
municipalities and in districts in large municipalities. 
District and municipal authorities, Departmental Congresses, and 
the National Congress must be chosen at this election. There 
ought to be overseers for the slates of candidates. Elections by 
"clubs" or "covens" must not be allowed. Small groups must not 
be able to usurp representation of the entire Sandinist people 
in a district or municipality. If we were able to hold the 
freest general elections in the history of our country and of 
all Latin America, the ones on 25 February 1990, why can't we 
hold such elections among ourselves? 
  2. In order to achieve a more balanced representation of 
differing views across the various segments of society, besides 
within territories, it would be politically prudent to elect the 
representatives to the Congress as follows: half directly in the 
districts and municipalities and the other half in Departmental 
Congresses. Rank and file leaders would tend to be chosen at the 
former, and national political, social, economic, and cultural 
leaders at the latter. The Congress would thus represent all 
segments and viewpoints of the Sandinist people. 
  3. Since the National Leadership has already played its 
historic role effectively, in keeping with a period of history 
other than the present and while exercising predominant 
influence, the bylaws must establish a new collective and 
democratic political leadership in the form of two complementary 
bodies. 
  3.1. The Sandinist Assembly, as the delegate body of the 
Congress and, therefore, as the highest authority while the 
Congress is in recess, would consist of 125 members, plus the 
departmental political secretaries, broken down as follows: 100 
members directly elected as such by the Congress and the 25 
members of the Sandinist National Council. The Sandinist 
Assembly would be chaired by its own, annually elected Board and 
would hold regular sessions every four months and special 
sessions when a third of its members so request or when an 
absolute majority of the members of the Sandinist National 
Council so resolve. 
  3.2. The Sandinist National Council would be the executive 
body and would consist of 25 members elected by the Congress. It 
would meet once a month in regular session and would be chaired 
by its Standing Committee, elected from among its members and 
made up of seven national secretaries with specific functions. 
It could hold regular sessions weekly and would submit monthly 
reports on its activities to the Sandinist National Council, 
which would in turn be answerable to the Sandinist Assembly. 
  4. It would be strongly advisable from a political 
standpoint 
to establish a proportional system for electing the two highest 
party authorities in the Congress. The various schools of 
thought within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] 
would thus be functionally integrated. I can find no other 
system that insures true, not rhetorical unity based on genuine 
democratic renewal. Exclusionary, hegemonic systems that lead to 
party rifts must be avoided. 
  On another occasion I will discuss the system for choosing 
the party's various candidates for the general elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with UNAG leader Daniel Nunez by Fabian Medina; </F>
place and date not given; first paragraph is EL SEMANARIO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Daniel Nunez could not stand to complete the rest 
period his doctor prescribed, and he is back in his UNAG 
[National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen] office. His hair is 
barely starting to grow back after chemotherapy for cancer left 
him bald. Despite his haste to get back to work, Nunez, who 
recently turned 55, thinks that no organization can depend on 
one person, on one boss, and he is ready to leave UNAG at the 
time of the 1996 elections. In his frank and down-to-earth 
language, he speaks of his fight against cancer, of his plans, 
and says what he thinks in this interview with EL SEMANARIO. 
  [Medina] Have you had a hard time with your disease? 
  [Nunez] My mother taught me a maxim that is a sort of credo 
for me. It goes like this: "If there is a cure for your problem, 
why complain? And if not, why cry?" This disease has not been 
easy. Cancer is like a curse in a person's life. Often, though, 
your recovery depends on the support you get from friends. I 
have had a great deal of support from really surprising sources, 
from political opponents. They have given me really incredible 
surprises. Local church groups to which I have belonged, in 
Waslala, San Juan del Rio Coco, la Guinea...many people have 
been praying for me. 
  I was quite surprised when in a very poor area in Matagalpa, 
a really impoverished place, the people there unexpectedly paid 
to have a mass said for my health. Those things are really 
priceless. 
  [Medina] Have you recovered now? 
  [Nunez] I really should not be working. They recommended 
that 
I continue to rest, but the truth is that in Nicaragua's 
situation, with all our difficulties, we cannot just sit back. I 
have things to do, I have to have another operation, because I 
now have a hernia. After my surgery, I had chemotherapy. I have 
to go for treatment every three months to keep the disease from 
spreading. 
  [Medina] What was the diagnosis? 
  [Nunez] Cancer. They removed one organ. I also had another 
tumor, or rather I still have it, between the aorta and the 
lung. They did not remove that because it was too dangerous. 
Still, in my last checkup the diagnosis was negative. That gives 
me fairly good chances of being cured. But you know that this 
disease is tricky, you do not know where it will emerge, when it 
will pop back up again. 
  In any event, it makes a person more aware that he is 
living, 
like a plant with a blight, with a disease that it is possible 
to fight and overcome, but it is also possible...that it will 
not be overcome. It makes a person live with more realism. 
  [Medina] How did you spend those three months away from your 
job? 
  [Nunez] First of all, I had to deal with the problem. I 
could 
not sit on the fence. I trusted my comrades on the board of 
directors to handle this work responsibly, and now I have the 
satisfaction of knowing that they did what should have been done. 
  We are facing some problems in the ECODEPA [Let Us Save 
Democracy program], the nation's economic situation affects us 
all, and we believe that great experience has been gained 
through this. For an organization that depends on one leader is 
not an organization. Then you are creating a personalized power 
base, and that is not good. UNAG has the force of the forest, 
meaning that for every tree that falls, another is planted. It 
has the strength to move forward no matter whether one or two or 
three of its leaders have to leave for this or that reason. I 
myself am prepared to leave the organization in 1996, with the 
new election we are going to have in the Third Congress. UNAG 
must move forward because it is not the work of one person, but 
of thousands of campesinos, hundreds of leaders. 
  [Medina] UNAG did very well in the last poll. To what do you 
attribute those results? 
  [Nunez] We have defined a broad sector-oriented strategy. We 
bring together members of cooperatives, small, medium, and large 
producers. And we have depoliticized UNAG. 
  We are also an organization that works to serve producers. 
We 
have projects in many places in Nicaragua, in poor areas.... We 
have a program called "From Campesino to Campesino" that 
involves technology transfer. In this program we teach 
campesinos to improve their production, how to best use their 
fertilizer, to produce their own seeds, and that has 
strengthened the campesino leadership of each region. 
  We have the privilege or the pride of having representatives 
all over the country. UNAG is in Siuna, in Rio San Juan, in San 
Juan del Rio Coco, in Jalapa, it is in the most remote places in 
the interior. We have developed grass-roots leaders in these 
communities. For example, the chairman in each department is 
from that department; they are not imported, but really are 
people from the local communities. The board of directors is 
well balanced, because we have comrades who have come right from 
the proletariat, and we also have good representation in men 
like Juan Tijerino (livestock), Alvaro Fiallos (cotton), Juan 
Ramon Aragon (livestock), and others. That balance gives our 
organization a lot of credibility. 
  We are an institution that works to serve producers. We are 
often concerned because there are producers who think we are a 
ministry and not a trade association that needs the work of 
these producers to sustain itself, to gain more strength in the 
national awareness of the campesino. 
  [Medina] Perhaps that may be related to the state's 
withdrawal from many of its institutions in rural areas--bank 
branches, ENABAS [National Enterprise for Staple Foods], etc. 
  [Nunez] Yes, that is true. We feel the peasants have been 
orphaned by state policies. I am referring to training, 
technical assistance, financing, developing new forms of 
production. For example, there is a big onion-exporting project 
that AID [Agency for International Development] is financing, 
and it has become a closed and favored group in the Sebaco 
Valley, where four or five producers are running it. The 
renovation of coffee production is often in the hands of favored 
groups. The economy in those sectors has not been democratized. 
Rural credit has practically been closed off. The eight private 
banks here say they finance 1 or 2 percent of the agricultural 
production in Nicaragua. That really makes no sense. 
  The government says, "Let us get back to the fields," and we 
say: "Great, excellent, let us go to the fields." But we are not 
going back to the fields; the opposite is true. Today in rural 
areas you have kidnapping, violence, crime, and often the print 
media, radio, and television do not report its true magnitude. 
We believe that this year, 1994, we have to apply a lot of 
pressure, we have to persuade the government that if no strong 
move is made toward rural areas there may be serious problems 
here. 
  [Medina] UNAG is a force in civil society. You have 120,000 
members.... Have you used that power--maybe to apply pressure? 
  [Nunez] We did not want to use it. We have used it to 
organize, to develop national awareness, to tell our members to 
support reconciliation and pacification, that they should 
support the coalition, that they need to support stability in 
rural areas and this transition from war to peace. 
  If we went the other way and encouraged the campesinos to 
challenge IMF policies, there really would have been a serious 
crisis here. The government might not have been able to 
implement any policies. We know the strength we have. We can 
mobilize 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 campesinos. We are using this 
strength to create awareness on a national and international 
level, to support this great productive sector with over 60,000 
small producers, including cooperative members. If some 
ministries continue to turn a deaf ear to appeals from this 
sector, we might be forced...not to abandon the peasants, but to 
take the lead in presenting their most heart-felt demands. 
  [Medina] What ministries do you mean? 
  [Nunez] We have tried to create some common ground with 
IRENA 
[Institute of Natural Resources] but it has been difficult, as 
they have a mindset that the state is the boss, and as the boss, 
the state is the one to implement reforestation policies, and we 
have opposed some of their projects. With the Ministry of 
Agriculture we have had some major differences. They have been 
reported in the newspapers, and we hope that in 1994 things may 
be better. For example, INTA [National Institute of Technology 
Transfer] is being announced with a lot of publicity hype. They 
will have 360 officials. We will see what these 360 bureaucrats 
will do to promote technology transfer for small growers of 
corn, beans, rice, etc. 
  The Ministry of the Economy...well, they have practically 
barred their doors to us. We went to them to protest the problem 
of cattle on the hoof leaving the country. Often when these 
cattle are bought in Costa Rica the livestock's value is not 
declared. The state fails to collect those taxes. Along with 
cattle rustling, there is also an abuse of power. 
  [Medina] But UNAG is both a union group and a business 
group. 
Isn't that contradictory? For example, when you criticize the 
export of cattle on the hoof, are you not acting more to protect 
the interests of CARNIC [Nicaraguan Meat Enterprise] 
slaughterhouses than the interests of livestock producers who 
get their best prices by selling outside the country? 
  [Nunez] Not so. We have criticized this ever since the 
revolution. Furthermore, CARNIC is in itself not a UNAG member, 
but it is composed of a number of producers, cooperative 
members, small and midsized producers. We are never going to put 
economic interests ahead of our sector interests. Let me tell 
you something that is not well known in Nicaragua. In 1993 we 
financed over 10,000 producers of sesame, rice, coffee, and 
basic grains. We have loans to recover, perhaps more than the 
National Bank. We are really interested in getting these 
problems resolved. 
  I do not think this is contradictory, for a group like ours 
has to have an alternative to offer producers. When we buy 
coffee, meat, or sesame, and at the same time we provide some 
products that are needed like agrichemicals and fertilizers, we 
are not acting like a private firm for our own personal profit, 
but rather as a complete enterprise that works with that 
producer to finance his harvest. Here is another example: last 
year we financed all the sesame grown on Ometepe Island. We left 
the island, and in Ometepe no one planted sesame because there 
was nobody to finance it. In Chinandega, 60,000 quintals of rice 
have just been harvested, the result of financing we gave those 
growers. 
  In Matagalpa and Jinotega, large producers owe UNAG about 
$500,000 in financing that we lent them two years ago, which 
they have not yet been able to repay. We acted like a bank, in 
an act of solidarity, in order to alleviate the financing 
situation. 
  [Medina] Where does that money come from? 
  [Nunez] It comes from loans we get from private banks, from 
the National Bank, from projects to supply peasant stores. We 
are creating "rural savings and loan banks." We cannot sit back 
and do nothing. The campesinos are not organizing just for the 
fun of it, but for the options that you mention so that they can 
overcome their economic limitations. 
  [Medina] People say Daniel Nunez could run as a candidate in 
the 1996 elections...because of your leadership and popularity. 
  [Nunez] Many people want to be president of Nicaragua. I, 
Daniel Nunez, think that what we need to do is seek consensus 
and unity so we can change the methods and ways with which 
presidencies in this country have been conducted. We need to 
create a consensus among all the progressive, business, trade 
union, political, and even religious sectors in order to develop 
a new strategy that will allow us to work for Nicaragua, not for 
a specific political party, and also not for a specific person. 
  Through all the conflicts we have experienced, there are men 
here who have emerged as leaders, who have set aside egotistical 
personal interests and are thinking about the nation. Others 
have clung to revanchism. As we have said since 1990, UNAG is 
going to support the most progressive sectors that pledge to the 
people that they will keep us from creating more financial 
monopolies, but instead will seek ways to develop small and 
midsized production. 
  We are going to support whoever pledges to improve economic 
activity in rural areas, who fights to lower the unfair interest 
rates we pay to state banks. We do not want to continue a 
neoliberal policy that will do to us what is happening in 
Chiapas. The Chiapas situation is the product of imposing a 
policy that works only for the privileged sectors, while 
ignoring the people who are left outside. I personally am 
concerned that if this plan continues on its present course, we 
may have an eruption here that we will not be able to control. 
  No, no, what I really want and my actions have demonstrated 
this when I have twice been a deputy to the National Assembly, 
and neither in 1984, nor now.... Why? Because I think the work 
Daniel Nunez does with the peasants, in direct contact with the 
grass roots, is more important than what I could do in the 
National Assembly. We do give guidelines to our UNAG comrades in 
the assembly. 
  We want to make this clear, in 1996 we are going to play a 
major role in getting out the peasants' votes. We are going to 
use all the influence we have in this sector so that the 
peasants will not be left unprotected as they have been by this 
government. 
  We Sandinists will have to make a great effort because we 
owe 
a debt to the people. The national leadership owes a debt to the 
people. The Nicaraguan people defended the revolution with their 
lives because they believed in it. I think that if the Sandinist 
Front, as our party, wants to repay this historic commitment we 
will have to be consistent and broadly based, and not continue 
fighting about presidential candidacies. We have to reach 
agreement to see what alliance we can form with progressive 
sectors. 
  [Medina] So there is no possibility that the name of Daniel 
Nunez will appear on election ballots in 1996. 
  [Nunez] Well, I have no such aspirations. To be president of 
a country a person needs resources. 
  If Sandinism and we Sandinists cannot join together and 
unite 
our forces with the most progressive trade union and business 
groups, social and economic sectors, we will lose the 
opportunity to move Nicaragua forward. I do not think the old 
historic parallels of liberals and conservatives, which are worn 
out and practically meaningless to the people, can offer a 
solution for this change. 
  I am a soldier, and I will always be wherever the party 
leaders want, so long as it is for my country. 
  [Medina] When you say that UNAG will support the most 
progressive sector or party, do you mean that UNAG might not 
support the Sandinist Front in the next elections? 
  [Nunez] If the Sandinist Front were to have the misfortune 
of 
becoming a divided party, how could we support a divided party? 
That is definitely not our aim. If UNAG has worked for anything, 
it is for the unity of the peasants. That unity we established 
with the national resistance was not easy for us, but we have 
demonstrated our unity. 
  The first thing we Sandinists have to work for is the unity 
of Sandinism. If there is no unity in Sandinism, there will be 
no Sandinist victory in 1996, even though we are the most 
powerful force in the country. There are workers, campesinos, 
businessmen.... There are opportunists who have renounced 
Sandinism, who bad-mouth it now, after the people supported them. 
  I say, if the Sandinist Front is divided, I will stay home. 
I 
will not support an election with a divided Sandinist Front, for 
that would be the worst tragedy that could happen to the 
Nicaraguan people.

  [Text] Brasilia, 23 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government's 
anti-inflationary program was strongly supported today when, in 
a final vote, the bicameral Congress approved the Social 
Emergency Fund, described as a vital instrument for the 
program's implementation. 
  The Social Emergency Fund bill received 402 votes, 
equivalent 
to 80 percent of the 500 congressmen -- of a total of 584 -- who 
participated in the vote. Ninety-five legislators voted against 
the government. 
  After the general support for the bill, the congressmen will 
vote on various proposals to change particular points. The 
government guarantees that it has enough support to achieve the 
rejection of these proposals to change particular points. 
  The Social Emergency Fund, endowed with $16 billion, will 
allow the government to curb inflation through direct control on 
public spending in social security and special health and 
housing programs and programs to eradicate hunger and misery.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Do you believe that the 
economic program drafted by Minister Cardoso will in the end be 
implemented? 
  [Amorim] I believe that a very important step was taken with 
the approval of the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] by Congress. 
This approval will allow the government to eliminate the public 
deficit, thus taking the first step toward controlling inflation. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Is the success of the economic 
plan 
still endangered by any political hurdle? 
  [Amorim] Evidently everything can be politically negotiated, 
but the most difficult aspect of the plan was really related to 
the approval of certain taxes, which had to be debated within 
the framework of the constitutional revision. This difficulty 
has already been overcome, in a first round. We trust that it 
will also be approved in the second round, because the issue 
protects the interests of the country, and not of the government. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] How long will it take for the 
effects of the stabilization program to begin being noticed? 
  [Amorim] They will be noticed in the very near future, I 
believe. The plan's approval by Congress has already had a 
positive psychological effect. Naturally, the plan also has a 
monetary stage. In this stage, the inflation rate will have a 
more concrete and immediate decrease, although it may take two 
or three months for this to happen. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] This sort of program generally 
brings about a stabilization of the national currency. In this 
case, will the value of the real cruzeiro increase? 
  [Amorim] We are seeking to stabilize our national currency, 
but we want to do it without falling into the other extreme, 
which is economic recession. Brazil has many inhabitants and a 
labor market full of young people. It is very important that 
the process does not hinder economic growth. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the government try to prevent 
the exchange rate from falling, harming export products? 
  [Amorim] The stabilization of the exchange rate will result 
from domestic monetary stabilization. It will not be the result 
of a law ordering the indexation of the cruzeiro to a foreign 
currency. It will come about naturally, as a consequence of a 
public deficit equal to zero and of the monetary measures which 
are being implemented. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] The other Southern Cone countries 
are expecting an opportunity to increase their exports to 
Brazil. This is why the exchange rate aspect of the 
stabilization program is important to them. 
  [Amorim] I believe that the growth of the Brazilian economy 
is what will really favor those who export to Brazil. When the 
economy grows, as it did in 1993, our partners' exports to our 
country increase a great deal. I think that this is more 
important than the type of exchange rate. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Everything leads one to the 
conclusion that in 1995, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
will have a unified tariff system but will not yet be a common 
market. When do you believe the conditions will be adequate for 
coordinating macroeconomic policies, and reaching the goal 
established by the Asuncion Treaty? 
  [Amorim] Some fundamental stages must first be overcome. We 
are moving very fast, in a manner that has perhaps not occurred 
anywhere else in the world. We are completing the trade 
liberalization process. In 1995 we will have a unified tariff 
system, which may not be perfect, at least not with regard to 
all products, but there will be a schedule to unify the tariffs 
of the products that still have different tariffs. 
  I believe that this naturally results in creating harmonious 
policies for various fields, such as for example rules for the 
capital markets and financial flows that have been agreed upon 
by the Mercosur member countries. 
  I therefore believe there will be a natural unification 
resulting from the requirements of the trade liberalization 
process and of the Common Foreign Tariff. 
  [EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO] Will the full enforcement of a 
common market depend in the domestic stability of the member 
countries? 
  [Amorim] This is taking place very fast. You can see that so 
far Europe still has no overall monetary policy, because it does 
not have a single currency or a single central bank. I 
therefore believe that the common market can exist with free 
capital flow and hand labor, which are other elements of the 
common market, even before the creation of an entirely completed 
macroeconomic policy. 
  Surely there must be agreement about these policies, but I 
believe they will come about naturally, because all countries 
are engaged in the same process.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has informed Labor Force President Luiz Antonio de 
Medeiros that after the adoption of the URV [Real Value Unit], 
all salaries will be compulsorily converted into the equivalent 
of the average dollar value of salaries in the past four months. 
After meeting the labor leader, the minister said the average 
value will be the minimum value for workers, who will negotiate 
their final salary values in URV's with businesses. Workers 
earning higher-than-average salaries, like those with a 
collective agreement renewal date in February, will have their 
salaries converted into URV's at the nominal value, Medeiros 
said. 
  According to Medeiros, the Finance Ministry is determined to 
set the minimum salary at a figure that will be equivalent, in 
URV's, to slightly more than $60 -- $63 or $64. Medeiros, who 
said on 21 February that he would not agree to negotiating the 
average value, said after the meeting that he was satisfied. 
  "It is a good beginning for the negotiation," he said. 
  Cardoso said that "in this transition phase we do not want 
the purchasing power of workers to drop," adding that he intends 
to talk with other labor leaders, like CUT [Sole Workers Center] 
President Jair Meneguelli and Vicente Paulo da Silva Campo, aka 
Vicentinho -- the president of the metalworkers' union of Sao 
Bernardo do Campo. The minister said the government has not made 
a decision yet on the salary conversion proposal. 
  The method for compulsory indexation of private sector 
salaries by the average value is ready. According to Finance 
Ministry sources, all workers, except for B Group workers -- for 
whom salaries will be converted to URV's in March -- will 
benefit more than under the existing salary policy. This will 
happen because the URV will adjust real salaries on a monthly 
basis, while the existing salary policy guarantees partial 
adjustment only of salaries equivalent to up to six minimum 
salaries. 
  The finance minister said that, apparently, the "minimum 
salary" equivalent to the average of the last four months is the 
formula that will best preserve salaries, despite the fact that 
other alternatives also are being considered. 
  According to the minister, salaries will not be increased 
and 
the URV will serve as a safeguard, giving them daily protection 
against inflation. 
<H5>  The Position of Team Members in the Balance of Power </H5>
<H5>  The Winners </H5>
  Edmar Bacha -- The special Finance Ministry adviser 
advocated 
adoption of a fixed rule for converting salaries by the average 
value, on the grounds that free negotiations between workers and 
employers still must be approved by Congress. 
  Sergio Cutolo -- The Social Security minister, who like 
Bacha 
has experience in previous stabilization plans, claimed that the 
time required for free negotiations would be longer than the 
period expected for the transition from the URV to the new 
currency. 
  Winston Fritsch -- The economic policy secretary, who in the 
beginning was for freedom of the market, finally was convinced 
by Bacha's claim that the government needs to establish salary 
conversion rules. 
<H5>  The Losers </H5>
  Persio Arida -- One of the designers of the stabilization 
plan, Arida is against any type of government intervention in 
the private sector. He has always advocated that conversion to 
the URV should be voluntary and not compulsory. 
  Walter Barelli -- Since the beginning of the talks, he has 
upheld the thesis that the government should adopt a single 
criteria for converting prices and salaries into URV's. His 
position was defeated on 21 February. 
  Pedro Malan -- Identified as a neoliberal, the Central Bank 
president also has advocated the URV's voluntary adoption by 
society. He was defeated by Bacha's arguments.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Foreign Minister Cesar Amorim said 
yesterday that the Brazilian Government will avail itself of the 
decisions made at the Uruguay Round of GATT talks to reach 
agreement with the United States on the patent law. After 
meeting with the ministers of finance, industry and commerce, 
science and technology, and culture -- Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, Elcio Alvares, Jose Israel Vargas, and Jose Roberto 
Nascimento e Silva, respectively, whom he briefed on his 
negotiations in Washington last week -- Amorim declined to say 
if an agreement will be reached. He said: 
  "I believe the agreements of the Uruguay Round give both 
sides a set of conditions for reaching an agreement. However, I 
cannot give assurances such an agreement will be reached." 
  Amorim confirmed that under U.S. law, 28 February is the 
deadline for an agreement. He added that an eventual accord 
must be ratified by the Brazilian Congress within the normal 
deadlines for the approval of the patent law. Once approved by 
the Chamber of Deputies, the bill will be submitted to the 
Senate and return to the Chamber of Deputies if the 
modifications requested by the United States are included. 
  Amorim said that during a conversation with U.S. Commercial 
Representative Mickey Kantor last Wednesday, "suggestions, new 
ideas, and imaginative proposals were made" for resolving the 
problems created by Brazil's reluctance to recognize 
international patents. 
  After yesterday's meeting, Minister Cardoso said Brazil will 
uphold its basic demands during the negotiations with the United 
States.

  [Text] Washington -- The Brazilian and U.S. governments are 
making a "serious effort" at the last minute to try to reach a 
negotiated solution on the dispute over the protection of 
patents and intellectual property, according to a source close 
to the negotiations. The deadline, which was unilaterally 
established by the U.S. Government last May when actions were 
taken against Brazil in response to a request made by the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical Industry Association, is 28 February. 
  Many talks have been held at various levels following the 
meeting between Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor here in Washington on 16 
February. The implementation of commercial sanctions against 
Brazilian exports by the U.S. Government has not been averted. 
But it is no longer the only choice as it was before the visit 
of the foreign minister. 
  If the negotiations go well in the next few days and lead to 
similar positions on the main points of disagreement, the U.S. 
trade representative could, for example, say that the 
understanding produced sufficient progress to justify the 
suspension of the action but that the U.S. Government reserves 
the right to resume the case and retaliate if Brazil does not 
honor its commmitments within a reasonable time. 
  The terms of the Brazilian commitment are in the note that 
Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima 
delivered to Kantor the day before the visit of the Brazilian 
foreign minister. In the note the Brazilian Government offered 
to submit amendments to the new industrial property code bill 
which is being debated in the Senate to make the Brazilian 
regulation for intellectual property protection compatible with 
the TRIPPS [Trade Related Intellectual Property Protection 
System] which was approved by the Uruguay Round of the GATT last 
December. 
  The amendments to the code will reportedly resolve the 
differences between Brasilia and Washington on Article 27 of the 
TRIPPS which is the most important of the four differences that 
the U.S. Government considers to be "critical." Until recently 
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry argued that the demand for 
"domestic registration" of pharmaceutical patents which is in 
the industrial property code bill that was approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies last year was compatible with the TRIPPS 
which is reportedly "ambiguous" on that issue. 
  The U.S. trade representative said, however, that the 
Brazilian interpretation is incompatible with the TRIPPS and 
that it would not resist a discussion in the GATT.

  [Text] Brasilia -- A total of 24 companies involved in the 
scheme of businessman Paulo Cesar Farias were banned yesterday 
afternoon from participating in public bids or from receiving 
any fiscal benefits from the government. Reconsidering a ruling 
made last December, Judge Novely Vilanova of the Seventh Federal 
Court granted an injunction on the suit filed by the Attorney 
General's Office against former President Fernando Collor, Paulo 
Cesar Farias, Claudio Vieira, and 24 companies for illegal 
amassment of wealth. 
  Judge Vilanova's decision means that any contract signed 
between those companies and the government since the injunction 
was granted are suspended. Among the companies affected are the 
Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, and Tratex construction 
companies, as well as Mercedes Benz do Brasil, Votorantim, and 
the Cooperativa Regional dos Produtores de Acucar e Alcool de 
Alagoas. 
  Late yesterday afternoon Attorney General Aristides 
Junqueira 
sent notes to Ministers Elcio Alvares (Industry and Commerce) 
and Romildo Canhim (Federal Administration Secretariat) 
notifying them on the court's decision. Beside suspending 
contracts and reallocating budget resources, the government must 
now prevent those companies from winding up, changing their 
business status, or merging with others. 
  Reconsidering the first ruling on a request from the 
Attorney 
General's Office, Judge Vilanova emphasized the existence of 
evidence in the law suit against the companies. Pointing out 
the urgency of "mechanisms of morality," Vilanova observed that 
the injunction does not assume guilt. He criticized the 
government, saying: "In face of the illegal actions attributed 
to the companies, the government could have temporarily 
suspended the participation of those companies in new bids. A 
court decision was unnecessary." 
  The companies may still resort to the Federal Regional 
Court. 
The companies may not engage in contracts with the government 
for 10 years. While Collor, Farias, and Vieira have not been 
punished, yet they may have their political rights suspended for 
up to 10 years in addition of losing their assets and being 
fined. 
  The 24 companies affected by the injunction are: 
  1. Construtora Tratex Inc.; 
  2. Construtora Andrade Gutierrez Inc.; 
  3. Construtora Norberto Odebrecht Inc.; 
  4. Cetenco Engenharia Inc.; 
  5. Mercedes Benz do Brasil Inc.; 
  6. Industria Votorantim Inc.; 
  7. Companhia Catarinense de Cimento Portland; 
  8. Companhia Cimento Portland Gaucho; 
  9. Companhia Cimento Portland Rio Branco;

<F P=106> [Article: "No Middlemen"] </F>
  [Text] The businessmen have changed their tactics in 
preparation for the 1994 elections. They are now investing less 
in traditional politicians and turning to their own leaders in 
an attempt to reach the front line in national politics. "No 
middlemen," says Senator Albano Franco (PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party], Sergipe), president of the National 
Confederation of Industry and one of the first businessmen to 
exchange private management for public administration 27 years 
ago. The legalization of business contributions to parties and 
candidates and the fears aroused by revelation of the bribery 
schemes headed by P.C. Farias and Joao Alves have made 
self-financing more attractive. "Since the managers proved to be 
incompetent and corrupt, the best thing for the businessman to 
do is get involved in hand-to-hand combat himself," says Antonio 
Fabio Ribeiro, president of the Brasilia Federation of 
Industries and a stockholder in Encol. 
  In the homestretch of the race for party affiliation--the 
deadline was Sunday the 9th--the switching of people and parties 
was intense. At least four prominent business leaders made their 
choices at the end of the year. The president of the Minas 
Gerais Federation of Industries, Joao Alencar Gomes da Silva, 
landed in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], from 
where he may run for state governor. The former president of the 
Rio Grande do Sul Federation of Industries, Luiz Carlos 
Mandelli, joined the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] and is also 
expected to run for governor. Two other federation 
presidents--Fernando Bezerra (PMDB) of Rio Grande do Norte and 
Miguel de Souza (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]) of Rondonia--will 
seek seats in the National Congress. "We are encouraging our 
fellow businessmen to join, and we now have representatives in 
several parties," says Albano Franco happily. 
  The bevy of businessmen includes the heir to a 
communications 
empire. Edson Queiroz Filho of Ceara, who is a stockholder in 
the Edson Queiroz Group, a 21-company conglomerate that expects 
to bill about $500 million this year, intends to run for the 
Senate. Queiroz, who is Tasso Jereissati's brother-in-law, 
president of the PSDB, and former governor of Ceara, founded the 
PP [Progressive Party] in his state. His decision to be a 
candidate is causing his rivalry with his brother-in-law to 
intensify even further. Queiroz is entering the scene with the 
strength of a group that controls the Green Seas System (the 
Globo Network's affiliate in the state), the DIARIO DO NORDESTE, 
and 23 radio stations. 
  "The new candidacies by businessmen show that the latter 
were 
no longer able to solve their problems quietly through 
negotiations with the administration," says Deputy Flavio Rocha 
(Rio Grande do Norte), heir to the Guararapes textile group. He 
wants to be the PL [Liberal Party] candidate for president of 
the republic. Someone else noting the rush by businessmen to 
enter politics is the president of the Sao Paulo PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] and former minister of agriculture under Collor, 
Antonio Cabrera. With only three days left in which to join a 
party, Cabrera found that among the new party members in his 
state, there were 18 businessmen who wanted to run for federal 
deputy. One of them is Aires da Cunha, owner of Blue Life, the 
country's third-largest private health care group. 
  As orphans of the PRN [National Reconstruction Party], 
several people who had once been part of Collor's troops went 
looking for parties that would help them fulfill their desire to 
return to public life. That was the case with former President 
Collor's friend and backer of the story about Operation Uruguay, 
businessman Luiz Estevao de Oliveira, who is now a candidate for 
district deputy in Brasilia. Although wanting to join the PSDB, 
he had to be content with the PP. Former Minister of Health 
Alceni Guerra, the victim of an unfounded accusation concerning 
fraud in the purchase of bicycles for sanitary agents, is 
considering an invitation to run for the Senate or even for 
governor of Parana on the PFL ticket. 
  The invasion by businessmen is occurring at a time when 
career politicians are losing ground. Several of them are also 
showing discouragement. "I'm tired of this disgusting business," 
says Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB), who will leave the 
governor's palace in Ceara for Harvard University in the 
aristocratic State of Boston [as published] in the United 
States. If he can get a full scholarship, Ciro will spend 12 
months studying economics and political science. After 36 
consecutive years in office, Senator Jutahy Magalhaes (PSDB, 
Bahia) is also going to retire. His place will be taken by his 
son, Jutahy, Jr., former minister of social welfare. The PSDB 
also expects to say farewell to Senator Jose Richa (Parana). 
Defeated in his 1990 bid for state governor and thoroughly 
trounced in the 1993 congressional campaign, Richa has become 
discouraged and has already announced that he will not run in 
1994. 
  Because of all that, Congress is expecting to see more new 
faces than it ever has before. Only 40 percent of the 
congressmen managed to get reelected in 1986. The number fell to 
32 percent in 1990. Governor Leonel Brizola (Rio de Janeiro) 
believes that 85 percent of the current Congress is going to be 
replaced. That change does not necessarily indicate a change in 
the ideological profile of the legislative branch. "Today's 
Congress is worse than yesterday's, and the one we get tomorrow 
will be worse than the one we have today," predicts Deputy 
Nelson Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul). 
<H5>  Election Timetable </H5>
  The parties that may present candidates for president of the 
republic are the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], the PFL, the PL, 
the PMDB, the PSD [Democratic Social Party], the PRN, the PSDB, 
the PT [Workers Party], the PTB, the PP, and the PPR. Here are 
the key dates in connection with the 1994 elections: 
  9 January: Deadline for party affiliation by candidates. 
  2 April: Deadline for resignation from public office in 
order 
to be a candidate; start of the period for holding regional and

<F P=106> [Article: "Inflating the Nest"] </F>
  [Text] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is 
gaining Barelli, Albano, and Aureliano but losing its original 
identity. The search for a slate on which to be a candidate in 
the October elections is transforming the parties into electoral 
Frankensteins. 
  When it was founded, back during the days of the Constituent 
Assembly in 1988, the PSDB immediately acquired a symbol and a 
nickname. Its symbol is the toucan, and its nickname was the 
"Sorbonne Party," a reference to its necktie-sporting leaders 
with their doctorates. So far the party has remained faithful to 
its mascot, but not to its nickname. Over the last few days, the 
party has picked up members as disparate as an economist with 
ties to unions, a business leader, and a rancher. In other 
words, it has attracted a sympathizer of the PT [Workers Party], 
a former member of Collor's PRN [National Reconstruction Party], 
and a former bionic governor from Arena [National Renewal 
Alliance]. To put things even more clearly, the party has been 
joined by Minister of Labor Walter Barelli; Albano Franco, 
president of the National Confederation of Industry (CNI); and 
former Minas Gerais Governor Aureliano Chaves. What do the three 
of them have in common? Until a few days ago, they had nothing. 
Now they have the party. 
  The "Frankensteinization" of Brazilian parties had a 
deadline. According to the election timetable approved by 
Congress, politicians wanting to be candidates in the elections 
of 3 October had to join a party by Sunday the 9th. Just before 
that date arrived, the parties received an avalanche of new 
members who, on the pretext of offering electoral benefits, 
ended up further eroding the distinctiveness of the various 
parties. Besides the PSDB, the phenomenon also had a strong 
effect on at least two other parties: the PP [Progressive Party] 
and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. But it was in the PSDB 
that the repercussions were greatest. 
  The toucan symbolizing the PSDB is now sporting a promising 
forelock [a reference to President Franco]. It was with the 
support of President Itamar Franco and his team that the PSDB 
gained Barelli and Albano Franco. The party also took in 
Minister of Justice Mauricio Correa, who had been without a 
party since his break with Leonel Brizola and the PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party]. The invasion by politicians with 
different plumages has caused an uproar in the tucano nest. "The 
only thing lacking is for General Figueiredo to join the PSDB," 
Deputy Edmundo Galdino (PSDB, Tocantins) raves. 
  The strongest objections have concerned Albano Franco. The 
senator was invited to join three months ago by Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and PSDB President Tasso Jereissati, 
who is Albano's partner in a bid to win the contract for 
cellular telephones in Ceara. The PSDB bloc in the Chamber of 
Deputies, headed by Deputy Jose Serra, opened its beak at the 
time and is still complaining. Reactions opposing Albano have 
also come from Sao Paulo, where the PSDB is strongest. Senator 
Mario Covas, the PSDB's candidate for governor of Sao Paulo, has 
told friends that he would not like to see Albano on the party 
slate. 
  But the most indignant reaction has come from Senator Jutahy 
Magalhaes, Sr., who is threatening to change parties if Albano's 
membership is not rejected. The problems between the two men 
involve a murky family quarrel. As minister of social welfare, 
Jutahy Magalhaes, Jr., did everything he could to get rid of the 
Brazilian Welfare Legion (LBA) headed by Leonor Franco, Albano's 
wife. Leonor not only managed to keep the LBA intact: she was 
even appointed to be the new minister of social welfare. 
  Although controversial, Aureliano's decision to join has not 
caused a commotion equal to the one created by the arrival of 
Albano. "I have no aspirations to be a candidate," says the 
former governor and former vice president. "I joined the PSDB 
only in order to have a platform for the more consistent 
exercise of citizenship," he philosophizes. With a new look and 
a little mustache as well, Aureliano withdrew from politics 
after bringing up the rear in the presidential election of 1989. 
Despite his denials, he is behaving like someone who wants to 
run for state governor, but along the way he is going to 
encounter PSDB member and former Minister Paulino Cicero, who 
also has his eye on the governorship of Minas Gerais. 
  While the addition of Albano and Aureliano to the party has 
been viewed with distrust, the same cannot be said of Barelli's 
decision to join. The minister has not only been well received: 
he is already the subject of jokes. Barelli is being called the 
PSDB's most likable economist, making him a counterpoint to 
Deputy Jose Serra's difficult temperament. 
  The 1994 elections may also include the charms of the most 
refined Rio de Janeiro elite. Socialite Regina Marcondes Ferraz 
is the most illustrious acquisition by the PPR in Rio de 
Janeiro. Now that she has joined the party at the request of 
former Minister of Finance Francisco Dornelles, Regina will have 
someone in the party with whom to discuss Chanel's latest 
collection. The reason is that the PPR has also received 
reinforcement in the form of the first lady of Alagoas, Denilma 
Bulhoes, who is in the habit of wearing the most famous European 
labels while campaigning in the environs of Maceio. Regina may 
not have Denilma's political experience, but she does not 
consider herself a novice. "During the 1989 presidential 
campaign, I even held meetings in my home for Maluf," she says. 
"Considering all the chaos in which the country finds itself, I 
decided that it was time to participate more fully, so I joined 
the PPR." Regina has not yet decided whether to be a candidate, 
although her friend Dornelles is pressing her to do so. 
  Taken by a sudden interest in politics since he began 
courting former Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello, humorist Chico 
Anysio also beat the deadline for party affiliation by choosing 
a party, although like Regina, he is not confirming his 
candidacy. Chico chose the PP. One of those at his side will be 
union leader Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, president of Union Power. 
Medeiros first considered joining the PSDB, but he was 
intimidated by the posturing of the party leaders in Sao Paulo 
with all their plumage. Since the perch was so narrow, he chose 
to land in the PP, which has "progressive" in its name and a 
bunch of conservatives in its ranks. To give an example, he will 
be in the company of Brasilia businessman Luiz Estevao, Fernando 
Collor's inseparable friend--one of the latter's few inseparable 
friends, let it be said. The PRN, which had more than 30 
deputies at the start of the Collor administration, is now down 
to seven musketeers. 
<H5>  Three Party Models </H5>
  PSDB: Known as the party of intellectuals, it now presents 
an 
eclectic profile: the standard PSDB member wears the hat of 
Aureliano Chaves (formerly of the PFL [Liberal Front Party]), 
has the face of Minister Barelli (formerly almost a member of 
the PT) and the body of businessman and Senator Albano Franco 
(formerly of the PRN), and wears the tennis shoes of Deputy 
Maurilio Ferreira Lima (formerly of the PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party]). 
  PPR: The party that has always had the face of Maluf is 
acquiring new ingredients in addition to the unmistakable bald 
head of Esperidiao Amin. The party is celebrating the solid 
acquisition of First Lady Denilma Bulhoes. Socialite Regina 
Marcondes Ferraz has also joined, although she denies wanting to 
be a candidate. 
  PP: This is one of the newest and most heterogeneous 
parties. 
It has the distinctive hair of former Governor Alvaro Dias 
(Parana), the huge mustache of Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the 
body of Professor Raimundo/Chico Anysio, and the legs of 
Governor Joaquim Roriz (Federal District), who is having a rough 
time on the CPI [congressional investigating committee].

<F P=106> [Article written by Jayme Brener with the cooperation of </F>
Helio Contreiras in Rio de Janeiro and Otto Sarkis in Brasilia: 
"Dr. Von Braun's Return"] 
  [Text] H.O.P. are three letters that stand for pure 
dynamite. They are the initials of Lieutenant Brigadier Hugo de 
Oliveira Piva, the father of the Brazilian space program and of 
half a dozen domestic missile projects. His name stirred a 
great deal of controversy in the 1980's when he went to work for 
Iraq's Saddam Husayn with Brasilia's concurrence, although such 
concurrence was never fully assumed. Well, the man behind 
these three letters is back. At 67, and retired since 1987, 
Piva is quietly serving as an informal adviser -- although 
without pay -- for two of his old projects, which were 
resuscitated in recent months through new doses of government 
funds. These projects are the MAA-1 Piranha (an air-to-air 
missile) and the MSS 1.2 (surface-to-surface missile). 
  Piva knows that his name, or just his initials, has been at 
the center of one of the worst controversies in the history of 
Brazilian-U.S. relations. The fact is that Uncle Sam has never 
forgiven him for his cooperation with Saddam Husayn, who was 
thrashed in 1991 during the Gulf war on an initiative of the 
White House. To avoid further friction, "the brigadier" -- 
Piva's nickname -- has not put his signature on any of these 
projects and, officially, he continues to work as an 
international dealer of a large number of products ranging from 
black pepper to machine tools. This is a rather sad job for 
someone having two doctorate degrees -- in aeronautics and 
applied mathematics -- from foreign universities and who had 
become known as "Brazil's Dr. Von Braun," in reference to German 
scientist Wernher von Braun, the pioneer of aerospace research 
in the United States. Yet, Piva's dream is to be able to come 
back through the front door to the field of arms manufacturing 
or to the Brazilian aerospace program. Speaking to ISTOE, he 
said that he might be able to do that during the next government 
"if it is favorable to resuming the materiel, aeronautics, and 
nuclear industries given their role in promoting development and 
national sovereignty." 
  Piva said: "I view the resumption of Brazilian missile 
projects with satisfaction and reassurance because these 
projects will promote advanced technology -- which is essential 
for the progress of any nation -- in every area." He added: 
"After all, I regard these projects as my children whom I used 
to hold on my lap." To a certain extent, he still holds them. 
The Aeronautics Ministry has entrusted the development of the 
Piranha project -- under an $8.8 million contract -- to the 
Mectron Engineering Company, which is based in Sao Jose dos 
Campos [Sao Paulo State], without a prior bidding process in 
light of its being highly specialized in the field. Working 
for Mectron are Piva's "scientific children," that is, a 
handful of researchers who worked with him after graduating from 
the tough Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA) and 
participated in the early stages of the Piranha project. They 
followed the brigadier to two missile factories: Orbita, a 
mixed company, and Avibras [Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc.] a 
private company. Then, in 1989, they left for Iraq. Their 
mission was to develop an air-to-air missile. Those who turned 
to the dictionary to look up the word for piranha in Arabic -- 
if there is one -- made the right move. They all had a 
humiliating return to Brazil as the Brazilian Government was 
aligned with the anti-Saddam alliance and denied any 
responsibility concerning the work of the scientists. Piva said: 
"The Collor de Mello government was dominated by foreign 
interests and needed a scapegoat." 
  Following the Iraqi affair, the leading members of the team 
of researchers created Mectron while Piva announced his 
retirement. In 1992, Mectron obtained a contract with the Army 
to complete the MSS 1.2 surface-to-surface missile, which is now 
being tested. Piva helped them secretly. Now, Mectron -- which 
has a little more than 30 employees -- is grabbing a slice of 
the Piranha project. Mectron Technical Director Renato Zanetta 
declines to comment on his ties with his mentor. According to 
Major Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of the Aerospace 
Technical Center (CTA), "Piva has nothing to do with this 
project." Yet, the man whose initials are H.0 P. has given 
Mectron -- in addition to his expert advice -- papers, sketches, 
and diagrams of the Iraqi Al-Piranha. All this was done 
secretly because Hugo de Oliveira Piva, a retired lieutenant 
brigadier earning the equivalent of $1,400 monthly, continues to 
quietly run his company Spaceplus from an office located above a 
lingerie store in downtown Sao Jose. 
  The award of contracts to Mectron, a company that is very 
close to Piva's heart, would then be a well-earned 
acknowledgement of the work of somebody who has been racking his 
brain to produce missiles, wouldn't it? This is what the 
majority of the military involved in the project believe. But 
insiders in the military hardware industry, who are already 
"hot-tempered" by nature, are even more troubled. The sharpest 
thrusts come from Avibras, at present the only manufacturer of 
rockets in the country, also located in Sao Jose. Avibras Vice 
President Rubens Porto contends that "our advice has not been 
sought for the development of the Piranha missile, but if we 
were consulted we would have alternative projects." Major 
Brigadier Jose Marcone, deputy chairman of the Brazilian 
Commission of Space Activities, adds that "Avibras was not 
interested in the Piranha." An engineer satirizes: "The truth 
is that Avibras was never able to recover from the killing off 
of scientists made by Piva there." 
  Piva and Avibras have not been on speaking terms for a long 
time. In 1991, when the company entered into composition with 
its creditors, Piva was hired by a bank to make an estimation of 
the equipment offered by the company as collateral for the 
payment of its debts. When Piva went to the Avibras' 
facilities, which have very strict security control, he 
presented himself as "engineer Hugo de Oliveira." When Avibras 
managers saw their rival on the premises they got the fright of 
their life. From there to pressing charges of industrial 
espionage there was only one step. 
  Piva smiles when talking about this incident. His smile 
vanishes when he recalls that in spite of being the father of 
the renaissance in the Brazilian missile industry, the latter is 
far from being the apple of his eye. His real pet answers to 
the name of V.L.S., satellite launching vehicle, a project that 
goes back to the 1970's but that was hamstrung by lack of funds. 
Last year, however, the project was revived because the 
government promised to invest $40 million in the sector in the 
next three years. It is estimated that the V.L.S. will be 
launched in 1995 carrying a satellite that will also be of 
Brazilian make. 
  The only thing is that the acronym V.L.S. -- as well as the 
initials H.O.P. -- is tantamount to having problems with the 
United States because Brazil is not a signatory to the 
international treaty on the control of missile production. The 
Brazilian Government guarantees that the V.L.S. project -- which 
is being developed by the newly set up Bahia Space Agency since 
the end of January -- is a purely civilian endeavor -- green and 
yellow [the colors of the Brazilian flag] and not olive green. 
Notwithstanding this, the White House mistrusts Brazil given 
the fact that whoever has the know-how for launching satellites 
may very well launch a military missile having a range of 1,000 
km. The United States is also suspicious of all the other 
countries that have refused to sign the aforementioned treaty, 
namely India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Iraq itself. U.S. 
military have gone as far as hinting that Piva may have used the 
V.L.S. technology to upgrade Iraq's Scud missiles. By using its 
clout, the U.S. Government did its utmost to delay the Brazilian 
aerospace project. Its last bid for delaying it was to ban 
Brazil from having access to inertial platforms, the devices 
that guide the rocket. Piva and Brigadier Taveira from the CTA 
argue that the problem has already been overcome. A CTA 
official notes, in a state of euphoria that "we have even 
managed to buy a computer for the rocket from the United 
Kingdom, a faithful ally of the United States." "We thought 
that they were not going to deliver it," he added. The most 
skeptical ones, however, contend that the satellite launcher 
still has many shortcomings and that the frequently claimed 
self-sufficiency is all but designed to lure possible suppliers 
of the necessary equipment. 
  If the Brazilian aerospace program is already facing 
difficulties, one can very well imagine how it fared after 
Piva's signature. Even though he has many friends and disciples 
at the CTA of Sao Jose dos Campos, Piva tries to avoid even 
coming close to the center. As a friend of his notes, "his face 
shines when he talks about the V.L.S.." As soon as he starts 
working on exportation and importation, Piva's thoughts wander 
to what is in store for him. He does not rule out the 
possibility of wearing a researcher's overall. H.O.P. says he 
does not support any candidacy in particular, but concedes that 
"Lula's [Luis Inacio da Silva] PT [Workers Party] has supported 
the development of the military hardware industry, which is 
precisely what I have always defended." In conclusion, he says: 
"I could go back to that area if I were asked to do so by a 
government that follows those guidelines, whether it represented 
the PT or any other party."

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Feb (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government 
today lamented the "aggravation of the fratricidal war" in 
Angola, asking for an immediate cease-fire in the African 
country, which has strong cultural links with Brazil. 
  In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated 
that the cease-fire can contribute to the successful conclusion, 
in the short-term, of the negotiations under way in Lusaka, the 
capital of Zambia, between the Angolan Government and National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) guerrillas. 
  The note emphasizes that both sides should accept the result 
of the elections held in September 1992, in which Angolan 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos emerged as the winner, and 
should observe the UN Security Council resolutions calling for a 
cease-fire. 
  The Brazilian Government stated that the aggravation of the 
Angolan war in the past few weeks "is more deplorable at a time 
in which there were sound hopes for peace on the basis of the 
conversations under way in Lusaka."

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>
  [Text] [Retired] General Ruben Dario Paredes has confirmed 
that a group of [former] military officers is drafting a 
proposal to reinstate the National Guard within the structure of 
the Public Force. This proposal will be submitted to 
presidential candidates and to the Legislative Assembly. 
  Paredes disclosed that a group of military men, including 
Daniel Delgado, Carlos Arosemena King, Gerardo Garcia, Aquilino 
Sieiro, Juan Antonio Guizado, and Severino Mejia, is preparing a 
draft of the Public Force Law. He added that their purpose is 
to establish a foundation, in which professionals from various 
fields will participate, to offer the public a public security 
project. 
  Gen. Paredes, who retired on 12 August 1983, said he 
personally advocates the reestablishment of the National Guard 
as a component of the current Public Force. He explained that 
this component would be made up of 600 men and would be equipped 
with weapons that "would not threaten anyone." He said it would 
be in charge of the security of the Panama Canal and the defense 
of the borders. 
  The concept of the National Guard emerged in 1953, when 
President Jose Antonio Remon Cantera enacted a law that changed 
the national police into a national guard. In September 1983, 
Panama's former strong man Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega changed 
the National Guard into the Defense Forces, which the 1989 
invasion dismantled and changed into the current Public Force. 
  On 15 September 1992, Juan Chevalier, former government and 
justice minister, presented a 115-article bill to enact the 
Public Force's basic law. It establishes four components of the 
Public Force: the National Police, the Air Service police, the 
Maritime Service police, and the presidential police. 
  Gen. Paredes said the military men who are working on a 
proposal on public security matters must use the Executive 
Branch's bill as a foundation, but they must also incorporate 
the concept of a National Guard. He believes that 99 percent of 
military members have come to understand that the healthiest 
path for Panama is "the consolidation of democracy," but there 
is still a small number of people who "are yearning for the past 
alongside (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega." 
  The former National Guard commander also warned that with 
the 
departure of the U.S. Southern Command, there is "danger" there 
will be a "power vacuum" in Panama. Paredes pointed out that 
by distorting the people's mandate, a government leader could 
take advantage of the situation to utilize the Public Force to 
hold on to power. He added that this situation could trigger 
the return of the "vicious circle" that existed in Panama since 
1903, when economic and political interests took over the Public 
Force.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov 
arrived in Panama yesterday at the invitation of the government 
to strengthen ties of friendship and trade between the two 
countries. Mamedov, who will remain in Panama two days, will 
meet today with President Guillermo Endara and will later meet 
with Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino. He will meet with the 
local and foreign media tomorrow. 
  The Russian deputy foreign minister was met at Tocumen 
International Airport by Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero 
and members of the Russian Consulate. Alexis Ermaro, Russian 
consul in Panama, said this is the first time a high-ranking 
Russian Government official has visited Panama since the Soviet 
Union was dissolved two years ago. Ermaro said the deputy 
foreign minister will also meet with Panamanian businessmen to 
study the benefits of trading with Panama. 
  The consul approved of Mamedov's visit because his 
government 
is mainly interested in the trade potential, given Panama's good 
relations with the European markets. Likewise, he said the two 
countries wish to establish technical, trade, and financial 
cooperation to strengthen those relations. The diplomat did not 
give details about the meetings or the topics that the Russian 
authorities would discuss with the Panamanian authorities during 
the two-day visit. 
  Trade relations between the two nations have gradually 
developed after the Soviet Union disappeared.

  [Text] Panamanian and Russian diplomatic sources have 
disclosed that yesterday in Panama City both countries signed a 
Consultation and Opinion Exchange Protocol. The document was 
signed for Panama by Foreign Minister Jose Mulino and for the 
Russian Federation by Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, 
who arrived in Panama on 20 February and returned home yesterday. 
  In the protocol the sides agreed to periodically consult and 
exchange opinions with each other on bilateral issues, common 
problems, and topics that are discussed at international forums. 
  Mamedov said the signing of the document "constitutes a 
historic moment for relations between Panama and Russia, 
especially with regard to both country's political and 
commercial prospects." The diplomat, whose words were 
officially translated into Spanish, asserted that Panama plays 
"a very important role" in his country's foreign policy, and 
added that this event "marks the beginning of our political 
relationship." 
  Panama and Russia established consular relations on 29 March 
1991. 
  Meanwhile, Mulino said the Russian diplomat's visit "is an 
unprecedented event in the history of Panamanian international 
policy because, among other things, it is the first time a 
ranking Russian official has visited our country." Mulino said 
he is certain that relations between the two countries will 
prove to be very beneficial. Regarding his meeting with Mamedov 
and President Guillermo Endara, Mulino explained that they 
discussed both countries' complex and difficult transitions to 
democracy.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino recently addressed 
the 20th OAS Special General Assembly held in Mexico. He said 
the Panamanian Government priority is to resolve the country's 
social problems and emphasized that a large percentage of the 
1994 budget has been dedicated to the social sector (education, 
health, housing, and public works). 
  Minister Mulino said the Panamanian Government feels each 
country should contribute, taking into account their respective 
human and material resources, to the establishment of a new 
hemispheric cooperation phase based on equality, social justice, 
and reciprocal respect and benefits. The OAS, said Mulino, has 
been enriched with the protocols of Washington and Managua. The 
inclusion of extreme poverty as a basic objective for integrated 
development and the creation of the Inter-American Council for 
Integrated Development have been decisive steps in the struggle 
we have initiated and to which we are all committed, the 
Panamanian minister added. 
  Additionally and as an initiative of this special general 
assembly, Foreign Minister Mulino added, Panama completely 
supports the proposal to declare 1994 the year of social 
integration, with the objective of establishing social 
integration as a priority of Inter-American cooperation. 
  Minister Jose Raul Mulino also emphasized to the 20th OAS 
Special General Assembly delegates the importance of the current 
electoral process in Panama, which is pluralist and free, to the 
country's democratic consolidation. On 8 May [election day] and 
1 September [inauguration day for the elected government], a 
difficult and complicated transition period will have ended and 
the elected government will find a country that is active 
economically and has been institutionally and financially 
reconstructed, the Panamanian minister reported. He also 
invited all the OAS delegates to attend the elections as 
observers and verify Panama's significant democratic 
advancements.
