  [Text] The Arab League has asked the international 
community and the United Nations for immediate action to halt 
massacres of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina perpetrated by the 
Serbs, who take advantage of the world silence and the blockade 
that prevents any defensive weapons from reaching the Muslims 
there. 
  In a statement made today, the Arab League General 
Secretariat called on the Security Council to use all possible 
means to restore peace to this republic according to the 
principles of law and justice and not the policy of aggression 
and occupation. 
  In its statement, the Arab League General Secretariat 
emphasized that it is following with extreme concern the tragic 
developments in Bosnia and the Serb forces' continued killing of 
unarmed civilians, especially the tragic incident that led to 
the killing and wounding of 263 Muslims when Serbs shelled the 
capital of Sarajevo yesterday.

  [Text] Algiers, 4 Feb (MENA)--Youcef Khatib, chairman of 
the National Dialogue Conference, has criticized those casting 
doubts on the legitimacy of Liamine Zeroual's appointment as 
president of Algeria because no elections were held. He said 
that President Zeroual gained the support of those attending the 
dialogue and of various political forces in the country, 
including those who did not participate in the dialogue. 
  In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Algeria, Khatib 
said: The political parties that withdrew from the dialogue were 
seeking to frustrate it. We know what their objectives were. 
  He noted that a draft document on organizing the 
transitional 
period was presented for discussion during the dialogue and that 
all the participating parties and organizations approved it. 
  On the reason for amending the draft document's article on 
appointing the president, Khatib said: The draft stipulated 
that the president be chosen by the dialogue and the dialogue 
committee. In view of the withdrawal of the main parties from 
the dialogue, it was decided to go back to the Constitution, 
which gives the Higher Security Council the right to appoint the 
president. This article was amended in accordance with the 
Constitution. 
  Commenting on Bouteflika's nomination for the presidency and 
then his withdrawal, Khatib said: Bouteflika agreed at first to 
become president and was given all the authority he asked for. 
But some parties and political forces objected to him, 
following the leak of his nomination to the press, because he 
does not stand for breaking with the past, which everyone was 
looking for. 
  He stressed that the parties and the people expressed full 
satisfaction with President Zeroual when it was publicly 
announced that he would be president because of his 
qualifications to lead the state. 
  On the contacts with the "banned" Islamic Salvation Front, 
Khatib said that these contacts are continuing and have achieved 
encouraging and fruitful results. He expressed his hope that 
during the next stage there will be positive steps to stop the 
wave of violence in the country.

<F P=106> [Jamal Khashuqji report: "After News of Differences Between </F>
Its Political and Military Leaderships, the Salvation Front 
Prepares To Escalate; No `Gratis' Initiative for Zeroual"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- Sources close to the dissolved Algerian 
Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] have confirmed that FIS supporters 
will escalate "armed action" against the Algerian authorities, a 
signal that the FIS is not prepared to offer the new President 
Major General Liamine Zeroual a "gratis initiative" under which 
it would suspend military operations. This new FIS position 
comes after news of differences between its political leadership 
and those responsible for armed action over contacts with the 
government. 
  The same sources expect the FIS' "serious" military 
escalation to be carried out soon by the FIS supporters who have 
joined the so-called "Islamic Salvation Army." They stressed 
that "information they received from inside [Algeria] indicates 
that the fighters are now in a strong position, having managed 
to close their ranks and secure large quantities of arms and 
continuous sources of supply." The sources believe that any 
"suspension of armed action would lead to a loss of the current 
zeal and drive and could lead to sharp differences in the ranks 
of the gunmen whom FIS' leading ulema had managed to unite." 
  An FIS member who left Algeria recently and wishes to remain 
anonymous for security reasons has stated that "the most 
important recent achievement was the containment of the dispute 
which occurred between Sa'id Makhloufi (one of the Armed Islamic 
Movement's leaders) and the FIS political leadership because 
Makhloufi had thought that the leadership was willing to make 
concessions unacceptable to him." He also said that "another 
achievement" was that "most members of the Armed Islamic Group 
[as published] have joined the Islamic Army, and those who have 
not officially done so are coordinating with the command of that 
army." He noted in this connection that the group no longer 
issues statements in its name, and he cast doubt on statements 
issued in its name abroad such as the statement claiming 
responsibility for the assassination of Cheik Mohamed 
Busulaymani, who was close to the Hamas Movement. FIS leaders 
abroad (Rabeh Kebir and Anwar Haddam) strongly condemned the 
assassination. 
  The appearance of a taped statement with the voice of Sa'id 
Makhloufi, a former officer in the Algerian Army and one of the 
FIS founders who leads an important part of the operations 
against the Algerian regime, criticizing the "Provisional 
National Council" headed currently by Cheik Abdelrazzaq Rejam, 
had raised fears of a possible serious split within the FIS. 
  It is now certain that by moving to escalate, the FIS is 
saying that it has no intention of offering President Zeroual a 
"gratis" initiative calling for the suspension of armed action, 
particularly as "the mujahidin have become a difficult factor 
that cannot be ignored in any future negotiations." 
  It is estimated that the armed Islamic movements have as 
members about 8,000 youths who have joined the military 
operations and are distributed over the countryside where they 
control areas not within the regime's grasp. They form large 
groups each in some cases exceeding 100 people controlled 
sometimes by military people who have deserted from military 
service. They have medium weapons such as antiaircraft guns and 
shoulder missiles. They mount operations against army camps, 
the police, and military convoys. A large number of them could 
take part in a single operation. 
  A second group consists of those who are involved in 
underground operations inside the cities. They go in small 
groups not exceeding 10 members each and they operate in 
absolute secrecy with some of them leading normal lives as a 
cover. Some of them only operate at night. Joining these 
groups is more difficult than joining the groups in the 
mountains. Desert detention camps are an important source of 
those who join this category. 
  Anwar Haddam, head of the FIS parliamentary mission, who 
lives in the United States and is a member of the FIS Executive 
Committee abroad, was the first to speak of the need for "the 
mujahidin to be taken into consideration in any serious 
negotiations between the regime and the FIS." He told AL-HAYAH 
the day before yesterday that "the leaders of the mujahidin are 
now an important part that cannot be ignored in the 
decisionmaking process within the FIS." One of the most 
prominent of these leaders is Abdelqadir Shabouti, known as 
"Major General Shabouti," a veteran who worked with the late 
Mustafi Bouway'li, the first man to declare armed mutiny in 
Algeria. 
  FIS sources have stated that the military operations have 
not 
at all been affected by the national dialogue conference or the 
appointment of Zeroual as head of state. They added that the 
Islamic Salvation Army had claimed responsibility for a number 
of operations last week, the most important of which was the 
ambushing of an army patrol in Boumerdas east of the capital, in 
which 12 soldiers were killed and the attackers seized the 
patrol's weapons. The Islamic Army also claimed responsibility 
for a number of operations carried out on 26 January, the day of 
the opening of the national dialogue conference. Among the most 
important of these operations were "the assassination of three 
policemen in Baraki, the assassination of an officer near the 
Constantine bridge," the assassination of four inspectors and an 
officer in el-Aghouat [as transliterated], an ambush for Major 
General Bakhouti in Warqala [as transliterated] (which he 
survived), the assassination of Farhat Sheybout, member of the 
Algerian Communist Party's Political Bureau in Jijel, and the 
"execution" of six people in the Taher area accused of 
collaboration with the police. FIS sources said that "these were 
killed to put an end to the informer phenomenon." 
  The sources said that the Armed Islamic Movement also 
claimed 
responsibility for the al-Sawma'ah operation in which 15 members 
of the "special forces" were killed in the area of Blida last 
Sunday and also for the assassination of Rashid Nefrirt, 
secretary general of "the Group for Culture and Democracy," last 
Monday.

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 7 (AFP) -- The radical Armed Islamic 
Group (GIA) has executed" 70 members from a rival Algerian 
fundamentalist movement, according to a GIA statement appearing 
here on Sunday. 
  In the statement, which has not been authenticated, the GIA 
said it had carried out the executions of members of the Islamic 
Armed Movement (MIA) without giving a precise date. 
  The statement was sent by fax, headed the "State of the 
Islamic Caliphate in Algeria" and dated February 5, 1994. 
  It said the killings had been carried out according to 
Koranic law, adding that the "masters of the political decision 
are the mujahedin." 
  The GIA has accused the MIA of trying to suppress its group 
and has described MIA leader Said Mekhloufi as a "traitor, and 
agent of the government services." 
  In a previous statement the GIA said it was "against all 
truce, all dialogue and all reconciliation with the powers" in 
place and threatened anyone taking part in talks with "the worst 
of deaths." 
  Meanwhile security forces announced Sunday that 13 armed 
Moslem militants were killed between Tuesday and Thursday in 
several regions of Algeria. 
  Six militants were killed Thursday in Oued Fregha on the 
northern border between Algeria and Tunisia, and two died in 
Mechta El Magahi 450 kilometres (279 miles) southeast of Algiers. 
  Three fundamentalists were killed in Oran in western Algeria 
on Wednesday, and two died Tuesday evening in a suburb of 
Algiers. 
  Earlier Sunday the Hilton hotel in Algiers closed its doors, 
the latest in a growing wave of foreign companies to suspend 
operations here because of continuing fundamentalist violence. 
  The hotel, which opened last August, decided to close for an 
unspecified period six days after the killing in the Casbah 
district of French cameraman Olivier Quemener, whose body was 
repatriated Sunday. 
  It also came three weeks after the assassination of a 
employee of the French consulate, Monique Afri. Both killings 
were blamed officially on Muslim fundamentalist groups.

<F P=106> [Note issued by the Foreign Ministry; date not given] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of 
Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various 
forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national 
sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For 
instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the 
beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and 
good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this 
issue to the attention of the related authorities of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic 
channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented. 
  But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and 
the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference 
not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests 
against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal 
affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy 
of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all 
internationally accepted current norms and principles, and 
demands from the authorities of that country to seriously 
refrain from the repetition and continuation of such 
interference which will have grave consequences for and negative 
impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries. 
Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such 
interference.

  [Text] Two commanders of Karmal-Dostam's infamous militia 
were killed recently in Faryab Province. Sources of the Armed 
Forces told BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY's military correspondent: 
As a result of the successful operations by the mojahedin and 
the forces of the Islamic Army, dozens of militia including two 
of their commanders -- Nasim Chapaw and Zar Alam -- were killed, 
and many areas have been cleared of Dostam's militia. According 
to another report, Gol Mohammad, known as Gol Pahlawan, brother 
of Rasul Pahlawan [Dostam's commander in Meymaneh, capital of 
Faryab], has been seriously wounded in a confrontation with 
mojahedin in Faryab Province.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 7 (AFP)--PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is 
ready to meet here this week with Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres if Israel shows more flexibility toward 
implementing Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories, a 
senior PLO source said late Sunday [6 February]. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization representative to 
Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, earlier disclosed that 'Arafat had turned 
down a chance to see Peres here on Monday on the grounds that 
Israel was delaying agreement on a final autonomy deal. 
  He said the PLO leader would hold talks with Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak on Tuesday. 
  In Tunis a PLO source told AFP that 'Arafat would travel to 
Cairo on Tuesday and would meet Peres "in the event that there 
is progress in the Israeli position." 
  He said the PLO was sending a delegation here on Monday 
headed by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, a member of the organization's 
executive committee, to meet Peres in another bid to overcome 
obstacles blocking application of a September agreement between 
the PLO and Israel. 
  The accord offered limited self-rule to Palestinians on the 
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
But its implementation, scheduled to start with the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops on December 13, has been repeatedly delayed by 
disagreements over security issues. 
  In the latest attempt to iron out differences, 'Abd-Rabbuh 
will be accompanied by Faysal al-Husayni, a prominent 
Palestinian figure from the territories, Ahmad Quray', head of 
the PLO economic wing, and Nabil Sha'th, leader of the PLO 
negotiating team on security questions. 
  In another development, Ahmad al-Tibi, a senior aide to 
'Arafat, predicted Sunday in Jerusalem after discussions with 
Peres that a comprehensive autonomy accord would be signed in 
Cairo this week. 
  "I can say an overall agreement will be signed this week in 
Cairo ... [ellipsis as received] Mr. Peres is committed to 
meeting with Mr. 'Arafat," al-Tibi declared, describing Peres as 
"sincere and serious in trying to accomplish an agreement very 
soon." 
  A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
meanwhile refused to confirm that Peres would be in Cairo on 
Monday, saying: "We will issue a statement in due time." 
  But Gad Ben Ari also said Rabin had told the Israeli cabinet 
he was still "interested" in having the Peres-'Arafat meeting 
"take place as planned." 
  The goal of the meeting would be to "agree on how to pursue 
the negotiations with the PLO in order to end them as soon as 
possible," Ben Ari said without promising that a final accord 
would be reached in Cairo. 
  The Cairo negotiations between Peres and the PLO team will 
focus on a list of points drawn up in the Swiss resort of Davos 
where Peres and 'Arafat met on January 29-30, Kamal told 
reporters after talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  Both sides emerged optimistic from the Davos encounter. 
  But while 'Arafat said he would be ready to sign a final 
deal 
in Cairo this week, Rabin said it needed three or four more 
weeks and the Israeli army raised its own reservations. 
  "The security issues are the most important, but they are 
not 
the only ones," Rabin warned on Wednesday. "We will also have to 
agree on civilian and economic issues." 
  The key stumbling-blocks remain the control of border 
crossings with Egypt and Jordan into the new autonomous areas 
and measures for protecting Jewish settlements in Gaza. 
  But according to Israeli press reports, the two sides agreed 
in Davos on the amount of land around Jericho to be granted 
self-rule. 
  A PLO statement on Sunday appealed to the United States and 
Russia, co-sponsors of a Middle East peace initiative launched 
in 1991, to "pressure" Israel into "rapidly" withdrawing its 
troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The communique, drafted by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO 
political department, charged that the behavior of Israeli 
authorities "clearly shows that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is 
trying to avoid a withdrawal of Israeli forces under the 
inadmissible pretext of security, which bears no relation to 
reality."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sha'th Tells AL-HAYAH: Disagreement </F>
Between Rabin and Peres Over Results of Davos Meetings"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has said that he 
believes there are differences between Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres over security 
issues. He stressed in a statement to AL-HAYAH that 
negotiations are being conducted "inside the Israeli Government" 
-- which automatically suspends Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
over arrangements for implementing self-rule in the Gaza Strip 
and the Jericho area. 
  Sha'th disclosed that Rabin asked Peres to postpone his 
talks 
with Palestinian President 'Arafat and to return to Israel to 
get his approval of what had been agreed in Davos. And he said: 
"We consider what was agreed between 'Arafat and Peres in Davos 
an objective shift toward easing the the problems obstructing 
the implementation of the Palestinian self-rule agreement." 
  The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks 
criticized Rabin's position on the negotiations, pointing out 
that it "delays" reaching an agreement. He said: "We 
understand the need for the agreement Peres has reached to be 
approved by his leadership. But Rabin's announcement that no 
agreement has been reached with the Palestinians makes the 
Israeli side's credibility the object of doubt. It also 
violates the Declaration of Principles agreement signed by the 
two sides." 
  Sha'th pointed out that Peres' position was positive, which 
is why President 'Arafat agreed to suspend the negotiations and 
postpone them until next week in Cairo to give him a chance to 
discuss the matter with Rabin. 
  He said: "The Palestinian side is still awaiting the Israeli 
position before 'Arafat and Peres meet next week, and the 
Israelis have to come back to us with what they have agreed upon 
so that our commitment to what we agreed upon in Davos will 
continue." 
  Sha'th described what 'Arafat and Peres agreed upon as "an 
objective shift." He said that they agreed that the corridor 
linking the Jericho area with the Gaza Strip be under the 
control of the Palestinian National Authority only, and that the 
two sides jointly assume security supervision of the crossings, 
on the grounds that Israel considers itself responsible for 
external security during the transitional phase, and it is 
entitled to obtain the necessary security information about the 
crossing traffic. 
  He pointed out that the two sides "nearly reached a full 
agreement on the issues concerning the crossings, the size of 
the Jericho area, and the road linking Israeli settlements in 
the Gaza Strip with the Israeli and Palestinian borders." 
  He stressed the Palestinians' adherence to "the 
implementation of measures to safeguard the Palestinians' 
dignity, including raising the Palestinian flag over the main 
building of the crossing and the presence of Palestinian police 
at the crossings." 
  Sha'th went on: "The Israelis must realize that there are 
common interests for the two sides which have been agreed upon, 
even though we consider that what was agreed upon between 
'Arafat and Peres is suspended, pending what he is going to come 
back with." He stressed that, if the Israelis do not backtrack 
on what 'Arafat and Peres agreed upon, "it will represents a 
step forward." 
  He believes that delaying the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho "would disrupt the withdrawal timetable. We insist 
that the withdrawal be completed on 13 April, and the Israelis 
must bear the consequences of their delay. And they must 
complete the withdrawal on the set date." 
  He warned that "patience has limits. The U.S. and Russian 
cosponsors must intervene if no tangible progress is achieved." 
  He urged the Americans to "intervene so that what was signed 
in front of them in the White House will be implemented."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation, in Cairo, by Smadar Peri on 3 February] 
  [Text] [Sha'th] I do not understand Rabin. We could have 
signed the agreement in Davos last week. Rabin, however, 
refused. I am telling you this in no uncertain terms -- Rabin 
deliberately delayed the signing. 
  [Peri] Dr. Sha'th, Peres and 'Arafat will meet in Cairo in 
three days. Is there any chance they will sign the agreement 
this time? 
  [Sha'th] I have no expectations and I also do not know what 
to think. I wish I could put my finger on the real reason that 
Rabin is delaying the signing. 
  [Peri] Is Rabin delaying? 'Arafat was the one who agreed 
and then backtracked. 
  [Sha'th] I want to tell you unequivocally that in Davos last 
week we could have signed, but Rabin spoiled it. I do not 
understand why he did this. Perhaps it is because the agreement 
with Syria is more important for him; because of the 
over-sensitivity of your senior defense establishment, or 
because of the tension between your number one and number two 
men. 
  I have witnessed this tension between the number one and 
number two men on our side as well. I recognize the symptoms. 
  [Peri] Tell us your version of what exactly happened at 
Davos. 
  [Sha'th] I think that Rabin is now trying to play the game 
he believes we played in Cairo when Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] 
and Peres reached an agreement and 'Arafat canceled it at the 
last minute. 
  Let me tell you what happened at Davos. We sat in one room 
with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and everything was 
almost wrapped up. Peres said: I have to make a final phone 
call to Rabin. He was radiant. Then he went to make his phone 
call and returned completely downcast. We immediately 
understood things did not go well. Peres returned to the table 
and said: I am sorry, I do not have time, I have to fly to 
Washington. He offered no explanations, but we gathered that 
Jerusalem decided to hold back. 
  [Peri] What happened after Peres left? 
  [Sha'th] We agreed to continue the talks in Cairo on Tuesday 
[1 February]. The Israelis, however, failed to appear. I 
phoned Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation, and 
asked him why he did not show up. Shahaq said: I did not 
receive any instructions. Later I called again, but Shahaq 
repeated the same words without offering any explanations. I 
asked him: When will you come? Why don't you send Yo'el Singer 
meanwhile? Shahaq answered: I do not know. 
  [Peri] Do you think Rabin does not want to reach an 
agreement? 
  [Sha'th] He is behaving strangely, with a mixture of 
positive and negative elements. I think he is acting out of 
anger. Since Rabin assumed power he has been changing his 
priorities every month. Once it was al-Asad, and then it was 
'Arafat. One month he is talking about 'Syria First,' the next 
month he opts for the 'PLO First.' Now 'Arafat is the good guy 
and al-Asad the villain; next month it will be exactly the 
opposite, with Rabin giving al-Asad and 'Arafat opposite roles. 
  [Peri] You claim that Rabin is conducting his policy out of 
anger. My colleague Sever Plotzker wrote that 'Arafat is 
conducting a policy of "coitus interruptus." 
  [Sha'th, laughing] This term is inappropriate. Can anybody 
suspect 'Arafat of not being interested in an agreement and a 
withdrawal? If you want to speak about "coitus interruptus," 
then look at Rabin-Peres. It is there you will find a coitus 
interruptus, not among us. 
  'Arafat was never as positive, flexible, realistic, warm, 
and 
humane as he was in Davos. You should have followed the deluge 
of telephone calls from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to the Israeli 
delegation. Every five minutes there was a phone call from 
Rabin or Baraq. You would think that your entire army and 
defense establishment took on your diplomatic echelon at Davos. 
  [Peri] People in Israel believe 'Arafat wants to delay the 
signing of the agreement in order to squeeze more concessions 
out of Israel. 
  [Sha'th] Let me tell you in no uncertain terms: Your boss 
does not want the agreement to be signed now. He also does not 
want anybody else to do the job for him. At the same time I am 
not saying Rabin has backtracked. He is interested in the 
agreement, but he is in no hurry to adhere to the timetable, 
even if everything has been prepared. 
  [Peri] How long will it take to finalize the agreement? 
  [Sha'th] It is possible to finalize it next week. Although 
some issues still need to be settled, such as the border 
crossings and the security of the Gaza Strip and Jericho area 
settlements, altogether we reached reasonable standards in Davos. 
  If there is a will to sign, it will be possible to wrap 
things up. You will not believe how diligent and productive 
Singer and I can be. In Davos we worked around the clock. I 
did not even see the door of my hotel room. I reached Davos by 
helicopter and was driven to the (Zehof) hotel, where we worked 
until 0600. Everything went fine. I thought to myself that 
this time we are going to finish things up. Peres was very 
cooperative and happy -- until Rabin's phone call. 
  [Peri] What did you think when Peres reentered the room with 
such a dejected look? 
  [Sha'th] It reminded me of my university days. We had a 
lecturer who was always late or absent. I decided to punish him 
by not coming to some of the lectures, but in the end I lost 
credit for that course. 
  [Peri] If you decide to punish Rabin you could lose the 
chance for an Israeli withdrawal. 
  [Sha'th] Rabin cannot afford to let this go. He stands to 
lose too much. 
  [Peri] What do you think about the criticism leveled at 
Peres after everybody saw him holding hands with 'Arafat? 
  [Sha'th, laughing] I read in the newspapers that Rabin was 
angry. Could it be that he was jealous? I do not want to 
intervene in this unique relationship between your number one 
and number two men. However, I really do not understand why 
Peres has to apologize for "holding hands" with 'Arafat, and why 
Rabin had to immediately flex his muscles. 
  'Arafat did not want to get Peres in trouble when he took 
his 
hand. On the contrary, our number one man tried to evince 
warmth, to be communicative and positive with the man you sent 
to conduct the negotiations. It was a demonstration of the 
desire for peace. Instead of a positive reaction, however, there 
was an uproar in Israel. A simple humane gesture was blown all 
out of proportion. 
  [Peri] Now, in this interview from your Cairo home, you seem 
to be upset and bitter. 
  [Sha'th] I have good reason to be frustrated at a personal 
level. I was invited, along with Shim'on Peres, by U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore, to receive a prize from the "Buds of Peace" 
organization. I had to apologize to the organizers and tell 
them I was waiting in Cairo for Shahaq and Singer to finalize 
the draft agreement. However, they did not come because, as 
they put it, "they did not receive any instructions." I know 
very well who was it who did not give them those instructions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F>
Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 7 
February; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, let us begin this dialogue 
by trying to clarify the status of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations that seek to implement the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles. Where do the talks stand? What 
points have been agreed upon? 
  [Ghawshah] Doubtless, agreement has been reached on numerous 
points but we have not yet received an Israeli response to 
several others. At the Davos meeting, several points were 
raised to which Israeli Foreign Minister Peres gave no answer. 
He said he wished to consult with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin 
and would return with a response. We are awaiting the Israeli 
reply to see how much momentum it would impart to the 
negotiations. Failing this, we will stay in the vicious circle 
in which Israel wants the negotiations to revolve. This is the 
result of Israel's hardline attitude and intransigence. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you believe the meeting with the Israeli 
foreign minister in Cairo today will lay the foundations to 
implement the Declaration of Principles? 
  [Ghawshah] If Israel shows a positive attitude, this will 
remove many hurdles and make it possible to reach agreement 
within days. If Israel maintains a hardline position, the 
vicious circle will persist. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, observers ask that if all these 
problems have occurred in the initial stages of implementing the 
Declaration of Principles, what will happen when many other 
complicated problems, now postponed, are tackled? Does the 
pessimistic outlook that keeps emerging also affect the PLO 
leaders? 
  [Ghawshah] The Israeli positions raise eyebrows, especially 
as the Palestinians have shown much flexibility and made many 
concessions. Instead of responding favorably, Israel has 
persisted with its hardline attitudes. We believe that the 
Palestinians are more flexible and more committed to 
implementing the agreement on the specified dates. 
  [Al-Jundi] There is, doubtless, a great difference between 
flexibility and making concessions, is there not? 
  [Ghawshah] As I have said, we, the Palestinians, have shown 
much flexibility. We made concessions sometimes to surmount the 
obstacles barring the implementation of the agreement. The 
Israelis, in return, adopted a hardline position and are still 
making proposals that are not close to the agreement's text and 
do not show a real commitment to implement it on the specified 
dates. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin 
often discusses security. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
announces that no concessions can be made on security. Do the 
Israelis realize that security is also a Palestinian concern? 
  [Ghawshah] We have approached the security issue as such. 
But the other side exaggerates the issue and claims that some 
issues are security affairs when they're not. We think that 
continuing Israeli intransigence and stubbornness on some 
positions will not achieve security, but constitute a future 
threat to it. 
  [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat 
will arrive in Cairo tomorrow and meet President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak. Can we say that this a sign that 'Arafat will not meet 
Peres or will only come to Cairo after the Palestinian 
delegation has conducted lengthy discussions with the Israeli 
foreign minister and possibly reached real results that merely 
need a signature? 
  [Ghawshah] Brother Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] visit to 
Cairo and his meeting with President Mubarak will deal with 
bilateral ties. This is important to the Palestinians. They 
will also consult on numerous issues. We cannot link the date 
of this visit with Peres' visit. As for 'Arafat's meeting with 
Peres, or possibly with Rabin or others, this will depend on the 
progress in the negotiations and on Israel's willingness to 
overcome the hurdles and reach an agreement. 
  [Al-Jundi] Can we say that 'Arafat's failure to come to meet 
Peres in Cairo today is a Palestinian message indicating that 
'Arafat's talks with the Israeli foreign minister are futile? 
  [Ghawshah] We cannot say that. But we do not think it is 
necessary for 'Arafat to meet Peres in all the ongoing meetings. 
Remember, the basic meetings are between the delegations and the 
members of the Liaison Committee. Although the need 
occasionally arises for a meeting between President 'Arafat and 
an Israeli delegation headed by Peres, we basically believe that 
President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin should hold a 
meeting. Its purpose would be to reach a final agreement and 
sign it. 
  [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Dr. Samir Ghawshah, a member 
of 
the PLO Executive Committee. You are always welcome. Thank you. 
  [Ghawshah] Do not mention it.

  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, 
has called on Russia and the United States, the cosponsors of 
the Middle East process, to pressure Israel to expeditiously 
withdraw from Gaza and Jericho. 
  In his statement, Qaddumi said that Israeli behavior 
definitely proves that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is 
trying to avoid withdrawing the Israeli forces under security 
pretexts that are unacceptable and not in line with reality and

  [Text] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has condemned the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and the Taba-Davos negotiations. He 
said: They contradict the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and the principles of peace based on the exchange of 
land for peace, which were reaffirmed at the Syrian-U.S. summit 
in Geneva. 
  Addressing a crowded ceremony in al-Yarmuk camp in Damascus 
yesterday on the DFLP's 25th anniversary, Hawatimah added that 
the Oslo-Davos agreement [as heard] is a partial and separate 
agreement that gives nothing in return. He noted that this 
agreement was concluded behind the backs of the Palestinian 
people and their intifadah and that it is bound to fail. 
  'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], also delivered a 
speech on behalf of the joint PFLP-DFLP command and the alliance 
of Palestinian forces. Sayf Bin-'Ali also delivered a speech on 
behalf of the Arab liberation parties and movements, and 'Ammar 
al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau, 
delivered a speech on behalf of the Lebanese national and 
Islamic resistance. 
  The speakers condemned the Oslo and Davos negotiations and 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement--which disavow the Palestinian 
people's rights--and called for dropping these agreements. They 
also praised the brave intifadah in the occupied Arab 
territories and the steadfastness of our kinsfolk in the 
occupied Golan and southern Lebanon. 
  The rally was attended by a number of secretary generals, 
members of political bureaus and central committees of 
Palestinian factions, a number of representatives of the 
Lebanese national and Islamic movement and Arab liberation 
movements, some members of the diplomatic corps accredited to 
Damascus, and a crowd of citizens.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has 
announced that the health of its founder, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, 
began to deteriorate four days ago. 
  Shaykh Yasin has been in Kefar Yona prison in occupied 
Palestine since May 1989. The Israeli Military Court sentenced 
him to life imprisonment plus 15 years. 
  The Hamas representative in Jordan, Muhammad Nazzal, told 
AL-RA'Y that Hamas received reports from the occupied 
territories saying that Shaykh Yasin's health is precarious. He 
denounced Arab and international public opinion for ignoring the 
cause of Shaykh Yasin and urged human rights organizations and 
international establishments to pressure Israel to free Shaykh 
Yasin immediately. The shaykh has spent four years in prison in 
very bad physical condition. 
  Nazzal said that delays in the trial of Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Rantisi [spokesman of former Palestinian deportees in south 
Lebanon] have no legal justification, and are aimed at 
preventing him, and those who returned from Marj al-Zuhur, from 
playing their political role in confronting the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  Nazzal disclosed that the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, 
Hamas' military wing, and the Fatah Hawks groups coordinate 
military operations confronting Israeli occupation. 
  He said the martyrdom of Salim Muwafi, a Fatah Hawks 
commander in Gaza, a few days ago emphasized that the enemy is 
going ahead in its onslaught to liquidate all mujahidin and 
strugglers, regardless of their organizational affiliation. He 
hailed Fatah Hawks groups who announced they will continue armed 
struggle. 
  Answering a question on delaying the Doctors Union elections 
in the Gaza Strip, Nazzal said: The delay is supposed to last 
for a few days as a result of the recent martyrdom of one of 
Fatah Hawks commanders. 
  A similar delay was recently announced for elections at the 
Islamic University in Gaza following the martyrdom of 'Imad 
'Aqil, one of the 'Izz-al-Din Battalions commanders. 
  Answering a question, Nazzal said Hamas is not against a 
phased solution that restores any part of the occupied 
Palestinian land, on the condition that the Zionist entity is 
not recognized and that no part of the Palestinian land is ceded. 
  He added: The current negotiations to implement Gaza-Jericho 
agreement do not represent a phased solution as presented by the 
PLO in the 1970's. 
  Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, Nazzal said the Davos 
talks proved that the Palestinian side is the only party making 
concessions, and that delaying the signing of the agreement was 
simply a maneuver to market the new concessions made by the PLO 
leadership and to convince the Palestinian and Arab public 
opinion to accept the agreement as an important political 
achievement. 
  Nazzal expected more Palestinian concessions during the next 
PLO- Israeli talks. He said these concessions will tempt Israel 
to tighten its position on all issues negotiated during the next 
stage.

  [Text] The delegation from the Palestinian Council for 
Construction and Development has held meetings in Brussels with 
experts from the European Union [EU]. During these meetings, 
they discussed support for the council, which so far does not 
have a budget. Brussels recently hosted a seminar about the 
future of democracy and growth in the post-peace age in the 
Middle East in which a number of Palestinian figures 
participated, including the Palestinian intellectual, Professor 
Edward Sa'id. 
  During the seminar, our correspondent in Brussels Nur-al-Din 
al-Faridi met with Antoine Zahlan, Palestinian economic expert 
specializing in development affairs, and asked him how prepared 
the Palestinian side is to develop the economy of the occupied 
territories. 
  [Begin recording] [Zahlan] Many studies have been conducted 
inside the occupied territories on numerous projects for 
villages and towns in Palestine. All these studies were 
prepared on different aspects. However, there were no funds to 
implement the projects. Now many of these studies are being 
looked at again, and the World Bank and EU have gathered this 
information and are reviewing it. They are now making proposals 
on financing the implementation of these projects. However, our 
council so far does not have the appropriate bodies to study 
these projects. 
  [Al-Faridi] What is the budget of the Council for 
Construction and Development? 
  [Zahlan] Currently nothing, since we have not had any 
assistance to start implementing it. Therefore, most of our 
work comes from the contributions of individuals. 
  [Al-Faridi] Is it right for you to start discussing issues 
of regional cooperation with Jordan and Egypt and some 
transportation links with Israel, for example, while the 
political agreement has not yet been implemented and the 
promised international contributions have not arrived yet? 
  [Zahlan] With regard to the council, it is not holding any 
negotiations with Israel for cooperation on its work. Its 
speciality is to transfer international, Arab, and Palestinian 
aid for specific goals that might serve Palestinian society and 
help it integrate once again with its neighbors, the Arab 
countries. Our duty is to reunite the Palestinian economy with 
its neighbors. [end recording]

  [Text] The United Islamic ticket [al-qa'imah al-islamiyah 
al-muwahhadah] and the Medical Democratic Alliance Bloc [kutlat 
al-tahaluf al-tibbi al-dimuqrati] of the Medical Society have 
denounced the incidents at the elections for the Medical Society 
at al-Azhar University in Gaza. A statement distributed by the 
two parties and printed by local Jerusalem newspapers said armed 
'Arafat loyalists burst onto university grounds, smashing 
furniture and tearing up election posters. They then threatened 
the committee supervising the vote, saying that unless they left 
the campus within a quarter of an hour they would wreck their 
cars. The committee left to prevent infighting. 
  The statement called this behavior a brazen violation of all 
our values. It is a flagrant breach of all democratic values 
and a form of terrorism, for which the 'Arafat supporters must 
be held responsible. We urge all nationalist and Islamic forces 
to assume their responsibilities toward such behavior, and we 
call on the committee to set a new election date for next 
Friday, 11 February, the statement said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Required U.S. Partnership"] </F>
  [Text] Reports indicating that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher intends to visit the Middle East next month 
raise anew the issue of the U.S. partnership in the peace talks 
and whether this partnership is effective and active or merely a 
media term that has no connection with reality. 
  If we overlook a known fact -- namely, that the 
Palestinian-Israeli interim agreement was reached in the absence 
of that partnership and that the rounds of negotiations between 
the various Arab negotiating parties and Israel, held in the 
U.S. capital, have ended in deadlock on all or most of the 
tracks -- then one is more than justified in questioning the 
role and effectiveness of the U.S. partnership. 
  The United States' silence in the face of Israeli practices 
that were and are still being carried out in the occupied Arab 
territories, including the pursuit of fugitives, settlement 
activity, and detentions, as well as its silence in the face of 
the ongoing stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli talks and 
Israel's evasion of its commitments and its disregard for the 
timetable on implementing the agreement under the pretext that 
the dates are "not sacred," makes an observer feel that the U.S. 
partnership in the peace process is neither effective nor 
adequate. 
  The most elementary interpretation of U.S. partnership means 
adopting the resolutions of international legitimacy and their 
obvious meaning and calling what is self-evident by its real 
name. The occupied territories are, in fact, occupied and not 
disputed, because this term, adopted lately by Washington, 
creates the impression that those who champion Arab rights are 
on an equal footing with the Israeli party. During recent 
rounds of negotiations in Washington, the United States tended 
to dilute the concepts and terms approved by the international 
community in describing the situation in the occupied 
territories. To a large extent, this endangers the provisions 
of the terms of reference on which the peace process is based. 
  The Palestinians and the Arabs are interested in an active 
U.S. partnership that will manifest itself in difficult times 
and lead the Israeli side back to the reality and spirit of the 
peace concepts as adopted by the international community. Such 
a partnership will certainly boost the peace process in the long 
run, because it will contribute to the establishment of a just, 
comprehensive, and lasting peace acceptable to coming 
generations, who alone will decide whether to preserve that 
peace.

  [Text] India has charged Pakistan with adopting a 
conscious policy of ethnic cleansing of religious minorities. 
In a hard hitting statement in Geneva, the finance minister, 
Dr. Manmohan Singh said discrimination against the minorities is 
in-built in Pakistan's Constitution. Terming Islamabad's record 
on human rights as abysmal, he observed that Pakistan's 
championship of the cause of Kashmiris lacks credibility. Dr. 
Manmohan Singh said Pakistan continues to remain in illegal 
occupation of one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in flagrant 
violation of UN resolutions. The finance minister reaffirmed 
India's commitment to peace and stability in the region. It is 
in this spirit, he said, that New Delhi made six proposals, 
including a draft agreement on peace and tranquility along the 
Line of Control. 
  The Congress-I says Jammu and Kashmir cannot revert back to 
the 1953 status. The party spokesman, Mr. Chandulal 
Chandrarkar, told reporters in New Delhi today that the clock 
cannot be put back. He said the accession of Jammu and Kashmir 
to India is final and irreversible. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari 
Vajpayee, has welcomed the prime minister's suggestion to freeze 
the Kashmir issue for the time being and to hold talks with 
Pakistan to improve relations. Talking to newspersons in 
Lucknow today, he said Pakistani propaganda against India should 
be countered effectively. Mr. Vajpayee said the people in the 
Kashmir valley are fed up with terrorist activities.

  [Text] Massive anti-Pakistan demonstrations were held in 
Jammu and Kashmir and several parts of the country today. 
Thousands of people participated in the demonstrations to 
protest against Islamabad's role in abetting and sponsoring 
terrorism in various parts of India, especially in Jammu and 
Kashmir. 
  A large number of Youth Congress-I workers held a massive 
rally close to the Indo-Pakistan border at Wagah in Punjab to 
denounce Pakistan's support to disruptive forces. Addressing 
the demonstrators, the Youth Congress-I president, Mr. 
Maninderjit Singh Bitta, asked Pakistan to stop encouraging 
terrorism in India and work sincerely for peace between the two 
countries. 
  In Jammu, several organizations, including the pradesh 
[state] Youth Congress-I, the Democratic Youth Federation of 
India, Yuva Janata Dal [youth wing of Janata Dal], Young Lawyers 
Association, ABVP [Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad -- All 
India Student Council], National Youth Front, and All India 
Kashmiri Samaj [Society] organized the rallies. Activists of 
many of these organizations marched to the headquarters of the 
UN observers to submit memorandums against Pakistan's activities. 
  Effigies of the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, and 
former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were burned at many places by 
the demonstrators. Reports reaching Jammu say anti-Pakistan 
slogans rented the air in the border villages of Kathua, Samba, 
Akhnur, Rajaori, and Punch. Senior Congress-I leader Mr. 
Madanlal Sharma and the Youth Congress-I leader, Mr. Raman 
Bhalla, were among those who addressed the rally. 
  Demonstrations were held near the American Embassy and 
Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, protesting against the 
recent statements of these two countries on Kashmir. The 
demonstrators raised slogans and carried placards denouncing the 
statements. 
  In Orissa, Youth Congress-I activists held a rally in 
Bhubaneswar to protest against Pakistan's interference in Punjab 
and Jammu and Kashmir. The Arunachal Pradesh Youth Congress-I 
also organized a protest rally in Itanagar and burned effigies 
of Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Nawaz Sharif. Reports of similar 
demonstrations have come in from other states. 
  The demonstrations coincided with the nationwide hartal 
[strike] in Pakistan called by the Bhutto government today to 
express solidarity with Kashmir militants.

  [Text] India's multitarget surface-to-air missile, Akash 
[sky], was successfully test-fired at Chandipur in coastal 
Orissa yesterday. In a technological breakthrough, the missile 
used an integrated two-stage rocket ramjet propulsion system. 
While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen supply system, the 
ramjet rocket draws air during flight for combustion in 
conjunction with the fuel-rich propellants. India now joins an 
exclusive group of three nations possessing such technology. 
They are the United States, Russia, and France. The 650-kg 
missile Akash has a range of 25 km. It has a (?face) and a radar 
called Rajendra capable of multitargeting. Manufactured by the 
Defense Research and Development Organization, the missile Akash 
has multiple warheads which could target four to five enemy 
aircraft at long range. More than 100 parameters were monitored 
during the test-flight. Apart from propulsion parameters, the 
measured and predicted range values were in close agreement.

<F P=106> [Speech by brother leader of the revolution Colonel Mu'ammar </F>
al-Qadhdhafi in Misratah on 2 February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. May God make your evening a 
good one. I would like first of all to thank you for providing 
a second chance to meet in Misratah. I am very grateful to you 
for your invitation, which I received when I was in Sirte the 
other day. [passage omitted] 
  We are now in a new confrontation. Confrontations are the 
same, but the means and weapons may vary. Today, as we were in 
the recent past, we are confronting the same enemy. We have the 
same people, the same nation, and the same religion confronting 
the same enemies, which are the West, Christianity, imperialism, 
colonialism, whether it was in 1912, 1911, 1915, or now. We are 
in a new confrontation. It is beneficial to browse through our 
history and pause before the sacrifices made by our forefathers 
and our families. [passage omitted]. 
  Brothers, it is very important to stop before these lessons, 
the lessons of our past history and the heroism of our 
forefathers and their sacrifices, because they represent our 
provision to face up to the new confrontation. It is very 
important. Important in the Libyan information approach, 
important in the Libyan educational curriculum and important 
even in family discourse and the club chatter and everywhere we 
are. [passage omitted] 
  Until now [al-Qadhdhafi pauses, interrupted by crowd 
chanting] ...look at the Americans and the West. Their 
calculations now are based on that the Libyan people have been 
spoiled and their demands have increased; luxury goods have 
become necessities. The Libyans have become accustomed to 
things they did not know before. They have become used to 
canned food and fashion and European and Western things. Now 
when oil exports become less and imported things decrease, the 
Libyans will comply with our [the West] orders and accept the 
new world order, what they term as international legitimacy, 
which is the legitimacy of force: the West is strong and the 
others should comply. This is impossible. [passage omitted] 
  Before the battle, the enemy carries out preliminary actions 
to weaken his adversary. When there are two armies fighting 
against each other and two countries fighting against each 
other, before the firing of machine-guns and the use of aircraft 
(?which may be easy for the braves) begin the battle, there is 
another action which is the dangerous action -- an action that 
paves the way for victory in the military battle. It is a 
psychological, propagandist, economic and political action. 
This is a dangerous action, because you have to gain spies from 
the enemy; you have to recruit them. You have to infiltrate the 
enemy's front. You have to weaken the morale of the enemy. You 
have to run bad propaganda which the enemy may believe; your 
agents have to spread that. This is very dangerous. You have 
to be aware that you are facing this weapon. 
  Now we are not facing aircraft or missiles, etc. This may be 
easy; it could possibly be easy. No matter how many missiles 
may be launched, an aircraft carrier cannot enter our desert; it 
will stop when the water ends. Missiles constitute a terrorist 
action which has never forced a people to leave their land; it 
never put an end to a nation. The important thing is that we 
should understand this. I know that your morale is high, and 
that you are ready; this is great. But the important thing is 
that we should understand at this meeting some of the important 
things. 
  You are not facing aircraft carriers, or missiles, or guns. 
What I want to say is that a battle could be better. A 
military battle must come to an end; it does not last long. 
They cannot land on our territory. No matter how long the 
battle may go on, we have the fate of our land in our hands. In 
the end we will evict them. But the battle which is being 
fought now and the weapon which you are now facing -- the weapon 
which the enemy has begun to use -- is neither the machine gun 
nor the rifle. It is silent weapon. It is a weapon which 
targets morale. I will tell you what these weapons are. 
[2-minute break in audio reception]. 
  Heresy is another weapon, like recruitment and treason. Now 
we hear about the Takfir and Hijrah group, the Da'wah, the 
Jihad, and al-Fatah -- and so on and on. Everything invented in 
religion is heresy, and every heresy is a deceit, and those who 
adopt deceit will rest in hell. [passage omitted] This is a 
dangerous weapon; this is a dangerous stratagem to destroy the 
Arabs and Islam -- these Islamic parties. 
  The plan was hatched in India, Afghanistan, and Iran. They 
taught people and recruited them and established schools. They 
called one Da'wah, another was called The Jihad, another they 
called The Takfir and the Hijrah, another they called The 
Tahrir, The Brothers, etc. They told them to enter the Arab 
countries and cause the Muslims to blaspheme and fight each 
other. [passage omitted] 
  Heresy is a weapon useful to America, the Israelis and 
Europe. They are all hoping that the Arab nation will be 
fragmented and that the Arabs will fight each other using heresy 
-- Muslim brothers, the Atonement and Flight, the Islamic Call 
and the Muslim Vanguards -- exactly as you have been witnessing 
in Egypt and Algeria. 
  Some three thousand have died in Algeria. Every day 
somebody dies exactly like it used to be during the war of 
liberation, when the Algerians were fighting the French. Even 
the policeman who used to protect you in the street can no 
longer do so. Someone might just come up to him screaming: There 
is no God but Allah; God is great, before knifing him. How can 
anyone say such and do such a thing to a soldier who is a 
Muslim. But if you ask, however, why did he have to do it, he 
will say this is what he was taught. And if you ask him who 
taught you this? He will say: I was taught by a Muslim who 
came from Sudan or from Jordan. But when they arrest the 
teacher, who is from Sudan or from Jordan, and ask him how did 
you learn this? He will say I was taught by an Afghan, an 
Iranian, or an Indian Muslim. Therefore, this must be a 
conspiracy and a foreign invasion. 
  Heresy is something hard to comprehend. You should, O 
brothers, warn your children against it. And in this you must 
not show any compassion, because it is a very serious matter 
indeed if the number of those people gets bigger. They might 
then arm themselves with knives, swords, and weapons and begin 
to slaughter anyone who happens to be in their way. 
  One of them has killed his uncle, the brother of his father 
who was taking care of him. They told him: In order to prove 
that you are with us you must kill your uncle because he is an 
unbeliever and a police officer. You must kill him to prove to 
us that you are one of us. They gave him a hunting rifle; he 
waited in darkness for his uncle and shot him dead. Is this 
Islam? No, this would be madness if everyone has to kill his 
father, brother, and neighbor. But such a thing is taking place 
in Egypt and Algeria every day. People are killing their 
brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbors and sons. 
  We must be vigilant to this Zandaqa [Islamic movements -- 
the 
current fundamentalism]. This is a dangerous weapon. The 
Americans said that the Arabs would be fragmented from inside. 
[passage omitted] They have tried it, and in Algeria people are 
killing one another, and in Egypt people are killing one 
another, while the West and the Jews laugh at this Islam, this 
kind of Islam that has succeeded in dividing people. They have 
succeeded in mobilizing an Islam and are using it to fragment 
the Arab nation and destroy the real Islam. You must be aware 
of this. You must be conscious of this conspiracy. 
  This is yet another weapon. When they recruit somebody to 
the 
Zandaqah movement, they have recruited a spy. What is amazing 
is that they do not come to you and say: We want you to 
fragment the Arab nation, to be against pan-Arabism, to fragment 
Islam. They do not say to you: We are recruiting you; 
Afghanistan is behind the Zandaqah movement, and America and 
Israel are also behind it. No. They come to you and use Islam, 
in the mosque and say: There is no God but God and Muhammad is 
his prophet. They say to you: This is wrong, little by little, 
until they bring you under their control and make you capable of 
killing your own uncle. 
  Thus the battle now begins at home as I have already said. 
You must be vigilant, starting at home. Everyone must watch 
his children. Their teacher could be a Zindiq [an Islamic 
fundamentalist] who has come from abroad; a doctor, if he has 
come from abroad. You know he has treated your child, your 
neighbor, your kinfolk. Perhaps while treating them he gave them 
information little by little. Search and examine any books 
brought home by your child or somebody else, see whether they 
are very old books on Zandaqah or not. [passage omitted]. 
  When faced with a Zindiq, have no pity or mercy toward him. 
He must be finished, really. The Zandaqah is an extremely 
serious sickness, and he who carries this disease must be 
finished. For he who likes Islam, Islam is clear: Read the 
Koran, give us a lesson from the Koran, a lesson in religion, in 
morals; lead us in prayers, call for prayers, teach us and you 
are welcome. But if you set up a party among us, in secret, and 
you say: Kill each other, and others are infidels, then never. 
[passage omitted] 
  From now on, everyone must be vigilant to their families, 
their children. Islam is clear. If somebody wants to observe 
religious rules, he is free to do so. But the movements I have 
mentioned to you, they have knives, guns, pistols, bombs and 
America is behind them. All the leaders of the Zandaqah 
movement are to be found in Germany, America, Britain, and 
France. All the movements you are hearing about in Egypt, 
Algeria, Syria, and Tunisia, and those who were members of the 
Libyan Islamic Brotherhood movement, you have seen them, they 
are all in America, Britain, France, and Germany. Western 
intelligence is funding them. 
  What kind of Islam is an Islam funded by Christianity, the 
Christians, and the West? Is this Islam? Is this reasonable 
Islam, funded by the West, funded and encouraged by their 
intelligence services? Is this Islam? We do not want an Islam 
whose paymaster is America. We do not want this sort of Islam. 
  Another weapon is drugs. Orders were given by America and 
the Western states to the Israelis to plant hashish in occupied 
Palestine, export it secretly to the Arab countries, dump it on 
the shores of the Arab countries from Egypt to Morocco in return 
for billions of dollars paid by America and the Western states 
as a compensation to the Israelis for planting hashish. America 
is however fighting hashish everywhere in the world, and is 
prepared to go to war against any state planting hashish, except 
the Israelis. Why? Because the hashish in occupied Palestine is 
meant for the Arab youths, for the Arab countries, to lull the 
Arab nation. You must be vigilant to this. Brothers, this is 
not a matter for the law or the police. It is a matter for the 
family, a matter of education. You are all shepherds and every 
shepherd is responsible for his community. Every one must look 
after his children and family. [passage omitted] 
  As I have said, if tomorrow something wrong appears in 
Misratah, it will affect the morale of us all, it will affect 
the morale of Libya and the Arab nation. They will say here is 
an important city, a Mujahid city upon which we rely that has 
come out in angry demonstrations about the sewage, for example, 
or angry about housing or angry about petrol, or heresy appeared 
in it. You must be conscious of these things. I have spoken to 
the people in Tripoli, al-Zawiyah, Misratah, Benghazi and 
Darnah. There are some cities that should be jealous about the 
reputation of Libya. Be aware and do not let the enemy gloat 
over our misfortune. Persevere. If the electricity supply is 
interrupted for a time or public utilities or transportation are 
disrupted in a city such as Misratah, you must persevere and do 
not complain, because this will be very important to Libya's 
reputation before the West. [passage omitted] 
  People in places and cities other than those I have 
mentioned 
can be cross. If something is in shortage, they have the right 
to be cross. However, we in the cities I have mentioned have 
obligations to avert the enemy's gloating over our misfortune 
and because of our past history and our reputation we have to 
endure. However, first of all nothing wrong will happen, God 
willing. I am telling you this only to remind you. May nothing 
wrong happen at all and may everything move forward and 
progress. However, these are probabilities. When something 
happens in Misratah, we should not be cross. 
  All the things I have mentioned come and go. Take poverty, 
rain, money, houses, pavements, streets, homes and animals, they 
all come and go. These are things that can be good at times and 
bad at another. We must not let our future rely on them nor 
distort our history. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, you should be aware of these issues. This is the 
confrontation: high morale, mobilization, anger and popular 
revolution. These should be translated into a material action 
on Libyan land which proves the will of confrontation and 
convinces the enemy that these people are determined to live and 
to live free. This is what will make them retreat. This is what 
made the enemies retreat. But if we only talk and then put our 
hand to them and beg them for a dollar, or trade in currencies, 
or smuggle medicine, smuggle food products, smuggle Libyan 
products, trade in the Libyan dinar, ask them to give us their 
canned foods, or ask them to give us their cigarettes or their 
drugs, they will laugh at us. They will say: These people only 
talk, but in the end they put out their hands to us and beg. We 
should reject this. [passage omitted] 
  The last subject is concerned with the family of Ja'akah. 
First of all, you are aware that there is someone with the name 
of Ja'akah; however, I do not know his first name. We heard the 
Americans say that they would give 1 million American dollars, 
300 Libyan dinars [as heard], to anyone who would give them 
information about who brought down the Pan Am plane over 
Lockerbie. 
  Ja'akah used to work in Malta; he went over to the Americans 
and told them give me the 1 million dollars, I have information 
for you. They told him: All right, just give us the 
information. They kept him as a prisoner at the American 
intelligence; they did not, of course, give him the $1 million 
or anything else. He is still under arrest at the American 
intelligence. They asked him: What information have you got? 
He told them: That plane was brought down by such and such 
person who used such and such thing. He concocted a story; the 
story they are now repeating. They are saying that they have 
confirmed information, but they have only Ja'akah as a witness. 
  If they have a trial abroad, they will bring him to face 
[the 
accused] to whom he will say: Yes, you did bring it down; you 
put the case aboard and this and that. You did so because you 
wanted revenge. The Libyans wanted to avenge the raid of 1986; 
they wanted to take their revenge on Britain and America who 
killed their children. He will say now they have killed your 
children with such a bombing. They wanted to hit two birds with 
one stone; they dealt a blow to America and Britain at the same 
by bombing one plane which they brought down over Lockerbie, a 
British town, he will add. 
  He said the Libyans did so to avenge the raid. The Americans 
and the British have believed his story; they are trying to 
convince the world with such a story by using Ja'akah. Ja'akah 
is now with the American intelligence; he will lose his life... 
[pauses] his liberty forever. He will always remain under their 
control; they will never release him. 
  We started to ask who was Ja'akah? We were told Ja'akah was 
someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah, and suddenly everybody started 
crying this is very bad news for Suk al-Jumu'ah. Why is the 
latter involved in such a scandal? Why did that someone from 
Suk al-Jumu'ah put Libya in the mouth of a cannon? Why did that 
someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah create such problems for Libya? Was 
he a spy? 
  As soon as Suk al-Jumu'ah heard such a news they were angry. 
They said: We must destroy whoever tries to embarrass us; this 
one is a spy and we must set fire to his house and farm; we must 
destroy the houses of his family. They had a meeting, then I 
went to see them in Saradiq. I told them, O brothers, before 
you start destroying and setting fire to things, let us hear 
their story. Let them come and explain. So they came and said: 
We are the family of Ja'akah. We asked them does this one 
belong to you? They said yes, he is our son. His father came 
and made a speech which you have all heard. He said that anyone 
could take his [son's] life; anyone could kill him and that he 
will kill him, if he finds him. He added: We, his family, his 
father and close family, will kill him if we find him, because 
he is an agent who has harmed us. 
  However, his uncle read to us a report that Ja'akah was in 
an institution for mental illnesses. His testimony will, 
therefore, not be valid in a court of law. Had he been a sane 
person, he would not have been a spy against his country nor 
would he have harmed it like this for $1 million. He must be 
insane. That is how his uncle construed it. 
  I remember that people went after them and tried to take 
them 
apart. Had it not been for the guards, they would have been 
killed. We told the people: Please do not touch them; they have 
washed their hands of him. However, they told me that this 
family was not from Suk al-Jumu'ah; it came from Zawiyah 
al-Mahjub. Once the people at Zawiyah al-Mahjub heard the story 
they said: If there is any treason in Zawiyah al-Mahjub, we 
will have to do what Suk al- Jumu'ah would have done. We must 
find this family in order to destroy it and burn it. And you 
were told about the feelings of the people over there some time 
ago by that Haj [someone in the tent]. 
  Now, as soon as they heard the story, they went over to Suk 
al-Jumu'ah and contacted the family of Ja'akah who told them 
that there was no relation with between them. They told them 
that the spy came from, in fact, the Ja'akah family in Suk 
al-Jumu'ah. The Ja'akah here has nothing to do with that 
Ja'akah. The only thing they shared was the name. Ja'akah was 
a first name here and not a family name like in Zawiyah 
al-Mahjub. 
  That is it, things are now clear. The day before yesterday 
the population of Gmatah sent an emissary to me and said: We 
heard that the people of Zawiyat al-Mahjub said that this 
Ja'akah family is from Gmatah, but the family in Zawiyat 
al-Mahjub has the surname of al-Jurushi. Al-Ja'akah is a name, 
but the surname is al-Jurushi. Now the al-Jurshi family has had 
martyrs and mujahidin. And indeed as the emissary showed us, 
this family is a family of mujahidin and martyrs, and surely it 
would not do anything wrong. 
  Now the population of Gmatah is angry and they said: If we 
find that the family of this spy Ja'akah is in Gmatah we will 
burn and destroy it. Naturally, this is in one way disturbing, 
but this is also very useful. The Libyan people have now laid 
down a rule, neither a written law nor a decision, all the 
Libyan people have laid down a rule which says: Treason will be 
hunted down, besieged and destroyed. They have reached the 
point where they might have to burn families to death, destroy 
homes. This is a frightening matter which we may be able to 
prohibit, but in fact no one can prevent it. They said to me: 
Even if you install guards around a treasonous family, we will 
consider the guards as traitor themselves and we will burn them. 
If thousands of people storm a house, who can stop them. 
Neither Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, nor police nor anyone can do so. 
If people attack treason, by God I will not be able to touch 
them, even if they burn down a house or burn a family to death. 
Now, thanks be to God, treason is indeed besieged. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] An authorized source at the Iranian Embassy in Amman 
has stated that the reduction in the number of Iranian diplomats 
in Amman will not negatively affect bilateral relations, adding 
that the Jordanian officials believe likewise. The source 
added: This is a principled stand adopted by the Jordanians and 
Iranians. 
  In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, the source, who preferred 
anonymity, added that this issue is a technical issue and comes 
within the framework of organization and acknowledged diplomatic 
actions. 
  The source said that the number and names of the diplomats 
affected by the reduction measure, as well as the date of their 
departure, have been communicated to the Jordanian Foreign 
Ministry. However, he said he preferred not to divulge details 
of this matter to the press. 
  The Iranian source said that the Jordanian Government's 
request to reduce the number of Iranian diplomats is neither new 
nor unusual, but has been under discussion for some time. He 
said that relations between the two countries will develop under 
the leaderships of His Majesty King Husayn and Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  The source emphasized his country's eagerness to have 
delegations from both countries exchange visits since this will 
enhance bilateral relations, which is part of the Jordanian and 
Iranian officials' approach.

<F P=106> [Report by political affairs reporter Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] </F>
  [Text] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, has 
received Mr. Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, the minister of 
state for foreign affairs in Oman. He conveyed a verbal message 
from His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to his brother His 
Majesty King Husayn, dealing with matters of shared interest and 
Arab and world issues of mutual concern to the two brotherly 
countries. 
  Mr. Bin-'Alawi had this to say to Jordan television about 
the 
message and Oman's role in Arab fence-mending: 
  [Begin Bin-'Alawi recording] I communciated to His Highness 
Prince Hasan a message from his majesty the sultan to his 
brother his majesty the king. The message is a link in the 
chain of consultations that have marked the personal 
relationship between their majesties on matters related to joint 
Arab action, Arab solidarity, and other issues. Just like 
Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman wants to promote inter-Arab 
reconcilation. We hope both their majesties' efforts will yield 
results in order to advance the interests of the Arab nation. 
[end recording] 
  The Omani minister left Amman this afternoon concluding a 
visit to Jordan lasting several days. 
  On hand to receive and bid farewell to the minister were 
Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, the minister of state for foreign 
affairs; the director general and the chief of protocal at the 
Foreign Ministry; and the Omani ambassador in Amman.

  [Excerpts] His majesty the king and Her Majesty Queen Nur 
returned home this afternoon following a trip which included 
visits to the United Kingdom, the United States, Croatia, and 
Austria. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty told the "News at Ten" that his talks with 
American leaders were characterized with openness and frankness. 
  [Begin recording] [Husayn] I believe it was a very 
successful one and it came at a good time. It gave me the 
opportunity to meet not only with the President but with all the 
top officials there. It was characterized by openness and 
frankness, and I think a genuine desire, I note, to see our 
relations develop and grow and to give meaning to the word 
partnership in terms of the efforts of all to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in this region. 
  [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] During your many meetings in 
Washington, you reiterated Jordan's commitment to a 
comprehensive peace settlement. Do you feel that there are 
pressures on Jordan to go ahead individually to sign a peace 
agreement? 
  [Husayn] I think I have suggested more than once that in the 
past,there were suggestions that Jordan should ratify a peace 
treaty then begin to negotiate the terms of the peace treaty. 
This has not been accepted by us, and it is not the right 
approach, in my view, at all. So, right now, I believe, we are 
engaged in discussing the items on the agenda, which are part of 
the process leading to the establishment of a final 
comprehensive peace between us. 
  [Al-Sha'ir] Your majesty, do you want to say anything about 
Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah's assassination in Beirut? 
  [Husayn] I am more than angered and more than saddened by 
this kind of vicious crime. We have paid dearly in blood in the 
past for our principles, our ideals, and our fight for life. 
And I do not think that there are any in this world who can 
intimidate this country. It is not an individual or a group of 
people that may fall. And that is normal, all of us are going 
to die some time, sooner or later. And it is all in God's 
hands. But nobody can murder a nation, and I think here we have 
a nation that stands proud and will continue to stand proud, and 
will never be intimidated by cowards and cowardly acts. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn upon his return from a tour </F>
abroad by correspondent Kassab Samawi in Amman on 4 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Samawi] Sir, would you tell us first about your 
trip to the United States. Are you satisfied with the results 
of this visit? 
  [Husayn] Praise be to God. Personally, my medical results 
are very satisfactory, according to what doctors told me. I 
need another checkup after six months, and then an annual 
checkup, as is the case with anybody. Praise be to God, the 
results are good. On the official level, my meetings with the 
U.S. President and the U.S. Administration were useful and 
addressed all important issues in this region. I felt, indeed, 
that there is resolve and determination to crystallize the 
concept of participation and turn it into joint action to reach 
the required results and achieve a just and comprehensive peace 
in this region. In our visit to Croatia, naturally, I was very 
happy to meet with the youth of the homeland while performing a 
great duty of peacekeeping as part of the international 
peacekeeping forces there. They have won the respect, love, and 
appreciation of everybody, all the parties for which they are 
providing security and a decent life. I believe it is a source 
of pride for us to know that we are the second largest force in 
the peacekeeping troops there, after France. This is a major 
role played by Jordan. This is not strange for this good 
country, in terms of its aspirations and objectives to see 
people live in freedom, dignity, and security, wherever they are. 
  [Samawi] Your Majesty, we observed that during your talks 
with the U.S. Administration, there was a focus on bilateral 
relations. To what degree has the United States shown 
understanding of Jordan's needs, in terms of foreign 
indebtedness and inspection at al-'Aqabah Port? 
  [Husayn] As a matter of fact, the results were satisfactory, 
and I felt that there is understanding and resolve to see warm 
relations once again. The word warm has been overused, but I 
mean to have good, strong relations, as they were one day, and 
perhaps stronger than in the past. There is a sure desire for 
support and backing on the part of the President and the 
Administration. It might take some time, but I believe the 
results will be satisfactory, God willing. 
  [Samawi] After the Arab-American summit meetings and in 
light of this flurry of activity on the peace process, are we 
close to achieving peace? 
  [Husayn] I cannot say for sure that we are that close to 
achieving peace, but I believe that the process is serious and I 
hope that we will see progress on all tracks in the coming 
phase. Naturally, I do not know everything about what happened 
in Davos, but we have to learn about all the details. There 
could be difficulties or obstacles from time to time, but I 
believe these could be overcome if everybody wants to achieve a 
peace that future generations accept.

  [Text] Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's ambassador in 
Washington and chief delegate to the bilateral peace talks, 
returned to Amman this evening for further consultations with 
the government. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah spoke to Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, our political 
affairs correspondent: 
  [Begin recording] [Dhiyab] How would you assess this latest 
round of talks in Washington? 
  [Al-Tarawinah] I am not sure I can call it that. It was not 
so much the usual round of talks as one of consultations. It 
was a novel approach proposed by the sponsors as a way of 
injecting some flexibility. It may have also been meant to test 
intentions and pave the way for another round. It concluded 
Thursday [3 Febeuary] culminating two weeks of contacts between 
delegation heads. Beginning 15 February, We will hold further 
contacts using the same method of one-on-one sessions between 
chief delegates. The next round may last two or three weeks. 
The sponsors are happy with the way in which these latest 
consultations were conducted. All the delegations agreed to 
resume consultations on 15 February. 
  [Dhiyab] In this latest round, the news media was kept at 
bay, and it was limited to the chief delegates. What is the 
idea behind this? 
  [Al-Tarawinah] The news media is usually not let in on 
consultations. As I said, we are talking about a test of 
intentions. Each track has its own peculiarities. The Syrians 
and Lebanese are addressing the principles of negotiations. We 
and the Israelis have a joint agenda. We have not yet begun 
discussing the items on this agenda. The latest round was an 
opportunity for the chief delegates to discuss these items and 
points. The Palestinians were also there to talk about issues 
other than those being addressed at the ongoing negotiations in 
Taba, Cairo, Davos, Paris, and other places. Their contacts are 
being conducted with reference to a different agenda. As for 
us, we have insisted that the agenda be respected. However, in 
the absence of experts, we did not get down to details. We are 
waiting for the next round of consultations to see how to 
proceed in the future. We hope to be able to hold full sessions 
so that the process may begin in earnest. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations for the Sake of Negotiations"] </F>
  [Text] As expected, the 12th round of Arab-Israeli 
negotiations ended in Washington yesterday without achieving any 
progress on any of the tracks. This is due to the fact that the 
Israeli side is continuing its intransigent stands and policies, 
which lack a real desire to submit to the principles of 
international legitimacy. 
  It is well known that the 12th round was held after a 
four-month hiatus in the Arab-Israeli negotiations during which 
time many diplomatic efforts and contacts were exerted on the 
highest official levels in order to get the parties together 
again at the negotiating table in Washington. Hence, it was 
logical to believe that the results of this round should come as 
the crowning achievement of all these efforts and contacts. 
  However, certain things took place during the past two weeks 
-- the timeframe for this round -- as if the negotiations in 
Washington were a means in themselves. This was especially the 
case for the U.S. cosponsor, which exerted intensive diplomatic 
efforts to hold this round, even if was on the level of chief 
delegates, in order to keep the peace process alive in spite of 
Israeli signals that a step down the desired road would not be 
taken. 
  Moreover, although there is already talk about holding a new 
round of these negotiations in the middle of this month, we 
question the usefulness of continuing such rounds, which waste 
time and effort and whose lengthy sessions will not result in 
cracking open even a small hole in the wall of Israel's 
intransigent stand. We also question the purpose of continuing 
such rounds without any signs that their continuation will serve 
the interest of peace in the Middle East. 
  As we are already aware that the U.S. stand will continue to 
be that of an observer rather than an effective mediator, we 
doubt the use of continuing such a formula of negotiations, even 
if it takes place behind closed doors and away from the press 
and the media. This calls for a real review of the current 
policy of negotiations and an examination of more practical 
alternatives. Perhaps this would place the Middle East on the 
track of desired peace rather than the track of negotiations for 
the sake of negotiations.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--An official U.S. delegation is expected to 
arrive here soon for further discussions on Jordan's proposal to 
move sea-based searches of cargo to the port of al-'Aqabah, 
informed sources said Friday [4 February]. 
  They said the team would hold talks with senior officials on 
the mechanism and modalities of the proposed land-based 
inspections and report back to the Clinton administration, which 
has yet to take a policy decision on the issue. 
  The proposal was tabled during His Majesty King Husayn's 
visit to Washington in the third and fourth weeks of last month. 
Officials said the initial U.S. response was positive. 
  The plan calls for Lloyds Register of London to set up a 
base 
at al-'Aqabah to inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo for 
violations of the international sanctions against Iraq. 
  Until now, the inspections were conducted by U.S.-led 
warships patrolling the Red Sea, causing severe economic losses 
for Jordan, whose own imports are subject to the costly delays 
and higher freight charges levied by shipowners. 
  According to the sources, Lloyds Register representatives 
visited Washington last week to discuss the proposal in detail 
with administration officials. 
  Comments from U.S. naval officials in the Gulf indicated 
that 
the proposal was being circulated in U.S. military circles. 
  "It would be a step down for us," said Lieutenant-Commander 
Bruce Cole, spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command 
headquartered in Bahrain. "We might leave one ship there for 
spot checking in the early stages." 
  The U.S. Navy usually maintains three ships in the Red Sea, 
focusing their attention on the Tiran Straits, the gateway to 
the Gulf of Aqaba. Other members of the international coalition 
which contributed forces to fighting Iraq out of Kuwait in early 
1991 take part in the inspections on rotation. 
  The inspection forces, which took up place in August 1990 
immediately after the U.N. Security Council imposed the 
sanctions against Iraq, have so far intercepted 19,350 ships, 
the bulk of them in the Red Sea. 
  Of these, 8,450 were actually boarded and inspected by 
American or coalition naval officers and 440 were denied total 
entry. 
  According to the sources, the next step after the American 
mission's visit to Jordan would be formulating a final mechanism 
to be in place at al-'Aqabah and recommending it to the U.N. 
Sanctions Committee. 
  Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, who addressed the 
committee in New York on Jan. 27, has said, without specifically 
mentioning the proposal for land-based inspections, that he 
found the committee members willing to address Jordan's concerns. 
  According to Cmdr. Cole, the proposal also includes punitive 
measures against vessels found trying to violate the sanctions 
against Iraq. 
  "The (shipping of cargo) insurance would be forfeited if a 
ship is found to be in violation of the U.N. sanctions," instead 
of the diversions to nearby ports that was the maximum, penalty 
faced by ships boarded and inspected at the Tiran Straits, Cmdr. 
Cole said. 
  Shipping sources do not expect the new system to take effect 
in less than six months. It is also not clear who will bear the 
cost of Lloyds Register inspections. 
  However, the sources said, if worse comes to worst, 
Jordanian 
importers would pay the cost if only because that will be much 
cheaper for them than continuing to pay the extra $500 per 
20-feet container and $15 per-tonne freight that they pay for 
al-'Aqabah-bound cargo. 
  "The total amount that will be paid to Lloyds will be less 
than 10 per cent of the overall Jordanian loss under the present 
conditions," said a shipping source.

  [Text] In a news conference held yesterday to announce the 
establishment of the Pan-Arab Action Front Party [PAAF], Salim 
Suways, PAAF official spokesman, said his party denounces and 
condemns the recent acts of violence in the Jordanian arena, 
referring to yesterday's bomb blast in the Salwa movie theater 
in al-Zarqa' and last week's bomb blast in the Rivoli movie 
theater in Amman. 
  Suways said he has confirmed information and evidence, which 
he obtained one and a half months ago, indicating that the 
United States has sent a direct threat to the Jordanian 
Government. He said the threat hinted that the situation in 
Jordan will be turned into the situation that exists in certain 
sisterly Arab states (Egypt and Algeria) in terms of violence, 
chaos, and instability on the domestic front. 
  The threat, Suways says, aims to put pressure on the 
Jordanian Government in the peace process with Israel, 
particularly on the Jordanian-Israeli and the 
Palestinian-Israeli tracks, and stop it from creating any 
obstacles that would hinder or slow down the process. 
  Suways also said the PAAF demands the Government to set up 
an 
inquiry into the corruption file opened by the health minister. 
The PAAF also urges the Jordanian House of Representatives to 
assume its role in defending the citizens by opening all cases 
of corruption, he said. 
  The PAAF's first statement says the PAAF rejects the Madrid 
Conference, the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, the agenda agreement 
between Jordan and Israel, and the Syrian-U.S. talks. It also 
says the PAAF will seek to abort the current talks on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track.

  [Text] Amman--Security authorities are questioning at least 
five people in connection with bombings at two movie theatres in 
the last two weeks. But officials are declining comment on 
whether there was any evidence to indicate that a single group 
was behind the two blasts. 
  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of 
five 
people on Wednesday [2 February], one day after a bomb tore 
through the Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two 
people, one of them seriously. 
  The minister said investigations were continuing and that 
investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other 
sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any 
details. 
  The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on Jan. 26 at 
the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven 
people, one of them seriously. 
  The common features of the two bombings were that both 
occurred at establishments screening X-rated moves and the 
nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the 
exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices 
lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the 
projection rooms. 
  More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs 
were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused 
before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six 
months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with 
the same technique that was used by the extremist underground 
group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said. 
  "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group 
despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one 
source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could 
have learnt the technique." 
  Jaysh Muhammad is believed to comprise mostly of Jordanian 
volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home 
after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990. 
  Eighteen members of the group were found guilty of carrying 
out or plotting attacks against government officials, security 
officers, state buildings and foreign diplomats as well as 
liquor stores and night clubs in 1992. 
  Eight of them, including two in absentia, were sentenced to 
death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large, 
were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn. 
  Jaysh Muhammad was at one point alleged to be the "military 
wing" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood has 
categorically denied any such link with the group. 
  According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan, 
Jaysh 
Muhammad was set up by hardliners who belonged to the 
Brotherhood who were disillusioned with what they saw as the 
leadership's moderate approach and confining the group to the 
mainstream political process in Jordan. 
  The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the 
Brotherhood, has denounced the Jan. 26 bombing saying violence 
was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films that 
many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian society.

  [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has stated that the 
criminals who planted explosives at the Cinema Rivoli in Amman, 
Cinema Salwa in al-Zarqa', and the al-'Akrush Supermarket in the 
town of Safut have been apprehended. The explosive charge 
planted in Safut was discovered and defused, he noted. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, PETRA, the 
interior minister added: Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah, alias 
Abu-'Abbad, a construction worker aged 26 years, and 'Id Salih 
al-Jahalin, a plumber aged 31 years, have admitted that they 
committed these crimes. They are part of a group that will be 
uncovered later. 
  Hammad went on to say that the apprehension of these two 
criminals was the result of remarkable and persistent efforts by 
the Public Security organs since these crimes occurred. He said 
that investigations are continuing to unearth the details of 
plans to undermine the homeland's security and stability. 
  Hammad said that these two criminals who perpetrated these 
crimes, which aimed to undermine the citizens' security, have 
connections with some persons who have returned from Afghanistan. 
  Concluding his statement, Hammad said: We take pride in our 
inspired leadership, which has always rendered us loyal soldiers 
of the homeland, eager to perform our duties. We pledge to this 
leadership to remain, as King Husayn has always known us, people 
who have faith in the message, and who will keep the trust.

  [Text] Amman--Interior Minister Salameh Hammad on Sunday [6 
February] announced that two people had confessed to planting 
the explosive devices that went off in two cinema theatres and 
said there was a broader plot to destabilise Jordan through 
subversion. 
  The minister's comments, carried by the Jordan News Agency, 
Petra, indicated that the two suspects could be linked to an 
underground group called "Jaysh Muhammad" (Muhammad's Army) 
comprising mostly of Jordanians who returned home after fighting 
the 1980-90 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 
  Mr. Hammad said the two, Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah, 26, a 
construction material salesman, and 'Id Salih al-Jahalin, 31, a 
plumber, had admitted to planting the explosive devices at 
Amman's Rivoli theatre on Jan. 26 and al-Zarqa's Salwa theatre 
on Feb. 1. 
  The two blasts injured at least seven people, including Mr. 
al-Jahalin who suffered serious wounds to the lower part of his 
body at the al-Zarqa' explosion. 
  The nature of Mr. al-Jahalin's injuries were such as they 
could have been sustained only from a position of close 
proximity, possibly while handling the explosive device which 
went off prematurely, sources said. As such, they said, he was 
an immediate suspect after his removal to hospital and details 
he provided upon interrogation led to other arrests. 
  First reports spoke of five people arrested last Wednesday, 
one day after the al-Zarqa' blast. More detentions were 
reported shortly thereafter. 
  Mr. Shihadah and Mr. al-Jahalin also admitted to have been 
behind another bomb which was safely removed at al-'Akrush 
Supermarket at Safut, northwest of Amman, last year. 
  "The criminals have confessed that they carried out these 
attacks," Mr. Hammad said, paying tribute to the "strenuous and 
relentless efforts of the Public Security Department" for the 
arrest of the suspects. 
  The suspects "are part of a group which will be disclosed 
later," the minister said. "They have links with some people 
who have returned from Afghanistan." 
  "Investigations are continuing to uncover other details and 
plots aimed at harming national security and stability," he 
added. 
  The two bombings at the two theatres known for screening 
X-rated movies, coupled with the discovery of the device planted 
at the Safut supermarket which sells alcohol, had immediately 
made religious extremists prime suspects. 
  The nature of the bombs, described as crude, homemade 
devices 
consisting of acetone peroxide, were the same as the type used 
by members of Jaysh Muhammad in some attacks in 1991. The 
bombmaking technique was believed to have been acquired by Jaysh 
Muhammad members during their fight alongside the Afghan 
Mujahedeen. 
  Most of the group's members are believed to be Jordanian 
volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home 
after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990. 
  Eighteen members of the group were found guilty in 1992 of 
carrying out or plotting attacks against senior government and 
security officials, state buildings and foreign diplomats as 
well as liquor stores and night clubs. 
  Eight of them including two in absentia, were sentenced to 
death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large, 
were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn. 
  Jaysh Muhammad was at one point reported to be the "military 
wing" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood strongly 
denied any such link with the group. 
  According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan, 
Jaysh 
Muhammad was set up by hardliners who were once members of the 
Brotherhood but who quit the group after being disillutioned 
over what they saw as the leadership's moderate approach and 
confining the group to the mainstream political process in 
Jordan. 
  Some of the so-called Arab-Afghan veterans--Arab volunteers 
who fought in Afghanistan--remain in Pakistan as well as 
Afghanistan and are suspected to directing militancy in Algeria 
and Egypt.

  [Text] Kuwait, 5 Feb (KUNA) -- The State Security Court 
here today has postponed hearings in the case of the terrorist 
network which attempted to assassinate former U.S. President 
George Bush during his visit to Kuwait last year instigated and 
planned by the Iraqi intelligence until 5 March. 
  The reason for the postponement was to brief lawyers about 
the case before the hearing. 
  The court met under the chairmanship of Judge Salah al-Fahd 
and listened to the witness Abd al-Hamid al-Shatti, a Kuwaiti 
national who works at the Ministry of Interior. The witness 
said that when one of the accused was arrested he confessed that 
he was trained by Iraqi intelligence to assassinate Bush and 
blow up vital and crowded Kuwaiti locations. 
  He stressed that after the investigations and interrogations 
it became clear that Iraqi intelligence had provided the two 
main suspects: Wali al-Ghazali and Salim Nasir, with what was 
needed, referring to their confession that they were Iraqi 
intelligence personnel.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr </F>
al-'Attas by Kamal Jaballah in Aden; date not given] 
  [Text] Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has 
revealed that there are big "differences" in the views of all 
the parties involved in the struggle for power in his country. 
He accused the political forces participating in the government 
of practicing a "strong and backward centralism" in managing the 
state's affairs, adding that this shows that there is no desire 
to build a united state and its establishments but only a desire 
to keep things as they are. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in Aden, 
al-'Attas added that he rejected President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's offer to join the General People's Congress [GPC] 
because he did not want to cause more divisions within the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He also confirmed that there are 
military movements between the two former sectors of Yemen 
following the frustration of the plans made to rebuild, 
organize, and unite the Armed Forces since the establishment of 
Yemeni unity on 22 May 1993. 
  Al-'Attas spoke about the presence of terrorists in his 
country and how they are used in internal or external 
operations. He accused certain Yemeni state organs of 
benefiting from these terrorists carrying out operations against 
opposing political forces inside the country. 
  In response to a question about the date of the prime 
minister's return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: "Shortly...when we 
reach a full agreement on the security arrangements and the 
constitutional and legal guarantees, all of which aim to 
reorganize to establish security and stability in all parts of 
Yemen and make them the basis for ensuring that the guarantees 
agreed on to implement the "Pledge and Agreement" document will 
help ensure the implementation of the document." [sentence as 
published] 
  Al-'Attas added: "The responsibility of signing the Pledge 
and Agreement document is a big one. There are still big 
"differences" in views and these must be resolved by the Yemeni 
political forces' Dialogue Committee. We believed that this 
issue should not be moved from the Dialogue Committee to a 
subcommittee. We believed that these arrangements and 
guarantees had to be resolved through the document. But the 
others insisted on resolving them through the subcommittee." 
  The Yemeni prime minister dealt with the many efforts to 
reform the system and ensure unity and democracy through the 
establishment of law and order. He said: "All these efforts 
were met with countermeasures that showed the lack of desire to 
build the state and the establishments and the desire to let 
matters remain as they were before unity. Some political forces 
waged war against national reconstruction and the political, 
economic, financial, and administrative reform programs that 
were adopted by the government in 1991 and that it started to 
implement after being ratified by the Chamber of Deputies. This 
is sufficient evidence that there are countermeasures being 
taken." 
  Al-'Attas added that he returned to Aden when the Dialogue 
Committee moved to that city after seeing that the work done 
between 22 November and the end of December 1993 did not result 
in much progress. The committee met from 2 January to 18 
January and achieved a great deal that could not be done during 
the previous period. 
  Regarding reports that there are divisions inside the YSP 
about continuing the unity process while the opposite is 
reportedly unanimous on this issue, the Yemeni prime minister 
said: "One of the real mistakes made by the GPC is its constant 
effort to create divisions within the YSP and to fragment the 
national movement. This is against democracy and it classifies 
people. It wishes to see these differences inside the YSP." 
  Al-'Attas revealed, for the first time, the secret offer 
made 
to him by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to join the GPC 
instead of the YSP, adding that this was another indication of 
their attempts to create divisions within the YSP. 
  He said: "Following the incident when the Military Police 
stopped me last November while I was on my way to Sanaa, a 
telephone call was made between myself and the brother 
president. The president asked me to resign from the YSP and 
join the GPC to continue in my position as prime minister. This 
is evidence of their continued efforts to split the YSP's unity." 
  Al-'Attas added that his reply to the president's offer was 
that relinquishing his YSP membership would not be useful to the 
GPC, the YSP, or the Yemeni homeland. 
  Regarding reports about military movements in preparation 
for 
a confrontation between the two sides and the allocation of 
specific amounts of money to buy equipment and ammunition 
without the other side's knowledge, such as the one billion 
riyals that the president ordered to be spent in addition to the 
state budget or the accusation against the YSP that $300 million 
was added to the cost of the oil project in Hadhramaut without 
the president's or the government's knowledge for the same 
reason, al-'Attas said: "This is the first time I have heard of 
such a thing. We may have heard before that the same figure 
mentioned was given by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia!" 
  Al-'Attas added: "First, there is no Yemeni project whose 
cost has been increased. All the Yemeni oil projects have been 
completed. These projects' budgets have been approved by the 
Higher Council for Economic and Oil Affairs. Therefore, what is 
being said is really strange. The other side is looking for any 
accusation-- regardless of how false--to make against the YSP." 
  Regarding the military movements, al-'Attas said: "We do not 
deny that there are military movements by both sides. We have 
repeatedly warned against this, including in our letter to the 
Chamber of Deputies in October 1993 when we called for the 
control of the Army and security through the allocations, the 
expenditures, and the merger. But this has not been done. We 
have emphasized our desire that the Armed Forces should not be 
used in the conflict. One of the guarantees required to 
implement the Pledge and Agreement document is the adoption of 
all measures to prevent the use of the Armed Forces as an excuse 
to abort the document or to proceed with it in the opposite 
direction." 
  When told that the YSP has been accused of 
"internationalizing" the problem, the Yemeni prime minister 
said: We in the YSP have not said this, they are saying it. In 
his latest trip to Aden as part of the mediation committee, 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar met with 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and said that there are two 
systems and two states, which is the reality. During the 
transitional period, the YSP sought to complete the unification 
of all institutions, including the military establishment, but 
if you follow these steps you will realize who was obstructing 
unification to prevent the establishment of a single state and a 
unified army. He added: The others are throwing accusations 
right and left at all people and all countries, including Egypt, 
but I see it as a Yemeni issue. The problems of application are 
Yemeni, too, and they were not born in August 1993, as they 
claim, but go as far back as September 1990, immediately after 
the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait. The dilemma lies in the 
failure to recognize that this is a serious problem facing a 
single state and that there is a crisis facing the unified state 
because of this dilemma. 
  Al-'Attas categorically denied the GPC's accusations against 
the YSP that the latter has recently received military aid from 
Bulgaria with Kuwaiti financing. He said: This is absolutely 
untrue. They are accusing many sisterly countries, although 
military preparations by all parties to the conflict are clearly 
obvious nowadays, but we want to prevent such preparations. 
  Regarding the secessionist threats facing Yemen's southern 
governorates in particular should a separation take place, God 
forbid, the Yemeni prime minister said: The threats made by 
them are not new. They know very well that the YSP is a 
unionist party, that all its practices are unionist, and that it 
does not seek a separation. Their remarks always reflect their 
inner feelings and what they are thinking. When the dialogue 
started, within the tripartite coalition first and at the 
national level later on, who was advancing serious and 
responsible proposals to emerge from the crisis? Was it the YSP 
or the GPC? 
  Al-'Attas was then asked about the YSP's ambitions for 
power, 
which exceed the results of the recent parliamentary elections 
in Yemen, something that further complicates the crisis. He 
said: These accusations are untrue as far as the YSP is 
concerned. The proof of this is the debates of the 
quadripartite committee that started in November 1991 and 
continued until 1993. These discussions prove that the YSP has 
never thought of seizing power but has recognized the need for 
the participation of all Yemeni political forces. 
  Al-'Attas said that the YSP consolidated its position 
during the recent parliamentary elections. The YSP succeeded in 
retaining all the seats in the southern provinces, except for 
two that were granted to the GPC [as published]. Meanwhile, the 
YSP managed to wrest a number of seats from the GPC in the 
north. This represented a great victory for the YSP over the 
GPC and the Yemen Reform Party. 
  The Yemeni prime minister added: The elections were not 
disappointing as far as the YSP was concerned because it 
demonstrated the YSP's strength. Had it not been for some 
terrorist practices by certain sides, the YSP would have 
achieved better results, particularly in the northern provinces. 
  In response to a question about the charges that the YSP is 
responsible for the terrorist acts--judging by the historical 
record before unity and the attempt to accuse the GPC and other 
parties of being responsible for the recent assassinations of 
the YSP's cadres--al-'Attas said: When the terrorist acts 
started in Yemen, they [not further identified] said that these 
practices were the result of a settling of accounts among the 
YSP members or were motivated by acts of revenge. The YSP used 
to arrest the defendants and refer them to the competent 
judicial departments. But the interrogations with the 
defendants were always contradictory to the charges against the 
YSP. After unity, 151 YSP cadres were liquidated, in addition 
to the direct threats against the party. 
  Al-'Attas continued: The investigations always blamed 
external forces, although the perpetrators were Yemenis. In my 
capacity as the prime minister, I demanded that assassinations 
be halted and measures be taken against a number of defendants 
who carried out such assassinations. When the security measures 
were implemented, a perpetrator from the southern provinces was 
arrested. But the others failed to arrest the defendants at 
their end, although the location of the defendants and those 
supporting them was known. 
  Al-'Attas added: When the explosion occurred near my house 
in July 1992, a person was arrested whose hands smelled of TNT. 
But the next day the security reports were reversed and claimed 
that the smell was that of "qat" [narcotic plants]. 
  The Yemeni prime minister then talked about the foreign 
dimensions of terrorism which has affected Egypt. He said: 
"Terrorism has various forms. Terrorism runs counter to the 
democratic course pursued in Yemen. All terrorist practices in 
Yemen are listed under the category of terrorism. We have 
warned against these practices because the state resorted to 
favoritism with some parties to gain their support in 
confronting other domestic forces. A number of Yemenis and 
non-Yemenis recently returned to Yemen from Afghanistan." 
  The prime minister added: In my opinion, the presence of 
these terrorist elements in Yemen is harmful to the country and 
to its relations with other countries. It has become clear that 
there is "an overlap" [taqatu'] between the terrorist elements 
and the state apparatus. The extent of this "overlap" is not 
yet known. As prime minister, during a meeting attended by the 
head of the Presidential Council in 1992 I called for the arrest 
of the non-Yemeni terrorist elements or their expulsion from the 
country. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a decision on 
this matter at that time, but the decision was not implemented. 
  Some of the Yemeni terrorist elements were detained from the 
south governorates. The move was designed to cast a shadow on 
these governorates, particularly in view of the "allegations" 
that the orders of assassinations were issued by the YSP and 
that the said elements were members of the Jihad Party [hizb 
al-jihad]. The obvious goal, naturally, was to create further 
divisions within the southern governorates. 
  The Yemeni prime minister accused the GPC of demonstrating 
its partitionist designs through the "circular" issued by its 
standing committee to Yemeni diplomatic missions abroad. He 
said: The GPC standing committee is the authority in charge of 
issuing orders to the diplomatic missions abroad. 
  Answering a question concerning the ineligibility of the 
ruling regime in Yemen to lead the unified state because of its 
totalitarian history in both states before unity and the fact 
that the Yemenis have doubts about that regime and are trying to 
find an alternative democratic system, al-'Attas said: I believe 
that unity was a great event in Yemen's history. Unity 
coincided with democracy and these two developments, if left to 
interact with life and reality, will certainly spawn numerous 
leaderships. The problem is that the absence of democracy in 
the past has not allowed leaderships to emerge, but they will 
emerge in the future. 
  The Yemeni prime minister concluded his interview with 
AL-AHRAM by commenting on the task of rebuilding, reorganizing, 
and reuniting the Yemeni Armed Forces. He said: The Yemeni 
defense minister made several proposals on this matter and some 
of these were ratified, but some backsliding took place. 
  "In March 1992 the Yemeni Cabinet referred the issue to the 
prime minister and called for a solution. After meeting with 
the leaders of the Defense Ministry, the general principles were 
laid down and referred to the presidency. Suddenly, the whole 
project was dumped. A third attempt coincided with the formation 
of the coalition government. A proposal for rebuilding the 
Armed Forces, drafted by the defense minister and his 
colleagues, was ratified, with some changes, by the president. 
A timetable for its actual implementation was prepared. 
Suddenly, a new chief of staff was appointed and that man 
requested the postponement of any discussion of this subject. 
The result was that nothing was accomplished." 
  The prime minister spoke about Yemen's link to domestic and 
external terrorist incidents. He said: The state has followed 
and still follows a policy of "appeasement" of certain political 
forces to win their support in the face of other domestic 
forces. He added that the presence of terrorists in Yemen is 
harmful to that country both on the domestic and foreign levels. 
He disclosed the existence of "an overlap" or a yet unclear 
exchange of interests between these elements and some Yemeni 
state organs. The non-Yemeni elements have not been expelled 
from the country, he said.

  [Text] An Interior Ministry responsible source has informed 
the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', that a Boeing 707 cargo plane 
bearing the Ugandan flag was siezed at al-Hudaydah Airport 
today, Sunday. The plane was flying from London via Athens to 
Aden, carrying a large cargo of batteries specially for military 
equipment and radio systems, which were being brought into the 
country illegally and without the knowledge or approval of the 
specialized authorities. 
  Competent authorities are carrying out investigations to 
determine the circumstances involving the arrival of this cargo 
into the country as well as those behind it.

  [Text] Aden, 6 Feb (MENA)--A responsible security source at 
Aden International Airport has dismissed the press report 
released by the Interior Ministry in Sanaa today that the 
Ugandan aircraft that was impounded at al-Hudaydah Airport today 
entered the country illegally. The source said that the 
aircraft was intercepted over al-Hudaydah and was forced to land 
at the airport. 
  The source added that the aircraft, which operates for a 
British company, was flying from London via Athens to Aden after 
it had been chartered by the Yemeni Airlines Company [al-Yemda]. 
The aircraft had permission from the Aden Airport authorities 
to land at Aden Airport. The source stressed that Aden Airport 
officials had informed the aviation authorities in Sanaa and 
al-Hudaydah that the aircraft had permission to land at Aden 
Airport. 
  The source said that the officials at the Civil Aviation 
Authority and the Air Force Command in Sanaa and al-Hudaydah 
will be held responsible for the consequences of such illegal 
acts. He noted that these acts represent a grave step that 
jeopardize air transportation movement in Yemeni airspace and 
harm Yemen's reputation and international position. 
  The source demanded that the aircraft, crew members, and 
load 
be immediately released.

<F P=106> [By Moira Whittle, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] A British aviation company director tonight 
condemned the seizure of one of the firm's planes in Yemen as an 
act of "air piracy". 
  Andy King, director of Gatwick-based ANA Aviation, said the 
Boeing 707 aircraft's cargo contained nothing more sensitive 
than torch batteries. 
  The aircraft was on route for Aden with a cargo for the 
Southern Yemen airline al-Yemda when it was forced to land at 
al-Hudaydah airport near Sanaa, by the military. The four-man 
crew, which included a British engineer, left Britain with the 
cargo on Saturday night. 
  After the Ugandan-registered plane was forced down they were 
held at the airport for 18 hours before being released. 
  "This is air piracy as far as we are concerned," said Mr 
King. "The plane had permission to go to Aden. You can't force 
airplanes out of the sky. It's against international law. We 
are being used as a pawn between the North and South Yemenis," 
he said. 
  "There was nothing dangerous or of a military nature on 
board. There were just batteries and some pharmaceuticals," 
added Mr King. 
  He said various diplomatic efforts were being made and it 
was 
hoped the plane would be able to take off again with its cargo 
tomorrow. 
  A Yemeni interior ministry official said the plane was 
seized 
because it was carrying batteries for military equipment and 
communications sets and had entered the country's airspace 
without the knowledge or approval of the authorities. 
  Tension has been growing recently between the formerly 
Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) and 
the north.

  [Text] A responsible source at the General Civil Aviation 
and Meteorology Authority [GCAMA] has explained that the GCAMA 
is the authority responsible for issuing permits for all types 
of air transportation. This is in accordance with Article 10 of 
the Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of 1993. That article reads as 
follows: 
  No plane shall be allowed to fly within the civil aviation 
routes or conduct any direct flight to or from the republic 
without obtaining prior permission from the civil aviation 
authorities. This particularly applies to the following: 
  A. Crossing the republic's airspace. 
  B. Technical landing; that is, for purposes that have 
nothing to do with air traffic. 
  C. Emergency flights for rescue, relief, or other 
humanitarian purposes. 
  D. Foreign government flights. 
  E. Flights transporting weapons, ammunitions, or military 
and dangerous materials. 
  F. Irregular commercial air transportation flights. 
  G. Group tourist flights. 
  H. General flights connected with labor, tourism, air 
operations, or special flights. 
  With reference to the media reports carried by the Second 
Channel and the Second Program on a statement by an official 
source at Aden International Airport concerning the Boeing 707 
plane which landed at al-Hudaydah airport, the GCAMA affirms 
that it had not granted entry or departure permission to that 
plane. It also affirms that airports are not authorized to give 
such permission. The authority denounces in part and parcel the 
statement that was given by an official source at Aden airport.

  [Text] Pakistan has lodged a strong protest over Indian 
President Shankar Dayal Sharma's remarks against the person of 
its prime minister. Indian High Commissioner S.K. Lambha was 
summoned to the foreign office in Islamabad yesterday and was 
told that the assault on the person of the prime minister is not 
only unjustifiable but is also against the civilized norms of 
behavior between sovereign nations. The Pakistani foreign 
office has also said that the campaign launched by India to 
malign the Pakistani prime minister cannot misguide world public 
opinion, which has openely held India responsible for the human 
rights violations in occupied Kashmir. The government of 
Pakistan very much regrets that the Indian president also has 
involved himself in the campaign.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has 
declared that Pakistan would not be cowed down by any threat and 
no power can restrain us from supporting the cause of 
righteousness, justice, and equality. Addressing the 
Balochistan local bodies convention in Sibi today, she said we 
have been raising our voice against injustices and atrocities 
wherever they have been committed -- be it Bosnia, Kashmir, or 
Palestine. We would continue our support for the usurped rights 
of the people and no threat can intimidate us. 
  The prime minister said we supported the brotherly people of 
Afghanistan against Soviet aggression and are making every 
effort for peace to prevail in that country so that it rebuilds 
itself with the cooperation of brotherly countries. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said we love Pakistan, we love the land which we achieved 
after great sacrifices and would build this country into a 
strong and prosperous state. Millions of people of the 
subcontinent rendered tremendous sacrifices and laid down their 
lives to achieve a separate homeland for Muslims of South Asia 
where they could lead a life of respect, honor and independence. 
She said democracy has been restored in Pakistan through fair 
and impartial elections and an Awami [popular] government has 
taken over the reigns of the country. This government with the 
active support of the people would make every endeavor to 
accelerate the pace of development and bring about all-round 
progress and prosperity. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said it is our collective responsibility 
to work for the solidarity, integrity, and prosperity of the 
country and we must translate the dreams of the Quaed-i-Azam 
[great leader Jinnah] into reality. The people are the real 
heirs and owners of the country, and therefore, the government 
is paying due attention toward their betterment, she said.

  [Excerpts] The nation today observed complete strike to 
express solidarity with brethren in occupied Kashmir facing 
unprecedented rein of repression unleashed by Indian occupation 
forces. People on both sides of the Line of Control dividing 
the Kashmir valley also observed complete strike. 
  In occupied Kashmir, the All Parties Hurriat Conference 
decided to observe the strike in response to an appeal made by 
Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto. Today was a closed day. 
Business and commercial centers, government and semi-government 
offices, and educational institutions remained closed. Public 
transport remained off the road and life came to a standstill 
throughout the country. 
  The call for strike to express solidarity with the Kashmiri 
people struggling for their right of self-determination was 
given by the Special Committee of the National Assembly on 
Kashmir. The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto gave 
all-out support to the strike, highlighting the nation's 
commitment to the Kashmiri cause. Opposition parties joined 
hands, demonstrating that the entire nation is united behind the 
government on this national issue. 
  In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, processions 
were taken out and rallies organized by people of all shades of 
political opinion, business, traders, students and labor 
organizations to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir. 
The processionists parading through various streets chanted 
slogans against repression the Indian Army and paramilitary 
forces have unleashed against the people in occupied Kashmir. 
  Addressing the rally, speakers condemned the Indian 
atrocities in occupied Kashmir and demanded that the United 
Nations implement its resolutions on Kashmir in order to 
determine the wishes of the Kashmiri people in a free and 
impartial plebiscite. They said the unprecedented unity shown 
by the people throughout the country today spoke of their 
determination to continue to extend moral and political support 
to their Kashmiri brethren in their struggle against Indian 
hegemony. They condemned the Indian president for his unsavory 
comments against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and said Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto has emerged as the spokesman of the Kashmiri 
people. 
  Later, leaders of the rally went to the Indian High 
Commission and handed over a memorandum. 
  Trade and labor organizations also staged demonstrations in 
the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to express 
solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren. Carrying banners and 
placards, the marchers condemned Indian atrocities and urged the 
world community to halt human rights abuses in the held valley. 
They supported the government policy on Kashmir and assured 
that they will not rest until the Kashmiri people throw off 
their Indian yoke. [passage omitted] 
  Supporting the call of the Pakistani prime minister, a 
complete strike was observed in occupied Kashmir. Reports say 
life remained paralyzed in towns and cities of the valley. All 
government and private institutes and offices; schools, 
colleges, and universities; banks; and courts remained closed 
and transport was off the road. Agency reports say Kashmiris 
staged demonstration rallies in the capital, Srinagar, and other 
big towns of the valley. They were chanting slogans against 
Indian troops' atrocities. Indian soldiers used brute force 
against the demonstrators. The All Parties Hurriat Conference 
and various religious and mojahedin organizations have endorsed 
the call for today's strike to demonstrate that the people of 
occupied Kashmir wholeheartedly appreciate Pakistan's stand on 
Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Ahmad Idris dispatch from Islamabad] </F>
  [Text] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced in 
Islamabad today that, within the next two days, she will 
dispatch her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, as a special envoy to 
Iraq at the head of a delegation with about 14 tonnes of 
medicine. Zardari will bear a message from Bhutto to President 
Saddam Husayn. Informed sources say the message is connected to 
the release of two Pakistani soldiers and one civilian who were 
sentenced to seven years imprisonment in Iraq after entering 
Iraqi territory by mistake, as was claimed at the time, while on 
the job in a mine field on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. 
  Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, 
Pakistan dispatched troops within the Desert Shield operation in 
the second Gulf war and expelled an Iraqi diplomat. 
  The two countries relations were not satisfactory during the 
rule of General Ziaul Haq. 
  Informed sources told our radio that the Pakistani 
delegation 
will discuss with officials in Baghdad the causes for their 
tense relations. The sources voiced optimism that Iraq will 
release the imprisoned Pakistanis and that relations will be 
restored to what they were during the leadership of Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto and Benazir's first government -- a state of utmost 
cordiality.

  [Text] Karachi -- Mir Aimal Kansi, 30, a suspect wanted in 
connection with the firing at the CIA Headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia, was seen in Sehwan between January 17 to 23. Kansi is 
one of the `10 most wanted' people in the United States. 
  This correspondent, who happened to be in Sehwan for a 
visit, 
saw a strange, clean-shaven, fair and tall person and recognised 
him immediately as Aimal Kansi. Pictures of Kansi have appeared 
on wanted posters all over the world. However, neither this 
correspondent not Kansi introduced themselves to each other. 
  Between puffs of hashish, the person who stared at the Indus 
Hotel of Sehwan, where the shrine of Qalandar Lal Shahbaz and a 
"Kafi" of a Pashtoon Seth (businessman) are situated, said that 
he was on a visit to the shrine of the Sufi mystic. 
  He said that he was in the transport businesses in Karachi, 
however, he refused to give his residential address in that 
city. "The whole world is my home," he said when asked about his 
permanent abode. 
  Speaking in pidgin Urdu and occasionally in fluent English, 
Kansi said that his original village was near Zhob in 
Balochistan but he had spent most of his life in the United 
States of America and Germany. 
  After the firing incident, the American Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) had recovered an AK-47 assault rifle from an 
apartment where Kansi used to live with his friends. The FBI 
report said the rifle was the same as that used in the shooting. 
The report also stated that Kansi had no criminal record and 
that his neighbours generally thought him to be a normal person 
who posed no threat to anyone. 
  The Fairfax Country Police of Virginia and the FBI had 
issued 
warrants against Kansi, after the firing, charging with the 
shooting on January 25 that occurred during the morning rush 
hour traffic just outside the CIA headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia. Two CIA personnel were killed and three others were 
injured in the bizarre shooting for which no motive has been 
established. 
  In February last year a team of the FBI had come to Pakistan 
and raided, alongwith Pakistani officials, some of the houses of 
the people who belonged to the Kansi tribe of Quetta in an 
attempt to arrest the accused. The raids, however, failed as 
the family informed the officials that Kansi had left for the US 
a couple of days back. 
  The manhunt for Kansi led to a dead-end. Finally the US 
authorities placed a reward of $100,000 for information leading 
to the arrest of Mir Aimal Kansi. 
  "I was operated upon twice in the States because of 
excessive 
drinking. That is why I have given up alcohol," Kansi said, 
surrounded by some of the Malangs (spiritually intoxicated 
followers) of Sher Baaz Qalandar, who were sharing [word 
indistinct] of hashish, Kansi showed me his [word indistinct] 
and said, "I was, first, comforted with hashish in Germany by my 
girlfriend and since then I feel that anybody who does not 
experience the joy of smoking hashish cannot enjoy life." Thick 
clouds of smoke swirled around his tough face. 
  "This person takes hashish worth Rs [Rupees] 100 daily. said 
a bearer of the hotel about Kansi, when asked how much, 
approximately, hashish he took in a day. 
  Kansi also said that his father was an army officer "But now 
I am all alone." 
  When he was very high Kansi opened up and displayed his 
feelings. he laughingly requested: "My friends, now I feel very 
alone. Please made arrangements for my wedding." A servant at 
the hotel told THE NEWS that the person, we were talking about, 
did not meet anybody during his week-long stay in Sehwan. 
  "I visit the shine of the Qalandar because I feel a certain 
peace there. I have hashish and Khang with the Malangs sitting 
inside the shrine," Kansi said. 
  He, however avoided any other discussion about the United 
States other than references to his girl-friends and hashish 
smoking. This correspondent also did not show any eagerness 
about anything because this could have led to some suspicion or 
the part of Kansi. 
  Kansi was very impressed by the quality of the hashish 
available in Sehwan. "If you guys were in Germany with this 
quality of hashish, I swear, the girls would be crazy about you." 
  After this chance encounter with Kansi, he disappeared from 
the hotel and the town. Despite efforts by this correspondent to 
trace him again he was never seen in the vicinity of the town. 
  Aimal Kansi had gone to the US from Pakistan and was working 
as courier with a private company. 
  A recent report from Bangkok also said that the police's 
special branch teams had received information from Washington 
that Kansi, had slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide in 
the network of guerillas and criminal gangs operating from there. 
  The Thai police, on the information, have circulated wanted 
posters for the arrest of three men -- Kansi, Mohammad Farooq 
and Ramsi Ahmad Yusuf. The latter two are suspects in the World 
Trade Centre bombing case. 
  The wanted posters offer two million US dollars for the 
information leading the arrest of suspects.

  [Text] The situation in south Lebanon is worrying. We are 
receiving reports every five minutes of Israeli warplanes 
overflying the region. We received a report 10 minutes ago that 
Israeli warplanes are raiding the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights after 
intensive reconnaissance sorties throughout the night and into 
the morning over al-Nabatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah, western 
al-Biqa', al-Luwayzah, Jarju', and the central sector. 
  We received a report two hours ago that the Israeli 
bombardment of villages in the south intensified and continued 
until 1300, targeting the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights, Jarju', 'Ayn 
Bu Siwar, and Arab Salim. At about 1330, Israeli warplanes flew 
intensively at low altitude over Iqlim al-Tuffah and 
al-Nabatiyah, staging mock raids. The Lebanese Army confronted 
the aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. Iqlim al-Tuffah areas and 
al-Luwayzah came under artillery barrage at 1100 from the South 
Lebanese Army [SLA] and Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah. 
Resistance men fired at the sources. 
  Israeli aircraft reconnoitered the region up to east Sidon 
and al-Nabatiyah, breaking the sound barrier. Israeli warplanes 
flew low over western al-Biqa' at about 1100, again breaking the 
sound barrier over al-Nabatiyah. 
  The resistance men this morning attacked an SLA position in 
Sujud with rockets and mortar and clashes ensued in which all 
types of weapons were used. 
  At 1350 today, Israeli warplanes raided the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
heights, concentrating on al-Luwayzah, for the second time today. 
  Just in from the south, Israeli military aircraft are flying 
low over the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights and Lebanese Army ground 
anti- aircraft guns are confronting them. The resistance fired 
surface- to-air Strella missiles at the Israeli aircraft, 
causing panic in the region and making the people believe the 
Israeli aircraft had launched a new raid.

  [Text] Just in from the newsdesk. We have a report about 
the security situation in the south. Dani Nur-al-Din, our 
correspondent in al-Nabatiyah, has just told us that Israeli 
warplanes are raiding positions in the al-Zahrani River basin 
and the periphery of Jabal al-Rayhan. 
  The raiding planes have made four sorties. 
  Our correspondent also says that Lebanese Army antiaircraft 
guns in al-Nabatiyah are confronting the raiding Israeli planes. 
Over the telephone, we can hear the sound of heavy gunfire and 
the explosions of shells dropped by the Israeli aircraft.

  [Text] Marj 'Uyun, Lebanon, Feb 7 (AFP)--Hizballah 
guerrillas killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded three 
others in south Lebanon on Monday, triggering retaliatory air 
strikes, security sources said. 
  The ambush took place as an Israeli patrol drove along a 
road 
in Israel's self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, the 
sources said. 
  The attack was claimed by the pro-Iranian Hizballah. 
  Shortly afterwards Israeli warplanes raided Hizballah 
positions near the south Lebanon port city of Sidon, the sources 
said. 
  [In an earlier, related report, Paris AFP in English at 1135 
GMT on 7 February, stated the following: "Guerrillas attacked 
an Israeli army patrol with anti-tank rockets and automatic 
weapons on Monday wounding six soldiers, security sources in 
south Lebanon said. 
  ["The ambush took place as the patrol drove along a road in 
Israel's self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, the 
sources said. 
  ["A spokesman for the Islamic Resistance, the armed wing of 
the Hizballah movement, told AFP in Beirut that its guerrillas 
destroyed an Israeli Merkava tank, killing or wounding an 
unspecified number of Israeli soldiers. 
  ["Two other bomb attacks on patrols from the Israeli army 
and 
its proxy South Lebanon Army militia (SLA) caused no casualties. 
  ["Guerrillas also fired 10 Katyusha rockets on the outskirts 
of Marj 'Uyun, where Israeli forces and the SLA have their south 
Lebanon headquarters, but nobody was hurt, the SLA said. 
  ["Hizballah and the pro-Syrian Amal movement carry out 
frequent raids against Israeli forces in south Lebanon. 
  ["The pace slowed down ahead of the January 16 Geneva summit 
between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and US President Bill 
Clinton, but there have been around 20 attacks since."]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Hizballah; place and date not given] </F>
  [Text] The recent statements and threats by several Zionist 
officials, which coincide with the continuing escalation of 
attacks against the southern areas, reveal premeditated and 
grave Zionist designs. These designs aim to prepare for 
wide-scale military operations under the pretext of defending 
Zionist security, which is being threatened by the continuing 
resistance operations. 
  Needless to say, the Zionist enemy has not and will not give 
up its expansionist designs and aggressive policy. The Zionist 
officials' talk about peace is only an overt maneuver to conceal 
the terrorist plans being carried out against the south, the 
Western al-Biqa', and the occupied Palestinian land. 
  The Zionist enemy leaders are searching for excuses to 
escalate the situation and drive matters toward the brink of 
war. The Zionist leaders believe that the threats could twist 
the arm of the mujahidin and those resisting the policy of 
aggression. They also think that their threats could prompt the 
international community to make efforts to pacify the situation 
by taking into consideration the Zionist security concerns. 
  However, we believe that this Zionist method has been 
exposed 
and that the enemy should never talk about security concerns as 
long as it continues its occupation and attacks. Occupation 
cannot provide the enemy with security. This is possibly what 
the enemy wants so that the occupation might become a fait 
accompli recognized, even implicitly, through the destruction of 
the resistance role. 
  Resistance is a continuous embodiment of our people's 
rejection of this occupation and its results, like the fait 
accompli and the arrangements, which are indeed a recognition of 
this occupation. 
  Hence, we call on everyone, particularly those who hope that 
peace is imminent, not to wager on the enemy's claims and 
designs. We also call on them to be more truthful with their 
people and citizens. We tell them that before talking about 
Lebanon's readiness to join the peace, if it ever happens, they 
should talk about full preparations to confront the 
possibilities of a new war that might be launched by the Zionist 
enemy so that no one will be surprised. 
  We ask about the preparations for confrontation and 
steadfastness. What has the Lebanese Government done on this 
serious task? Where has the talk about the support for the 
south and southerners gone? Does the way to prosperity in 
Lebanon come through the purchase of shares in Solidaire or 
through steadfastness in the south and the confrontation of the 
continuous threats against the people, land, and waters? 
Prosperity can only come through strong faith and full 
readiness to offer sacrifices for the sake of regaining every 
iota of cherished soil that is being occupied by the Zionists.

  [Text] The repeated detentions of scores of Lebanese Forces 
[LF] personnel and officials on flimsy grounds and excuses harms 
the national accord, violates the laws and the Constitution, and 
disrupts social peace. Because of this and LF's eagerness to 
place a number of facts before Lebanese officials and the 
public, the LF would like to ask the state what has become of 
the accord and understanding agreement. Is the agreement to end 
the war and begin a new chapter still valid or is there a 
decision to disregard it? If a decision has been made to retreat 
on the accord and understanding agreement, who made this 
decision and in whose interest? 
  The LF reminds everybody that the war in Lebanon is over and 
that the Lebanese, who have paid dearly for this war, have the 
right to be treated accordingly by their own state. The state 
should help them speed up the move toward the peace era instead 
of giving the impression that it is responsible for continuing 
the atmosphere of tension, fear, and the painful legacy of the 
past. 
  The LF would like to ask about the fate of the general 
amnesty law and wonders if there is a need to create incidents 
that are mostly fabricated, unsubstantiated, twisted, and 
erroneously interpreted to serve narrow and cheap political 
goals? The LF would like to ask the state if what is being 
applied is a policy of reconciliation or a settling of accounts 
and the use of brute force? The Lebanese have a right to know 
from the state who is responsible for undermining the accord and 
understanding agreement and what are the measures adopted to 
straighten things out. 
  The LF emphasizes that the way it is being treated reflects 
a 
policy that smacks more of political repression than an exercise 
of authority against a political current that enjoys broad 
public support. Under this policy, unjust and unreasonable 
methods are being used, taking advantage of its institutions and 
agencies. 
  The LF, which has long been calling for the need to turn the 
page on the past and proceed to build a future, renews the call 
to renounce negative, malicious, and narrow-minded policies and 
the settling of accounts and to rise above factional and narrow 
interests. It calls on the Lebanese state to realize its role 
and responsibilities in this regard by helping all Lebanese to 
pursue a positive line instead of acting in a negative manner 
that runs contrary to laws, charters, constitutions, and norms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Security Source Explains the </F>
Detentions and Reveals Capture of `Israeli Sabotage Ring'"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- An official security source 
has explained the facts relating to the detentions carried out 
in several areas and affecting people of various affiliations. 
He said that the detentions were made "in the course of the 
continuous daily efforts of the Lebanese security organs which 
have recently succeeded in capturing an Israeli sabotage ring 
run by elements spread between Beirut and the occupied border 
strip." 
  The source emphasized to AL-HAYAH that the work of the 
Lebanese security organs "is not linked to any particular date, 
time, or place. Their task is to maintain security and ward off 
any threat to internal security, and it covers all security 
violations." [passage omitted] 
  He said that the pursuit and storming operations "have, 
contrary to the claims made by some, not been targeting any 
particular group. We tackle security issues on the sole basis 
of security and we let justice take its course and pronounce the 
verdict. The proof is that the security authorities have in 
recent weeks carried out a number of operations not restricted 
to any particular area but covering most Lebanese provinces." 
[passage omitted] 
  He said that the position recently taken by the Lebanese 
Forces' Central Information Bureau regarding the detentions and 
maintaining that they undermined national accord and the law 
"came after the security authorities detained some individuals 
who divulged some information in connection with the explosion 
targeting the Lebanese Army camp in Rumiyah years ago. Some 
admitted that they had been instructed by certain security 
officials to gather information regarding the movements of state 
officials, foremost among them President Ilyas al-Hirawi." 
  The source asked: "Are we the department which decides 
whether the general amnesty law should cover these people or 
should justice take its course and determine their fate, 
particularly as some of them have confessed that they were 
instructed by a special security organ to gather information for 
we know not whom?" [passage omitted] 
  He referred to the ring which worked for Israel, most of its 
members having been arrested before the end of last month. They 
used to gather information and move between Beirut and the 
security belt. He asked: "Are the security organs not supposed 
to interrogate those people or refer them to the military 
investigating magistrate, bearing in mind that some of them made 
clear and frank confessions?" 
  The source urged all parties "not to pass haphazard 
judgements and to wait for the truth to come out before taking 
stands harmful to themselves and before requesting dismissal of 
the charges, release of the detainees, and discontinuation of 
the pursuit of wanted persons." 
  He said that any charge made against any detainee "should 
not 
be taken as a charge against the party he belongs to." [passage 
omitted]

  [Interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by Fatimah 
Faqih in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [Faqih] What is the impact of the Clinton-al-Asad 
summit meeting on the integration of the Lebanese and Syrian 
tracks in the forthcoming round of negotiations? 
  [Dallul] The summit of U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Syrian 
Arab President Hafiz al-Asad was mainly based on the integration 
between the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. Furthermore, I say that 
this summit--and there is no illusion in what I say--is the 
result of this physical integration of the Lebanese-Syrian 
level, and the coordination and consultation with the Jordanian 
track. This integration of the Arab tracks, despite the 
deviation of Palestinian brothers from the semi-Arab consensus, 
forced all who deal with the dossier of the Middle East 
negotiations to follow a distinguished new approach with the 
Arab parties directly concerned with the negotiations. 
  In other words, the steadfastness of the Syrian and Lebanese 
front, and to some extent, the steadfastness of the Jordanian 
front, have been the basis of the political developments that 
were crowned by the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva. 
  All those concerned with the Middle East negotiations on all 
levels became aware that the political breakthrough they made on 
the Arab tracks, and precisely through the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, was not enough to make a settlement, even a distorted 
one, on the Palestinian track itself, so how can this be the 
case with the other tracks? The deformed agreement that is 
called the Gaza-Jericho agreement does not represent even a 
small portion of the Palestinian people's aspirations, so how 
can this be the case with our Arab nation's aspirations for 
comprehensive, just, and real peace? 
  Briefly, I say we and Syria have not been apart in very 
serious circumstances. Therefore, we will not be apart today 
after we reaped together the result of our steadfastness and 
integration. 
  [Faqih] How will the positive atmosphere be translated on 
the 
negotiations table? Are there assurances on pressuring Israel 
in order to advance the Lebanese and Syrian tracks? 
  [Dallul] Our only assurance for employing pressure on Israel 
is through continued integration of the Lebanese and Syrian 
tracks. This is the only guarantee for reaching a just and 
honorable solution. Some quarters tried to ignore or even to 
delay negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, and some 
international and regional forces tried to undermine the size of 
Syria and Lebanon in the settlement. They also tried to inflate 
the size of the Gaza- Jericho agreement in order to overshadow 
the whole cause, but we, on the Lebanese side as well as on the 
Syrian side, stressed that Palestine is an Arab cause, 
therefore, it concerns all Arabs, and no party, whoever they 
might be, has the right to say that this cause is his particular 
cause or his area, in which he deals in the manner he deems 
appropriate. 
  [Faqih] What is the role of the U.S. full partner? 
  [Dallul] We have no illusions about this. The U.S. partner 
has declared its full bias to Israel. During the main phases of 
the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the United States 
financed and even supported all Israel's wars against the Arabs. 
Furthermore, it provided an international and political cover 
for the Zionist state. But I speak now about the U.S. interest 
in all of this, and in this particular stage. Now the United 
State is the sole superpower in the international political 
arena, therefore, what interest do the American people have in 
antagonizing Arabs, who have huge human and economic 
capabilities? What interest does the United States have in 
supporting Israeli aggressions against Lebanon, for instance? I 
ask this question about U.S. interests, and I do not find 
convincing answers that call for continued U.S. adoption of the 
aggressive Israeli policy. Therefore, I assume that the United 
States is heading for a change in its alliances. I do not have 
facts indicating any major change in this field, but what is 
needed is to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict with some 
objectivity. 
  [Faqih] Does Lebanon still stick to its position not to 
participate in multilateral negotiations unless progress was 
realized in the bilateral negotiations? 
  [Dallul] Lebanon still sticks to this point in particular 
and 
refuses to participate in the multilateral negotiations. We do 
not have any other formula for negotiations other than the 
current formula. 
  [Faqih] Suppose Israel proposed a joint committee with 
Lebanon in exchagne for a commitment to comply with UN Security 
Council Resolution 425? How would you react? How do you 
envisage the work of such a committee? Will you approve of the 
security arrangements? What role would the Lebanese Army play? 
And what will become of Hizballah and the resistance and the 
South Lebanese Army [SLA] ? 
  [Dallul] Resolution 425 provides for an Israeli pullout from 
the occupied Arab territories not linked to security 
arrangements or a military committee with the Israeli enemy. 
Lebanon has publicly rejected any security arrangements with 
Israel. We have made our rejection of any joint military 
committee known as well. 
  The Lebanese Army is now set to deploy in all Lebanese 
territories, including those under Israeli occupation. As for 
the weapons in the hands of Hizballah and the resistance, the 
areas where the Lebanese military deploys will be off limits to 
any other weapons. As for what you call the SLA, we have never 
recognized it. For us, it is outside national legitimacy. We 
will deal with it accordingly. 
  [Faqih] Assuming Antoine Lahd recognized the l-Ta'if accord 
and the SLA surrendered their weapons to the state, is it 
possible that it would end up the way other militias did? Would 
the other parties and forces agree to absorb some 3,000 agents? 
  [Dallul] There is no comparison between the SLA and other 
Lebanese militias. These militias have fought each other for 
many years and for a variety of reasons, each adhering to what 
it viewed as its own princples. But none of these have strayed 
outside their Lebanese fold, or sold out to the devil the way 
the SLA have. In any case, Lebanon has its judicial and legal 
authorities that will decide the way to handle the SLA. 
  [Faqih] Has a link been established between Israel and the 
recent explosions in al-Sayfi and the attempt on the life of the 
Lebanese president? Don't you think such leaks are detrimental 
to Lebanon's credibility? 
  [Dallul] In criminology, we first look for who stands to 
gain most from a crime. In the case of a homeland, the evidence 
is usually more conclusive and damning. Lebanon is going 
through a state of growth and recuperation, and is emerging from 
a terrible civil war. There are ongoing attempts to restore 
credibility in Lebanon, with powerful forces working in the 
opposite direction. If the military confrontations are over, 
there is still a more ferocious battle that we have to fight, 
and that is the struggle for peace in Lebanon, for the Lebanese 
people's civilizing, cultural, democratic, and economic roles. 
  The rehabilitation effort is attended by compelling and 
destructive circumstances, pressure, and siege on all sides. In 
our battle for peace our weapons are not that many. The only 
weapon we have is the will and determination to build. 
  There are attempts to undermine the confidence we are 
seeking 
to restore to Lebanon's security and economy and to kill the 
saplings before they put forth their leaves, with the object of 
wrecking all that we have built and scrapping the al-Ta'if 
agreement. 
  [Faqih] Who will benefit from this? 
  [Dallul] The crime leads to the criminal. In any case, it is 
not far removed from Israel, although the direct perpetrator is 
not necessarily an Israeli. 
  [Faqih] Will the negative stands affect the pope's visit to 
Lebanon? Can the Lebanese security organs protect the pope? 
  [Dallul] There were no negative stands regarding the pope's 
expected visit to Lebanon. Some political sides declared 
political stands regarding this visit and expressed their desire 
that the Vatican maintains a balanced policy vis-a-vis the 
Middle East issue. However, there were no negative stands in the 
full sense of the word. 
  With regard to the capability of the Lebanese organs to 
protect the pope, it is certain that our organizations can 
provide such protection with efficiency. Those who can protect 
the entire homeland can protect its guests, even if the guest is 
the pope. 
  [Faqih] Is the Syrian presence in Lebanon subject to 
discussion? 
  [Dallul] There is no such problem as the Syrian presence in 
Lebanon. This presence came in response to an official and 
popular legitimate Lebanese request to confront the plot against 
Lebanon and the Lebanese. This presence contributed in a basic 
fashion to stability in Lebanon and to reaching this situation. 
  I say this presence was a solution, not a problem; it was a 
solution that stopped the bloodshed and brought an end to the 
fire that was spreading to every street, house, and village in 
Lebanon. This presence created a suitable atmosphere to lay down 
the bases of peace. 
  [Faqih] If Israel withdraws all its forces from southern 
Lebanon, can the Lebanese Army, with its limited capabilities, 
control the entire border and prevent infiltrations and fedayeen 
operations that would renew tension on the borders? 
  [Dallul] First, I would like to assert that the Lebanese 
Army 
can protect the Lebanese borders with its capabilities, which we 
are trying to develop. The capabilities of the Lebanese Army 
are not as limited as some people might think. This army stood 
up in the face of the recent Israeli aggressions and resisted 
them, with its available potentials -- with its hands, weapons, 
and determination. The army's determination is an important 
weapon. The decision of steadfastness and fighting is the most 
important weapon. Yes, this army can protect the Lebanese 
borders. With regard to the fedayeen operations, these 
operations are launched because dear parts of our land are still 
under Israeli occupation. So, when this occupation ends, there 
will be no need for fedayeen operations. 
  [Faqih] It has been reported recently that there will be 
government change or reshuffle following the Geneva summit? 
  [Dallul] Why should there be a change or a reshuffle 
following the Geneva summit? I see no reason for this, although 
the possibility of a government change in Lebanon exists under 
less important circumstances. This government will be changed 
when the reasons for its continuation have ended. This is not 
an important issue. People are not as important as the policy 
of the government or the general outlines governing its trends.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij by 'Ali </F>
al-Ruzz and Bisharah Shirbil in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] Have your meetings with British 
officials produced any specific agreements? 
  [Mirhij] I held wide-ranging talks covering the possibility 
of supplying Lebanon with arms, equipment, helicopters, coast 
guard requirements, rescue boats, light weapons, communication 
equipment, and various means of transport. The talks were held 
in the commercial way used traditionally between states. We 
sensed a British interest in strengthening economic ties and in 
playing a part in the region. We also sensed a British interest 
in the Lebanese market as a key to the region and beyond. They 
appreciate the Lebanese activity abroad and know that the goods 
it receives become popular. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Did the British officials show no inclination to 
provide financial or technical aid? 
  [Mirhij] The talks were held on a selling and buying basis 
but the British expressed willingness to provide facilities if 
deals were concluded. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the process of reconciliation 
between the various sects? 
  [Mirhij] It means nothing. Thr reconciliation should be 
among all the Lebanese because there are differences within each 
sect. Sectarian solutions only confirm the old disease. I hope 
that what I have said will not be interpreted to mean that I am 
against good relations within each sect and between sects, for 
that is a binding moral and humanitarian necessity. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is the cabinet now an institution as stipulated 
in the al-Ta'if agreement or is it still controlled by the 
"troika"? 
  [Mirhij] The cabinet is in the process of becoming an 
institution. This road is full of challenges but there is no 
alternative to it because when the cabinet becomes an 
institution it will be fulfilling everyone's rights and will be 
a guarantee for everyone. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the president's call for the 
amendment of the al-Ta'if agreement in connection with the 
powers of the presidency? 
  [Mirhij] The al-Ta'if document represents the political 
ceiling in a dangerous phase in Lebanon's life and it has 
achieved some kind of political balance and, more importantly, 
national accord on the basis of which the state has been 
rebuilt. That is why that formula should be preserved and 
protected by all means. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Are you in favor of the literal implementation of 
the al-Ta'if agreement? 
  [Mirhij] Yes, and after implementation we can improve from 
within. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Have their been any operations against Syrian 
checkpoints? 
  [Mirhij] There have been some attempts against some position 
and the culprits have been arrested. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International has talked about torture of 
detainees. 
  [Mirhij] I have no official information that anyone has been 
tortured. Let me say that such attempts in fact target 
stability and not the legal and legitimate Syrian presence which 
is objectively and strategically needed. Resisting the Syrian 
Army in this connection means resisting the supreme national 
interest. 
  [AL-HAYAH] There are those who claim that there has been 
an arrangement to ensure that the Syrian presence is not 
terminated. 
  [Mirhij] It will be a different matter when Lebanon is 
united and its institutions well established. The Syrians are 
helping Lebanon build its institutions because that is in their 
interest. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What about political decisions? 
  [Mirhij] Political decisionmaking in accordance with the 
al-Ta'if agreement has eliminated the possibility of conflict 
with the Syrian position and pushed toward integration. For 
instance, how would we have confronted the Israeli ambitions had 
there been no Lebanese-Syrian solidarity? 
  [AL-HAYAH] If the challenges of negotiations with Israel 
necessitated a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you agree? 
  [Mirhij] I am for any close integral political links that 
serve Lebanon, confirm its existence, and contribute to the 
liberation of its territory from occupation and the rebuilding 
of its state. What is going on now is the consolidation of the 
fraternity treaty and the building of its institutions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Are you continuing to grant citizenship to 
whomever it is due to? 
  [Mirhij] That is a commitment under the al-Ta'if agreement 
and the cabinet statement. We want to carry it out whatever the 
difficulties and complications. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What about Palestinian rights? 
  [Mirhij] Relations with the Palestinians are at their best. 
We always meet with them and facilitate their work as much as 
possible. There are some problems regarding the practice of 
certain professions such as medicine, engineering, and law. 
Apart from that, we help them in all fields. 
  [AL-HAYAH] There are those who use a racist language against 
the Palestinians. 
  [Mirhij] There is such a thing but we are fighting it. The 
Palestinians are our brothers and they have suffered and have 
been the victims of international ambitions and the Zionist 
movement. It is our duty to do our best to help them. Sometimes 
there is failure. That happens with our own people but it is 
something we are continuously trying to surmount and not a 
position we take.

  [Excerpts] Israel has decided not to send its peace 
delegation, with Shim'on Peres at its head, to Cairo today if 
Yasir 'Arafat does not participate in the talks. According to 
Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic correspondent, this was decided last 
night in a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Peres. More from reporter Dick Winter: 
  [Begin recording] [Winter] [passage omitted] The prime 
minister is not playing the PLO's game. Last night, in his 
meeting with the Arab Israeli Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, who has been 
described by Palestinian watchers as the PLO's ambassador to 
Israel, Prime Minister Rabin rejected the PLO's proposal to hold 
the talks today without 'Arafat being present. 
  Rabin is keeping Israel's next moves close to the chest. In 
a speech last night welcoming Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
to Israel, the prime minister repeated the stand he has been 
taking for the last month: 
  [Rabin] Mr. Prime Minister, in our quest for peace we have 
learned that we must stand our ground on matters of life and 
death, to guarantee our security, and not to run after false 
solutions. For us, peace without security is not peace. We are 
mindful of lessons from your distant and not so distant past. 
One of them is taken from your tragic history: the agreement 
which abandoned your country to the destructive jaws of the Nazi 
regime. We have learned to rely only on ourselves. 
  [Winter] This morning, Prime Minister Rabin will again meet 
with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, as well as the entire 
Israeli delegation and with senior members of the defense 
establishment, to decide on Israel's next move. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent Shlomo Raz at the Prime Minister's Office in 
Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Text] [Raz] Mr. Foreign Minister, are you going to Cairo 
tomorrow? 
  [Peres] I hope so. We still have to clarify a few things. 
  [Raz] Where do the contacts with the PLO stand? Is there 
any chance of concluding matters in the present round of talks? 
  [Peres] Israel has prepared a complete agreement. Now we 
have to also reach agreement with the PLO. 
  [Raz] Will 'Arafat arrive tomorrow? 
  [Peres] I cannot answer for him. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, where do the major obstacles lie? 
  [Peres] In the complexity of the situation on the ground, in 
the various scenarios, concerns, fears, and aspirations. 
Whoever thinks we are negotiating over where a policeman should 
stand or not is simply deluding himself. These negotiations are 
about the crux of the matter, about peoples' emotions, fears, 
and hopes. The fact that this is expressed in arguments about 
the stationing of this or that policeman merely serves to 
highlight the difficulties in bridging the existing gaps between 
the Palestinian and Israeli positions. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, do you really think that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] is throwing a monkey wrench into the works, as 
one newspaper headline stated? 
  [Peres] No one ever heard me make such a statement or use 
such a remark in the course of the past week. Many of the 
things attributed to me are mere assumptions based on groundless 
psychological analyses. 
  [Raz] Do you have any reservations with the IDF's degree of 
involvement in the current stage of the process? 
  [Peres] I think it is important that the IDF be involved. 
The negotiations definitely have their security and military 
aspects and I have no complaints about the IDF's involvement. 
  [Raz] Thank you Mr. Peres.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he fears a 
slowdown in the peace talks. Peres yesterday answered questions 
about the negotiations with the Palestinians and the whole peace 
process in a lively session in New York with members of the 
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. 
On the phone with details is Judy Lessing in New York: 
  [Begin recording] [Lessing] Shim'on Peres said his talks 
with Yasir 'Arafat are negotiations between two people with deep 
feelings and great emotions. With every point representing 
thorns and miles of feelings, suspicions, and fears. He said 
great care is taken over every word and nuance. There is a 
drawback to this. 
  [Peres] We feel that if we shall go on at the present pace 
we may lose a great deal of goodwill, both at home and abroad. 
The tremendous amount of goodwill which exists today in the 
world may evaporate and nothing will remain. 
  [Lessing] The foreign minister said recent remarks by Mr. 
'Arafat to the United Nations Human Rights Commission that Arabs 
do not believe Israel is serious about implementing the peace 
accords do not surprise him. 
  [Peres] Let us not forget that we are arguing with 'Arafat, 
not only agreeing. I do not expect 'Arafat to offer us 
compliments. He wants to win points too. 
  [Lessing] Mr. Peres turned aside rumors that he and the 
prime minister have differences and said that during the 
negotiations they are in daily phone contact. 
  [Peres] Each of us is entitled to emphasis what he thinks is 
important, but at the end of the day we reach an agreement 
otherwise we could not work. Let me say very seriously that I 
believe that Mr. Rabin, as myself, do understand in depth that a 
divided leadership may be a catastrophe for peace and for the 
country. You must trust us that we understand seriously what is 
our responsibility, and do not pay so much understand to the 
gossips and rumors. 
  [Lessing] Foreign Minister Peres said after President 
Clinton and Syria's President al-Asad met, there was a new 
climate. 
  [Peres] But when you look at the hard facts not many changes 
really occurred. First of all, I wish that al-Asad would use 
the same language like Clinton. It would warm up the heart of 
many Israelis. But whereas Clinton was forthcoming and 
generous, al-Asad was economic and careful. 
  [Lessing] Mr. Peres said he sees no change in four areas: 
the negotiations with Syria lack openness, are too formal, and 
do not give the negotiators the freedom to make mistakes and 
work through them. President al-Asad is silent about peace. 
Syria has an ambiguous position about security and Israel will 
not buy equal footing, exchanging a demilitarized Golan for a 
demilitarized Israel. There are no dramatic moves on Lebanon, 
just slow caution. 
  [Peres] We on our side, we say that we are for a 
comprehensive peace, Syria included, but we are against a 
comprehensive negotiation. Because if we shall have to 
negotiate simultaneously with all sides, the party which is slow 
or reluctant may decide the pace of the negotiations. This is 
more or less the situation. 
  [Lessing] Mr. Peres showed he is tired of the Saudi Arabian 
position: a private backing of peace but nothing in public. 
  [Peres] The time has come for them, in my judgment, to stand 
up and say clear things about peace. And, if you ask me, I am 
totally dissatisfied with their position. 
  [Lessing] Mr. Peres said much has changed since Yig'al 
Alon's red lines which could not be crossed. He said missiles 
and nonconventional arms have changed the nature of security and 
what is needed is a regional defense which is up to date and for 
tomorrow, not for yesterday. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Peres also predicts that when peace is 
achieved, an industrial zone will be created along the Jordan 
River. He told the Jewish leaders in New York that the river 
would be a bridge for new enterprises instead of a knife cutting 
the economic flesh of Israel and Jordan.

  [Text] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
political adviser, said that the PLO was prepared to immediately 
sign the understandings reached at the beginning of the Davos 
talks. Al-Tibi asserted that the meeting between 'Arafat and 
Foreign Minister Peres was conditional on Israel's -- and 
especially on Prime Minister Rabin's -- readiness to permit a 
rapid completion of the negotiations. 
  Speaking before the Jewish-Arab center in Yafo, Ahmad 
al-Tibi 
criticized the police force's intention to use dogs against 
Palestinians. Al-Tibi added that the PLO leadership was very 
interested in Minister Hayim Ramon's political future, because 
he had played a positive role in achieving the agreement between 
the PLO and Israel. Ahmad al-Tibi's remarks were reported by 
our correspondent Qa'is al-Qudra.

  [Text] Minister Yosi Sarid, a member of the Israeli team 
negotiating with the PLO, said that it was the Palestinian 
delegation's constant vacillation which precluded the reaching 
of an agreement in Davos, and not disagreements between Prime 
Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Sarid 
denied allegations made by Nabil Sha'th, according to which 
inflexible instructions from Rabin foiled agreement. Sarid 
asserted that Sha'th had approved a document formulated by the 
delegations and only retracted his agreement after 'Arafat 
expressed dissatisfaction with the paper. Minister Sarid that 
an exchange of accusations between the two delegations would 
neither help nor promote the negotiations. Instead of 
continuing to analyze what happened in Davos, Sarid said, we 
must prepare for the meeting in Cairo in order to guarantee its 
success.

  [Excerpt] Now to the cabinet meeting in Jerusalem: Health 
Minister Hayim Ramon did in fact resign this morning. He 
submitted his letter of resignation and left the cabinet 
chamber. The resignation takes effect on 48 hours' time. 
During the meeting, several ministers expressed reservations 
about IDF [Israel Defense Forces] involvement in the peace 
process; others spoke up for this involvement. On this and 
other issues on the agenda, David Ze'ev: 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is scheduled to arrive home 
late this afternoon. His office says the foreign minister will 
sit down with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the next steps in 
the peace process towards evening. 
  At this morning's cabinet meeting, a government source says 
Prime Minister Rabin told his ministers: We are always giving, 
and the Palestinians are always taking. Internally, the prime 
minister spoke out against the criticism of Labor Knesset Member 
Hagay Merom that Army officers are overly involved in the 
diplomatic process of the negotiations with the Palestinians. 
Rabin is said to have complained that the critics are never 
satisfied. Either, they say, the Army isn't having a big enough 
say, or, they say, the Army is too involved. 
  Meretz Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that while certainly the 
Army must be involved in the military ramifications of the Gaza 
Jericho First arrangement, there is the impression, says Tzaban, 
that the IDF's involvement goes beyond what is necessary. 
  Health Minister Hayim Ramon presented his letter of 
resignation, as expected. He was abrupt when asked about the 
next 48 hours until the resignation takes effect, but he 
certainly did not rule out the possibility of his remaining in 
the government, and not just as a Knesset member. [passage

  [Text] In today's cabinet session, security sources 
reported that the Fatah Hawks do not accept the authority of 
PLO-Tunis, and that since the signing of the Israel-PLO 
Declaration of Principles they have not ceased their terror 
activity. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Prime 
Minister Rabin emphasized to the ministers that in the talks 
which preceded the formulation of the Declaration of Principles 
he prevented the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] involvement 
because at that time political decisions were being made. Now, 
however, the military echelon is involved in the negotiations 
because military decisions are being made on issues such as 
external security, safeguarding the traffic axes, and securing 
the settlements. 
  Mr. Rabin explained that he wants the 'Arafat-Peres meeting 
to proceed as planned in Cairo tomorrow. Prime Minister Rabin 
and Foreign Minister Peres will hold a private meeting this 
afternoon in order to decide on this issue.

  [Text] Security issues, agreed to at the talks with the 
PLO, are to be discussed today at the Prime Minister's Office. 
Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of Staff Baraq, and other senior 
officers are to take part. Chief of Staff Baraq says reports of 
divisions between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the 
Foreign Ministry over security agreements with the Palestinians 
are exaggerated. All of us share a common goal to achieve the 
best security arrangements possible, he said in Tel Aviv last 
night. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 4 February 
adds: "Chief of Staff Baraq said yesterday that in the recent 
discussions with the PLO, very promising working papers have 
been formalized. The IDF examines every draft and makes its 
comments because it will have to execute the agreement in the 
field."] 
  Commenting on the gun battle between an Army undercover unit 
and Fatah members in Rafah yesterday in which one Fatah gunman 
was killed and two soldiers wounded, General Baraq said the IDF 
will continue to pursue anyone still engaging in armed attacks. 
The chief of staff, who was attending the annual dinner for 
wounded veterans of the IDF Engineering Corps, spoke with our 
reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-'Ami] There is an impression now 
that there is a conflict or an argument between the IDF, the 
Army, yourself, and the diplomats with regard to security 
arrangements and the agreement with the Palestinians. 
  [Baraq] No, no; we do not have.... [pauses] Our 
negotiations are not with the Foreign Ministry or the minister 
of foreign affairs, but Israel is running negotiations with the 
Palestinians. We have, naturally, different perspectives, but a 
common cause and goal to achieve an agreement with the 
Palestinians where the security interests -- especially the 
personal security of Israeli settlers in the Gaza and Jericho 
area -- will be fully secured. We are responsible for it. 
These are arrangements that have to do with the security of the 
individual settler in Gaza and Jericho, and we feel fully 
committed to make whatever should be done in order to secure 
that. 
  [Ben-'Ami] Does it look as if it is going to take a lot more 
discussion yet to reach the arrangement? 
  [Baraq] No. It is quite natural that we are clarifying the 
details with our Foreign Ministry officials, but if it should 
take another two or three weeks, so let it be. 
  [Ben-'Ami] General Baraq, has there been any change in the 
IDF policy toward Fatah members? There have been a number of 
gunfights, a number of arrests of Fatah people by the IDF? 
  [Baraq] We do not discriminate them along the lines of 
organizational behavior, but along the lines of their personal 
behavior. Those who are taking part in active violence, even 
after the 13th of September, the agreements, we keep pursuing 
them. But, we are not dealing with those who let their arms 
down and are not participating in active violence, and were not 
participating in the past in murders. 
  [Ben-'Ami] With regard to the violence, a number of young 
children have been killed in recent days on the streets in the 
Gaza -- an 11-year-old, a 13-year-old -- in shooting incidents 
with the Army. 
  [Baraq] We are making whatever we can in order to reduce the 
fatalities among civilians, especially among children. 
Unfortunately, the sources of violence are in the behavior of 
the Palestinian population. We hope that they will be able to 
control the going out and activity on the street of the 
youngsters. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from Washington by Arye Golan] </F>
  [Text] The Washington peace talks will resume 
approximately one week from now, on 15 February. Meanwhile, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has postponed his 
departure for the Middle East in order to enable Israel and the 
PLO to conclude their complex negotiations before an effort is 
made to expedite the Israeli-Syrian talks. 
  On the table at which Muwaffaq al-'Allaf and Itamar 
Rabinovich will again sit down together will be an Israeli 
proposal that a phased withdrawal and the establishment of peace 
be carried out concurrently and over a lengthy period. 
  [Begin Rabinovich recording] We believe an agreement there 
is an element of a phased implementation and an element of 
reciprocity or interface [preceding word in English], as it was 
termed in a CNN interview -- namely, the link between the 
implementation of withdrawal and the measure of peace dispensed 
during that phase. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, it appears that not much will happen in the 13th 
round, and those who entertained the hope that the 
Israeli-Syrian talks will achieve a breakthrough in the spring 
now hope it will happen by the end of 1994 at the latest.

  [Text] A 12-year-old boy, 'Ayman al-Suri, was killed this 
afternoon in the Jabalyah refugee camp when IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers fired at stone throwers. Our correspondent 
Moti Amir reports that this morning, two firebombs were hurled 
at IDF troops in Jabalyah and in Gaza city. There were no 
casualties and no damage was caused. A general strike was 
observed for the third consecutive day in the Gaza Strip today, 
in mourning for the death of the leader of the Fatah Hawks cell 
in Rafah, who was killed in a shootout with IDF soldiers. 
  Khayr Yusuf 'Abdallah, from the village of Bal'a in Samaria, 
was killed this morning by IDF gunfire when he attempted to flee 
his village, which was under curfew, in a car. The curfew was 
imposed in an attempt to locate stolen cars. 
  A youth was injured by soldiers' gunfire near al-Duhayshah 
refugee camp after breaking through an Army roadblock in his car.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister of the Czech Republic, Vaclav 
Klaus, has denied that companies in his country are selling 
nuclear technology, along with other weapons, to Iran. Speaking 
to reporters during the second day of his official visit to 
Israel, he was today lecturing at the Hebrew University. More 
from reporter Dick Winter: 
  [Begin recording] [Winter] Dr. Vaclav Klaus, in his first 
visit to Israel, met this morning with his former economic 
adviser: the governor of the Bank of Israel, Ya'aqov Frenkel. 
Frenkel, in 1986 a senior official in the International 
Monetary Fund, helped Dr. Klaus to plan the new Czech Republic's 
emerging free market economy. 
  But reporters' first question to the visiting prime minister 
was about the charges that the Czech firm Skoda, one of the 
Czech Republic's largest companies, is selling nuclear 
technology, along with other weapons, to Iran. 
  [Klaus] Well, I must say those are just rumors and 
speculations usually created by the competition in the Western 
European countries, in the United States companies which want to 
catch the markets themselves and try in advance to send rumors 
to undermine the Czech position. Simply that's not true.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted 
that Syria is serious about the establishment of peace and that 
it has always honored its commitments and obligations. 
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres cast doubts 
about the possibility of achieving a true breakthrough on the 
Syrian-Israeli track because, as he put it, the Syrian ice has 
not yet thawed. In fact, Peres and other Israeli officials are 
making contradictory statements every day and deliberately 
casting doubt about Syria's peaceful intentions. 
  The Geneva summit, which has given strong momentum to the 
peace process and, according to Peres himself, breathed new life 
into the peace process, has proved Syria's credibility to the 
entire world. This is demonstrated by the fact that all U.S. 
officials, led by President Clinton and Secretary of State 
Christopher, have praised Syria's positive and constructive 
stand and its determined effort to build a just, comprehensive 
Middle East peace. This is also demonstrated by the fact the 
entire international community has praised President Hafiz 
al-Asad's genuine interest in peace and his call to establish 
the peace of the brave in the region. Such a peace requires 
Israel to rise to the level of the aspirations of the region and 
the world. 
  Syria agreed to hold the current talks in Washington in 
appreciation of the U.S. role and in the hope that Israel will 
change its previous policies, put an end to the policy of 
intransigence and maneuvering, and respond to the UN security 
Council resolutions regulating the peace process. Right from 
the first session, the head of the Israeli delegation to 
Washington said the talks were held in a businesslike 
atmosphere. However, the Israeli officials soon tarnished this 
positivity with their negative statements. Following an Israeli 
request, it was agreed to hold the Washington talks away from 
the media. This is understandable, since it is known that the 
Israeli rulers call for secret negotiations. However, Israeli 
officials are making statements daily that cast doubt on the 
Washington talks. 
  Insisting on playing the same tune, Israeli officials still 
demand a definition of the nature of peace, despite tha fact 
that the Geneva summit clearly specified the nature of peace and 
stressed Syria's readiness to implement all requirements of a 
just, comprehensive regional peace. 
  However, definitely running amid noise and clamor and 
deliberately raising doubts in all directions, Israeli officials 
want a separate deal that is closer to a spectacle than to a 
peace, such as the Oslo agreement. Brought about by secret 
talks, the Oslo agreement has faced, and its still facing, 
obstacles. 
  If there is any positivity in the current Washington talks, 
then it is definitely the result of the positive Syrian 
position, not the Israeli position, which has not yet rid itself 
of the policy of maneuvering and procrastination. Syria has 
expressly declared its readiness to establish a just, 
comprehensive peace in the region and to abide by all its 
requirements. But has Israel declared its readiness to enforce 
UN Security Council resolutions and to fully withdraw from the 
Golan Heights? Syria is still awaiting the answer. 
  If there is any ice, then it is definitely on the Israeli 
side, rather than on the Syrian side. If Rabin admits that 
Syria is serious about the establishment of peace, what prevents 
Israel, knowing that the ball is now at its court, from 
declaring commitment to full withdrawal, instead of casting 
doubt, raising its endless security fears, and threatening to 
hold a referendum on the Golan and peace with Syria? 
  At this point, we recall statements by Rabin and other 
Israeli officials that Israel will not declare readiness to 
withdraw from the Golan before Syria defines the nature of 
peace. The Geneva summit defined the nature of peace. The 
world is still awaiting a statement by Israel on its readiness 
for full withdrawal. 
  Peace in the region is a matter of occupied territories and 
usurped rights. Consequently, peace requires an end to 
occupation and the restoration of land and rights. Unless it is 
just and comprehensive, peace in the region stands no chance of 
lasting. Certainly, peace is not separate deals made behind the 
scenes, evading the hopes and aspirations of the region's 
countries. Peace cannot mean capitulation to Israel and an 
acknowledgement of the legitimacy of its occupation and 
settlements. 
  Syria will always adhere to a just, comprehensive peace. It 
will never budge from this stand. No one in the world will 
blame Syria for this brave stand. Nay, the world supports 
Syria's quest for a just, comprehensive peace, especially since 
the world has seen the failures of separate deals. Undoubtedly, 
the world is expecting Israel to adopt the long-awaited positive 
stand.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The bilateral talks at the level of 
heads of delegations held in Washington since 24 January ended 
without any progress in the Middle East peace process. After 
two weeks of continued talks, Israel asked that these talks be 
suspended until 25 February. This shows the Israeli position is 
still the same in terms of intransigence, procrastination, and 
prevarication. It still adheres to all the obstacles 
threatening the peace process and continues to adopt proposals 
and ideas that will not achieve real, durable, and comprehensive 
peace. 
  This is revealed by Israeli assertions that issues have not 
reached fruition on the Israeli side and that circumstances are 
not yet conducive to achieving peace. No doubt, these flimsy 
pretexts conceal an Israeli attempt to sabotage the peace 
process, striking at its roots via a well-known policy of 
extending the period of talks and considering talks an end in 
themselves. 
  These Israeli efforts cannot be separated from practices 
designed to obstruct the peace process and to lay traps in its 
path. This is revealed by the Israeli Government's decision to 
expand two settlements in the Golan and to allow settlers to 
carry out this expansion with government support and 
sponsorship. No other evidence is needed that Israel does not 
want peace. These practices and positions all show, either 
directly or through impressions and maneuvering, that Israel 
still refuses to respond to the requirements of a just and 
comprehensive peace. Israel is hostile to the resolutions of 
international legitimacy that demand its withdrawal from 
occupied Arab territories. Israel is being hostile to peace and 
is contradicting it. Even in its separate deal known as the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, Israel is still procrastinating, 
prevaricating, and avoiding implementation. 
  Furthermore, the secret Oslo deal is still blocked, facing 
Israeli obstacles. Events and developments prove the Israeli 
plans cannot lead to the desired peace--a peace that secures the 
region's security and stability. 
  Hence, we believe that the Israeli positions and practices 
threaten not just the peace process, but also place the region 
in a state of continued disturbance and tension and spread an 
atmosphere of pessimism and darkness. Israel alone is 
responsible for this disturbed and worrying situation. It is 
responsible for the possible consequences of such a situation in 
terms of complications and reactions. This is because Israel's 
waste of the available peace opportunities has not been a 
coincidence. Each time, this has happened after careful 
considerations and planning. This is reaffirmed by Israel's 
refusal, inside and outside the talks, to speak about a full 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and by its refusal 
to stop settlement activities which are a manifestation of the 
occupation. This is also reaffirmed by Israel's refusal to 
comply with the basics and formula of the Madrid conference and 
by its disavowal of the principle of restoring the land in 
return for peace. 
  The continued Israeli rejection of all this is a rejection 
of 
peace and its requirements and of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. This is because whoever is concerned 
about peace does not prevaricate, procrastinate, or deceive.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Israeli Defiance," TISHRIN 
says: When the Israelis do not wish to understand, they exhibit 
an amazing ability to defy all facts. Thus, they are dealing 
with the outside world as if it is blind, deaf, and mute. In an 
interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister said he did not 
directly or indirectly hear that Syria is prepared for full 
peace, adding that he knows, however, what Syria wants from 
Israel in return for peace. 
  TISHRIN continues: Although Syria never conceals its resolve 
to restore the occupied Golan, it has for years stressed 
adherence to the establishment of a just, comprehensive Middle 
East peace. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, 
Syria has renewed this assertion hundreds of times. The recent 
Geneva summit was one occasion when Syria clearly explained its 
concept of peace and its nature. It also voiced its readiness 
to honor all peace requirements. Moreover, through President 
al-Asad, Syria called for concluding the peace of the brave. It 
also urged the Israeli leaders to rise to the level of the cause 
of peace and to have the necessary courage to establish a just, 
comprehensive peace in the region and remove the Middle East 
from the cycle of war and conflicts. 
  TISHRIN continues: It sounds odd that while the entire world 
is convinced of Syria's credibility and honest quest for peace, 
praises its efforts and initiative, and values its stands, the 
Israeli rulers find no reason to be convinced. The paper notes 
Rabin's recent statement in which he said: We do not know what 
kind of peace will be agreed on, and to where we will pull out. 
The paper says: It must be reasserted that Syria is looking 
for a just, comprehensive peace; a durable, stable peace; a 
genuine peace that ends occupation and restores rights to their 
owners; a peace that is acceptable to the current Arab 
generations and worthy of being maintained by future 
generations. Such a peace must be honorable and must uproot 
injustice, oppression, and occupation. 
  TISHRIN explains that such a peace requires Israel's full 
withdrawal from the Golan. It says that Syria has frequently 
asserted that it will never bargain over an iota of the Golan 
soil nor will it relinquish an inch of it. Any compromise, 
which Israel wants, is absolutely out of question. The Golan 
Heights are Syrian and have been since time immemorial. They 
should be returned to the motherland and to their evacuated 
population, who are awaiting the establishment of peace to 
return to their homes. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East is no 
longer exclusively a Syrian or Arab issue. Rather, it is a 
world issue. The world will not allow that a unique peace 
opportunity be destroyed. Two years of Israeli intransigence 
have so far failed to destroy this opportunity.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Feb (INA)--Iraq and the UN Special 
Commission have asserted that their talks in Baghdad over the 
past four days have augmented the great progress made since last 
July in both the political and technical fields. 
  A statement issued by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and 
Special Commission Executive Chairman Rolf Ekeus said the two 
sides expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
setting up a continuous monitoring and verification system in a 
spirit of goodwill for the sake of realizing their common 
objective, which is the submission of a report to the Security 
Council by both the Commission and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] at the earliest reasonable time, indicating 
that Iraq has adopted all the required measures in accordance 
with Paragraph 22 of the Security Council Resolution 687. 
  The statement added: Within this context, the Commission 
notes that the phase of intensive inspection operations which 
have already started in all fields within its jurisdiction will 
continue. For its part, Iraq said it will welcome all these 
inspection teams and will facilitate their work. 
  Following is the text of the statement: 
  A joint Statement issued by Tariq 'Aziz, Iraq deputy prime 
minister, and Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, the executive chairman of 
the Special Commission, at the conclusion of high-level talks in 
Baghdad from 2-5 February: 
  1. The progress that was achieved in relations between Iraq 
and the Special Commission in July 1993 has been augmented 
during the latest round of high-level talks that was held in 
Baghdad from 2-5 February. At their initial stages, the talks 
were attended by an IAEA representative. 
  The current talks reviewed the steps that have been taken by 
the two sides to establish the frameworks for the continued 
monitoring and verification system after Iraq's acceptance on 26 
November 1993 of UN Security Council Resolution 715 of 1991. In 
this regard, the talks have augmented the great progress that 
has been achieved since last July in both the political and 
technical fields, specifically the high-level talks held in New 
York and Baghdad in September, October, and November 1993. 
  2. The two sides expressed their readiness to expedite the 
process of setting up the continuous monitoring and verification 
system in a spirit of goodwill for the sake of realizing their 
common objective, which is specifically the submission of a 
report to the Security Council by both the Commission and the 
IAEA at the earliest reasonable time, indicating that Iraq has, 
in their opinion, adopted all the required measures in 
accordance with Paragraph 22 of Security Council Resolution 687. 
  The Commission noted that, within this context, the phase of 
intensive inspection operations which have already started in 
all areas of its jurisdiction will continue. For its part, Iraq 
noted that it will welcome all these inspection teams and 
facilitate their work. 
  3. Technical talks regarding a number of issues were also 
held. These talks were held in a businesslike and professional 
manner and produced positive results. 
  4. An agreement was reached to hold another round of 
high-level talks in the first half of March 1994 so as to 
maintain the momentum which has been added to this process in 
this round of talks as well as in the previous rounds.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Feb (INA)--Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN 
Special Commission, has described as positive his talks in 
Baghdad, which he concluded yesterday. 
  In a joint news conference with Riyad al-Qaysi, under 
secretary of the Foreign Ministry, here today, Ekeus said that 
the results of these talks have augmented the progress that the 
two sides have made during the past months. 
  Ekeus stressed that these talks have bolstered the mutual 
trust between Iraq and the UN Special Commission, thus providing 
a better atmosphere for both sides to implement relevant UN 
resolutions and for lifting the embargo on Iraqi exports. 
  He said that the two sides have agreed that the Commission 
and the International Atomic Energy Agency will submit as soon 
as possible their report to the UN Security Council on Iraq's 
adoption of the required measures in accordance with Paragraph 
22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687. 
  He stressed that in their talks, both sides dealt with 
political as well as technical issues related to the UN 
resolutions. 
  For his part, Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi stressed that progress has 
been made toward the continuation of the two sides' early 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. 
  He added: From our point of view, Iraq has implemented all 
the measures pertaining to that paragraph. 
  Dr. al-Qaysi indicated that both sides have agreed to 
continue cooperation, aiming for a speedy implementation of 
Paragraph 22 of the aforementioned resolution.

  [Text] Baghdad, 5 Feb (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has urged Mr. 
Ekeus to announce a date for the beginning of the trial period 
for future monitoring as agreed upon during the Baghdad and New 
York talks in last July and November. 
  In an article today entitled "Ekeus Talks in Baghdad, the 
Unjust Blockade, and the Responsibility for Prolonging it," the 
paper says that any procrastination or deliberate delays will 
increase the suffering of millions of Iraqis and will stain 
Ekeus' reputation in Iraq. He himself has acknowledged that 
Iraq has cooperated with him in a positive manner to help him 
fulfill his mission despite all its complications and 
difficulties. 
  The paper recalls an announcement made by Hans Blix, 
chairman 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iraq has done 
what it was required to do and that what is left to be done is 
the part concerning the work of the Special Commission under 
Ekeus. He also noted that this commission was slow in 
accomplishing its mission. 
  The paper says that Mr. Ekeus should prove that he has not 
gone beyond the limits of his mission, which is technical in 
nature. He should not be influenced by the wishes of this or 
that party. His mission is technical, not political. It is 
wrong to link Part C or Paragraph 22 to other paragraphs, 
because this paragraph is independent and has a clear meaning. 
  The paper brands the attempts of the Clinton administration 
and those following suit to make strange interpretations of 
Paragraph 22 for clear political purposes as unacceptable. The 
paper also says that it is unacceptable for Ekeus to submit to 
these attempts. It notes that this is not in line with the 
technical nature of Ekeus' mission and runs counter to the 
principle of neutrality, honesty, and sincerity, to which he 
often stresses commitment. 
  The paper adds that honesty makes it incumbent upon Mr. 
Ekeus 
to announce now the starting date for the monitoring as agreed 
upon, provided that this period is not in excess of six months, 
after which he would announce that his mission has been fully 
completed. This means that the UN Security Council would be 
compelled to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which 
means lifting the economic blockade. 
  The paper adds: Mr. Ekeus should specify the starting date 
for the monitoring period during his current talks in Baghdad 
and he should do it as soon as possible. It would be fair to 
say that this period should have started last July when Iraq 
agreed to install two monitoring cameras in two different 
positions in Baghdad, and when Iraq declared its approval of 
Resolution 715 in November. 
  The paper says that Iraq approved the (?proposed) trial 
period in order to dismiss all the pretexts that are being 
floated by some influential UN Security Council members, 
specifically the United States. Iraq's approval, the paper 
says, was in order to make it possible to implement Paragraph 22 
of Resolution 687, which means lifting the economic blockade 
against Iraq. The evil powers want to prolong the blockade to 
achieve tendentious political objectives that have nothing to do 
with the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Concluding its article, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that the current 
round of talks with Ekeus has special importance because it will 
discuss an important issue pertaining to the suffering of an 
entire people. Its results will negatively or positively affect 
the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council, 
specifically the credibility of the permanent big powers and the 
extent of their commitment to the implementation of the 
resolutions which they have voted for, especially since Iraq has 
honored its obligations, especially with regard to Part C of 
Resolution 687.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Clinton's Lies and Moral </F>
Wrechedness"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton does not want to rest 
between lies. He is eager to defend the "achievements" of his 
feeble presidency by fabricating crises abroad and spreading 
lies, something which a person assuming a public responsibility 
scarcely does! It has become completely clear to all observers 
that Clinton, before completing his first year in office, is 
being criticized severely by many domestic sides due to a series 
of defeats and failures abroad. 
  On the domestic front, problems and scandals are raining on 
his head, including his love affairs before, during, and after 
the presidential elections and the exposure of financial 
irregularities that are being investigated in a climate of 
economic failure, and his failure to fulfill his tempting 
electoral promises. On the foreign policy front, defeats 
continue in Somalia, Haiti, and Russia, and plans to contain 
Japanese superiority and European independence have also failed. 
Moreover, Iraq has succeeded in rebuilding itself and 
safeguarding its national independence. 
  Therefore, Clinton has been perpetually exposed to severe 
campaigns of criticism by the U.S. media, and many sides hinted 
that he might be fired before ending his second year in office. 
This makes him face difficult and bitter options and forces him 
to choose the easiest and shortest way to prevent failure and 
criticism; namely, fabricating crises abroad and diverting U.S. 
public opinion and making it accept confusing and misleading 
policies. 
  The worst of his recent lies may be the ones he told in his 
periodic report to U.S. Congress two days ago because these lies 
express the U.S. President's state of misery and his disgusting 
moral retreat. 
  He told his first lie to Congress when he said Iraq intends 
to rebuild its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, 
especially the nuclear weapon! If Clinton had a balanced mind, 
logic, or memory, he would not have uttered such foolishness, 
simply because it is well known that the reports of the United 
Nations and its committees, particularly the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, which work at the instructions and 
supervision of the U.S. Administration, have all stated in their 
official reports that Iraq has no nuclear weapons and that these 
committees have destroyed Iraq's peaceful nuclear capabilities. 
  One of the ridiculous and reprehensible ironies is that 
Clinton told that lie three days before the arrival of Rolf 
Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, in Baghdad. Ekeus 
had admitted in all his reports that Iraq was free of weapons of 
mass destruction in order to discuss the implementation of 
Resolution 715 after Iraq implemented the other resolutions, 
most important of which is Resolution 687. 
  Clinton told his second lie when he said that Iraqi soldiers 
opened fire on a military convoy of the allied forces in 
northern Iraq last December. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued 
an official report at that time and refuted the lie. Raising 
this fabricated story that collapsed when confronted by reality 
is intended to incite the U.S. Congress against Iraq and justify 
the blockade. 
  He also told a third lie to Congress when he said that the 
Iraqis are suffering from the blockade because Iraq refuses to 
export oil. Despite its silliness, this statement requires 
comment. Iraq did not refuse and will not refuse to export oil. 
The opposite is true. Iraq asks for permission to export oil to 
meet its people's needs, but the United States insists that a UN 
committee receive and spend oil revenues inside Iraq, as if the 
committee were a substitute for the Iraqi Government or as if it 
were in a country having no central government. 
  While it is a big insult to the Iraqi people, this U.S. 
condition cancels Iraq's sovereignty and violates its national 
independence because allowing a foreign side to receive oil 
revenues and purchase and distribute basic goods apart from the 
Iraqi Government means accepting a disgusting trusteeship that 
conflicts with the Iraqi people's history and dignity. The 
Iraqi people rebelled against that trusteeship and offered 
thousands of martyrs to terminate it and prevent it from 
returning. 
  Clinton knows that he is lying and that what he relates are 
sheer stories, fabricated and prepared to justify the 
continuation of the blockade. The issue may seem to be rather 
bearable, but if we take into account the fact that Clinton, a 
representative of the American people and their legislative 
organ, addresses Congress on such issues, we will understand the 
size of defect in the U.S. President. 
  He lies to the highest legislative authority to mislead it 
and get it to support an unjust and inhuman policy in conflict 
with the values and principles of the U.S. Constitution; namely, 
the continuation of the blockade on a whole nation. This 
behavior also conflicts with the presidential oath in which he 
promised to carry out his duties honestly and sincerely. It 
also conflicts with the qualifications required in a president; 
namely truthfulness. Congressional leaders and members were 
toppled when their lies were proved. The Watergate scandal 
toppled President Richard Nixon when he lied and denied that he 
had known about spying on the rival party's headquarters. 
  Clinton has not only committed the crime of insisting on 
killing thousands of Iraqis through the blockade, but has also 
gone beyond that to mislead the American people and Congress! 
If Congress is truthful and honest to the American Constitution 
and to its duties, it has to raise the issue of the President 
lying and misleading the American public and Congress and 
committing the crime of annihilating mankind! 
  Finally, Clinton's lies are just more evidence of his 
political and moral failure and bankruptcy, his weakness, and 
his unstable policy and behavior. This is his Achilles' heel. 
Leading the world, which is Clinton's ambition, will never be 
achieved by charlatans, liars, and the weak. This is history's 
most important lesson.

  [Editorial Report] Baghdad BABIL in Arabic on 2 February 
publishes on page 12 the following report under the banner 
headline "The Greatest Honor: Serving the Homeland and the 
Leader:" 
  "The coalition aircraft have dropped fliers over Bani-Sakin 
area, near al-Nashwah, al-Basrah Governorate. 
  "The Iraqis listen to beamed foreign radios, which have a 
greater influence than the fliers. During their underground 
struggle, the Ba'thists used the flier technique and they cannot 
be deceived by such games. 
  "The aircraft that dropped these fliers are the same 
aircraft 
that dropped hundreds of tonnes of bombs on our great people. 
They failed to achieve the enemies' goal to infringe on the 
sovereignty, security, and renaissance of Iraq under its mujahid 
leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve 
him. Accursed be they and shame on those who sold their 
homeland to jump into the hands of the foreigner." 
  Copies of six of these fliers are published with the report. 
Each flier is headlined "Wanted By International Justice," and 
includes a picture of the official concerned with a summary of 
"crimes" he has committed printed under the picture. The fliers 
read: 
  "Taha Yasin Ramadan, accused of crimes against humanity, 
including mass murder committed by the Republican Guard in the 
south under his command." 
  " 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, accused of crimes against humanity, 
including the killing of tens of thousands of citizens in Iraqi 
Kurdistan in al-Anfal Operations." 
  "Watban Ibrahim, accused of crimes against humanity. He 
ordered the execution of 42 merchants in Baghdad in July 1992." 
  "Muhammad Hamzah al-Zubaydi, accused of crimes against 
humanity, including brutal suppression of the popular uprising 
in al-Samawah, al-Nasiriyah, al-Basrah, al-Kut, al-'Amarah, and 
the marshlands in the south in March 1991." 
  " 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, accused of crimes against humanity, 
including mass murder, rape, and instigating genocide." 
  " 'Aziz Salih al-Numan, accused of crimes against humanity, 
including ordering the destruction and desecration of holy 
places when he was governor of Karbala' and al-Najaf."

  [Excerpts] Baghdad -- A symposium on facts and 
misinformation in Arab and foreign publications on the Mother of 
Battles will begin in Baghdad today. [passage omitted] 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH has interviewed Gilles Monet, secretary 
general 
of the French-Iraqi Friendship Society, on the sidelines of the 
symposium. Gilles Monet said: I have had the honor to be 
received by President Saddam Husayn several times. Saddam 
Husayn is a man who devotes his life to Iraq, and to place this 
country on equal footing with advanced countries. That's why 
the 17 July Revolution took place, and under his leadership oil 
was nationalized. Monet said that the Iraqis are lucky to have 
as their leader a man like Saddam Husayn. He said that the 
United States interferes in the domestic affairs of many 
countries. It even interfered in France's domestic affairs, as 
was the case with respect to the GATT agreement. He added that 
it was the United States which forced France to participate in 
attacking Iraq. He explained that France's relations with Iraq 
have started to improve since Edouard Balladur became prime 
minister 
  Monet said that French companies suffered much from the 
blockade imposed on Iraq because they lost many of the 
opportunities that that they previously had, not to mention that 
France now has a high unemployment rate, and if the blockade is 
lifted, this will greatly contribute to settling this problem. 
  Monet said he greatly admires the reconstruction process 
under way in Iraq. He said: The war has had negative results 
for the Iraqis but, at the same time, has made the Iraqis carry 
out great work. The Iraqis have proved that they have creative 
minds and can depend on themselves to attain great achievements.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (INA)--A three-day symposium on facts 
vs. misinformation in Arab and foreign publications on Umm 
al-Ma'arik [Mother of Battles] battle (reference to the U.S.-led 
war against Iraq) on Friday was concluded. 
  Organised by Umm al-Ma'arik research centre at al-Rashid 
Hotel, the symposium was attended by a large number of Arab and 
foreign writers and media men. More than 30 research papers in 
Arabic and foreign languages were discussed during the symposium. 
  The discussions were mainly focused on three main topics 
namely political and economic hegemony, and facts distortion and 
lies discrimination by Western media to manipulate the world 
public opinion. 
  Addressing the opening session, head of Umm al-Ma'arik 
research centre Dr. Muhammad Mudhaffar al-Adhami said the 
symposium aims at exchanging views to reach scientific analyses 
and conclusions away from effects of the world super powers. 
  Chaired by Arab thinker Muta' al-Safadi, the first session 
discussed political hegemony. 
  In his speech, Mr. al-Safadi said the symposium helps bring 
together Arab and foreign writers who wrote about Umm al-Ma'arik 
battle and who had not the chance to meet before, adding that 
the symposium will help expose facts and reveal the real 
intentions of the U.S.-led aggression against Iraq. 
  During the said session a large number of research papers 
were discussed, among them were papers on various books written 
on the Gulf war. They include Jeff Archer's "The Sledge Hammer 
and the Ant;" Muhammad Ahfood's "The Gulf War, a Test for 
International Legitimacy;" 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jawhari's "The Arab 
Gulf and the Allies War on Iraq;" Noam Chomsky's "On U.S. Gulf 
Policy;" Pierre Salinger and Arabic Loran's "The Secret Dossier 
of the Gulf War;" Dr. 'Awad Butrus' "Gulf War, Who Is 
Responsible;" and Colin Edwards' "Turning Ploughshares Into 
Swords in U.N." 
  Research papers on Ramsey Clark's book "The Fire this Time" 
and Michel Jobert's "Journal Du Golf" were also discussed. 
  The second session, held on Thursday, was dedicated to 
economic hegemony. Speaking at the session, Dr. 'Abd-al-Illah 
Beliqzeez (Tunisia) said goals behind the U.S.-led aggression on 
Iraq are clear and well known, saying that the United States 
aimed at controlling wealth sources. 
  He added that the U.S. tried to hit Iraq as it represents a 
power in the region that threatens its interests. 
  Dr. Beliqzeez went on to say that the U.S. and its allies 
are currently heading towards dismembering the Arab region. 
  A number of papers on economic hegemony were presented 
during 
the session. They included among others papers on "The 
Palestinian Intifadah and Gulf Convulsion" by Ahmad Sidqi 
al-Dajani, "America and the Secrets of the Gulf War From Carter 
to Bush" by Dr. Nabil al-Samman, and "America Invades the Gulf" 
studies of the American Congress translated by Wajih Radi. 
  The third session was devoted mainly to the misinformation 
and fact distortion and lies disseminated by Western media. 
  During the session chapters from Michel Collon's book 
"Attention Medias" were reviewed and discussed. The book 
reveals and exposes America's immoral practices and big lies 
disseminated by Bush administration to promote its war policy. 
The book also made it clear that prior to the military 
aggression against Iraq, Bush administration launched a smear 
media campaign to distort Iraq's image. 
  The researcher from Belgium shed light on the mechanism and 
status of the Western media saying that four factors determine 
the functioning of the Western media organs, chief among which 
is the financial control of the multi-national firms on Western 
media and the subordination of the media organs to the said 
firms and the authority, noting that media organs were obliged 
to beautify the image of the government to maintain good 
relations with the said firms and the government which supported 
them financially. 
  The participants on Wednesday visited al-'Amiriyah shelter 
which was bombed by specially designed bombs to rip through 
shelters. On Thursday, the participants visited a museum that 
documents the scale of damage inflicted upon Iraq's 
infrastructure by U.S.-led war and outcome of the postwar 
nationwide reconstruction drive. In the evening, the 
participants listened to lecture delivered by Dr. Muhammad 
Mudhaffar al-Adhami on the origin of Kuwait.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 5 Feb (INA)--An international symposium 
on war crimes and the blockade's violation of human rights in 
Iraq, organized by human rights organizations in Iraq, opened 
here this morning. 
  Dr. Riyad 'Aziz Hadi, chairman of the Iraqi Human Rights 
Society, delivered an opening speech in which he reviewed the 
negative effects of the blockade, which was imposed on the Iraqi 
people in flagrant violation of human rights. All nations, 
regardless of their different cultures, believe in human rights 
and man's dignity and rights in life. 
  He said that the economic blockade has caused the death of 
thousands of children, women, and elderly because of the lack of 
medicine and food and because of hospitals' serious lack of 
equipment and other requirements and their failure to extend 
services and medical care. [passage omitted] 
  Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who chaired the 
first session, delivered a speech in which he recalled the 
reasons for the martyrdom of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis 
during the past four years, and said that these deaths were 
caused by the criminal acts committed by the United States and 
its allies with the Security Council's support. 
  He pointed out that the Security Council has become a tool 
for war and is treating nations in an inhuman way through the 
veto right, which only five states enjoy. 
  He said that in a modern age and in various wars, the 
prevailing principle should be care for society as the source 
for all laws and not to threaten the society with law. He noted 
that experts of human rights and of war and peace are now 
raising their voices to say that sanctions against the Iraqi 
people constitute a crime against the whole of humanity. 
  Ramsey Clark also urged serious action by the humanitarian 
organizations and world figures to prevent the use of economic 
sanctions as a tool to strike at people since they constitute a 
crime against humanity and against the individual's right to 
live in prosperity and peace. 
  He said the economic sanctions are an ugly crime that cause 
the death of more people than those killed in military 
aggression, and especially deaths among the weak, the sick, the 
elderly, and women. He noted that the economic sanctions 
constitute a weapon of mass destruction since it paralyzes an 
entire country by starving it and spreading killer diseases. 
  He added: We in the World Criminal Court have found that 
economic sanctions constitute a continuous crime against 
humanity since it is a crime that seeks to murder children. He 
stressed that humanitarian and world organizations must act 
seriously to put an end to the sanctions that kill children, 
women, and old men daily. 
  Ramsey Clark noted that economic sanctions now threaten many 
countries because they have turned into a tool at the hands of 
the superpowers to intimidate other states. He explained that 
the United States had confessed that it refused to export 
foodstuffs to Iraq despite previous agreements. He said such a 
method is criminal and it is unacceptable to use food as a tool 
to strike at peoples. 
  He explained that the main purpose for this symposium was to 
find the means [words indistinct] the United States and its 
allies to immediately end the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq. 
  Concluding, Ramsey Clark said: I am seeking support for the 
Iraqi people whom I love and I wish them prosperity and hope to 
end the current suffering caused them by the sanctions that 
constitute a crime against humanity.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 6 Feb (INA)--An international symposium 
on war crimes and the blockade's violation of human rights in 
Iraq continues its work in Iraq for the second day running. 
  Several Arab, foreign, and Iraqi figures, representing 
humanitarian groups and organizations throughout the world, 
spoke during today's session, which was chaired by Amin Shuqayr 
from Jordan. [passage omitted] 
  Hugh Stevens from the United Kingdom said that the Muslim 
communities in Britain suffered from a wave of racism as a 
result of the policy of the British Government, which decided to 
declare war against Iraq and deliberately created a racist and 
tense atmosphere to prepare British public opinion for war. It 
also exerted efforts to cooperate with the United States to 
hamper any peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis. 
  He added that creating war deliberately is a crime against 
peace, in accordance with the Nuremberg principles. Therefore, 
in light of our experience, we can assert that the British 
rulers committed crimes against peace, as well as war crimes 
unprecedented in the history of war. 
  He said: I accuse former British Prime Minister Thatcher of 
committing war crimes, as well as crimes against peace. He also 
accused British Prime Minister Major and Foreign Secretary Hurd 
of war crimes and of committing the crime of deliberately 
creating poverty in one of the most important areas of the world 
by imposing an unjust and illegal economic blockade, whose 
consequences have become clear in Iraq's cities and hospitals. 
He pointed out that, through its alliance with the United 
States, Britain committed the ugliest crime of modern times. He 
described the alliance as most hostile to Iraq. He called for 
breaking that hostility through joint struggle by the free 
people of the world, who yearn for freedom and to live in peace. 
  He added: We should continue, through public opinion, to 
accuse the imperialists of crimes against peace, as well as war 
crimes, in order to strengthen opposition against the blockade 
imposed on Iraq. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria 
ended their meetings in Istanbul, Turkey, yesterday. The 
meetings were held within the framework of the periodic 
discussions held by these countries to study the situation in 
Iraq's Kurdistan. 
  The final statement issued stressed the following points: 
  1. Iraq's territorial integrity. 
  2. Opposition to any foreign interference in Iraq's affairs. 
  3. The need to lift the economic siege imposed by the regime 
on Iraq's Kurdistan and the south. 
  4. Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions. 
  If we put aside what was discussed behind the scenes during 
the meetings, we see that the three ministers' emphasis on the 
issue of lifting the economic siege of Iraq's Kurdistan and the 
south is a positive step toward understanding the sufferings of 
the Iraqi people in general and of our Kurdish people in Iraq's 
Kurdistan in particular. 
  Our Kurdish people have stressed through the parliament and 
regional government the need to compel the Iraqi regime to 
comply with the international resolutions imposed on it by the 
United States. The brother officials in Turkey, Iran, and Syria 
should realize that Saddam Husayn and not the Kurdish people is 
the reason why Iraq and the countries of the region remain 
within the whirlpool of conflicts that have exhausted the 
region's peoples and governments. Therefore, efforts must be 
made to save the Iraqi people--Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, and 
Assyrians--from the evils of the Baghdad dictatorial regime. 
  The time has come to put an end to the doubts about our 
Kurdish people's democratic experiment. The neighboring 
countries have to understand that recognition of the Kurdish 
people's national legitimate rights within a democratic and 
pluralistic Iraq is the guarantee for protecting the country's 
territorial integrity and for sparing it any foreign 
interference in internal affairs. 
  Action in any other direction will not be in line with the 
principles laid down by the new world order for dealing with the 
problems of the persecuted peoples looking for liberation. Our 
Kurdish people in Iraq do not intend the democratic experiment 
to result in anything but legitimate rights.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 7 (AFP)--Thousands of Iranian rebels 
using helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns 
on Monday ended four days of war games in an Iraqi region near 
the border with Iran, a rebel spokesman said. 
  Women rebels for the first time piloted helicopters that 
carried troops to mock battlefields during the first manoevers 
of the year, said Farid Soleymani, spokesman for Iran's main 
armed opposition group, the People's Mojahedin 
  The Mojahedin has several military bases in Iraq, near the 
border with Iran. 
  The announcement of the exercise, codenamed "Iran's hope," 
the first to he held since October 1993, came one day after 
Iraqi opposition fighters paraded in Iran, near the border with 
Iraq. 
  The Mojahedin on Sunday meanwhile called on Iranians to join 
protests that took place last week and revolt against the 
government of President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  Clashes occurred in the southern Iranian city of Zahedan 
last 
Tuesday. The Mojahedin claimed that protests had also taken 
place in other southern cities. 
  Baghdad and Tehran, who harbour each other's opposition 
groups, often accuse each other of interfering in their internal 
affairs.

  [Text] A reliable source in Baghdad has informed us that 
the Iraqi opposition forces' attacks on the regime's 
establishments and offices have continued unabated in the past 
few weeks. 
  On the night of 26 January, a heroic unit from the 
opposition 
forces staged a lightning attack on a police vehicle in the 
middle of Baghdad near the Baghdad Governorate building in Bab 
al-Mu'azzam. All four occupants of the vehicle were killed. 
  On the night of 27-28 January, the party's branch and the 
police headquarters in al-Huriyyah town came under attacks with 
machine guns. A number of the regime's henchmen were killed or 
wounded. 
  On the night of 28-29 January, the party's branch in 
al-Mashtal area was attacked by an armed unit from the 
opposition forces. One official was killed and two others were 
wounded. 
  The same source added that the regime spread rumors that it 
will annex Kuwait once again to Iraq and asked all departments 
and establishments, including airports, to stock up on fuel, 
especially oil and gasoline. 
  The source confirmed that the regime executed six of the 
Republican Palace officers last week. Their identities remain 
unknown.

  [Text] The Islamic resistance forces recently carried out a 
heroic operation that terrified the regime's forces, security 
organs, and ruling party officials in al-'Amarah. Our sources 
in the south reported that a resistance group launched a 
lightening attack against al-'Amarah governor's headquarters in 
al-Mashtal using medium-caliber machine guns and RPG-7's, 
causing damage to the building. 
  The sources said that a large number of the regime's 
henchmen 
and officials of his organs of repression were present in the 
building at the time of the attack. Ambulances and 
fire-fighting teams were seen hurrying to the destroyed 
headquarters and spent many hours pulling out the dead bodies of 
the regime's henchmen. 
  Our sources later learned that the al-'Amarah governor was 
away in Baghdad at the time of the assault. 
  The regime placed its forces on alert, adopted emergency 
measures in al-'Amarah, and conducted an extensive search 
operation that included arrests of citizens. 
  Another group of the Islamic resistance forces attacked a 
military command vehicle belonging to the tyrant Saddam's forces 
in Mid-January while it was traveling in al-Kahla' district in 
al-'Amarah Maysan Governorate. Our sources said that the 
vehicle was completely destroyed and the occupants killed 
included a major, a lieutenant, and the driver. Following the 
attack, the tyrant Saddam's forces conducted extensive patrols 
and set up checkpoints manned by security personnel to search, 
arrest, and interrogate citizens. 
  Kurdish opposition sources reported that an explosion has 
occurred in the Border Guard headquarters which is adjacent to 
the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. They said the 
evacuation of those killed or wounded by the blast lasted for 
two hours. 
  The same sources said that another military building used by 
the Special Forces in Baghdad Governorate was the target of a 
machine-gun attack in mid-January, killing army captain Sabri 
Yasin al-Rawi and three other mercenaries. 
  According to our sources, the headquarters of al-Hindiyah's 
district officer, a man known for his criminal behavior, was the 
target of a lightning attack by five mujahidin. 
  Our mujahidin in Karbala' Governorate earlier attacked the 
car of Kazim Marhun, a tribal chief in the area, forced him to 
get out of the car, and then shot him. They then left behind 
leaflets warning all those who terrorize our people to stop such 
actions or they would meet the same fate. 
  Our heroic mujahidin inflicted just retribution on the 
criminal Sattar 'Adday Taha in al-Jurn in al-Kaba'ish District 
because he had perpetrated treasonous acts against our people in 
that area. He had received several warnings to stop 
implementing the tyrant Saddam's orders and to learn from the 
death of his brother Samir 'Adday, who used to spy on our people 
and who later received his just retribution at the hands of our 
mujahidin.

sovereignty, and national unity. 
  In a letter of protest to the Arab League secretary general 
yesterday, the Iraqi permanent representative to the Arab League 
said that from 27-31 January U.S., British, and French aircraft 
carried out 192 hostile air sorties after flying from their

Arab member states.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 7 (AFP)--Iranian authorities have 
arrested more than 20 people for attempting to kill President 
'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani last week, Information Minister 
Ali Fallahian said. 
  Fallahian, quoted on Monday [7 February] by HAMSHAHRI 
newspaper, said the suspects either knew about the plot or 
played a direct role in the failed bid last Tuesday. 
  A gunman fired several shots as the president addressed a 
gathering in the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni to mark 
the 15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, but nobody was 
hurt. 
  The 26-year-old gunman, Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, was arrested 
immediately after the incident. His picture was published for 
the first time Monday on HAMSHAHRI's front page. 
  Fallahian said all of the people arrested in connection with 
the shooting had confessed to having "ominous and 
counter-revolutionary aims." 
  Several of the suspects are former members of leftist groups 
who served jail terms because of their "immoral and corrupt 
records," he said. 
  The minister added that the suspects had held a meeting the 
night before the incident to coordinate the attack and to ensure 
its success.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 6, IRNA -- The leader of the Islamic 
revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, on Sunday [6 February] 
warned against plots of satanic powers to physically eliminate 
those Iranian ulema who are efficient and helpful for the 
country, Islam and Muslims. 
  The supreme leader cited the February 2 aborted attempt on 
the life of President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani during a speech 
at the shrine of the founder of the Islamic Republic, the late 
Imam Khomeyni as the latest example of such plots. 
  "They attempted to strip Muslim ummah of one of the 
prominent, efficient and devotee personalities of the Islamic 
Republic, our beloved president...but thanks God this time they 
were frustrated as in many of their previous plots and 
treasons," the leader said. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i made the remarks in his speech to a 
large 
group of ulema, Friday prayer leaders and professors and 
students of theological schools. 
  The supreme leader termed the Islamic revolution as a great 
storm which thwarted treacherous conspiracies and ambitious 
plans of the U.S. and its lackeys in Iran, helped spread Islam 
and attracted other nations to spirituality. "This paid the way 
for the collapse of the eastern empire and of Marxist rule in 
the world," he said. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i also lauded the founder of the Islamic 
Republic, the late Imam Khomeyni, for laying the foundation of 
an Islamic system of government in a world estranged from 
spiritual values. 
  "But the reality is that there are many people who have 
neither realized nor felt the greatness of these two phenomena 
-- imam and the revolution. We should try to make this great 
truth tangible in the life of Muslims both in Iran and 
throughout the world," he said. 
  Elsewhere in his speech, the leader pointed out that piety, 
faith and knowledge is the key to all problems. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i cautioned that hypocritical and 
blasphemous powers of the world, now fearful of the vigilance of 
Muslims, have closed their ranks to get rid of the increasing 
influence of Islam. 
  "What is now happening in the four corners of the world such 
as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Palestine, Lebanon, Algeria and Kashmir 
betrays the deep enmity of the oppressors with Islam and the 
Islamic Republic," the leader concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Unusual Calm in Iran's Response to </F>
Jordan's Expulsion of Diplomats"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--Iran yesterday 
responded in an unusually calm manner to Jordan's decision to 
expel 21 Iranian diplomats. A spokesman for the Foreign 
Ministry in Tehran said that "Jordan's decision has come to our 
attention and we are going to implement it." 
  Diplomatic sources have said that the decision to expel the 
diplomats was taken at "the highest level." And that King 
Husayn during his visit to Washington received "comprehensive 
documents" about what were termed subversive activities carried 
out by 26 Iranian diplomats in Amman. The sources pointed out 
that other "intelligence information" from the United States and 
Israel reveals the Iranian Embassy's implication in "activities 
harmful to Jordanian interests." 
  Iranian sources say that Jordan's decision is part of a 
broader "U.S. effort" to isolate Iran. And that Washington 
asked two other Arab states, namely Oman and Qatar, to 
reconsider their policies toward Iran. But the diplomatic 
sources said that Iran is accused of involvement in the 
following actions: 
--Distributing huge quantities of propagandist informational 
items in Jordan. These items are sometimes transported by 
trucks. 
  --Financing "suspect candidates" in the November elections. 
  --Trying to cause a split and instigate opposition to 
Jordan's position on the peace process in the Middle East. 
  --Financing radical groups to oppose the peace process. 
  --Encouraging certain terrorist operations like the attack 
on cinemas in Amman and al-Zarqa'. 
  --Iran's possible involvement--via Hizballah--in the 
assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut.

  [Text] United Nations Hq. (New York), Feb. 4, IRNA -- 
Iran's permanent envoy to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, in 
a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Thursday 
[3 February] protested the illegal activities of the U.S. Navy 
in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. 
  Kharrazi complained that between June 25 to September 16, 
1993, the U.S. naval forces disrupted the routine patrolling of 
an Iranian air fighter and six helicopters over Iranian waters 
and threatened them to change their course. 
  In his letter Kharrazi emphasised that the Iranian interest 
section in Washington last month asked the Embassy of Pakistan 
to inform American secretary of state over the incident and to 
ask for an explanation. 
  The letter describing details of the incident was 
distributed 
as a United Nations Security Council document at the UN 
headquarters here on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the 
residents of the besieged city of Sarajevo, spent last night in 
a state of fear and apprehension of more heavy artillery attacks 
by the Serbs. This apprehension was heightened by the failure 
of talks involving the UN representatives to establish a 
cease-fire between the Serbs and Muslims. 
  The UN representatives' attempts failed because of Serb 
opposition to the removal of their heavy weapons and artillery 
from the area around the Bosnian capital. Despite the scale of 
the catastrophe of Saturday's [5 February] massacre, its 
unprecedented nature, and the innumerable sacrifices it claimed, 
stunning and horrifying people enormously, the UN 
representatives remain skeptical. They announced that it is 
difficult to examine the incident. 
  Along with this stance, European countries are seen to be 
quite ambivalent, reluctant to condemn the Serbs for this savage 
and antihuman act and brutal threats. They continue to give 
conflicting assessments of possible strikes on Serb 
positions--even though the Serbs have violated the UN Security 
Council resolutions. That, ultimately, indicates a lack of 
consensus on the need to take serious steps. 
  The United States has said it cannot assume sole 
responsibility for any action against the Serbs. This, while 
the European and American communities--with their own doubts and 
impotence--fail to consent to other countries, including those 
of the Islamic world, intervening to prevent massacres in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from continuing. 
  Many political experts say that even if the Western 
countries 
acted against the Serbs, this action would not be considered 
within the framework of a fundamental solution to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. It would merely be a way of 
mitigating the pressure of public opinion. This, because the 
Europeans continue to step up their pressure on the Muslims to 
accept a compromise and the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
anytime a possible plan for any measures against the Serbs is 
mentioned. 
  The West's unjustified conduct, the contradiction in its 
words and deeds, and the vacillation in the stances of the EC 
and the United States indicate the unlimited decadence of 
ethical values prevailing over the West's policies. With such 
low ethical and moral values, Europe and the United States are 
nothing more than terminally ill patients with little time left 
until their demise.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
strongly condemns the attack by the Serbs on the market in 
Sarajevo. In a statement it describes the attack as a sign of 
the continuing inhumane and terrorist crime of the Serbs against 
the people of Sarajevo. The statement refers to the non-use of 
force by the United Nations in attempting to establish peace and 
security in Bosnia-Herzegovina as giving the Serbs a free hand 
in the genocide of Muslims. 
  The Iranian Foreign Ministry statement reaffirms the need 
for 
the United Nations to rapidly intervene in order to stop the 
merciless massacre of the people in Bosnia, and calls for an end 
to the arms embargo imposed on the defenseless people of Bosnia. 
The Foreign Ministry statement describes the negligence by the 
Security Council and the UN secretary general as a violation of 
the principles and objectives of the United Nations, and an 
insult to world public opinion. 
  Our country's Foreign Ministry statement continues: The 
Islamic Republic of Iran once again announces its readiness to 
send peacekeeping forces, under the supervision of the United 
Nations, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a step that would help to end 
the genocide in Bosnia. The Islamic Republic of Iran regards 
the failure of the Security Council to make an urgent decision 
on Bosnia as dangerous for the honor and standing of the United 
Nations, the spirituality of the human race [as heard], and 
peaceful coexistence in international relations. 
  Our country's foreign minister spoke to our correspondent 
today. He called for the swift action of international circles 
in order to put an end to the massacre of civilians in Bosnia.

  [Text] We begin our news today with the latest incoming 
reports on the Serbs' unprecedented attack on the people in 
Sarajevo. Reports indicate that the casualty toll of the 
besieged and war-stricken people of Sarajevo from this attack 
has increased to more than 250. Our colleague in Europe has 
sent us more information on this attack: 
  [Begin recordeding] [Unidentified correspondent in Bonn] 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic has said that 66 were 
killed and 197 wounded in this attack, which is the worst attack 
on civilians since the onset of the war in Sarajevo. After the 
attack, in which a 120-mm mortar was used, Sarajevo's central 
market was the scene of bodies and of severed limbs. Many of 
the wounded died in the halls of Sarajevo hospitals due to the 
lack of medical facilities and medicine. 
  This attack has sparked off an extensive wave of disgust and 
rage among the Sarajevo residents at the indifference that is 
being shown by the United Nations and the West regarding the 
Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. While condemning the 
policy of the United Nations and the West, the officials of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have called for military steps to end the 
attacks on civilians or the lifting of the arms embargo on the 
Muslims. 
  Public mourning has been declared in Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
commemorate the martyrs of Black Saturday. Bosnian Prime 
Minister Haris Siladzic said to correspondents: Why is the 
United Nations supporting the aggressors and imposing sanctions 
on the victims? Are the 200,000 people whom we have lost so far 
not enough for the international community to take serious 
steps? Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic also stated that any 
government that supports the arms embargo on the Muslims is a 
partner in these crimes. 
  Meanwhile, in continuation of their past policies, Western 
and UN officials have limited themselves to a verbal 
condemnation of the attack and have called for investigations to 
identify those who are responsible for the attack. After the 
Saturday tragedy, the governments of France and Britain have 
once again stressed the need to continue the talks. British 
Defense Secretary Rifkind said: I do not think that an air raid 
on Serb positions will solve the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. 
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has stated: If the 
international community does not react seriously to this attack, 
we will lose all our credibility. [end recording]

  [Begin Shamkhani recording] As you know, as an extension of 
our own joint domestic exercises -- by the naval forces of the 
IRGC and the navy -- we felt it necessary to carry out joint 
exercises with some of our neighboring countries. Toward this 
aim, we will have our first joint exercises with another country 
since the victory of the revolution in the form of joint naval 
exercises with Pakistan. These exercises will take place in the 
high seas and with the participation of the warships of Iran and 
Pakistan. Four warships will take part from Iran, and the 
exercises will last four days. The planning, training, and 
preparatory stages of these exercises have been completed, and 
the exercises themselves will take place in the near future, God 
willing. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Letter from "the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in </F>
Amman"] 
  [Text] To the honorable chief editor of the SAWT AL-SHA'B 
newspaper: 
  The peace and blessings of God be upon you. Your esteemed 
newspaper on 31 January published an article on page 18 by Dr. 
Muhammad al-Mahasinah under the headline "Was Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah 
a Victim of Polarization or Peace?" In view of the errors 
contained in the article and given the freedom of the press and 
opinion, we would like to have the following explanation 
published with our thanks and appreciation. 
  Dealing with the difficult and critical situation in the 
Islamic world requires all of us to pool our efforts and remain 
vigilant to foil the plots by the enemies of the Islamic nation. 
This requires wariness and alertness in order to avoid being 
dragged behind the venomous and propagandistic media of world 
arrogance and Zionism that is aimed against the entire Islamic 
world. In this regard, writers should rise to their 
responsibility and be truthful and sincere, and to play their 
role in enlightening people and exposing these desperate 
attempts. 
  However, and with deep regret, certain people are 
contributing to strengthening the trend that serves our common 
enemy. Yet, we are certain that, although they make mistakes in 
analysis and interpretations, these pens do not have aims or 
ambitions other than to present their own views and to reveal 
facts. 
  The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Amman 
respects 
and appreciates such honest writers but will not remain silent 
toward those who do not appreciate the situation and who are 
unaware that they are serving sides that want to harm 
inter-Islamic relations, especially between the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Therefore, we find 
it necessary to reply to what Dr. al-Mahasinah wrote in his 
article. 
  1. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounces and 
condemns the terrorist and cowardly act which led to the death 
of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. The embassy can only extend 
its sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and the 
sisterly Jordanian family as whole and to beseech God almighty 
to have mercy on his soul and to grant his family solace and 
patience. 
  2. It is a source of consternation that this article, which 
lacks objectivity and logic, should be written by a Jordanian 
figure of the status of Dr. al-Mahasinah, who is the professor 
of Law at the university. In his article, al-Mahasinah tried in 
vain to link this cowardly act with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's stand on the so-called peace or with the issue of the 
reduction of the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan. 
  How did he link these two issues, which have nothing to do 
with this criminal act, unless it was something out of his own 
creation and imagination? It is regrettable that in this 
regard, the voice of a Jordanian brother joined the voices of 
Westerners and Israelis who continue their feverish efforts to 
shake and confuse relations between Islamic countries in 
general, and countries in the region in particular. 
  Moreover, Dr. al-Mahasinah should not have announced his 
stand off the cuff. He should have waited until things became 
clear and facts became solid before leveling accusations at 
others. In order to put him in the picture along with others 
who do not know, we say that the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
stand toward the Zionist enemy is a principled and constant 
stand that will not change one iota under any circumstance. 
This stand was not developed yesterday or by chance. Indeed, 
it is older than the victorious Islamic revolution in Iran. 
History recorded the Islamic and principled stands adopted by 
Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his secret, throughout his life 
against the occupying enemy whether in the Shah's dungeons, in 
exile, or in power. Therefore, our stand toward what is now 
called the peace process emanates from this principled and 
deep-rooted stand. 
  As regards the issue of reducing the number of Iranian 
diplomats in Jordan, we would like to emphasize that the warm 
relations between the two fraternal countries, which are 
permeated by the spirit of brotherhood and love, are proceeding 
forward under the wise leaderships of the two countries. 
  For our part, we are concerned about maintaining these 
relations and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. From 
this particular premise, we say that the reduction of the number 
of diplomats is purely an organizational issue as stated by 
responsible quarters in Jordan. Here, we also reaffirm our 
concern about maintaining the higher interest of the two 
countries and about proceeding forward with these active 
relations no matter what the sacrifices are. We have no doubt 
at all that the Jordanian leadership shares the same feeling and 
that the recent statements by the wise leadership in Jordan are 
evidence of this. Hence, while we reiterate our deep regret 
about what was written outside the realm of logic, we ask the 
honorable and esteemed SAWT AL-SHA'B newspaper to be accurate 
and cautious more than ever before. 
  [Signed] The Embassy of The Islamic Republic of Iran in 
Amman

  [Text] Kuwait, 6 Feb -- The State of Kuwait tonight 
strongly denounced and condemned the savage massacre perpetrated 
by the Serb forces against innocent civilians in Sarajevo 
yesterday, which left a large number of the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina dead or wounded. 
  Kuwait reaffirmed its support and backing of the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its readiness to receive more of the sick 
and wounded to offer them medical care. This was stated at a 
meeting of the council of ministers held tonight under the 
chairmanship of Shaykh Sa'd al-Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah, the 
heir apparent and council of ministers chairman. 
  In a press statement after the meeting, Minister of State 
for 
Cabinet Affairs 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil said that the Kuwaiti 
Council of Ministers had called on the UN Security Council's 
member countries, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all 
the international organizations and bodies to intervene 
immediately to stop the genocidal operations to which the people 
of Bosnia- Herzegovina were being subjected and to take the 
necessary measures to end that regrettable and tragic situation. 
  The council of ministers expressed its confidence and 
satisfaction at the U.S. stance, expressed in a report submitted 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Congress, regarding 
the strict conditions that the Iraqi regime must implement 
[tanfidhiha] for any easing of the sanctions. Topping the list 
of these conditions was the release of POW's and hostages, 
recognizing the demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and 
respecting Kuwait's independence and sovereignty. 
  The council stressed that the U.S. stance was identical to 
that of the international community in its insistence on making 
the Iraqi regime yield to UN resolutions, forcing it to respect 
international law, and aborting all its attempts to have the 
siege lifted until all the Security Council's resolutions 
accepted after the cease-fire in the Kuwait liberation war were 
implemented. 
  Minister al-Dakhil said that the council of ministers 
approved a draft law on adding a new paragraph to Article 7 of 
Emiri Decree 15 of 1959 regarding the Kuwaiti nationality law. 
The article stipulates that children born to a naturalized 
Kuwaiti after he obtained Kuwaiti nationality are to be 
considered native Kuwaitis. The provision of the paragraph added 
to the aforesaid article applies to those born before the 
introduction of this law. 
  He added that the council decided to approve the draft law 
and referred it to the National Assembly. 
  Furthermore, the council examined a number of other topics 
on 
its agenda and made appropriate decisions regarding them.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has expressed 
happiness over yesterday's successful strike and said that it 
has provided a new inspiration and strength to the valiant 
struggle of the Kashmiri people. In a message last night, she 
said that observance of the strike from the coastal regions of 
Karachi and Gwadar to the blood-soaked Anantnag in occupied 
Kashmir was aimed as a reminder of the Kashmiris' basic right 
and to assert that the Kashmiris are not alone in their just 
struggle. She expressed confidence that the strike will force 
world public opinion to realize once again that it will not be 
in the interests of the world community to ignore the issue of 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Referring to the struggle of the Kashmiri people, the prime 
minister said that the strike was a part of the government's 
policy to get the Kashmir issue resolved in accordance with UN 
resolutions. She said that this was the strategy under which she 
traveled to Geneva to address the UN Human Rights Commission 
where she raised the Kashmir issue. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said 
that the strike and her address to the UN Human Rights 
Commission have helped highlight the Kashmir issue at the global 
level. She said that the peaceful proposals presented by 
Pakistan in accordance with international law are responded to 
with threats of war. We cannot be browbeaten by these threats, 
she added. 
  The prime minister said that some Indian leaders have 
started 
criticizing her personal life. She does not care for this 
criticism because she prefers the Kashmiris' right to 
self-determination over anything else, she added. Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that all such activities point 
to India's bewilderment. She said that we still favor a 
peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue and believe that peace 
cannot be achieved without providing justice. The prime minister 
said that Pakistan still wishes India to hold talks to resolve 
the Kashmir issue. She urged India to take steps to peacefully 
resolve the Kashmir problem in accordance with international law. 
  Prime Minister Bhutto said Pakistan will continue to extend 
diplomatic, moral, and political support to the Kashmiri 
brethren until India holds talks with Pakistan. She said that 
by showing solidarity with the Kashmiris, Pakistan has proven 
that Pakistanis and Kashmiris have the same soul. She said that 
world public opinion has started taking note of Indian brutal 
atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Indian propaganda that the 
freedom struggle in Kashmir depends on Pakistan has been 
exposed, she added.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (INA) -- Vice-President Mr. Taha 
Yasin Ramadan said that Iraq does not view the lifting of the 
embargo through the resumption of oil export in accordance with 
the UN formula which is considered another form of embargo on 
Iraq. 
  In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper published today, 
Mr. Ramadan said we want to lift the embargo and resume oil 
export in the manner that could not infringe our independence 
and national sovereignty. 
  Mr. Ramadan added "We want to have Iraq sell and buy without 
interference of any other forces pointing out that the current 
formula for resuming the export of oil is rejected, since it 
constitutes a flagrant interference into Iraq's sovereignty. 
[no end quote marks as received] 
  Mr. Ramadan said that all oppressive formulas they (enemies) 
have placed under various covers and which were considered a 
mask to carry on the imposition of the embargo and preventing 
Iraq from exporting its oil had ended. There should be a serious 
consideration to lifting the embargo from Iraq and allowing it 
to export it abroad, he said. 
  Mr. Ramadan said that he was optimistic that the embargo 
would end through patience of Iraqis and determination to 
restore life to its normal. 
  Mr. Ramadan said the embargo would be eliminated through the 
building of self-capabilities of the society and will be lifted 
once and for all when the criminal enemies be convinced of the 
impossibility to achieve the objectives that had urged them to 
impose this embargo on Iraq. 
  Mr. Ramadan added that Umm al-Ma'arik [the Mother of 
Battles] 
represents the beginning of a new stage and a new growth not 
only on the level of slogans and principles but on the level of 
starting the correct mobilization pointing out that impact of 
Umm al-Ma'arik would also be realised in eras to come.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President Akbar </F>
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran on 4 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. We will have two short sermons today, with an eye on 
the time and current needs. The first sermon will include 
mostly issues relating to the revolution and its anniversary and 
some current issues. [passage omitted] 
  In my view one of the most effective factors in this 
important event should be sought in the people's awareness and 
vigilance. We have clearly felt, and feel, with all our being, 
that the strongest factor which made us victorious in the 
revolution and has foiled -- and still foils -- plots and acts 
of mischief and also safeguarded us and made us triumphant in 
the war, and gives us the opportunity to plan and carry out 
important infrastructural work, is that same awareness of the 
people and their vigilance and presence on the scene. 
  The reason why the people have become like that and why that 
awareness came about and why this phenomenon occurred in Iran, 
and why other places are not yet ripe for this divine 
phenomenon, cannot be overlooked easily. They raise fresh 
questions which lead to other questions when answered. [passage 
omitted] 
  The most fundamental thing that has happened during the last 
20 years of struggle and the Islamic struggles of the previous 
decades is that the awareness of the people has increased. 
[passage omitted] 
  Competent leadership is the next thing. Very well, people 
are aware and vigilant and ready for self-sacrifice. If the 
masses are vigilant but have no leader to lead them they will 
face problems. We have seen such problems in many areas. But 
such appropriate grounds, people's awareness, make the 
leadership a great deal easier. We have many interesting 
examples of that. We did not have any political parties or 
party training before the revolution, we had no party network to 
bring people together and discipline them. We had masses of the 
self-initiating people. If you look at the moves made during 
the last year of the revolution you see that all of them were 
guided and well calculated. 
  If the people wanted to go on strike, they had leadership. 
If the headquarters in charge of the strikes issued an order 
that this sector should go on strike and the other sector should 
not, the people accepted that, even though it was difficult for 
them not to go on strike. When we said that the oil workers 
should go on strike, because at that time oil revenue was the 
main source of income for the Pahlavi regime and the world and 
the supporters of the regime would also have been greatly 
damaged by the loss of four or five million barrels of Iranian 
oil, the workers went on strike. Later, we discovered that there 
were difficulties in our domestic consumption, the people were 
faced with difficulties in their domestic use, then a delegation 
which went to the oil producing regions on behalf of the imam -- 
and I was a member of that delegation -- we witnessed an amazing 
degree of obedience among all these diverse but aware and 
vigilant groups. [passage omitted] 
  The other issue that I wish to refer to now -- and it is an 
issue of great importance in the science of sociology and the 
movement of masses and history --is the trust which existed 
between the masses of the people and the leaders of the masses. 
This trust is very effective. If such a degree of trust 
existed in Afghanistan today, there would not be these wars 
there. If there was a person who was accepted by the people and 
who instructed the people not to fight and told them what to do, 
the people would have accepted it. 
  If such a degree of trust is created in any society between 
the leaders and the masses of the people and if this trust can 
be consolidated and can continue, this will provide the basis 
for movement, it will provide the means for eliminating 
difficulties and fighting against disruptions. 
  At the beginning of the Islamic revolutionary movement the 
enemies of Islam became aware of this secret. We see that from 
the first days of the revolution, the first weeks of the 
revolution, there were many efforts to create a rift between the 
leadership and the people, between the officials and the people. 
All the propaganda means of news imperialism and their domestic 
agents were used to weaken the trust of the people in their 
leaders and officials and to eliminate the love and affection 
which existed between the leadership and officials and the 
people. 
  This was one of the things they never succeeded in 
achieving. 
They carried out repeated attacks on that fortress, they exerted 
a great deal of pressure on that rampart, they subjected that 
popular trench to repeated bombardments, but they never produced 
any results. The bombs boomeranged back to themselves and 
targeted themselves. 
  Of course they have also used other means, they created 
internal unrest -- which they described as street clashes -- 
they staged a coup d'etat, they imposed the war with Iraq 
against us, they staged economic sanctions against us and did 
whatever they could; but what is still continuing is their 
molestation and satanic moves which started since the outset of 
the revolution. These things were ad hoc. Street unrest, 
revolts and insecurity did not last long and we saw that it was 
the people who repelled such plots. [passage omitted] 
  You see that they have pursued a continuous chain of action, 
which is still going on, to create a rift between the officials 
and the people. They have a number of ad hoc means to which 
they resort such as war, revolt, and other such things. 
  We feel that the revolution is victorious in all arenas and 
it enjoys better support than it did 15 years ago and it is 
developing further. If it used to be easy for the enemy to 
create a shock, now it is no longer so. A better way of saying 
that is that the revolution has reached certain maturity. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today I see the foundations of the revolution to be so 
strong, its roots so deep in the heart of this community, the 
branches of the holy tree of the revolution so tall throughout 
the space of our country and other environments, and I see the 
people so much more aware, sincere and more in the arena, in 
line and in one with the revolution, that I think that those 
dangers that our enemies traditionally plot have passed by the 
revolution and our 15-year-old revolution has traversed a 
100-year course. 
  Those sentiments, those sympathies, that strange scene that 
we saw at the immaculate tomb of his eminence the imam 
[Khomeyni] on 1 February, and the sentiments that came from the 
people after that -- and still does -- are all proof to our 
claim. 
  Now the march on 22 Bahman this year [11 February] will show 
those who had plotted to pale the hue of the revolution this 
year that their arrows have hit granite, those tricks have 
become old hat for our nation, the people have been vaccinated 
against those germs and will no longer be influenced. It is 
truly a wonderful event in the world. [passage omitted] 
  This incident to which your attention has now been drawn -- 
the assassination attempt -- to my mind this is a very minor 
issue which can always happen. A few people can always give 
rise to a small incident. However, these things are no longer 
of any importance to the revolution. You should feel quite 
reassured about that. The revolution has now become quite 
separated from individuals. I said that the revolution has 
reached the stage of maturity; it is no longer a child which 
needs suckling. It provides its own sustenance. A lofty figure 
like the imam of the ummah departed from among these people. At 
that time we shuddered to think about what would happen when the 
imam would no longer be among us. Then we witnessed this calm 
movement of an ocean of people, and this Islamic revolution 
continues forever on its path. Through divine guidance, this 
ship correctly continues its voyage toward its destination in 
this tumultuous ocean. 
  How effective can individuals be any longer in this 
revolution that others should put themselves in trouble, should 
put themselves in danger so that a certain individial may or may 
not be there; and that a person like me who is one of the most 
minor soldiers of this revolution! 
  I say that world arrogance, America and others should really 
know that in Iran they should give up the hope that by the 
physical or psychological elimination of individuals they can 
overcome the revolution. 
  May God protect you, your revolution and the leader of the 
revolution. We are very weak soldiers. There are many people 
like me who can be in the service of the people. Nothing 
important will take place through this route of assassination 
attempts. 
  Those who planned this act of mischief had something else 
in mind, something more than me. As I said, I am only an 
individual. Their aim was to weaken the revolution, to weaken 
the presence of the people upon the stage. If one day they can 
achieve that goal, they believe that they have achieved 
something major. Therefore, this is what they had in mind. They 
thought that in the presence of foreign reporters and the guests 
of the Ten Days of Dawn, in the first official meeting of the 
celebrations, a minor action which would have given rise to a 
great deal of publicity would have achieved those goals. This 
would have disrupted the very first meeting and would have 
created insecurity, and this would be the first defeat of the 
regime during the Ten Days of Dawn. This would have taken the 
luster away from the subsequent meetings, people would have felt 
insecure and would not have attended them. This would have been 
a sign to the world that the revolution had lost its luster. Of 
course, if they had achieved greater success and had been able 
to get rid of someone this would have provided them with greater 
success. 
  However, this is the sign of their stupidity. They should 
have looked a little to the past and to the events around them. 
Did not a bomb explode right here in the Friday prayers a few 
years ago, and did it not scatter parts of some people's bodies 
around the trees? Was the meeting disrupted? Did the Friday 
imam that day take one step back? Were the subsequent Friday 
prayers deserted? This should have been an example. 
  This was just the sound of a few shots, of a bomb. Have we 
forgotten that during the Friday prayers, in marches Iraqi 
bombers flew overhead and the roaring of the aircraft drowned 
the sound of the loudspeakers; but these people with their 
clenched fists and with the shouts of God is Great remained 
steadfast. How foolish it is to imagine that with such actions 
they can weaken the morale of the people. It is a futile hope 
that the morale of the people could be weakened. 
  The new strategy of world arrogance which I also referred to 
in a previous sermon, and the new official policy of colonialism 
regarding us is to weaken the morale of the people. Everything 
can be summed up in this one sentence. Such actions, and the 
efforts to minimize the achievements of the revolution or to 
exaggerate the difficulties of the revolution are their constant 
policies. Those policies may occasionally be intensified or 
occasionally be abated, but our people are vigilant. Our people 
understand. Our people see the countries around them. They see 
their neighboring countries. They see other revolutions. They 
see their own lives and they compare them. 
  First of all, the people see that what they staged the 
revolution for is getting stronger. Those who sacrifice their 
children are not after a more luxurious living. One sells all 
that one possesses and spends it on one's sick child. Here, 
they offer their young men, one or two or three, to be martyred 
in the fronts. It is clear that these people are after somethig 
different. You cannot deal with these people through material 
means. 
  Second, do not the people notice material issues? Even if 
for a hundred times they say that there are difficulties in 
Iran, there is such and such, when the people see that during 
the Ten Days of Dawn a factory, for instance a petrochemical 
plant, started production and it was officially announced that 
1,000, I mean, that 700 factories have severed their links with 
foreign countries and are now providing their raw material from 
inside and by the hands of their own workers; when people see 
these tangible things, when they see that during the Ten Days of 
Dawn thousands of projects in villages and cities and everywhere 
have starting production, let someone moan or say something. 
Even in these issues the people will not be deceived and will 
not be misled. The people are not so illiterate and uninformed. 
If the people were uninformed they would have been misled and 
would have left the stage as the result of the propaganda during 
the satanic shah's period. 
  In any case, thanks be to God, they have missed their 
target. 
Regarding myself, I said that it was not important. The 
sentiments which I witness toward myself are really too much for 
me, I feel ashamed for so much kindness, for so many messages, 
for so many expressions of support. I ask all the dear ones, my 
brothers, and the nation to regard all this expression of 
kindness as sufficient. If there is a hearing ear, this much is 
sufficient to make them understand the situation inside our 
society. They should not waste their time on these messages and 
such like. I express my sincere thanks. It is not that I do 
not attach importance to these, but I believe that the issue is 
not worthy for you to spend your time and efforts on it. I am 
grateful. Let all the messages and expressions of support be 
for these 10 Days of Dawn and for the programs and ceremonies of 
the 10 Days of Dawn. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--Following the session of talks 
he held with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the bilateral session between 
Peres and 'Arafat tonight, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said that 
the two parties tried to find a solution to specific points 
regarding the Declaration of Principles. Musa refused to enter 
into the details of these points. He said that the talks, which 
went on for 90 minutes, were good, and he stressed the desire of 
the two parties to work seriously to reach an agreement. 
  Musa said the meeting that began today between the 
Palestinian and Israeli delegations will successfully reach 
solutions to the remaining problems. 
  He added that Egypt is not pressuring any of the parties. 
Its only hope is that the two parties will succeed in 
overcoming the obstacles. He said he cannot set a time limit 
for reaching agreement because there are many problems. 
  Musa noted that the two parties are discussing major issues, 
and when they solve them it will be possible to find solutions 
to the other issues. 
  In a statement after the session of talks, Palestinian 
President 'Arafat expressed his appreciation for the Egyptian 
role, and said that Foreign Minister Musa will continue his 
efforts to push the peace process forward to a comprehensive and 
just peace. 
  He said that he sensed a real desire on the part of Shim'on 
Peres to reach a final agreement. He added: We were about to 
reach such an agreement in Davos. We agreed to resume the talks 
in Cairo under the auspices and with the support of President 
Husni Mubarak. 
  He expressed the hope that the talks will end tomorrow, 
Tuesday, noting that both parties desire to reach agreement on 
the measures to implement the agreement as soon as possible. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Peres said he hoped the talks will 
end tomorrow, adding that the two delegations had come with good 
intentions of reaching an agreement and not to bargain. They 
sense their responsibility. They also made some progress in 
Davos, Peres said and explained that what was agreed upon in 
Davos is acceptable and they intend to continue with it. 
  Peres said that in Davos 'Arafat proposed setting up two 
small committees [words indistinct] consisting of three members 
from each side to begin working to overcome the remaining 
obstacles. He added: We are here for important and positive 
work. He said that he speaks on behalf of the Israeli 
Government and that he represents the Israeli Government's 
policy. 
  He added: We will listen carefully to everything the PLO 
chairman has to say, and he will listen carefully to what we 
have to say in order to try to narrow the differences and 
resolve the outstanding problems.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat have held a late night meeting in Cairo. The 
teams have been instructed to negotiate as long as it takes to 
resolve differences. 
  Foreign Minister Peres says even if agreement is reached on 
the security issues, much work still remains, but he says that 
he and the PLO chairman have decided to stay on in the Egyptian 
capital until all the obstacles are overcome. David Ze'ev 
examines the reports from Cairo: 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told reporters in Cairo he 
has 
a mandate to reach agreements with the Palestinians. The 
Palestinians say they have been told that Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has given his foreign minister the green light for what 
the PLO ambassador to Cairo said would be a breakthrough toward 
drafting an agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area. 
  Foreign Minister Peres repeated the Israeli position that 
much work remains, but he also said that his discussion with PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat late last night in Cairo was held in a 
positive atmosphere and that he was sure both sides will make a 
far-reaching effort to achieve agreements on whatever issues 
possible, and Peres said he has the authority to sign 
agreements. The reference is to the Palestinian anger that he 
would not sign after agreements were reached in Davos over a 
week ago and the PLO accusing Prime Minister Rabin of vetoing 
his foreign minister's achievements. 
  In the meantime, Peres and 'Arafat will remain in Cairo as 
their negotiating teams try to work out the differences. The 
teams have been instructed to hold marathon sessions toward 
reaching that objective. Despite the war of nerves that 
preceded the resumption of the negotiations, both Foreign 
Minister Peres and Chairman 'Arafat smiled and were upbeat after 
their meeting last night. 
  Here in Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the key in 
resolving the differences has been the open line with the 
Palestinians: the ability to pick up the phone, in the Israeli 
official's words, an option that exists both with the 
Palestinians and Jordan but not with Syria, preventing contacts 
with Damascus during breaks in the Washington negotiations to 
raise such issues as the Syrian role in the violence in Lebanon 
that claimed the lives of four Israeli soldiers yesterday. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 8 February 
carries a report on a telephone interview with Foreign Minister 
Peres in Cairo on 8 February. The report notes that "referring 
to the serious incident in the security zone in south Lebanon 
yesterday, Minister Peres said that one of the issues in the 
peace negotiations with Syria should be that of Damascus' 
curbing Hizballah." 
  [A report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben on page A1 of Tel Aviv 
HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 8 February adds: "In a session held at 
the prime minister's bureau prior to the departure of the 
Israeli delegation for Cairo, Rabin decided to accept Peres' 
position not to alter clauses in the understandings reached with 
the PLO in Davos. The prime minister rejected the demand by 
security elements to introduce certain amendments into the Davos 
document in order to underscore Israel's responsibility for 
security on the roads in Gaza and along the 'safe passages' of 
the Palestinians in the Jericho area."]

  [Text] Chairman of the National Dialogue Committee Dr. 
Youcef El Khatib has evinced clear optimism concerning the 
future of national dialogue in the era of the new authority. In 
a statement to the daily EL MOUDJAHID, Dr. El Khatib expects 
that the parties which boycotted the national conference will 
take part in the running of the transitional stage through 
participation in the Transitional National Council. He said: 
Such an expectation is possible and this is what made us leave 
the doors of the council open. 
  In another statement published by the daily EL WATAN, Dr. El 
Khatib affirmed that the national dialogue will continue under 
the leadership of the new authority in the country, and at the 
same time he confirmed reports that the national dialogue 
committee has held contacts with personalities representing the 
dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. Mourad Medaoui gives 
us the details: 
  [Medaoui] The chairman of the National Dialogue Committee 
today announced that the task of the committee has ended and 
that the question of organizing dialogue is now a matter for the 
new authority. In a statement to the daily EL WATAN Dr. Youcef 
El Khatib said that the committee has indeed held contacts with 
personalities representing the dissolved FIS, and he pointed out 
that these personalities had secured the blessing of the FIS 
leaders in Blida prison. He stressed that these personalities 
were from inside the country and that there was no contact at 
all with leaders now abroad. 
  Dr. El Khatib considered these contacts as positive for two 
reasons: First, the fact that this tendency has accepted the 
principle of dialogue, and second the fact that this tendency 
has expressed its readiness to contribute to taking the country 
out of the crisis by helping to bring an end to bloodshed. Dr. 
El Khatib expects national dialogue to be easy now because of 
the existence of a platform that defines everything including 
relations between the various parties to the dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report from Algiers by Hisham Fahim] </F>
  [Text] Abdelhamid Mehri, the leader of Algeria's National 
Liberation Front [FLN], which has ruled the country for 30 
years, has stated that his party will deal with the new regime 
in Algeria as an authority that lacks constitutional legitimacy. 
He added that his party will help this authority to emerge from 
this status and gain popular and constitutional legitimacy, 
provided there is goodwill and a true desire to restore normalcy 
in the country. 
  In remarks to AL-AHRAM, Mehri pointed out that the society's 
real problems cannot be solved through institutions that lack 
legitimacy and credibility. Asked if his party will accept any 
responsibilities or positions in the Transitional National 
Council (parliament) or in the new Algerian Government, Mehri 
said the FLN will accept no responsibility in running the 
country's affairs during the transitional period, adding that 
the period's political objectives are shrouded in ambiguity. 
  On the national dialogue conference, which the party has 
boycotted, and his assessment of it, Mehri said: It was 
supposed to conclude the dialogue that started over 18 months 
ago but the dialogue deviated from the natural course we 
expected it to take. He noted that for the FLN, the goal of the 
dialogue is to agree on comprehensive and political common 
grounds envisaging solutions for the various security, 
constitutional, institutional, economic, and social problems and 
to form a national coalition based on these common grounds. He 
added: But the dialogue turned into an attempt to recommend the 
successor to the Higher State Council and extend the 
transitional period for another three years with the same policy 
and views applied in the past two years. 
  He noted that this was why his party boycotted the 
conference, because its results could neither change the 
political, security, and economic realities in the country nor 
draft any clear-cut policy to confront these problems. He added 
that this does not mean that the party rejects dialogue, because 
dialogue is a necessary means to solve problems, but that what 
counts is the dialogue's nature. 
  Asked about possible developments, Mehri said that the 
situation in Algeria is very difficult, noting that emergence 
from the current crisis will require all the political and 
social forces to agree on how to end the violence. He added: 
It also requires taking the appropriate measures to restore 
full constitutional life based on the 1989 Constitution and to 
call on the people to contribute to running their own affairs 
through elected municipal, legislative, and presidential 
councils.

  [Text] Khartoum, 8 Feb (SUNA/PANA) -- Sudan has condemned 
Sunday's mortar attack on an outdoor market in Sarajevo in which 
68 died and another 200 were injured. The Foreign Ministry 
denounced what it said Monday was the "negative stance of the UN 
Security Council vis-a-vis these inhuman killings." It called 
for an end to what it termed was a "human rights violation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina". The government called for the lifting of 
the arms embargo imposed on Muslims in the besieged city. The 
United Nations have been unable to determine who fired the 
single mortar round Sunday.

  [Excerpts] Khartoum, 7 Feb (SUNA) -- The interior minister, 
Brigadier 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, has denied that a 
foreign country was behind the incident at al-Thawrah mosque 
last Friday [4 February] in which 16 people were killed and 20 
others wounded. He pointed out that investigations were 
continuing to find out more about this mystery, particularly as 
one of the criminals was still being treated and could not be 
questioned because of the current state of his health. 
  In a statement he delivered today at the Transitional 
National Assembly, the minister reviewed the incident at 
al-Thawrah mosque and the criminal acts carried out by an armed 
group of foreigners. He said that their moves began with an 
attack on a police station at Umm Baddah north where they 
claimed that they wanted to make a report but then seized 
weapons [passage omitted] 
  In response to questions and requests for clarifications, 
the 
minister said that notwithstanding the basic principles of 
general policy there must be measures for control and regulation 
of the procedures relating to arrivals in the country. He 
expressed the hope that further investigations would provide 
more information about this mysterious incident. He ruled out 
that the criminals were targeting Usamah Bin Ladin, proprietor 
of the Hijrah company working on the al-Tahaddi road.

<F P=106> ['Uthman Mirghani report: "Khartoum Rules Out Foreign </F>
Financing; Opposition Accuses Front and `Afghans'"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Khartoum, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Sudanese 
Interior Minister Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad 
Husayn yesterday ruled out the existence of any foreign 
financing for the armed group that carried out the mosque 
massacre. Meanwhile Sudanese opposition sources have said that 
the gunmen, two of whom were killed and a third wounded, are 
"Arab Afghans" [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan mojahedin 
against Soviet forces]. [passage omitted] 
  Mubarak al-Mahdi, official in charge of external action in 
the opposition Ummah Party and former interior minister, has 
said that the mosque incident was carried out by a Sudanese 
group whose members' features indicate that they are either from 
western or southern Sudan, according to the testimonies of some 
eyewitnesses. They were wearing Sudanese costumes. Their faces 
were veiled. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Mubarak 
al-Mahdi said yesterday that the al-Riyadh district incident 
differs from the Shaykh Abu-Zayd Mosque incident. It can be 
said that the former (the al-Riyadh incident) is linked to a 
process of settling accounts and disputes within the "Arab 
Afghans" groups present in Sudan, which are armed. 
  He said that linking the al-Riyadh incident group and the 
al-Thawrah incident group "is an attempt to conceal the 
operation carried out by security services to terrorize citizens 
and oppositionists, especially as mosques have become platforms 
for the opposition." 
  He added that "the government is responsible for the two 
incidents, because it allowed these elements to enter Sudan. 
And its attempt to lay the responsibility on foreigners is 
unacceptable. It opened the door to foreigners, the Arab 
Afghans, and others, granting residence, citizenship, and the 
right to carry firearms." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Feb (MENA)--The opposition Sudanese 
National Unionist Party strongly condemned Friday's massacre at 
the Ansar al-Sunnah Mosque and said that it was one of the 
ugliest crimes perpetrated against Muslims in Sudan. 
  In a statement it issued today, the party, which is closely 
monitoring the painful events in Sudan, stressed to the whole 
world that the Islamic Front's government is ultimately 
responsible for what happened in the mosque and that the 
government's claims that foreign elements were responsible for 
the incident do not absolve it from this responsibility. 
  The statement added: Even if this accusation is true, who 
opened the country for extremists, fanatics, and terrorists from 
every corner to come and spread corruption, anxiety, and threats 
in the country and the region? 
  The statement appealed to the international community and 
world conscience to exert pressure on the Khartoum regime to 
stop its evil actions against innocent citizens and called for 
an immediate and urgent investigation. It also demanded 
punishment for the responsible criminals and killers who can 
only be the extremist groups that have been massed in the 
country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Riak Machar, "leader of the Unified Sudanese </F>
People's Liberation Movement," by Nizar Daww-al-Na'im in London; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Daww-al-Na'im] Whom did you meet in Britain 
and what is the nature of your visit? 
  [Machar] I have come to London on a private visit for the 
eulogy of my wife Emma (a British citizen killed in a road 
accident in Nairobi). All my meetings were on the basis that 
this is a private visit. I have met with some lords and members 
of parliament. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] What foreign role do you seek for the 
settlement of the Sudanese problem? 
  [Machar] I believe that Britain can spearhead efforts in 
support of the current Kenyan-led initiative and if that 
initiative does not succeed then Britain and the European Union 
states could play a part and perhaps take the entire issue to 
the United Nations. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] What do you expect of the initiative of the 
IGADD (Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development) 
states led by Kenya? This is an initiative by heads of state 
who deal with the Sudanese Government as a government like 
theirs and deal with you as rebels. What are the chances of 
success for such an initiative? 
  [Machar] I expect a lot from these states because they are 
our neighbors and they sense and are affected by our problem 
whether through the exodus of refugees or instability on the 
borders. Some of these states, like Eritrea and Ethiopia, are 
on good terms with Khartoum. True, they treat us as a rebellion 
and treat Khartoum as a government but there is no other way. 
So long as Khartoum and the two wings of the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement [SPLM] have accepted the initiative, the 
chances of making progress seem to be good. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Will the two wings of the movement go to the 
negotiations as one delegation? 
  [Machar] We expect the two wings to go as one united 
delegation because we have a joint program for negotiation based 
on the movement's target which is self-determination for the 
people of southern Sudan and peripheral areas. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] The northern parties have warned the IGADD 
states that an agreement between just the government and the 
SPLM would not represent all the Sudanese people and would 
perhaps not be binding, and they renewed the call for a national 
constitutional conference embodying all Sudanese parties. What 
is your answer to that? 
  [Machar] My disagreement with the northern opposition is 
over the fact that they see a need for the downfall of the 
government first and then discussion of the problem. They do 
not take into consideration the suffering of the people of the 
south who have shouldered the burden and massive cost of the war 
including the famine, disease, and death. If we have to wait 
until the opposition assumes power, when would that be? They 
last time it took 16 years to topple (former President Ja'far) 
Numayri. [passage omitted] 
  The second observation is that the opposition grouping did 
rule Sudan at one point but the war continued. As regards their 
call for a constitutional conference, that is an old call. They 
did not implement it when they were in power, so why ask others 
to uphold it or wait for it? I do not trust them because when 
they are in the opposition they are friendly but when they are 
in power they resume the war and the policies which I fight. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be clear that we do not wish to dominate power in 
the north. All we want is an independent state in the south 
because unity between the north and the south has failed and 
that is why secession is the solution. If we have to achieve 
that peacefully then let us do it through a referendum on 
self-determination. That does not necessarily mean that the two 
states would be enemies. We can look at the example set by 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Have you been invited to join the opposition 
Democratic National Grouping [DNG], and were Garang's relations 
with the DNG raised at your meeting? 
  [Machar] I did not discuss that matter with Garang but I 
believe that he is getting closer to my position without my 
discussing the matter with him. We are open to dealing with the 
DNG and I talked to their representatives in the past. We told 
them that they should not fear the idea of self-determination so 
long as it was going to be done peacefully. We tried to attend 
one of their meetings but they did not let us. I do not know 
what they are doing with Garang now because he now speaks the 
same language as we do, particularly since his call for 
self-determination. If, after this, he retains his membership 
of the DNG, why should we too not join? [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Two and a half years since the split, what 
have you achieved? 
  [Machar] We fulfilled the first objective which is to call 
for self-determination. It is now the main issue for the 
southerners. There is still some way to go to achieve democracy 
in the SPLM and guarantee human rights. Garang still has some 
prisoners. These were the three points over which we broke 
away. Yes, we agree on the aims of the movement but we may not 
agree on the way it is run or on the issue of safeguarding human 
rights. So we still have some way to go before the movement is 
reunited.

  [Excerpts] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir, the first deputy 
prime minister and foreign affairs minister, today met Rolf 
Ekeus, the chairman of the UN commission charged with the 
destruction of the Iraqi regime's weapons of mass destruction, 
who arrived in the country today. [passage omitted] 
  Sulayman Majid al-Shahin, the under secretary at the Foreign 
Ministry, who had welcomed Ekeus on his arrival, said that the 
prominent UN official's visit to Kuwait was important because it 
exemplified the UN Security Council's surveillance over the 
Baghdad regime's mass destruction weapons. 
  He added that Ekeus will brief Kuwaiti officials on the 
achievements of the UN commission with regard to destroying 
Iraqi mass destruction weapons and the long-term monitoring of 
the Iraqi regime's armament program. 
  For his part, Rolf Ekeus said that the commission did not 
feel satisfied up till now with the results of its work in Iraq, 
which meant that the UN economic sanctions imposed on the 
Baghdad regime, because of its aggression against the State of 
Kuwait, will remain in force. 
  Ekeus added that with regard to chemical weapons, the 
commission did not feel reassured because of the lack of 
complete information from Iraqi regime officials that would 
enable the commission to confirm that all these weapons had been 
destroyed or removed. 
  Ekeus stressed that there were still serious problems to be 
solved with the Iraqi regime officials at a meeting to be held 
in March. He said he believed that as long as the UN commission 
was able to work in Iraq, the Baghdad regime would not be able 
to implement any comprehensive armaments program. He emphasized 
that UN control was effective in this field and that the UN 
Security Council will rely on the reports of the commission when 
it came to make any decision related to considering the lifting 
or reduction of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi regime.

<F P=106> [Statement by "an official source" at the Standing Committee </F>
of the General People's Congress, GPC; date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] On 4 February, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
media cited a statement attributed to an official source at the 
YSP Central Committee. It was not only the contents of the 
statement that aroused our surprise and condemnation. What 
aroused our surprise and condemnation was the YSP's exploitation 
of the official media to transmit the statement issued by an 
official at the YSP Central Committee. This represented party 
monopoly over the second channel and Aden radio unprecedented 
since 22 May 1990. 
  While the General People's Congress Standing Committee 
regrets this act, it has no choice but to transmit this 
explanatory statement to our masses, asserting that it is forced 
to do this hoping that the YSP will stop this exploitation. 
Furthermore, the official spokesman's statement, which was 
embellished with flowery language concerning the document of 
pledge and accord, is strong evidence that the YSP views this 
document as a card for political propaganda and media deception. 
Although we, in the GPC, have always preferred that the 
practical implementation of the provisions of this historic 
document be the real test through which our people will be aware 
of the honest intentions, sound trends, and serious commitments, 
we have no choice but to explain the facts to our people without 
distortion, as follows: 
  1. The YSP statement notes that some representatives of the 
coalition to the dialogue expressed reservations about the 
document when it was signed so as to resort to them when they 
discuss the implementation. This shows a clear contradiction 
between their agreement on the document and their reservations 
about it. 
  In order to explain matters and to avoid veiled words -- 
which will only cause fear and worry for citizens when they fail 
to understand or comprehend --we, in the GPC, do not hesitate 
to acquaint the citizens with what the Standing Committee 
spokesman really means. The citizens will then judge what was 
issued by the YSP and decide which side is telling the truth, 
adopts clearer stands, and is most concerned about this document 
which was welcomed by our masses because it is an impregnable 
shield that protects the unity, safeguards democracy, and 
strengthens popular participation: 
  On the evening of Monday, 17 January -- that is, less than 
24 
hours before the signing of the document of pledge and accord -- 
brother Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas, representative of the 
YSP who was chairing the meetings of the political forces 
dialogue in Aden, dropped the following paragraph -- which was 
registered as Number two in page 18 of the document, under the 
headline "Constitutional Amendments:" 
  "Unifying the political will and enabling the constitutional 
institutions to assume their tasks, exercise their powers, and 
implement what was agreed upon in the pledge document." 
  When the GPC representative in the subcommittee, which was 
reviewing the final draft of the document, insisted on keeping 
this paragraph, the rest of the committee members supported him. 
Despite this, the YSP representative paid no attention to any 
opinion in the committee and insisted on canceling it. This 
prompted the GPC representative to underscore his reservation 
about this behavior in front of all the members of the dialogue 
committee. However, the YSP representative insisted on his 
stand on the pretext that this issue falls within the powers of 
the subcommittee. 
  In light of this behavior, and after signing the document, 
the GPC distributed the following memorandum among the members 
of the dialogue committee: 
  Brother members of the political forces' dialogue committee, 
greetings: 
  The GPC would like to draw your attention to the paragraph 
which had been listed on page 18 of the pledge and accord 
document until 17 January, when it was unilaterally dropped by 
one party to the committee. 
  That paragraph reads: Unifying the political will and 
enabling the constitutional institutions to assume their tasks, 
exercise their powers, and implement what was agreed upon in the 
pledge document. 
  That unilateral arbitrary measure proved beyond any doubt 
that as far this matter is concerned, all our efforts have been 
in vain. 
  [Signed] The GPC. 
  That memorandum was described by the YSP statement as a 
point 
of reservation designed to be used when implementation of the 
document is discussed. The GPC is certain that the masses of 
our people cannot consider the GPC's adherence to ending the 
crisis and all its manifestations as affirmed by its official 
memorandum to the members of the political forces' dialogue 
committee on 18 January an indication of ill intentions and 
noncommitment to implementation of the accord. However, it is 
regrettable that the fallacies that have been floated by the YSP 
after the signing of the accord document provide the most 
conspicuous evidence that the YSP views the document only as a 
means to continue the crisis in the face of the citizens' 
suffering in terms of a speedy deterioration of their living 
standards and the appalling price hikes. Citizens are also 
living in fear and anxiety over the destiny of their unity and 
the future of their homeland for no reason except that the YSP 
considers the demand for the unity of the political leadership, 
merging of the state institutions, and the Presidential Council 
and cabinet members' assumption of their executive tasks an 
inexcusable crime. What commitment does the YSP claim to the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document when its 
representatives in the political forces' dialogue and the 
state's executive authorities refuse to abide by the 
stipulations of the Constitution, contrary to the provisions of 
the pledge and accord document? 
  Following the same deceptive tone, the YSP Central Committee 
source claimed that the coalition representatives in the 
subcommittee and the military and security committee shirked 
their responsibilities toward the so-called discussion of the 
military and security guarantees. The source also claimed that 
the House of Representatives refrained from supporting the 
pledge and accord document. We at the GPC have irrefutable 
evidence which puts the blame on the YSP and proves the honesty 
and soundness of the GPC stand in the subcommittee and the 
security committee which was established to enforce the seventh 
article of the accord document. However, we will postpone 
exposing the falsehood of the YSP Central Committee spokesman's 
allegations in this regard and concerning the House of 
Representatives' decline to bless the document until the 
political forces' dialogue committee concludes its debates on 
the stands of the parties represented in the subcommittee. This 
is out of the GPC's concern that its uncovering of that 
deception and falsification might embarrass the parties to the 
political forces' dialogue before they are briefed on all that 
has been included in the minutes of the meetings of the 
subcommittee and the security committee. Afterward, we will be 
free to inform the people of all facts so that they would pass 
their judgment away from propaganda, allegations, or statements 
that have nothing to do with reality. 
  The GPC, which has expressed readiness to sign the agreement 
anywhere and anytime, regrets those new conditions and demands 
that have been set by the YSP, its partner to the coalition, 
outside the boundaries of the agreement. The GPC views those 
new conditions as a clear attempt to obstruct the signing of the 
agreement and to avoid commitment to implementing it. The 
consequences and effects of this regrettable stand will further 
complicate the crisis and expose the homeland to an unknown 
destiny.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice </F>
president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, 
YSP, by Kamal Jaballah in Aden; date not given] 
  [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party and Yemen's Vice President, has welcomed 
decisive and responsible Egyptian mediation to resolve the 
current grinding political crisis in the country because of 
Egypt's immense sacrifices and assistance in support of the 
Yemeni revolution and its constant backing in Yemen's 
contemporary issues. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his place of residence 
in "al-Husayn" in Aden, al-Bid stressed that Yemen cannot allow 
itself to be a base for domestic or foreign terrorism, 
especially to the extent that is harming the Egyptian people. 
He said that all the Arab countries will find themselves in a 
difficult situation if they do not stand united against 
terrorism. 
  Al-Bid added that the YSP leaderships went voluntarily to 
the 
capital, Sanaa, with the backing of all the electoral districts. 
He said that the party has made sacrifices that eliminated the 
discrepancy in development resulting from the past division and 
isolation, in order to create a state of law and order, a state 
that takes the united Yemeni homeland into the 21st century and 
not back to the 19th century, a state governed according to a 
new Yemeni social contract and not merely a signed document of 
pledge and agreement or "a forced return to the family house" -- 
which is what would ensue once that document is bypassed and 
negated and the guarantees, executive programs and timetables 
for implementation are abandoned. 
  The YSP secretary general went on to say that the current 
crisis has posed a real test for his country of its ability to 
establish a state of institutions, modernity, and stability 
despite the complications of confrontation. He said that there 
has been no clear, unified vision of a unified state. He added 
that the anti-YSP forces have not given it enough time, and they 
have pushed it into an unenviable position through the 
assassination of leading figures and statesmen, and even the 
violation of houses. 
  Al-Bid said that he regards the "Pledge and Agreement 
Document" as a mere "way station" to put the course of unity in 
the unified state into the hands of the Yemeni people. He noted 
that the crisis is not a personal issue between him and 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih but a crisis among all the ruling 
Yemeni organizations, bodies, and parties that are participating 
in the current dialogue. 
  He added that all the agreements signed during the past four 
years since unity was established have been set aside and in 
practice we have moved in the opposite direction. He stressed 
that the principles of democracy, coalition, and a state of law 
and order are enough to take care of the unity program and 
advance it. 
  Al-Bid began his interview with AL-AHRAM by saying:"It was a 
historic moment when we went to live in our capital Sanaa to 
establish our program, which the Yemeni national movement has 
long struggled to achieve. During our stay in Sanaa, we exerted 
all our efforts, but unfortunately we discovered that not all of 
us had a clear vision of the practical program. In other words, 
events showed that our vision of and belief in the program was 
not identical. Still, we do understand that a historic task 
such as this one is not easy to accomplish without suffering, 
sacrifices, and enough patience. The forces opposed to this 
program did not give us enough time to think calmly. They 
placed the YSP in an unenviable position through assassinations 
and by targeting leading figures and statesmen, such as the 
Chamber of Deputies speaker, the prime minister, the justice 
minister, and the YSP Political Bureau members. All of them 
were targeted directly and the last thing these forces did was 
to violate our houses. 
  The Yemeni vice president said: Yet we exerted every 
effort for the sake of unity and we do not regret what we have 
offered for our cause. We also tried to choose the path of 
democracy and proposed a coalition to sponsor the unity plan, 
because we saw various conflicting trends in the Arab world. We 
thought perhaps this initiative would act as a way out and 
confront everyone with their responsibilities for building a 
homeland at this difficult juncture. 
  Al-Bid affirmed that all the signed agreements have been put 
aside and that work was being conducted according to the others' 
convictions, making no effort to draw up a democratic, unionist 
plan for Yemen. 
  He explained: We have now reached an understanding within 
the framework of the Pledge and Agreement Document, which is a 
document of national consensus that we subscribed to and had our 
own view on. We agreed that it should form the common ground for 
us to rectify the path of unity. Anyone who wants unity has to 
defend under appropriate conditions -- a state of unity, for 
which I was most enthusiastic. After the 22 May "joy" we had in 
Yemen, which left behind overwhelming passions, I consider that 
the 18 January "joy" brings national awareness. Hence, let us 
pause at this juncture and proceed together to rectify the 
course of unity guided by the hands of the Yemeni people. I 
believe that a genuine state of unity that entails the 
requirements for construction and the establishment of this 
democratic plan is primarily a "compound" state. The gist of 
the document leads to this goal, but we the Arabs regrettably 
always work according to passions, not reason. If we relied on 
reason we would have been wiser. 
  The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party went on: 
Nearly four years have passed since unity was established but 
the question remains: What is the situation now in Yemen? 
  He replied: They say that the YSP is pursuing separation. 
When we went to Sanaa with our sons we were treated like 
immigrants. What did we go for and who dictated that we should 
go there? We went voluntarily and won the support of all 
electoral constituencies in the southern and eastern 
governorates and our citizens. This party offered what it 
should offer for unity, carried the banner of democracy and 
coalition, demanded a country of law and order, and offered 
sacrifices on behalf of the entire nation--150 cadres and 
leaders from our membership. We did not stop where the gangs 
and those behind them wanted. 
  He emphasized: The Socialist Party thinks of the future; it 
is not limited to just one individual. When we embarked on 
unity, we realized that we were chasing a dream. Some of us 
were overwhelmed by the sense of the saying "Moving from one 
framework to another provides an opportunity." Despite this, we 
all felt that we were the partisans of a cause and backers of a 
unionist, democratic plan, considering the plan's regulatory 
mechanism on the one hand and the actual situation in Yemen on 
the other. 
  Al-Bid pointed out that the YSP had presented 18 points, 
which were supported by the Yemeni masses. "We conceded these 
points in return for the "Pledge and Agreement Document," the 
document on national consensus. Now, we want to implement this 
document." 
  He added: "The document is not ideal, but neither is it 
impossible, as some believe. However, it contains our minimum 
goals; and we need to approach it responsibly, not by merely 
signing it and `returning to the house of obedience' [legal term 
meaning for a court to order a reluctant wife to live with her 
husband]. Our relationship with the leadership in Yemen does not 
mean that we should return to the house of obedience. We are 
looking to establish a new social contract, which was delineated 
in the pledge and agreement document. We now have to proceed 
from another starting point. Our Yemeni character will enable 
the leadership to overcome all their differences." 
  The YSP secretary general affirmed that individual security 
cannot be separated from public security in the state. Security 
cannot be restricted to the leaders without thinking about the 
security of the state as a whole. "The document affirms the 
importance of establishing a state of law and order, a state 
that can rectify the differences in progress between the two 
parts of Yemen and the isolation that existed in the past, a 
state that will enter the 21st century without returning to the 
19th century. When we signed the unity paper, I did not have in 
mind returning Yemen to the 19th century." 
  Al-Bid then responded to reports about tampering with the 
budget for the oil project at Hadramawt, the objective of which 
is said to be to divert funds to buy weapons and ammunition in 
preparation for a military confrontation between the two sides. 
He said: "This agreement must be approved by Parliament and 
the Council of Ministers. It is signed by foreign companies. 
The things that are rumored and have been published are 
impossible. How can funds be withdrawn or added in an agreement 
made by the YSP? Those who spread these rumors should have 
provided their evidence. Otherwise, these accusations can be 
categorized as cheap and absurd, especially since they deal with 
money. Shame on them." 
  Answering a question on the degree of understanding between 
the Chairman of the Presidential Council 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and his deputy, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and whether their 
relationship has reached a dead end, al-Bid said: "First, the 
issue is not personal. Reports always claim that the conflict is 
between the president and his deputy. True, we are responsible 
for leading this country, but we do so through organizations, 
parties, and councils. The issue is now out of the hands of the 
coalition parties and in the hands of the sides now taking part 
in the national dialogue. Any honest person will take a 
positive stand on this document by providing guarantees and 
starting to implement the measures in the relevant documents 
within a definite time frame." 
  He affirmed that the Committee for Dialogue Among the Yemeni 
Political Forces is entrusted with taking a decisive stand on 
the whole subject, saying: We support any decision they reach 
regarding this crisis. 
  I believe that this is a real test of our belief in our 
cause, the cause of building a unified and democratic Yemeni 
homeland. There is widespread support for this cause; this 
proves that Yemenis are capable of resolving their differences 
on the basis of the pledge and agreement document according to 
the democratic process. There is broad conviction in all Yemen 
that Yemenis want a life of recognized establishments, civilian 
normality, and stability for themselves and those around them. 
Therefore we will not be influenced by all the elements who 
want to push Yemen to a clash. 
  Al-Bid added: "The crisis has shown that the Yemenis reject 
terrorism and violence, for these things conflict with the 
democratic process. It also showed their desire for social 
justice and for a homeland united in a state that is "fitted 
together" [ murakkabah] and can resolve the differences in 
development, competition, opinion and counter-opinion, and 
diversity." 
  He explained: "If 22 May 1990 was Declaration of Unity Day, 
then 18 January is the day of rectifying the unity process. 
Rectification always faces difficulties, especially as it 
normally conflicts with habitual practices. The force of habit 
deprives people of their will; as the Yemeni proverb says, 
"Stopping a habit causes hostility." 
  Despite this, the crisis is not over. Our worst fear is that 
the document will just be used to bypass the crisis and to 
deprive it of any substance. The document therefore needs an 
executive program and timetable with priorities. One of the 
priorities is to arrest the outlaws who carried out the bombings 
and assassinations. 
  Al-Bid went on to say: "We do not want Yemen to be a base 
for terrorism, either in the Arab homeland or worldwide, because 
it is unthinkable for Yemen to follow a democratic course and be 
a base for terrorism. But it is worth recalling that many Arabs 
became involved in Afghanistan with the support of foreign 
international powers; but when these Afghan Arabs returned to 
their Arab lands and peoples that enjoyed security and safety, 
such as Egypt, Algeria, and Yemen, they began to suffer from 
this tribulation [terrorism]. All these are signs of an 
alternative plan for ruling. It is a terrorist plan that 
opposes development and is threatening the Arab nation. We 
believe that the Yemeni unity program is the nucleus of a 
pan-Arab, democratic, and unionist plan and we are enthusiastic 
about it. There is no harm in continuing with it despite the 
difficulties in implementing it, but we should be wise and deal 
with the reality consciously." 
  Regarding the extent of foreign intervention to escalate the 
Yemeni crisis, al-Bid said: "We have a crisis, but it is under 
discussion and the subject of a national dialogue. We should 
not blame it on others. The Arabs have this habit, in the past 
and now, of blaming foreign interference for their domestic 
crises in order to end them. If we look at the recent past to 
find those who had foreign ties, the question then becomes: Who 
are they? Who are these, whom we have reared and fed? 
Therefore, there is no need to open these files now. We are 
facing rulers whose mentalities are not equal to the cause. Yet 
this could help in rectifying the unity process." 
  He noted that the majority of regimes in the Arab countries 
are not thinking about development and stability as much as they 
are thinking about holding on to power. We believe that 
democracy is the right way to achieve stability and development. 
  The Arab countries will find themselves in a difficult 
situation if they do not stand against the creeping terrorist 
tide.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
praised the Austrian role and support for the Middle East peace 
process, hoping it will continue until peace is established in 
the region. 
  At the beginning of his joint news conference with Austrian 
President Thomas Klestil following one hour of talks, Mubarak 
remarked that Egypt and Austria maintain close cooperation. He 
said Egypt looks forward to further cooperation between the two 
friendly states. 
  In his statement, President Mubarak welcomed the Austrian 
president, noting that the two countries have similar views on 
several issues. He referred to the role played by former 
Chancellor Bruno Kreisky in backing the Middle East peace 
efforts. 
  In his statement, the Austrian president thanked Mubarak for 
inviting him to visit Egypt. He affirmed that Austria plays an 
important role in pushing the Middle East peace process ahead by 
participating in the working groups stemming from the 
multilaterals. 
  President Klestil noted that Austria was among the first 
states to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people. He stressed that his 
country will continue to develop its relations with Egypt and 
Arab states within the framework of the policy established by 
Chancellor Kreisky and former President Kurt Waldheim. 
  He remarked that inviting Yasir 'Arafat to dine with them 
last night was a fine gesture by President Mubarak. He said he 
hoped he would have the chance to meet Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres in Cairo this evening. 
  President Mubarak was asked about the Bosnian crisis and 
recent developments there and whether the West has been hesitant 
about taking any measure. He said: All I can say is that 
events in the former Yugoslavia and the onslaught against the 
Bosnian people are primarily the responsibility of the European 
Community. 
  Mubarak added that he had expressed this view often. He 
emphasized the need for everyone to work collectively to stop 
violence against Muslims in this part of the world, because if 
the issue is left unresolved, it will be a time bomb threatening 
all Europe. 
  Touching on the same issue, the Austrian president said: We 
discussed the former Yugoslavia and expressed our fear that this 
problem might be an example that could be repeated elsewhere if 
the world accepts the imposition of military force. 
  Touching on violence in Egypt, President Mubarak remarked 
that extremism is not exclusive to Egypt, but exists worldwide. 
He added that the media in Europe and elsewhere are blowing the 
little events in Egypt out of proportion. 
  The president said these incidents are under control. We are 
not afraid; we face things very firmly because they are a 
handful of criminals with no link with Islam. There is no 
relation whatsoever between what is happening and Islam, he 
stated. 
  The president added: A look at the world map will show us 
that terrorism occurs every day and everywhere. But the media 
focus on events in Egypt as if such incidents are limited to 
Egypt, which is not true. 
  In the context, the Austrian president affirmed that 
terrorism exists everywhere. He referred to terrorist assaults 
in his country lately. 
  President Mubarak was asked about the progress achieved in 
the Middle East peace talks and whether a breakthrough is 
foreseeable, particularly between 'Arafat and Peres. He said: 
This is a 50-year old problem; it is not easy to solve overnight. 
  He hoped the ongoing talks between the Palestinian 
delegation 
led by 'Arafat and the Israeli delegation led by Peres would 
achieve results by the end of the week. He said negotiations 
are the only way to reach an agreement. 
  President Mubarak hopes 1994 will be the year the Middle 
East 
problem is solved. 
  Asked about developing bilateral ties with Egypt, 
particularly in the economic field, the Austrian president 
replied that his accompanying delegation includes 
representatives from and leaders of industrial firms, such as 
the president of Siemens Communications. He referred to the 
signing of an agreement today to complete the development, 
improvement, and modernization of the telephone communications 
network. He explained that today's agreement complements one 
signed during the time of late President Anwar al-Sadat and 
former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky. 
  Touching on tourism as a primary source of economic 
development, the Austrian president said his country will 
continue to encourage Austrian tourism in Egypt and will not 
restrict it. He remarked that the small, isolated incidents 
that occur once in a while will not affect this tourism. 
  The Austrian president noted that Austrian and Egyptian 
universities are cooperating in scientific research and student 
exchange. He also noted close cultural exchanges. 
  President Mubarak was asked about news agency reports of 
warnings by the so-called Islamic Group to commit terrorist acts 
against tourists and foreigners. He replied: We provide the 
necessary protection to everyone on Egyptian soil, Egyptians and 
foreigners alike. 
  The president said anyone could fax papers to a news agency, 
reference to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah statement sent to AFP 
on 7 February, warning foreigners to leave Egypt, but he 
affirmed that the security bodies are taking all the necessary 
measures to confront this and taking precautions against every 
possibility. 
  Asked about developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Austrian 
president said he shares Egypt's view that the problem is "a big 
tragedy." He stressed that the world must face up to this 
problem or tragedy and refuse to partition a UN member state or 
wipe it off the world map by military force just to satisfy 
ethnic ambition. He remarked that Egypt and Austria hope this 
problem will be solved.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb. 7 (AFP) -- The outlawed Moslem 
fundamentalist group Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Monday issued a 
"final warning" for foreigners to leave Egypt. 
  "We have to warn them first so that our religion is innocent 
of the blood which will flow," the group said in a statement 
sent to AFP. 
  It said the killing of a police general in the southern town 
of Asyut Sunday was "the final warning to tourists and investors 
to leave the country." 
  Tourists and investors would be the main targets as a way of 
pressuring the "fascist" government of President Husni Mubarak, 
the group said in a second statement. 
  "The Jama'ah implores all embassies, consulates and 
businessmen to advise their citizens and kin, be they tourists, 
or Arab or Western investors, to leave the country immediately." 
  The group, which wants to turn Egypt into an Iranian-style 
Islamic republic, has frightened away many potential 
holidaymakers, costing the government billions of dollars in 
lost revenue. 
  "He who helps a regime which fights Islam, tortures its 
sons, 
abuses its women and hangs its young will suffer the same 
punishment as tyrants," it said. 
  Suspected Moslem militants on Sunday shot dead police 
general 
Omar Mustafa as he left his house in Asyut. He was the second 
police general to be killed in four days in the town, a hotbed 
of Islamic militancy. 
  On Wednesday, another officer was killed in similar 
circumstances. 
  Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned foreign investors and tourists 
to 
leave the country last Wednesday hours after a police raid in 
Cairo in which seven militants were killed. The group warned it 
would retaliate against the "massacre" by police. 
  Sunday's attack in Asyut brought to 297 the number of people 
killed since the Moslem militants launched a violent campaign to 
overthrow the secular government of President Husni Mubarak in 
March 1992. 
  The fundamentalists have targeted policemen, senior 
government officials, foreign tourists and Coptic Christians. 
More than half of the 107 policemen were killed in Asyut.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Ahmad Idris in Islamabad] </F>
  [Text] Severe differences have surfaced among Egyptian 
Islamic groups regarding the warnings issued to foreigners that 
they should leave the country. In a statement to our radio by 
telephone, the official in charge of the Information Bureau of 
the Conquest Vanguards Organization [tanzim tala'i al-fatah] 
condemned, on behalf of the organization, the warning issued 
three days ago by the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah to foreigners and 
its threats to strike at foreign investors and their projects in 
Egypt. He said: 
  [Begin recording] The Islamic masses and the whole nation 
know that Islam -- as all scholars have always been unanimous -- 
has forbidden any act that harms the Muslims. Thus, striking at 
the Egyptian economy and at legal investments will harm the 
Muslim masses there. [end recording] 
  The statement notes that this will isolate the Islamists and 
provide excuses to uproot them. The statement calls on the 
Egyptian leadership to apply the Islamic law and wipe out 
hotbeds of corruption to end armed confrontation and improve the 
situation.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR denounces the stance 
UN officials have assumed on the massacre committed lately by 
the Serbian slaughterers besieging Sarajevo, the massacre that 
killed 68 and wounded hundreds of Muslims. 
  In an editorial today, the paper says the stance adopted by 
the UN officials since the crisis began has been one designed to 
demonstrate neutrality and ignore responsibility to preserve 
peace and stability in member states. 
  The newspaper adds that the international organization has 
left the Bosnian people easy prey for extremist ethnic gangs, 
which get the most modern weapons anywhere, while it has barred 
the victimized people's access to weapons to defend themselves. 
  The paper describes the world's position on the massacre as 
"loose and feeble," although the world claims it has reached the 
peak of civilization.

<F P=106> [Column by Samyah al-Jundi: "The State of America"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton hardly mentioned foreign 
policy in his State of the Union address last weekend. He only 
noted the few achievements made in his first year in office, 
specifically the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada 
and Mexico, the GATT Agreement, and increasing pressure on Asian 
countries to open their markets and eliminate customs 
restrictions on their imports. Apart form this, the speech 
focused on domestic issues. There was disappointment for anyone 
who expected the U.S. President to say something about his 
latest tour of Europe and Russia, about his meeting with 
President al-Asad in Geneva, and whether the tour added or 
contributed to a clear U.S. view of the world, its problems, and 
how to address them. 
  The world's problems disappeared in Clinton's address 
despite 
the aggravation of problems in volatile areas such as Bosnia and 
Somalia and despite the doubts surrounding the reforms in Russia 
and the increasing differences between the United States and its 
Western allies over security and foreign policy. The drama of 
President Clinton failing repeatedly to appoint a new defense 
secretary to succeed Les Aspin added a new dimension to the 
general picture formed over a year of Democrats' rule of the 
extent of the confusion, division, and vacillation of actions, 
goals, and concepts. Does the United States deal with 
outstanding problems piecemeal? Is it trying to find a separate 
solution to every problem? Will it intervene militarily where 
things are hot and, if so, what is the extent and the limit of 
such intervention? What is the United Nations' role and what 
are its resources and ability to play such a role? 
  There are people who believe that President Clinton, after a 
full year in office, appears less enthusiastic about confronting 
his responsibilities as the first post-Cold War President of the 
United States. There are others who believe that the Democratic 
administration has not yet assimilated the changes on the world 
map and lacks a clear view of the shape of the world order in 
the long term and of the nature of the world map currently being 
shaped, a map in which states and ministates are bracing 
themselves to play an influential role in provoking wars and 
making peace. It is expected that the world will continue to 
see the United states vacillating on the road between the 
Balkans and Somalia and Russia and its former empires without a 
comprehensive framework for achieving peace based on a firm and 
consistent basis.

  [Excerpts] Six Arab residents were injured by the Israel 
Defense Forces gunfire in the territories today. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that four residents sustained 
slight injuries when soldiers fired at stone throwers in 
Nabulus. Another incident occurred in Rafah, where two 
residents were slightly injured when soldiers fired at stone 
throwers. [passage omitted] 
  Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, member of the Fatah supreme committee 
in the Gaza Strip, says the announcement by several Strip Fatah 
Hawks members of their intention to resume armed struggle is a 
spontaneous reaction to the killing of Salim Mu'affi, rather 
that a decision made by the organization. In a talk with our 
correspondent, 'Abd-al-Raziq said the continuing manhunt for 
Fatah Hawks by the security forces undermines the local 
population's confidence in the peace process.

  [Text] A press source at the Embassy of Palestine has said 
that the Egyptian Embassy in Amman has started handing out forms 
to be filled by evacuees from the Gaza Strip in order to carry 
out a census. 
  This procedure is aimed at maintaining the evacuees' right 
to 
return to their homeland, their identity, as well as all their 
acquired rights. 
  It should be noted that completing this form does not affect 
the evacuee's right to residency, work, commercial activity, and 
housing. For this purpose, Gazans should report to the Egyptian 
Embassy in Amman.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers, the reality is that the enemy can no 
longer obliterate or send into oblivion, that it swims against 
the current, and covertly and overtly carries out actions which 
contradict its statements. 
  The ruling authorities in Israel still believe they can set 
the clock back and that it is possible to perpetuate the 
occupation while stepping up their talk about peace, as if it's 
realization is imminent. [word indistinct] the uproar continues. 
  Through all this, it becomes evident that what the Israelis 
want is to drag the peace process into mazes that, in case the 
peace process continues, will only undermine and destroy its 
very foundations. 
  From this premise, the enemy's procrastination and delaying 
tactics on the one hand, and the escalation of its terrorist 
operations against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland 
on the other are signs as to how official Israel approaches the 
peace process and its requirements. Official Israel's illusion 
has reached the point of believing it is possible to bypass, or 
distort the inalienable Palestinian rights under the slogan of 
introducing amendments to the Declaration of Principles. Five 
months after it was signed, Israel has not yet offered any 
evidence that it abides by the implementation of its provisions. 
  While we view the Declaration of Principles as a first step 
on the road to peace, we are aware, and emphasize that this 
agreement is not the end of the road, given that it is an 
agreement for a transitional stage and does not, as yet, respond 
to all our national aspirations for liberation and complete 
independence. 
  In spite of all the above, we stress to the enemy before 
anyone else, that we have the necessary potential, will, and 
confidence in victory that make us say with a resounding voice 
that Israeli blackmail will be to no avail, and that occupation 
will inevitably be eliminated. Let the enemy wallow as much as 
it wants in its illusions. However, it must realize before it 
is too late that its illusions will founder on the rock of our 
people's steadfastness and their unflinching faith in the 
inevitable victory and independence on the liberated land of 
Palestine.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Security Council and Confidence Building: </F>
What Is the Required Position?"] 
  [Text] Everyone is now aware that Iraq has fulfilled all 
of its obligations toward Section C of Resolution 687 and 
Resolution 715 concerning monitoring, and that Iraq has 
confirmed its commitment through the various measures it has 
taken to implement these two resolutions. This fact has been 
noted by various international quarters. The UN Special 
Commission has also confirmed that Iraq has respected its 
commitments and obligations despite the injustice done to it. 
  This reminds us once again of the fact that reciprocal 
obligations of both Iraq and the UN Security Council, in 
accordance with the Council's own resolutions, require an 
immediate move to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which 
stipulates that the oil embargo should be lifted without any 
delay to enable Iraq to secure its immediate food and medical 
needs. 
  Within the contexts of justice and logic, any fair observer 
must view with surprise any attempt to bypass this fact and 
delay the lifting of the embargo, or any attempt to use the 
suffering of the Iraqi people as a card for extortion and cheap 
bargaining to achieve certain political objectives that are 
rejected in part and parcel and infringe on the Iraqis' right to 
possess their free will. 
  To be clearer, we refer to statements made by some people on 
"confidence building" and the suspect call for delaying a 
resolution to end the embargo until the conditions for that 
"building" are established. These statements are part of the 
maneuvers mastered by the United States, which seeks to involve 
others in these maneuvers, prevent them from seeing what is 
right, and place them in the whirlpool of the U.S. hostile 
objectives that run contrary to legitimacy and the principles of 
right and justice. 
  Confidence building between Iraq, the Security Council, and 
the Special Commission with a view to ending the injustice and 
the wrongdoing done to the Iraqi people is an immediate, 
important, and a required thing to do. It can be achieved 
through understanding and the fair objective perspective that is 
free from ulterior motives and evil purposes. It requires all 
the parties concerned to recognize that Iraq has done all it can 
to sincerely fulfill its obligations and commitments. 
  On the other hand, "confidence building" cannot be done 
through maneuvers; the attempt to dismiss facts; ignoring the 
suffering of the Iraqi children, women, and old people; or 
drifting behind the games of this or that international party 
that agreed to be a false witness in the greatest moral and 
human scandal seen by the world in the late 20th century. 
  We know very well that the United States and its lackeys do 
not wish the truth to emerge or the embargo to end. However, we 
also know that the Security Council issued a specific resolution 
that included reciprocal obligations, which Iraq has fulfilled. 
The Security Council should now fulfill its own obligations and 
lift the embargo and put an end to this flagrant violation of 
everything legitimate, humane, and just.

<F P=106> [Article by Hani Wahib: "How Civilized Is Hesitant Clinton?"] </F>
  [Text] At a time when statements by good people around the 
world call for lifting the unjust siege imposed against Iraq, 
and when there was a positive change in the positions of the 
majority of Security Council permanent members toward lifting 
the siege, hesitant Clinton, in his report to the Congress, 
followed a heretical approach in what he said about the long 
time needed to be sure of the soundness of future monitoring 
implementation. He also lied about what he called Iraq's 
commitment to democracy and respect for human rights, and he 
cawed like a crow about civility. The Arab saying that 
something is so sad that it is funny is true because hesitant 
Clinton continues to slaughter people--elderly, women, and 
children--in Somalia while he wails about human rights and 
announces a withdrawal from Somalia. He wails about civility 
while it was he who hit the houses of seemingly safe people in 
Baghdad with missiles, and killed men, children, and women from 
26-27 June 1993 when there was no military confrontation between 
Iraq and the U.S. 
  When hesitant Clinton tries in vain to prolong the unjust 
siege on Iraq through empty logic and baseless pretexts, he 
demonstrates his bankruptcy and his deviation from the will of 
the international community and law. Iraq has implemented 
Resolution 715 on future monitoring and Part C of Resolution 
687. This requires the implementation of Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687--the immediate lifting the oil embargo on Iraq 
and the total lifting of the siege. There is nothing in the 
Security Council that refers to the "trial period." Hesitant 
Clinton's talk about democracy and human rights is mere 
nonsense. Statements by Special Commission Chairman Ekeus, and 
others, who are not Iraqis, refer to Iraq's legal right to have 
the siege lifted. 
  Iraq's steadfastness, the determination of its leader Saddam 
Husayn, and our efforts to bolster the jihad and construction 
march, are the means to lift the siege against hesitant 
Clinton's will and despite the falsity of his talk.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 7, INA--Arab and foreign experts taking 
part in the International Symposium on War Crimes and Violations 
of Human Rights which is being held here called for a joint 
action to lift the trade sanctions on Iraq. 
  They called for setting up committees consisting of Iraqis 
and chaired by Europeans in order to explain the effects of 
trade sanctions on the Iraqi people. 
  They also called for establishing Arab and Islamic 
organisations that would defend human rights of Arabs and 
Muslims. 
  The Sunday [6 February] morning session was chaired by Amin 
Shuqayr from Jordan. The main speaker of the session was Dr. 
Safiyah Safwat, member of the Permanent Bureau of the Union of 
Arab Jurists. 
  Dr. Safwat delivered a paper entitled "The Effect of 
Sanctions (on Iraq), an Eyewitness Reports.". 
  She said that for more than three years Iraq has been 
subjected to severe sanctions and blockade and the Iraqi people 
have faced the most intensive and vicious air war in which 
hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed and the country's 
infrastructure destroyed. 
  The paper said numerous reports of international missions 
have indicated the size of destruction caused to Iraq as a 
result of the war and the imposition of economic blockade. 
Among these reports are Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan's report in 
July 1991, the report by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross in October 1991, the report of the Harvard International 
Team in May 1991, and the report by the General Federation of 
Iraqi Women in November 1992, Dr. Safwat said. 
  On the child status, she said for a period of ten months 
only, January to October 1991, 1,977 Iraqi children under the 
age of five died from causes related to the effects of the 
economic embargo. "For the same period in 1992, the total number 
of deaths among such children was 3,821, an increase of 93 per 
cent over the 1991 total," Dr. Safwat added in her paper. 
  The paper said the embargo has, moreover, deprived Iraqi 
pupils and students of their learning and educational needs. 
  "There are acute shortages of stationery, educational and 
laboratory equipment as there are shortages of technical and 
sports materials," it said. 
  Dr. Safwat said the economic embargo against Iraq has also 
severely affected social services as the deterioration of the 
economy has led to cuts in crucial services such as children 
nurseries and reformatories, and homes for the disabled. 
  The paper said because of the continuation of trade 
sanctions on Iraq, prices of basic goods have exceeded the 
economic capabilities of the majority of the Iraqi families. 
  Another speaker of Sunday's morning session was Mr. Ahmad 
Nasir from the Sudan. 
  He said that the international and humanitarian 
organisations 
in the West are known of their achievements for the Western 
people. He wondered why Arabs and Muslims do not set up such 
organisations that would defend their rights. 
  Shaykh Muhammad Bu Stah from Libya said the Arabs need a 
real 
action towards the sanctions against Iraq and Libya. 
  He lauded the Libyan Human Rights Committee and its 
contribution on both Arab and international levels. 
  Among the participants of the International Symposium on War 
Crimes and Violations of Human Rights is former U.S. Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark. Mr. Clark is one of those international 
dignitaries who condemned the U.S. and other countries which 
took part in the aggression against Iraq. Mr. Clark is chairing 
an international war crimes tribunal. 
  Mr. Clark told THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER that the tribunal held 
hearings in 35 cities in the U.S. and in more than 20 countries. 
  He said the tribunal, for example, held hearings in four 
cities in Turkey and another four in Britain. "The final 
tribunal was held in the city of the United Nations, New York, 
because the U.S. was the aggressor," he said. 
  Mr. Clark said the tribunal accused former President George 
Bush and other U.S. officials of 19 charges. In some countries 
the court where the hearings were held added charges against the 
country where the court was held. It happened in the UK, 
Canada, Italy and Japan," Clark said. 
  The court has also charges against the Japanese Government, 
because it permitted us to maintain naval vessels which were 
used in the Gulf war, he said, adding that there was a big 
protest in Japan where "I saw a hundred boats with people 
protesting the arrival of U.S. vessels." 
  The former U.S. attorney general said the most important 
crime now is the embargo. 
  "It is judged as a continuing crime against the U.S. [as 
received]. The embargo punishes the whole people of Iraq," he 
said, adding that it kills infants, the sick, and elderly people. 
  Mr. Clark said that the most urgent humanitarian issue on 
our 
planet is to lift the sanctions against the Iraqi people. 
  He said there are signs of lifting these sanctions. "Three 
permanent members of the Security Council stating that they are 
not feeling good about the sanctions, they have not voted 
against them yet but I can say they feel badly of the sanctions. 
There is uneasiness and you see it coming up more and more in 
the press elsewhere," Mr. Clark concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Kashif; from the "Attention" column: </F>
"Decisions of the U.S. Era"] 
  [Text] The U.S. President and his secretary of state see no 
reason to continue the Arab boycott of "Israel," saying "it no 
longer belongs to this age." And since Senator Brown cannot 
comprehend continuing that blockade, he submitted a bill to the 
U.S. Senate imposing sanctions on any Arab government abiding by 
resolutions that boycott U.S. firms dealing with "Israel". The 
Brown bill was immediately approved by a majority of 93 votes. 
Nobody in the U.S. Senate supported the Arabs, although the U.S. 
decision will first affect pro-U.S. Arabs, because it "bans the 
sale of U.S. arms to Arabs and withholds all types of U.S. 
services and military consultations to any state not abiding by 
the U.S. decision." 
  Of course, pro-U.S. Arabs will not be disappointed by their 
Washington master. In fact, they will use the Congressional 
decision as an excuse to get rid of the boycott resolutions to 
which they are committed by Arab unanimity. 
  We do not expect pro-U.S. Arabs to resist, reject, or speak 
out against the decision, because those following the course of 
recognizing "Israel" have already begun dealing with it on 
political and security levels, and will soon begin dealing with 
it on the economic level, through economic projects in Gaza and 
Jericho, or through the Middle East market now being established 
via relations and agreements that cover the entire Arab homeland 
and extend to all its capitals. 
  Since Washington is committed to the peace it is formulating 
and leading in the Middle East, it considers the Arab boycott to 
be harmful to the peace efforts. It does not understand how the 
pro- U.S. Arab camp can recognize "Israel," guarantee its secure 
borders and establish normal relations with it, without 
cancelling the boycott resolutions and measures with the open 
decision that Washington has asked of the Arab League, now that 
the United States has guaranteed the required majority in that 
organization. 
  Washington is now working for Tel Aviv's economic 
superiority, after it has guaranteed its military superiority. 
With this superiority, Washington asks its Arab camp to 
guarantee Tel Aviv's economic and military hegemony without 
condition or restriction. A powerful Israel guarantees U.S. 
interests in the region and guarantees the continued existence 
of the rulers -- presidents of kings -- that Washington appoints 
over the region.

<F P=106> [Article by Husayn al-Shahrabli: "Lobby and Lobby"] </F>
  [Text] As often reported in the Arab press, some people 
have swallowed the bait and have begun inching closer to 
Washington in the hope of forming an Arab lobby similar to the 
Zionist one. But little did they know that the bait is an 
American hamburger on an Israeli hook. 
  This could not have been due to goodwill or naivete, because 
some of them have swallowed the bait despite their knowledge of 
the hook and its origin. There are also those who, from the 
time of their grandfathers, have yielded to the humiliation of 
slavery and have actually vied with one another in order to win 
the favor of the American master. 
  But those rushing to the White House have been truly 
deluded, 
because the American master is no longer his own master. He has 
lost control of his affairs to the Zionist lobby and placed all 
his eggs in the Israeli basket. 
  Still, the devotees of the United States have formed an Arab 
lobby that is not for, but against, the Arabs and their nation. 
  Let us now seriously compare the endeavors of the new lobby 
with those of the established Zionist lobby. 
  The Arab lobby, if it is correct to call it by such a name, 
is a generous lobby. For we have not heard of a single occasion 
on which it has secured anything. On the contrary, it has 
conceded everything with contentment and satisfaction. And as 
the saying goes: Contentment is an inexhaustible treasure. 
  On the other hand, the Zionist lobby has secured everything 
without becoming content or satisfied. 
  The Arab lobby specializes in increasing pressure, cooling 
down hot spots, and loosening knots in order to clear the way 
for the Americans. 
  Conversely, the Zionist lobby specializes in creating those 
hot spots for the Americans, both president and officials, by 
all possible means. The Zionist lobby controls the most crucial 
areas of American society -- power, money, and the media -- and 
holds the keys to every door. Thus, most of the decisions made 
by the U.S. Administration come in attractive Zionist dress. 
  The Arab lobby makes blood sacrifices for the Americans, 
even 
if it is the blood of kinsmen and brethren, while the Zionist 
lobby is among the leading guests to waste more Arab blood. 
  Let us now compare the most significant achievements made by 
the Zionist lobby for Israel with those of the Arab lobby for 
its nation. 
  The former has made the mighty United States a secretary 
serving in the office of the Zionist prime minister, and has 
subjected U.S. will to the decisions of the Knesset. 
  On the other hand, the latter has reduced Arab states, 
governments, and officials to employees in a small section of 
the U.S. State Department, begging for visas and identity cards 
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At the same 
time, it has subjected Arab countries' will to the future and 
comfort of the U.S. President, whether Republican or Democrat. 
  We all know that the Zionist lobby controls the United 
Nations and its Security Council resolutions. 
  As for the miserable Arab lobby, the lame lobby, it is no 
more than a folkloric group fit to decorate and add color to 
conference tables (with their head gear, beards, and mustaches) 
or become another number in a list of signatories. 
  The Arab lobby is destroying the Arab structure and dwarfing 
the nation, from the ocean to the Gulf, and burning its history. 
  It is a stupid lobby, which has been charmed by blond 
America, and it has disowned its mother, its father, and its 
homeland for the sake of its love -- because America is its only 
love. 
  It is a short-sighted lobby, which does not view its 
national 
wealth as lawful unless it is first blessed by the U.S. 
treasury. It also does not consider its nation's problems fully 
diagnosed unless they have been seen through the U.S. 
microscope. The United States knows everything about the 
nation. 
  It is a very tiny lobby that derives strength from the 
Zionist lobby and looks taller, stronger, and more treacherous 
in the shadow of that lobby. 
  The Arab lobby continues to claim that it works for the 
nation and its interests. This is why it has offered its 
territory as a bridge for the dirty infidel masters to come 
occupy the homes of the poor faithful, who have performed 
absolution for prayer. 
  An Arab lobby, a Zionist lobby, a Zionist Arab lobby. 
  Bless you, O Iraq, for you have been, and you will continue 
to be, the nation's pivot, pure heart, and the banner under 
which the nation seeks cover from the disgrace of the so-called 
Arabs. 
  Bless you, for they have formed a lobby against you. 
  But you are stronger and more lasting, because you seek the 
help of God. They heard you praying: O God, O Helper.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (INA)--AL-THAWRAH daily of Iraq 
wondered about how long would the Iranian regime continue to 
play the role of a guardian on Arab and Islamic affairs. 
  The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Ba'th Socialist Party, 
said 
in an article today that the regime, which faced an irritating 
armed resistance in many of its major cities, districts and 
villages was incapable of playing any positive role in the 
region. 
  AL-THAWRAH added that instead of solving its internal 
problems, rising from its messed up policies and its failure to 
find suitable solutions for obstacles facing its people, the 
Iranian regime intervened in the internal affairs of Arabs and 
Muslims despite the harsh lesson it learned from its war with 
Iraq. 
  The paper commented that the Iranian regime received a 
similar blow when it attempted to interfere in Iraq's internal 
affairs during the chapter of sabotage and hooliganism following 
the 30-state aggression on Iraq. 
  The paper cautioned Arabs and Muslims against Iranian 
attempts to intervene in their internal affairs through 
spreading chaos and instigating trouble under false slogans 
similar to what has been going on in Jordan and Algeria.

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn has received a cable 
from Shaykh As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, amir of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement-Bayt al-Maqadis on the third anniversary of the 
U.S.-Zionist military aggression against Iraq. 
  The cable says: The Jihad Movement has devoted its utmost 
efforts, both in terms of funds and personal sacrifice, for the 
sake of raising the flag of God is great. You were the warrior 
who carried that flag to confront the gathering of infidels, who 
advanced from various parts of the world in order to extinguish 
the torch of freedom burning on the Land of the Two Rivers and 
to subjugate Iraq just as they have subjugated other Arab and 
Muslim rulers, who now rush to the Black House in Washington in 
order to request mercy and pardon and to receive the infidels' 
instructions to strike at our peoples and to mortage their 
honour and dignity in return for a cheap livelihood and the 
existence of a feeble, powerless rule. 
  The cable adds: The Mother of Battles was like the Mu'tah 
battle in which the Muslims faced the Romans in Greater Syria 
[Bilad al-Sham] under the command of Zayd Bin-Harithah, Ja'far 
Bin-Abi-Talib, and 'Abdallah Bin-Rawahah, may God rest their 
souls in peace. Later, the command was passed to Khalid 
Bin-al-Walid, may God rest his soul in peace, who maneuvered and 
then withdrew. The Mother of Battles was also like the battle 
of the Prophet's grandson, al- Husayn, peace be upon him, who 
faced injustice without surrendering. Al-Husayn preferred to 
meet his God and enter paradise than live a luxurious life and 
remain silent toward injustice and the unjust ones. There was 
no parity in arms and men. There was only dependence on God and 
whatever means of confrontation were available. 
  There can be no comparison between spiritual and material 
values. Spiritual values are linked to God, and fate is ordained 
in God's Holy Book and in the traditions of His prophet. So 
those who faced the world with its Persian and Roman empires 
with the spirit of Jihad faced death for the sake of God. They 
were not afraid of the enemy's superior power. 
  The nation looks up at you while you still stand lofty, 
telling free men that Palestine is still Arab. You are the only 
one among the rulers still considering Palestine Arab. The 
rulers calmed down and were therefore humbled. They removed 
Palestine from the nation's map and geography. Damn them. The 
nation still has men who can achieve glories. The United States 
will vanish and God's order will prevail, whether the infidels 
like it or not. 
  The cable continues: During the immortal Mother of Battles 
we smelt the fragrance of history, recalling Muslim victories in 
Palestine and visualizing the armies of Khalid-Bin-al-Walid 
crossing the Syrian Desert to al-Yarmuk on the approaches of 
Palestine. 
  May God grant victory to Iraq. May God make the Holy Koran 
your guardian. May God make you the rightly guided leader. May 
the traditions of God's prophet be your torch with which to 
extinguish the fire of hatred and Mazdaism. Please, your 
excellency, accept from the Palestinian people's mujahidin their 
blessings and prayers for your steadfastness in the face of the 
enemies. Victory will come soon after the removal of the 
blockade and its unjust tools. God is all-powerful.

  [Text] Taha Yasin Ramadan, Revolution Command Council 
member and vice president, has said that the rancorous enemies 
who are wagering on a war of attrition by perpetuating the 
blockade will lose their wager, just as they lost their wager on 
the war they perpetuated between Iraq and Iran for eight years. 
The Iraqis under leader President Saddam Husayn crowned this 
war with a great victory and emerged from it stronger and more 
capable, he added. 
  During a meeting today with a delegation from the Jordanian 
Arab Democratic Party, led by Samir Habashinah, the party's 
deputy secretary general and member of the Jordanian House of 
Representatives, Ramadan said that the Iraqis will foil the war 
of blockade and will emerge stronger. He pointed to what the 
Iraqis have achieved in terms of marvelous and great victories 
in their counterattack, represented by reconstructing what the 
aggressors demolished and by foiling the aggressors' schemes 
designed to deprive Iraq of both its livelihood and its elements 
of strength, progress, and reconstruction. 
  Habashinah saluted the heroic stand of President Saddam 
Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He also lauded their 
confrontation of the largest aggression against the Arab nation. 
  Habashinah stressed that the Iraqis' firmness and adherence 
to their principles and sovereignty are additional strength for 
all the Arabs, who are struggling for their nation and its 
sovereignty and progress. 
  The meeting was attended by the head of the Foreign 
Relations 
Office of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, 
secretary general of the Arab Popular Forces Conference.

southern Iraq. The regime's artillery shelled the regions of 
(Bahilah) Nahr Salih, Abu-Saddah, (Muray'an) (al-Mifrakh), and 
al-Waki in al-Madinah District in al-Basrah Governorate. 
  Our sources in southern Iraq said the shelling was so 
intense 
that scores of houses were destroyed and heavy losses inflicted 
on citizens' property. According to the latest information 
available to our sources, a 15-year old girl was martyred in the 
shelling, which is still continuing.

  [Text] Our sources in Iraq have monitored extensive 
movements for tyrant Saddam's forces on the road linking the 
Governorates of al-Najaf and Karbala' in central Iraq. Our 
sources said in an urgent dispatch received today that dozens of 
armored military units and tank battalions were seen taking up 
positions along the road. Most of the tanks deployed by the 
regime, our sources added, are sophisticated Russian-made T-72's 
used by the Republican Guards. 
  Our sources cited well-informed sources that the deployment 
came after antiregime popular moves in central Iraq, especially 
in the Governorates of Karbala', al-Najaf, and al-Hillah. The 
sources said the command of the deployed force was instructed to 
hold military exercises and training for occupying imaginary 
targets inside cities. 
  It should be noted that the Governorates of al-Najaf and 
Karbala' were in the past few weeks the scene of heroic 
operations carried out by the Islamic resistance forces. The 
regime's centers, headquarters, and its security and party 
services were attacked, and leaflets urging citizens to rebel 
against and overthrow tyrant Saddam's regime were distributed.

al-Mansur suburb of Baghdad. This was reported by arrivals from

the regime's recent instructions banning individuals from 
dealing in currency in the Baghdad money market and restricting 
this activity to a group of brokers working directly on behalf

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Syria: Failure of Washington </F>
Negotiations Arouses Questions About What Israel Wants"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Despite the 
atmosphere of secrecy surrounding the recent round of bilateral 
negotiations, what has been leaked about the failure to reach 
any agreements or an understanding on foundations for the peace 
process has aroused real question marks about what Israel wants 
and its aim behind delaying reaching a solution on the Syrian 
track. Perhaps some observers interpret this as an Israeli 
attempt to dampen the success achieved in the the Geneva summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton last month, 
and to indicate that improving Arab-U.S. relations should be 
done via Israel. 
  For its part, Syria refuses to accept these ideas and 
insists 
that Israel should negotiate as a party, not as an ally of the 
United States. 
  In statements to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Syrian political sources 
have accused Israel of trying to drive a wedge between Syria and 
the Arab states. It does not want to achieve any progress on 
the Syrian track. This is why it has pointed to the need to 
delay any achievement until details of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement have been completed in isolation from the other 
tracks. Besides, the praise heaped recently on Syria and 
President al-Asad in particular at the expense of Egypt and the 
PLO chairman in the seminar held by Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin reflects -- according to the Syrian sources -- 
Israel's desire to split Arab ranks and deal with personal 
matters. Syria rejected and continues to reject this because 
its policy is opposed to such orientations. The sources are 
surprised by Israel's constant return to secrecy and discussing 
the concept of peace before announcing its agreement to withdraw 
completely, even though Syria has stressed its willingness to 
implement all requirements of a just peace. 
  A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that in its current 
policy Israel is seeking to obstruct all efforts related to the 
peace process and to waste time. But Damascus will continue to 
display self-restraint, because it believes that time is not in 
Israel's interests and that these maneuvers will not help it to 
achieve what it wants, because the government's worrying 
position in Israel will inevitably push it toward the Syria 
gate, from which to move toward all solutions. 
  The Syrian official added that current factors should help 
Israel to recognize the right of the Syrians, Palestinians, and 
Lebanese to have their territories liberated from the Israeli 
presence. And that Israel tried to play games by working for 
bilateral agreements, which Syria believes weaken the Arab 
position and has rejected conclusively. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--Jordan's Ambassador in Egypt 
Nayif Sa'ud al-Qadi has denied that there was a diplomatic 
crisis between his country and Iran that led to the reduction of 
the Iranian diplomatic staff in Amman. 
  In statements to MENA, he said that all the Jordanian 
Government did was request that the number of Iranian diplomats 
in Amman be close to the number of Jordanian diplomats in Tehran. 
  He added that the Iranian Government did not object, and 
understood the motives of the Jordanian request, which was made 
according to diplomatic norms. He affirmed that the request had 
nothing to do with any incident before or after it was made. 
  He noted that current Jordanian-Iranian relations are 
normal, 
that both countries have embassies in each other's capitals, 
that there is normal trade exchange between them, and that 
Jordan always seeks friendly relations with Arab and Islamic 
countries. 
  The Jordanian Government had requested the departure of 21 
out of the 26 diplomats at the Iranian Embassy by the end of 
February. In its request, the Jordanian Government explained 
that the move was aimed at achieving a balance in the diplomatic 
representation between the two countries because only three 
diplomats are working at the Jordanian Embassy in Tehran. 
  While Iran announced its acceptance of Jordan's request, 
Arab 
diplomatic sources in Cairo said that relations between Jordan 
and Iran are somewhat clouded after Iran recently submitted to 
the Jordanian Government a number of proposals for relations 
between the two countries to be enhanced through popular, not 
official, political channels, over which Amman expressed 
reservations. 
  The diplomatic sources interpreted this as fear of 
infiltration by pro-Iranian forces into Jordanian political life 
as was the case with Hizballah in Lebanon, especially at a time 
when the Jordanian Government is strenuously trying to contain 
the Islamic extremist trend that overshadows the country's 
political life. 
  These developments come at a time when the Jordanian 
Government has expressed displeasure at the recent burglary 
attack on the home of Jordanian Ambassador in Tehran Yasin 
Istanbuli. The Jordanian Government believes that the Iranian 
authorities did not deal with the incident properly. These 
developments also coincide with the assassination of the 
Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut by people 
believed to be extremists and with explosions at two movie 
theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' last week. 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has announced that it 
arrested 
a group of Afghan Arab returnees who received military training 
during the Afghan war against the former Soviet occupation. 
  The Jordanian Interior Ministry said that these Afghans were 
responsible for the explosions at the two movie theaters. 
  The Jordanian-Iranian relations improved after the end of 
the 
Gulf crisis. Diplomatic relations between Amman and Tehran were 
resumed in 1991 after a 10-year hiatus because of Jordan's 
support for Iraq in its war against Iran.

  [Text] At the offices of the Jordanian Corporation of the 
Development of Exports and Jordanian Commerical Centers, a round 
of economic and trade talks has been held between the Jordanian 
side under Marwan 'Awad, director general of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade, and the Chinese side under Li Ping, deputy 
director of the Chinese Council for the Development of 
International Trade. Also present was Dr. Muhammad Bani-Hani, 
director general of the Corporation. 
  Mr. Marwan 'Awad spoke to the news desk about the talks: 
  [Begin 'Awad recording] We met with the director and the 
joint delegation of the Chinese chambers of commerce and the 
Chinese Exports Development Corporation. We reviewed the status 
of economic and commercial cooperation between the two sides and 
the agreements in place between our two countries. We pointed 
out the investment opportunities that may induce Chinese 
businessmen to invest in Jordan. We proposed instituting 
assembly lines using Chinese technology and expertise. 
Investors would benefit from Jordan's position and its 
relations with neighboring states through the bilateral pacts it 
has with them. This is in addition to the joint investment 
opportunities that may open up for Chinese investors. We also 
updated them on the measures taken to promote the export of 
Jordanian products to China in settlement of a Chinese loan to 
Jordan. It is a good opportunity for us to introduce Jordanian 
products to the Chinese market. 
  In addition to increased trade, our aim is to reduce the 
deficit in the balance of trade estimated at $35-40 million. We 
import $60 million worth of goods from China and our exports to 
China are on the order of $20-25 million. The Chinese side said 
they were willing to raise the volume of bilateral exchanges and 
boost their Jordanian imports. They requested and obtained 
detailed lists of Jordanian goods that may form an export basis 
to China. 
  For their part, the Chinese delegation will, through the 
Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Exports Development 
Corporation, distribute the lists to the interested quarters.

<F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES, by Ian 'Atallah] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade (CCPIT) delegation ended its trip to Jordan 
Thursday [3 February] indicating that it was guardedly 
optimistic about prospects for enhancing future Sino-Jordanian 
trade cooperation. 
  Delegation head Li Ping told a group of Amman World Trade 
Centre members that "frankly speaking, we still don't know very 
much about the Jordanian market." 
  The CCPIT team Thursday visited the Jordan Trade Association 
(JTA), The Amman World Trade Centre (AWTC) and the Jordan Export 
Development and Commerical Centres Corporation (JEDCO), where it 
was addressed by Marwan 'Awad, the secretary-general of the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade. 
  Both the members of the JTA and Mr. Awad emphasised to Mr. 
Ping that Jordan wished to see greater equality in the current 
trade balance between the two countries. 
  Although official figures vary, Jordan currently imports 
from 
China a little over three times in value as it exports there. 
  "I think that it is our responsibility as well as yours to 
bridge the trade gap," Mr. 'Awad told the Chinese team. 
  In that area, he stated, discussions were underway between 
the two countries on how to structure Jordan's repayments of 
some $47 million in debts due to China from foreign aid, and 
that the loans would be repaid by Jordan partly in commodities. 
  "Although the amount of commodities involved will be 
relatively small, it will give us the chance to introduce some 
of our products to the Chinese market." 
  Mr. Ping stated at the meeting with JTA members, however, 
that "an actual balance in bilateral trade may be very difficult 
to achieve." 
  Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that "the two countries' 
economic complementarity is not very large, and Jordanian 
products suitable to China are few." 
  "The key point, and one which we are stressing very heavily 
to the Jordanians, is that they need to provide us with detailed 
information and specific lists of suitable products which we 
could select from. Our attitude is positive," he said, but the 
bottom line regarding hard benefits of any imported Jordanian 
commodities to china and their price range still had to be 
adhered to. 
  Mr. Ping told the JORDAN TIMES that China's economy was 
currently undergoing near-explosive expansion, with last year 
seeing a 12 per cent economic growth rate and an overall foreign 
trade increase of 18 per cent. "Last year, our total import 
value reached $104 billion, a 29 per cent increase over the 
previous year, so you see that we are looking for suitable 
products with great urgency." 
  He said that China's current main needs were in the areas of 
technology and infrastructure development, specifically in the 
areas of air, land and sea transport and transport facilities, 
telecommunications and communications network development, 
energy technology and raw materials processing technology, and 
modernisation of China's agricultural sector. 
  "All of these are top priorities for China's development. 
With regard to these areas, China has great demand for import. 
But the key issue is, once again, what products does Jordan 
have that are suitable for our market." 
  At the Amman World Trade Centre, the AWTC's members told Mr. 
Ping that one important area for improvement in Sino-Jordanian 
commece was in the field of banking communications. 
  There were no direct routes of correspondence between 
Jordanian and Chinese banks, and the banks from both sides had 
very limited knowledge of each other, which leads to indirect 
and inefficient routing of bank transaction and transfers, long 
delays and added costs. 
  Overall, they told Mr. Ping, this present situation cramps 
trade between the two countries greatly. 
  They suggested the establishment of a comprehensive 
communications network between Jordanian and Chinese banks as 
well as exchange of information between the two banking 
communities. 
  They also suggested that the Bank of China open a major 
branch office sometwhere in the Middle East. 
  Mr. Ping concurred with the AWTC members, saying that 
banking 
and its development in China had not kept pace with overall 
economic growth, and that foreign banks had only recently begun 
to establish branch offices in China, and on a limited scope. 
  Wang Yuechun, third secretary at the Chinese Embassy 
commerical office in Amman, told the JORDAN TIMES that in the 
future, China planned to send trade delegations to the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
  He said that China was very interested in assisting in the 
rebuilding of the Palestinian economy and that China's motives 
in the case were not merely economic, but political as well, as 
China had long been in sympathy with the Palestinian people and 
"their struggle to regain their rights and dignity."

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) is being 
targeted for criticism for remaining "uninvolved" in the food 
and drug case which was raised by Minister of Health Abd 
al-Rahim Malhas two weeks ago. And while its representatives 
have responded to critics in the press and among IAF 
constituency, the front has yet to outline its position towards 
the affairs. 
  Some analysts believe that the IAF has been unable to make 
up 
its mind over support of Dr. Malhas if only because a large 
percentage of its constituency is pharmacists and food traders 
whose interests have been targeted by Dr. Malhas's criticism. 
  On the other hand, the IAF does not want to appear to be 
siding with the government especially since it was Dr. 'Abd 
al-Salam al- Majali's government that was perceived to be 
targeting the Islamists by the change in the Election Law to a 
one-person, one- vote system. 
  Other analysts believe that the IAF cannot be called upon to 
have a unified party line on this issue because the issue is 
"non-partisan" and is not political in nature. 
  These analysts believe that the IAF has within its ranks the 
same split in opinion over the minister's statements as the one 
that has appeared in society at large. 
  The IAF's position may become clearer when its spokesperson 
in parliament, Hamzah Mansur, takes the floor today. But in the 
meantime, the front has attempted to ward off criticism by other 
deputies and political forces in the country. 
  It has, nevertheless, worded its response carefully to avoid 
committing itself to any particular position. 
  In fact, on Wednesday, the first day of parliamentary 
discussion of the Malhas allegations, the IAF deputies who are 
usually at the fore of those signing up to speak against the 
government did not take the podium and left it instead to the 
deputies who lashed out at the minister. 
  Critics of the powerful Islamic party maintain that the 
movement failed to give adequate attention to Dr. Malhas' 
charges of corruption among businessmen and importers and within 
the bureaucracy of the ministry itself. 
  Two weeks ago, a weekly Arabic newspaper quoted Dr. Malhas 
as 
saying that a good quantity of food and medicine that reaches 
the market does not meet international standards and 
specifications. 
  He pointed the finger at what he described as "whales" in 
the 
business sector who, he maintained, have exercised pressure and 
intimidated food and drug control employees in his ministry. 
  The minister's statements created panic in the Kingdom, 
especially since Dr. Malhas directly connected the increased 
percentage of cancer cases in the country with the quality of 
imported food and drugs. 
  The Lower House of Parliament immediately called for a 
session to discuss the charges of the minister and initiate 
investigations into the minister's claims. The House gave the 
government three days to present a report substantiating the 
minister's statements. But in what appeared to be an isolated 
incident, the IAF's deputies in the Lower House were seen as the 
only organised bloc in the House which accepted the government's 
request to delay discussion of what has been titled by the local 
press as "Malhas gate." 
  Other "opposition" deputies had demanded that the government 
stick to the deadline of last Sunday but they failed to gain the 
support of the IAF deputies except al-Zarqa' Deputy Bassam 
al-'Moush, who seconded the government' motion for delay saying 
that they also needed time to "collect information." 
  Criticism of the IAF's position grew when the president of 
the Pharmacists Association, Husam Musmar, who was elected on an 
Islamist platform, published a letter dismissing Dr. Malhas' 
call for upgrading and enforcing legislation which would provide 
for tighter control over the quality of food and medicine in the 
Kingdom. 
  At the same time Mr. Musmar published his letter in local 
Arabic papers, AL-SABIL, an Islamist weekly believed to be the 
mouthpiece of the IAF which also marginalised the importance of 
Dr. Malhas's statements much to the chagrin of its Islamist 
readers. 
  In this week's edition, AL-SABIL's editor in chief, Hilmi 
al-Asmar, sought to ward off criticism that the Islamists were 
in support of business interests at the expense of the health of 
the people. 
  In a long column he also sought to dispel charges that the 
Islamists' dismissal of the charges made by Dr. Malhas was 
because he was a well-known critic of Islamist calls for 
stricter social laws, especially in regard to segregation of men 
and women. Before assuming his post as minister of health, Dr. 
Malhas wrote a weekly column in AL-RA'Y Arabic daily in which he 
often lashed out at fundamentalist social demands and called for 
progressive and liberal policies. 
  "We understand the criticism of our brothers who love us and 
are loved by us, because we did not give the food and medicine 
case its due in our earlier edition of AL-SABIL," Mr. al-Asmar 
said in his column. 
  "But it was not because we do not want to point to the cases 
of corruption in our society and not because we are enemies of 
any particular individual," he added. 
  Mr. al-Asmar asserted since other Arabic language papers had 
dedicated enough space to the case "AL-SABIL did not feel the 
need to repeat what was already published." 
  He was responding to a letter the weekly received from 
al-Tafilah and which was signed by 23 IAF supporters. 
  In that letter, which AL-SABIL published on the inside page, 
the signatories said: "There was great disappointment among the 
youth of the Islamic movement when your paper was published 
without investigating or saying a word of support for this 
important national issue." 
  The signatories were especially critical of a column by Mr. 
al-Asmar which the letter said "was weak and denied the 
existence of corruption but instead took the opposite view." 
  "If there is animosity towards some newspapers, then this 
should not stop you as Muslims, as a movement and newspaper, to 
say that is right," the letter added. 
  The signatories also pointed out that "Islamists were the 
first to open the files of corruption in the last Parliament, 
and the Islamists have based on their election campaign on 
putting an end to financial and administrative corruption." 
  AL-SABIL also carried two items signed by the "editorial 
staff" in which it said that they were happy to receive "an 
unending number of telephone calls" and that they were not above 
criticism. 
  "We stress that we are completely on the side of the 
citizen... and by deduction in support of the minister of health 
against the whales of corruption," one of the pieces said. 
  The criticism of the IAF movement's position was also 
apparent in other papers, including the evening daily AKHIR 
KHABAR, which accused the movement of siding with the rich 
against the poor. 
  "We were hoping that the IAF would take this opportunity to 
stand by the minister at this crucial moment because it is the 
poor people who give the Islamic movement its political base and 
its parliamentary seats, and not the large businesses even if 
they cloak themselves in Islam," it said in an article signed by 
Nahid Hattar. 
  "I worry about the movement, which appears torn between the 
power of the people and the force of those with interests, 
tilting towards the side that we cannot accept," Mr. Hattar 
added. 
  Mr. Hattar's column appeared side by side with a letter from 
the official spokesperson of the IAF deputies, Hamzah Mansur, 
who was replying to a similar charge made by Mr. Hattar a day 
earlier. 
  "I was surprised, as were my brothers the IAF deputies, by 
what appeared in Mr. Nahid Hattar's article in which he 
categorised the deputies into two groups: one with the poor 
people and the other which stands with the whales," Mr. Mansur 
said. 
  "We reject the notion that our society should be divided 
into 
rich and poor for wealth is not a crime... Citizens, both rich 
and poor, are our brothers and family," Dr. Mansur added.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Moshe Nussbaum] </F>
  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman announced 
that four soldiers were killed and five wounded in a Hizballah 
ambush in south Lebanon this morning. Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq 
told us a short time ago that it was a planned ambush that 
involved at least 15 Hizballah terrorists, as well as other 
forces which fired from a distance. Syria could always prevent 
such attacks, Lieutenant General Baraq told our correspondent 
Moshe Nussbaum. 
  [Begin recording] [Baraq] At around 1100 this morning one of 
our patrols, which was opening up a road to Sujud, was ambushed 
with light weapons and RPG fire from several hundred meters 
away, as well as with Sagger missiles from a distance. We 
sustained several casualties in the initial attack. A firefight 
ensued and lasted about an hour. All together, we have four 
fatalities -- I can not give you their names because their 
families have not yet been notified -- and five casualties. 
Three casualties were sustained in the incident itself and two 
others later. I wish to express the condolences of the entire 
IDF to all the families. These soldiers were among our best 
fighters. 
  A war has been going for some time along the Lebanese 
border. 
We regrettably suffer fatalities. We cause heavy losses to the 
other side, but we are also having a tough time. Following the 
conflagration, there were exchanges of fire in the region. We 
rushed in extra forces, including helicopter gunships. Later, 
there were several Israel Air Force attacks against targets from 
which the perpetrators of the attack originated, as well as 
other sites. I assume that the other side also sustained 
casualties. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] To what extent can 
responsibility for the incidents be placed on Syria? 
  [Baraq] Hizballah is responsible. We hold them mainly 
accountable for this, and we will make them pay. In our 
opinion, had the Syrians been interested they could have 
contributed to an effective action by the Lebanese Government to 
restore calm or cease Hizballah activity, but they are not doing 
so. It only depends on them and the Lebanese. We will continue 
to fight Hizballah as much as necessary. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
troops on the northern border and in the security zone have been 
placed on alert, and Israel is closely following what is 
happening in the north. 
  Military and political sources say that a trend of 
escalating 
terror attacks has persisted since the beginning of the dialogue 
with the PLO. In 1993, the number of terror attacks in Lebanon 
doubled, the number of infiltration attempts increased 
considerably, and the organizations opposed to the peace process 
have exhibited a higher motivation to infiltrate into Israel and 
carry out attacks. The sources say Syria will continue to use 
Hizballah, as it has in previous years, according to its 
political needs.

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin and Amira </F>
Hess] 
  [Text] Defense establishment and IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] elements are concerned about the emerging cooperation 
between several Fatah Hawks squads, which have rebelled against 
the local Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas elements. 
  A report submitted by security elements indicates that Fatah 
Hawks squads were in touch with Hamas recently about possible 
cooperation, but no agreement was signed. 
  So far, Hamas has merely provided moral support to the 
insurgent Fatah Hawks squads, but it is believed that the two 
sides will initiate joint operations at a later stage. 
  The security elements' report states that 51 Fatah fugitives 
and activists have set up several squads and rebelled against 
the organization. The activists and the fugitives, including 
some who participated in attacks on Israelis, have acquired 
increasing power which rests mainly on support from accomplices. 
  The report further indicates that the PLO-Tunis leaders have 
lost control over the Fatah Hawks squads. Even more serious, 
according to the report, is the fact that the squads have 
rebelled against the young local leadership of the Gaza Strip 
Fatah organization. 
  It is believed that the local Fatah leadership in the Strip, 
headed by Sami Abu-Samahdanah, 'Iyad al-Ashqar, Dhiyab al-Lawh, 
and Sufiyan Abu-Zayida, is also unable to control the splinter 
squads. 
  The security report asserts that several elements within the 
PLO leadership in the Strip, including fugitives, have rejected 
the authority of Fatah because of its agreement to ban attacks 
following the signing of the declaration of principles on 13 
September. 
  The report says that Fatah members who have rejected the 
organization's authority are still carrying out attacks, and in 
recent weeks, they have been involved in attacks on IDF and 
security troops. It has been further learned that the local 
leadership is also worried about the emerging cooperation. 
  In view of the intensifying Fatah Hawks activities, the 
Jordanian branch of Hamas has issued an open statement 
encouraging the squads' work and even urging their expansion. 
  The defense establishment has decided to continue the 
manhunt 
for these fugitives despite their affiliation with Fatah and 
despite the agreement that Fatah members would no longer be 
classified as fugitives. 
  "The PLO leadership in Tunis, as well as the local 
leadership, realize that the IDF will continue hunting the 
fugitives, even if they continue to protest against this," a 
security figure has stated. 
  The report also refers to the local leadership's fear of a 
wave of purges liable to be launched because of the discord -- 
which has not yet developed into a physical confrontation -- 
between peace agreement supporters and those opponents who have 
left the organization. 
  In a leaflet disseminated yesterday in Gaza, the Fatah Hawks 
claim responsibility for the assassination of three 
collaborators over the past two weeks. A photocopy of the 
"license to carry arms and ammunition" belonging to one of the 
victims was attached to the leaflet. 
  The three dead men are Salah 'Ashur from Dayr al-Balah and 
Yusuf al-Salibi from Gaza, whose bodies were discovered last 
Monday, and Muhammad Shihadah, alias al-Qaqam, from Jabalyah, 
murdered 12 days ago. 
  The leaflet contends that activities against collaborators 
are coordinated between the leadership and the Hawks, although 
it implies a controversy over this matter between the Fatah 
"military branch" and the civilian leadership, which has 
reservations about the executions because of their detrimental 
impact on society. In the leaflet, the Hawks pledge to carry 
out every order of the Yasir 'Arafat-headed leadership, adding 
at the same time: "We announce that we will punish every 
traitor and collaborator." 
  The leaflet announces that the Hawks have interrogated 
'Ashur, "a collaborator since the 1970's and one of the most 
dangerous," warning other collaborators that 'Ashur divulged 
their names during his interrogation and that "the Fatah bullets 
are not far from them. We will soon meet." 
  The Hawks leaflet further claims that Shihadah was "a member 
of the undercover units."

  [Text] Tzomet Knesset members [MK's], Salmovitz, Goldfarb, 
and Segev have decided to suspend their decision to resign from 
Tzomet and have pulled back the letter of resignation they sent 
to the Knesset House Committee demanding to be recognized as a 
separate faction. 
  Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that 
MK's 
Salmovitz, Goldfarb, and Segev are now seeking to reconvene 
Tzomet's Central Committee within two weeks in order to discuss 
their demand that their allegations of financial mismanagement 
in the movement be investigated. The MK's said that if their 
suspicions prove true, they will demand that Tzomet Director 
General Doron Shmu'eli take a leave of absence until the 
investigation into the matter is concluded. 
  MK Ester Salmovitz, who is deputy speaker of the Knesset, 
explained that she and her two colleagues would retain their 
posts until the Central Committee convened. Our correspondent 
reports that Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan announced that he 
would reply to the three MK's request in several hours.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela'] </F>
  [Excerpts] The list of groups acting against the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement -- mainly out in the streets 
and against any peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors 
-- is bound to be very long. A notice announcing the 
establishment of a new, a hitherto unheard of group is daily 
placed in our mailboxes. Whatever their number, they represent 
an achievement scored by the settler lobby unified under the 
roof of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, 
and Gaza, or in short -- the YESHA' [acronym for Judaea, 
Samaria, Gaza] Council. [passage omitted] 
  The emergence of the various protest groups can be credited 
to a few enthusiasts from settlements, from Jerusalem, and from 
other locations throughout the country. The YESHA' Council is 
ostensibly uninvolved in their establishment, which is presented 
as a personal initiative motivated by anxiety for democracy and 
the Israeli nation's well-being. In practice, most groups are 
in one way or another linked to the YESHA' Council, which 
assists them in every way, including lobbying, telephone and fax 
facilities, and even through the services of their spokesmen. 
[passage omitted] 
  One of the most veteran organizations is the Action 
Committee 
for the Annulment of the Autonomy Plan, which is inspired by 
Elyaqim Ha'etzni. Ha'etzni explains that the somewhat obsolete 
name is due to the fact that the body was established back in 
the days when autonomy, and not self-rule, was on the agenda. 
"Later we were visited by this catastrophe, the new government, 
and today our main job is to try and save Eretz Yisra'el." 
  In brochures and flyers, Ha'etzni calls for civil mutiny. 
"Do not play according to the rules!" says his introduction to 
a leaflet, which is rife with quotations from Moshe Hanegbi, 
'Amos 'Oz, and Thomas Jefferson in support of illegal action for 
the sake of liberty. In Ha'etzni's understanding, the 
implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and Samaria is 
a violation of that liberty. "Signing such an agreement and 
sacrificing us all on the false altar of peace is an illegal 
act." 
  His leaflet speaks of "the insane government" "which 
endangers the life of every Jew from Holon to Hebron," whose 
leaders are as good as prostitutes. 
  Ha'etzni encloses a questionnaire to the leaflet asking the 
reader to fill it out and send back to the action committee. 
This is what the form says: "I, the undersigned, will not 
carry out a plainly illegal order. I will not uproot 
settlements." Ha'etzni does what Yesh Gvul [organization 
supporting soldiers' refusal to serve in territories] never 
dared: He openly calls on citizens to violate laws and disobey 
orders. 
  In the propaganda material he disseminates Ha'etzni explains 
how important it is to be arrested. "The stick of detention 
should not scare anyone," Ha'etzni told DAVAR. "We ought to 
take the Palestinians' place in prisons. When thousands of Jews 
are in jail, the government will fall." 
  Another body in the midst of hectic activity is This Is Our 
Land [Zo Artzeynu], the group which initiated the Hamakhpil 
[doubling] operation that aims to establish new 
quasi-settlements in the vicinity of existing ones independently 
and demonstratively, in full knowledge that the operation is 
illegal. The operation organizers have two addresses: Ginot 
Shomron and the state of New York, the United States. [passage 
omitted] 
  At first the YESHA' Council subscribed to the concept that 
new settlements should be established and the existing ones 
expanded without consulting the authorities. At some point, 
however, heads of the YESHA' local and regional councils 
concluded that the idea may elicit negative public reactions, 
and they decided to pull out. Today the YESHA' Council's 
official stand on this matter is that they are not partners in 
the endeavor, but will not take action against it. When 
necessary, they provide assistance, providing telephone services 
and any other required logistic facilities. 
  In the wake of this week's arrests, the YESHA' Council 
issued 
a public statement protesting the police commissioner's 
announcement about the plan to set up detention camps for 
settlers and criticizing the government "which releases 
Palestinian terrorists at the same time detaining good Jews." 
One of the publications of This Is Our Land notes that the 
organization supports the women's group headed by Rut Matar. 
  Women for the Sake of Tomorrow [Nashim Lema'an Hamahar], 
Matar's organization, also opposes the peace process and does 
not mince words describing its objection to the government's 
peace plan. "Peres and 'Arafat have reached an agreement in 
Switzerland, in other words: The terrorist Palestinian state is 
in the making," their press communique says, urging reporters to 
come and cover their rally near the Jerusalem-Jericho road in 
Ma'ale Adumim last Tuesday. "This road will be the main road 
from Jerusalem to the terrorist state. Any Jew daring to take 
this road will be jeopardizing his life," the statement adds. 
[passage omitted] 
  This week we received propaganda material from the Public 
Committee for the Protection of Ma'ale Adumim. This week, a 
hostile rally welcomed Police Minister Moshe Shahal as he 
arrived to inaugurate the first Civil Guard station in the 
territories. "In Jericho the government plans to arm 3,000 
terrorists, and in Ma'ale Adumim it establishes a Civil Guard 
station with 30 soldiers," their leaflet states. There are no 
soldiers in the Civil Guard, only civilians. "The Ma'ale Adumim 
kindergartens are against the Gaza and Jericho agreement," says 
another leaflet. One activist with the group believes the 
possibility of handing Judaea and Samaria over to Palestinian 
rule undemocratic. "A free regime has no right to uproot a 
settlement and assail citizens rights, even if they are an 
unpopular minority." 
  The group works in coordination with, and is sometimes 
financed by the YESHA' Council, and is closely associated with 
This Is Our Land. 
  Newspapers occasionally carry advertisements placed by 
various groups denouncing the government's peace plan, and each 
of these groups is confident that its way is the right one: 
Professors for Political and Economic Strength; Army officers 
join forces in the Awakening and National Strength Forum. The 
executive committee of the Knesset opposition came out with the 
slogan -- the Eretz Yisra'el Front, while the Endeavor 
[Ma'amatz] Action Committee, headed by Ya'aqov Novik and Ya'aqov 
Sternberg invests daily efforts and complicated logistics in 
organizing rallies, transportation, and other necessary steps. 
Their activities are centered mainly in Jerusalem. 
  Bney 'Aqiva [youth movement affiliated with the National 
Religious Party], and the 'Ezra and Habad movements are willing 
to supply anyone with masses of youths for rallies, sometimes 
for the purpose of collecting donations. 
  The activity is initiated by West Bank settlers and 
Jerusalem-based activists ideologically related to the tenets of 
Gush Emunim. Their primary goal is to foil the peace agreement 
with the Palestinians. The protest activities against 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights have become a part of the 
greater drive, and today it is sometimes difficult to tell the 
issues apart. This did not happen by accident. The first 
stimulus for demonstrating against withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights came from West Bank settlers, who organized and prodded 
the Golan activists to rally against the peace agreement. In 
these groups, activists speak in the same breath of the West 
Bank and the Golan Heights, brewing a sentimental concoction of 
arguments about the nature of Israel's ties and problems with 
the Palestinians on the one hand and with Syria on the other. 
  Others view the Golan Heights as a separate issue while 
emphasizing that they do not oppose the government policy, that 
they are only against giving up the Golan. 
  The slogan "People With the Golan" pasted on thousands of 
verandas was the work of the Golan Action Committees [Matot 
Hagolan]. A prominent activist based in Jerusalem, a sort of an 
aficionado, says that since the movement is scattered throughout 
the country, all the work in done by volunteers and with modest 
donations, "because the problem is not just of the Golan 
settlers. The entire nation should decide this vital issue of 
the Golan. There is no right or left in this matter." 
  Setting up signing-up stands throughout the country, 
activists expand their enterprise by enlisting new activists. 
They claim to be unrelated to the YESHA' Council or the Golan 
Settlement Committee headed by Eli Malka. 
  In all these fields, the YESHA' Council operates behind the 
scenes. On the one hand, its activists are pleased with the 
voluntary operations conducted in various locations. Their work 
is done by others. On the other hand, it does not want to lose 
control. For that reason, it has established a superstructure 
named the Joint Action Committee [Hamate Hameshutaf]. A Tel 
Aviv office organizing rallies throughout the country is 
financed by YESHA', according to the secretary who took our 
phone call. Meetings at which short- and long-term activities 
are coordinated are held periodically at the council offices. 
All the groups receive assistance from the YESHA' Council: 
telephone and fax facilities, spokesman's services, and 
probably funds too. 
  As if the number of organizations and names was 
insufficient, 
they established One Israel [Yisra'el Ahat], a body defined as 
the operational headquarters of the Joint Action Committee. It 
is headed by Moshe Merhavya, a resident of 'Eli who had worked 
for Minister Ari'el Sharon at the Construction and Housing 
Ministry and is credited with having obtained the authorities' 
approval for so many new houses in the settlement of 'Eli in 
recent years. 
  Yesterday's demonstration in the ancient synagogue of 
Jericho, for instance, had been planned in Knesset Member [MK] 
Hanan Porat's office at the Knesset last week. The meeting was 
attended by Uri Ari'el, chairman of the YESHA' Council, by Moshe 
Merhavya, and a representative of the Endeavor Action Committee. 
People want to stand by MK Porat's side and show the Jericho 
synagogue students that they are not being abandoned, YESHA' 
Council members said and proceeded to help print notices about 
transportation to the rally.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "A Creeping Putsch?"] </F>
  [Text] Israel is more or less divided in two: tall people 
and short people, fat people and thin people, and Rabin's men 
and Peres' men. Under this division, politicians have been 
dragging the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to a place where it 
does not belong: the arduous road of internal political 
struggle. 
  The question is not what is the professional opinion voiced 
by the chief of staff and his subordinates in internal forums 
discussing the peace process but who is leaking the chief of 
staff's views and for what purpose. Last Friday, YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT -- which, according to the aforementioned division, 
gets its leaks from the tall people -- carried a front-page 
report that "the chief of staff is trying to create a crisis 
with 'Arafat." Five days have gone by, and we have not heard of 
the IDF spokesman issuing any denial. To make sure, I 
officially approached the spokesman and asked him whether he 
could deny the report, which I consider serious. After all, it 
is not every day that a chief of staff plans to sabotage a move 
decided upon by the government. The spokesman said he did not 
participate in the meeting and, consequently, could not issue a 
denial. 
  I pursued my inquiries with a higher level and found that 
there are no plans to issue a denial. I was told: "We do not 
deny every report appearing in the press." Although this 
refusal in no way constitutes confirmation of the report, I got 
the impression that the Army top brass is not really sorry that 
its reservations about the Davos understandings are getting so 
much publicity. One need not be an erudite political 
commentator to realize that the chief of staff -- and definitely 
the prime minister -- are not averse to the leaks. 
  The wave of reports about the Army's reservations has a 
purpose: to rein Shim'on Peres in. "There is a man who is very 
displeased with the rapid progress in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians, and he systematically leaks information against 
the agreement," says a man close to the foreign minister -- and 
we can only guess who he is referring to. Others look for the 
psychological angle. They think that to this day, the chief of 
staff has been unable to forget that he was not let in on the 
Oslo agreement. He has been very critical of the loopholes in 
the agreement and now wants to approve every comma and period. 
Into his fourth year as chief of staff and in view of his 
ambition to have a far-reaching political career, Baraq cannot 
afford to fail in the implementation of the agreement on Gaza 
and Jericho, those people say. 
  The chief of staff, however, is not the main protagonist in 
the affair of the Army's public involvement. The main 
protagonist is the defense minister, who is disturbed by Peres' 
hyperactivity. 
  In the meeting of the "peace team forum" held on the morning 
of 27 January (attended by Rabin, Peres, Baraq, Shahaq, Dayan, 
Sagi, Haber, Yatom, the head of the Shin Bet, and three senior 
Foreign Ministry officials), Peres found himself in the minority 
in the face of the criticism of the Army top brass. From that 
day on, but mainly after Peres and 'Arafat were seen holding 
hands and bursting with joy, there have been systematic leaks 
about the Army's opposition to the Davos agreement, including 
reports about this confidential meeting. Indeed, the signing in 
Davos was torpedoed successfully. Peres was forced to travel to 
Cairo with new demands. 
  The General Staff's reservations may or may not be relevant, 
but that is not the point. The point is the way in which the 
IDF was ushered into the political decisionmaking process. 
Rabin's dominance as prime minister and defense minister, 
coupled with his disregard for his cabinet ministers and his 
suspicion of Peres, created a situation where Ehud Baraq became 
his confidant and his close adviser. The inner cabinet has been 
replaced by a group of senior officers trusted by Rabin and 
Baraq. And, somehow, the fine line dividing the executive 
branch from the elected level has been blurred. Suddenly we 
find Army officers negotiating peace or sitting on either side 
of Rabin in meetings with statesmen. Thus the Army finds itself 
siding with one minister against another and involved in 
decisions that are the exclusive prerogative of the elected 
level. 
  A military putsch, if you forgive my expression, comes in 
many forms. It does not necessarily entail usurping a 
legitimate government by force. Excessive involvement of the 
army in government bodies, even if solicited by the highest 
level, is a type of putsch. Perhaps a creeping putsch. Those 
who want to uphold checks and balances, the separation of 
powers, and the subordination of civil servants to elected 
officials should put the Army back where it belongs as an 
apolitical entity.

  [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had a short 
meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman in Jerusalem today. 
But before the meeting with the Israeli president, he [Klaus] 
had talks with Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the right-wing 
opposition Likud bloc, who is a staunch opponent of the present 
Israeli Government's policy on Palestinians. 
  Talks between President Weizman and Vaclav Klaus centered 
mainly on the general situation in the Middle East while Klaus' 
discussions with Binyamin Netanyahu concentrated on the level of 
privatization in both countries and on economic reform in the 
Czech Republic. 
  Prime Minister Klaus commented to Czech radio on his talks 
[with Netanyahu]. 
  [Begin Klaus recording] This is a political party that puts 
emphasis on similar principles as the political party [Civic 
Democratic Party], which I lead, and [on similar principles] as 
the government coalition that rules in the Czech Republic. We, 
therefore, preferred to talk about our views on civic, social, 
political, and economic matters. The Middle East issue or the 
question of Palestine did not dominate our discussions. [passage 
omitted] It is absolutely evident that the Czech Republic is, 
in these areas [of privatization], the country with a greater 
private sector, the country with a lesser tax burden, the 
country with less regulatory measures and state intervention in 
the economy. These were matters the Israeli party was 
exceedingly interested in. [end recording]

  [Text] In Jerusalem today, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin signed a joint 
statement on the promotion of economic relations between Israel 
and the Czech Republic. According to Prime Minister Klaus, the 
document carries a decision on immediate preparation for a 
further step toward the liberalization of bilateral trade. This 
step should result in an agreement on a free-trade zone between 
the Czech Republic and Israel in the very near future. 
  At the same time, the Czech Republic and Israel have 
succeeded in concluding the two-year long discussion on the text 
of the bilateral agreement on the protection of investment and 
on profit repatriation. At a news conference, Prime Minister 
Klaus returned to the possibility of Czech arms exports to the 
so-called sensitive countries. He repeated that arms exports 
were carried out on the basis of a government license and in 
line with the law.

  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Iranian Ambassador in Beirut 
Homayun 'Alizadeh has criticized the "suspect media campaigns 
against the Islamic Republic, exaggeration of small matters, and 
attempts to cast doubt on the Iranian economy." 
  Addressing a speech rally held in Beirut yesterday to mark 
the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution in 
Iran, he referred to "imperialist moves to undermine the 
nation's steadfastness and force it to follow a new plan 
intended for the region." 
  He enumerated "the Islamic Republic's achievements," noting 
that "it was able to increase the local product by 7.7 percent, 
while the average local product increase last year did not 
exceed 2 percent." He pointed out that the aim of "the 
imperialist campaign is to undermine Iran's stability and 
security through groups linked to it." 
  Shaykh Na'im Qasim, Hizballah's deputy secretary general, 
spoke on the occasion and attacked the Lebanese Government, 
saying "we have seen nothing from it except harm to its people 
and to all Lebanon." He spoke of "the government's suppression 
of the press and the media because they talk about the head of 
that government or some of its members."

  [Excerpt] Marj 'Uyun, Lebanon, Feb 7 (AFP) -- [Passage 
omitted] A spokesman for the Islamic Resistance, Hizballah's 
armed wing, told AFP in Beirut that its guerrillas destroyed an 
Israeli Merkava tank, killing or wounding an unspecified number 
of Israeli soldiers. 
  Israeli warplanes later raided Hizballah strongholds near 
the 
south Lebanon port city of Sidon. 
  Two Israeli fighter bombers swooped over the Jabal al-Safi 
hills southeast of Sidon, firing several missiles at Hizballah 
positions, while a second wave of attacks targeted the nearby 
village of al-Luwayzah, Lebanese police said. 
  Three Israeli Cobra helicopters strafed the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
ridge, where Hizballah has hideouts dug into rock. 
  The guerrillas launched three surface-to-air SAM-7 missiles 
at the helicopters but missed. 
  Israeli gunners fired around 150 shells on the Iqlim 
al-Tuffah and the southern district of the eastern al-Biqa' 
Valley while Hizballah fired around 40 Katyusha rockets into the 
security zone, security sources said. 
  One of the rockets hit a home, near the barracks of the 
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia in Marj 'Uyun, 
wounding a woman and her four children, hospital officials said. 
  The guerrillas also carried out two other bomb attacks on 
patrols from the Israeli army and its proxy South Lebanon Army 
militia (SLA), apparently causing no casualties. 
  A 10-year-old child was killed meanwhile and three were hurt 
in a landmine blast near the southern port of Tyre, UN 
peacekeepers said. It was not clear if the mine was left over 
from Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon or if it had been sown 
recently. 
  Israeli army deputy chief-of-staff Amnon Shahaq warned last 
month that the Israeli army is "facing a real war" in south 
Lebanon against Hizballah. 
  Last year, 26 Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes in 
south Lebanon, compared with 13 in 1992, according to an Israeli 
army report. 
  Hizballah, which is staunchly opposed to Arab-Israeli peace 
talks, is the only militia which has not been disarmed by the 
Lebanese authorities since the end of the 15-year war in 1990. 
  It is spearheading anti-Israeli attacks, which eased in the 
run up to the January 16 Geneva summit between Syrian President 
Hafiz al-'Asad and US President Bill Clinton. 
  There have been 20 attacks since.

  [Excerpt] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- High-level 
diplomatic sources yesterday revealed the success of U.S. 
attempts to "persuade" Ukraine to withdraw an offer to sell Iran 
$1.2 billion worth of modern weapons. 
  Ukraine made this offer to Iran in November within the 
framework of a world Ukranian effort to find new oil supplies to 
replace what it used to import from its neighbor, Russia. 
  The sources pointed out that the question was raised during 
the meeting held last month in Kiev between U.S. President Bill

  [Text] According to reports received, even though a few 
days have elapsed since the massive demonstrations by the people 
of Zahedan against the clerical government, the situation in 
that city remains tense. The regime's guards and agents have 
arrested a large number of the city's residents, especially 
youths, in fear of more riots erupting, and this has further 
heightened the Zahedan people's anger at Khomeyni's regime. 
  The valiant people of Zahedan and the families of the 
martyrs 
of the latest demonstrations in that city have forced the 
Khomeyni regime to hand over the bodies of three of the martyrs 
of those demonstrations. The regime's officials -- terrified at 
the Zahedan people's reaction at the last rites of the martyrs 
of the heroic demonstrations, which would fan their fury and 
hatred -- had refrained from handing over the bodies. 
  In the course of the heroic uprising by the people of 
Zahedan, in addition to some being martyred, thirty people were 
also wounded. Some of the regime's guards and agents were also 
killed by the people. 
  Following the large-scale demonstrations by the people of 
Zahedan and the attack on Hashemi-Rafsanjani, which has plunged 
the entire regime in fear, Khamene'i issued a decree appointing 
Besharati, a (?member) of the shah's SAVAK and the current 
interior minister, as his replacement in the law enforcement 
forces for the next three years. [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tension Dominates Zahedan Following </F>
Armed Confrontations; Security Forces Search Houses To Arrest 
Those Opposed to Mullah"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Iranian 
Revolution Guard Corps yesterday reopened the airport in 
Zahedan, provincial capital of the southeastern region of the 
country -- which allowed two planes carrying the full capacity 
to head for Tehran. 
  The airport was closed to air traffic last Tuesday when 
disturbances swept the city and then worsened later, developing 
into armed confrontations between security forces and armed 
elements opposed to the government. 
  Eyewitnesses arriving from the city yesterday have said that 
the situation there is still tense and that security forces 
continue to search houses and buildings there. 
  It has been reported that security forces have arrested 
scores of people and moved some of them to Tehran. A committee 
comprised of three mullah arrived in Zahedan yesterday. It is 
sent by the "Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i to hold negotiations 
with Sunni leaders in the city in connection with the people's 
complaints. It is worth noting that the Sunni represent over 80 
percent of the city's population. The authorities believe that 
maybe this reality was one of the factors behind the uprising 
against the Shiite mullahs' regime in Tehran. 
  However, Sunni leaders in the city have urged the city's 
inhabitants to remain calm, refuting the reports that the 
disturbances are linked to religious questions. Nevertheless, 
they have not yet announced their agreement to talk to the 
mullahs sent by Khamene'i from Tehran. 
  Eyewitnesses say that organized groups of young men spread 
in 
the main street in the city last Tuesday and began to overturn 
government vehicles and set government building ablaze, burning 
portraits of Khomeyni and other mullahs of the regime. A crowd 
of the city's residents chanted when the young men began to burn 
the Khomeyni flag which replaced the historic Iranian flag in 
1979. 
  It has not yet been determined who was first to open fire, 
hence turning the peaceful demonstrations into violent 
incidents. However, individuals from the Baluchi tribes, which 
form much of the population in Zahedan, are usually armed to the 
teeth. 
  Local police, who are limited in number, did not make any 
attempt to control demonstrators. At any rate, the regular 
police are the object of the mullah regime's suspicion, as their 
political allegiance is suspect. 
  The demonstrators, who were angered by the opening of fire 
on 
them, tried to seize the local government's premises, but were 
forced to retreat after the guards opened fire on them. Two 
people were killed in the incident. An hour later the first 
Revolutionary Guard battalion arrived to scene aboard a 
helicopter from the nearby town of Khash. An armed 
confrontation erupted immediately between members of this 
battalion and unknown gunmen who tried to seize the radio 
station. Two members of the Guards were killed in the clash. 
  The "Revolutionary Guards" succeeded in evacuating 
government 
officials and a number of mullahs who had sought shelter in the 
governor's residence in the city. Further violent actions 
occurred in the afternoon of the same day when a group of 
Shiites were brought to the area by government trucks from the 
nearby Bazman area to -- so it seemed -- intimidate the 
demonstrators. But the Bazman group, led by two government 
mullahs, had to retreat after a brief confrontation with the 
Sunni demonstrators. 
  Eyewitnesses say that at least 50 people were wounded, and 
that 23 of them are still receiving treatment in local hospitals.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 7, IRNA -- Iran's Information 
[Intelligence and Security] Minister Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali 
Fallahian in an interview with HAMSHAHRI daily said here today 
that Kurosh Nik Akhtar who tried to assassinate President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani on the first of February was a member of a 
clandestine terrorist group. 
  "In addtition to arresting Kurosh Nik Akhtar, who was 
apprehended because of the full awareness and prompt action of 
our courageous people on the first of February, a large network 
of his accomplices and cohorts have been identified," Fallahian 
said. 
  According to the minister over 20 persons who have been part 
of this network have been arrested so far. 
  The minister added that Nik Akhtar had changed his name from 
Kamareh'ee [name as received] and that the investigations had 
revealed that he and his accomplices had organized a meeting on 
the night prior to the assassination attempt to fully discuss 
the details of the plan to assassinate Iran's fourth president. 
  After the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in the 
February of 1979, the Islamic Republic was established. 
Mohammad 'Ali Raja'i, the second president in the history of 
this nascent republic, was killed along with Prime Minister, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Javad Bahonar, by a bomb that was 
planted in their office by a terrrorist MKO member. Terrorist 
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), a group sponsored by 
Saddam Hussayn, also targeted Iran's third president, Ayatollah 
Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, now the supreme leader of the Islamic 
revolution. During his term as the president Ayatollah 
Khamene'i was injured while addressing a crowd at a mosque. 
  President Rafsanjani, the fourth president of the Islamic 
republic who won his second term in the office by a landslide, 
was the target of a failed assassination attempt by forghan 
group in 1979, a group responsible for the death of many of the 
ideologues of the Islamic revolution such as the late Ayatollah 
Morteza Mottahari. 
  President Rafsanjani in an interview with Tehran radio after 
the assassination attempt said that he did not recognize at 
first what was going on, mistaking the gun shots for the 
explosion of a light bulb in the mausoleum of the late Imam 
Khomeyni.

  [Text] The intelligence and security Minister 'Ali 
Fallahian, in an interview with our reporter today, revealed new 
details of the assassination plot on the president's life. 
  Giving some examples of the conspiracies hatched by global 
arrogance in various dimensions this year, Mr. Fallahian said: 
On the security dimension alone, during the current year 
[ending 20 March 94] the mercenaries of foreign powers smuggled 
about 24 bombs into the country. But thanks to the vigilance of 
the hidden imam's unknown soldiers, 20 of these bombs were 
discovered and 16 people were arrested. Unfortunately, four of 
the said bombs exploded. 
  He added: During the current year, the country's security 
and 
intelligence organs have arrested about 40 spies, who have had 
links with Iraq. 
  Referring to the important role played by the president to 
advance the objectives of the Islamic revolution, the 
intelligence minister said: When the main elements responsible 
for the plot to assassinate the president were arrested it 
became clear that they are individuals with notorious records, 
low belief or no belief at all, low morals, and corrupt. Some 
of them have were affiliated with mini-groups [reference to 
opposition groups]. 
  He went on: Among those arrested is an individual who has 
had 
links with some foreign embassies.

  [Text] By closing about 840 km of the country's eastern 
borders against the smugglers, routes used by the drug 
trafficking convoys from the borders into the country are 
blocked. 
  Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, in an interview 
with our correspondent, also said: The task of closing the 
borders in the vulnerable areas began from four months ago. The 
job was completed by digging canals of four meters deep and four 
meters wide, erection of many watch towers, and planting of 
mines along the routes used by the drug trafficking convoys. At 
present there is no possibility of such convoys finding their 
way into the country. 
  About the recent disturbances in Zahedan, which took place 
with provocation of the drug traffickers, the interior minister 
praised the Muslim and revolutionary people of Zahedan for 
staging a rally on Sunday to condemn the action of these 
saboteurs. He said: The Shiite and Sunni brothers and sisters, 
by staging a march in Zahedan to protest against the drug 
traffickers, have once again demonstrated their support for the 
Islamic revolution, the esteemed leader, and the president, and 
they have terminated all the conspiracies spread by internal and 
foreign enemies.

Bosnia-Herzegovina are now exposed to one of the worst 
atrocities in history of mankind while many countries and 
international organizations look on indifferently. 
  The president lauded Bosnian Muslims for their bravery and 
heroic resistance, hoping that the Muslim people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would succeed in their jihad (holy struggle) 
to preserve their indentity. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani made the remarks in a meeting with 
foreign 
and Iranian artists participating in the international film, 
theater and music festivals here on the occasion of the 15th 
anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution. 
  "The presence of Bosnian artists here will reflect the 
courageous spirit and resistance of the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the world," he added. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Jihad and the propagation of 
virtue and prohibition of vice are designed to reform society. 
Of course, reform of the individual man is the reform of 
society but these things go in steps. Usually not all members 
of a society are mature and pious. That would be an ideal 
society. But maybe it is not our destiny to have such a 
society. Even according to our religious documents there will 
be wicked elements during the rule of the imam of time. Even 
in a revolutionary society, even in a pious society, even in a 
society where the majority of people are pious, jihad and the 
propagation of virtue and prohibition of vice must continue to 
exist. Domestically, public supervision which is the propagation 
of virtue and prohibition of vice is constructive, while jihad 
has greater meaning in facing foreign wickedness. Every society 
faces threats domestically and from outside. Today has been 
named the day of prayer after the factors that will guard the 
revolution. They will strengthen the very factors that brought 
about the revolution. Prayers are a necessity for humans; 
without praying, remembering God, and paying attention to 
spirituality, and without analyzing one's own actions, there 
will be no development of human character. Brothers and sisters, 
pay attention to your prayers. [passage omitted] 
  The Koran has always emphasized that we must look at both 
sides: the material and the spiritual. Our imams have said that 
those who forget either the material or the spiritual are not 
one of us. Extremism is condemned whichever way it may go. If 
we do not pray, fast, read the Koran, visit the shrines, or go 
on the hajj, and if we think that worshipping of the divine is 
limited to serving the people -- even if we spend all our life 
serving the people -- but fail to pay attention to spiritual 
matters, we will move toward destruction. But also if we think 
to the contrary and believe that the material life should be 
abandoned, then our society will be poor, we will be poor, the 
enemy will overcome us, we shall fall from honor, we will fall 
prey to the enemy, and we will be in chains. It is necessary to 
maintain interest in both. 
  The jihad for the propagation of virtue and prohibition of 
vice is an issue of public supervision. We should be like 
mirrors to each other, reminding others -- according to 
religious laws -- of their weaknesses, and in order to show the 
wrong and the right path. We should look after each other. This 
is the essence of piety. These are the manifestations of a pious 
society. Those who think that it is possible to have a 
prosperous society without these spiritual elements are wrong. 
  What better evidence than the situation in the advanced 
western countries? The condition that they face, their spirit 
of aggression, their selfishness, and the great and dangerous 
injustice that prevails in the world, are all due to the fact 
that spiritual matters are not taken into account. Things that 
you now see in Bosnia and things that are happening in the 
Balkans are the best evidence for the brutality of arrogant 
powers. Over there there is great injustice and great 
treachery. The latest unfortunate event is that the Croatian 
Government's military force which was earlier the target of 
aggression and had thousands of men killed fighting against the 
Serbs, has now crossed the borders and is attacking the innocent 
Bosnian Muslim people, who are being attacked by the Serbs at 
the same time. The world has yet not taken a correct step in 
this case, although the Security Council has issued a warning 
and given a two-week deadline for sanctions. We expected the 
Security Council to take a serious view of this. It would be a 
terrible precedent for a neighboring country officially and 
militarily to er another country which is facing a so-called 
civil war, and in order to support a group of people who are of 
the same race -- and to massacre an innocent people in such way. 
God willing, at least the neighboring countries and the 
effective powers of the Security Council will remain vigilant 
and will not tolerate this disgusting new suppression. 
  In today's Friday prayers we have some dear Muslim guests 
from the friendly Muslim country of Brunei. The sultan and his 
entourage are participating in our prayer ceremony. The fact 
that a national leader, despite his usual program when visiting 
another country, should remember the Friday prayers is a source 
of great satisfaction. They have come to the prayers and we 
welcome them and thank them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Meshkini, member </F>
of the Assembly of Experts and senior lecturer at the Qom 
theological school, on 4 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] You should be somewhat 
patient. You should wait for a while. You have done something 
great. Your revolution is great. It has had many difficulties. 
You should know that with all these high prices and all these 
problems... [pauses] You will forgive me for taking so long to 
speak, but I am constantly unhappy about this issue, these high 
prices and problems. I should even tell you this: in the 
meeting that members of the Assembly of Experts had with the 
leader, despite the fact that it was not the place for such 
discussions and the issue did not concern the experts, it was 
put to their excellencies, the leader and the president as 
follows: Sir, you who are the first person of the country, and 
Sir, you who are the second person of the country -- both of you 
are present -- and we, members of the Assembly of Experts have a 
different task. But, we put forward this issue: the nation is 
unhappy with high prices, inflation, and some other matters. Be 
kind enough to think more of the nation. 
  This was discussed in that meeting and this is what the 
leader said in response: There has been no occasion in which I 
have gotten together with the president, two of us or more, and 
not discussed the issue of high prices, inflation, and people's 
problems. 
  You people should not worry. It is natural for such problems 
to exist. The hope is that the country's infrastructure has 
been well built, the result of which we will soon see. Be 
patient and, God willing, you shall receive both the goodness of 
the world as well as the hereafter. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Representatives of the Supreme Council for 
Coordinating the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan [Shura-ye 
Ali-ye Hamahangi-ye Enqelab-e Eslami-ye Afghanistan] met Foreign 
Minister Velayati in Tehran on Monday and discussed the latest 
developments in Afghanistan. 
  At the meeting, thanking Iran for her fundamental and wise 
policies on Afghanistan, the Afghan delegation said it was a 
good example of good-neighborly relations. 
  Referring to the latest developments in Afghanistan, they 
asked Iran to continue her efforts toward the establishment of 
peace in Afghanistan. 
  Referring to the fact that Iran's ambassador would remain in 
Kabul, our country's foreign minister said: This shows Iran's 
special attention to the events in Afghanistan. 
  Expressing regret about the continuation of fratricide in 
Afghanistan, Velayati said: Iran was considered one of the main 
supporters of our combative Afghan brothers during the war with 
foreign occupiers, and after the liberation of Afghanistan she 
began extensive efforts to halt the civil war there. 
  He added: Iran would seriously support any proposal by the 
warring groups that would end the war and bloodshed in 
Afghanistan and bring about a fair and honorable peace.

visit to Azerbaijan is to follow up the process of implementing 
the bilateral memoranda of understanding.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 7, IRNA -- The Islamic Republilc of 
Iran has never delivered any weaponry for supporters of General 
Farah Aidid of Somalia, an informed source at the Defence 
Ministry said here today. 
  The source said circulation of such unfounded news is in 
line 
with sinister plots aimed at distorting the image of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in the world. 
  A former commander of the U.S-led multinational forces in 
Somalia had claimed last Saturday that Aidid supporters receive 
arms from Iran, Sudan and Iraq. 
  The source also denied claimes by an Arabic weekly that Iran 
held clandestine talks with the Czech Republic for the purchase 
of Russian weapons.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] The Zionist regime has admitted that the bold attack 
by Lebanon's Islamic Resistance mujahidin against Israeli 
military patrols in the occupied area in south Lebanon killed 
four Zionists and wounded two. 
  Although in such cases, the Zionist regime, which is 
helpless 
when it comes to such operations by the Muslim revolutionaries, 
always resorts to blind attacks on residential areas and finds 
many innocent Lebanese people rolling in blood, the continuation 
of the anti-Zionist resistance is of extreme political 
significance. Overtly colluding with the United States during 
the past two years, the Zionist regime has tried to make it look 
as if it seeks peace and attempted to hide its aggressive nature 
by participating in the so-called peace conference and by 
propagating false slogans. But the continuing operations by the 
Islamic Resistance mojahidin thwart much of this effort by 
Israel and clarify that the Zionist regime continues to occupy 
part of Lebanon and some other Arab countries and that it also 
extensively violates international regulations. 
  The operations by Lebanon's Muslim mujahidin against the 
Zionist occupiers also clarify another reality: Contrary to what 
the heads of some Arab states claim, Tel Aviv is vulnerable. 
Justifying their participation in the compromising talks with 
Israel in Washington, the Arab governments always speak of 
upsetting the Middle East's military balance in Israel's favor. 
But if this is true, then the operations by the Lebanese Muslim 
mujahidin show that having faith in the struggle against this 
usurping regime can alter the material and power balance to a 
large extent.

<F P=106> [Article by Khayrallah Khayrallah: "Iran Is Changing"] </F>
  [Text] As the peace process galvanizes the people of the 
Middle East and grips their attention, some extremely important 
matters sometimes disappear from the general picture, like what 
is happening in Iran. Is Iran still the same power trying to 
export its revolution or has the regime there now shifted to the 
phase of defending its own existence, and is that now its sole 
preoccupation? 
  It is clear that the Iran we knew at the time of the war 
with 
Iraq in the eighties is not the same as the Iran of today, whose 
revolution is now entering its 16th year trying to find a new 
and more pragmatic path. The daily facts of life, especially 
oil prices, dictate above all that there should be a search for 
new policies that would negate past policies without announcing 
it. For how is one to interpret the fact that in Lebanon, 
through its tools there, Iran appears to be most extremist about 
Israel but in the Gulf it establishes the best relations with 
Qatar, the country which has gone further than other Arab states 
in the region in responding to the peace process and whose prime 
minister met with the Israeli foreign minister twice, and the 
country which had expressed willingness to host one session of 
the multilateral negotiations, which would mean the arrival of 
an official Israeli delegation in Doha? 
  Qatar, of course, is free to follow any policy it likes, 
particularly as it is a sovereign state that knows its own 
interests. It is worth noting that Iran's upstaging stops at 
certain limits. Where the upstaging game benefits Tehran in 
defending the regime's past slogans and where such slogans are 
still alive, Tehran pursues that same policy as in Lebanon, but 
where appeasement appears to be desirable, such slogans 
disappear, as in the case of Qatar for instance. 
  It is true that the internal political polarizations 
sometimes make it necessary for Iranian politicians to continue 
to play that game even though it has proved to be very harmful 
to a country such as Lebanon, but it is also true that the 
changes taking place in Iran are now apparent to everyone. The 
evidence can be seen in the fact that Syria is engaging in the 
peace process without any consideration for the Iranian 
position. Even some of the Lebanese forces which had more than 
good links with Tehran are beginning to try to emphasize that 
there is some distance between them and Iranian policies and 
that their policies are Lebanese before being Iranian. 
  What is taking place in Iran is seen as part of the changes 
occurring in the region, radical changes that made the sight of 
Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat holding hands look quite 
ordinary as if they have been friends for decades. It remains 
to say that knowledge of what is going on calls for a minimum 
degree of thinking about the new picture emerging in the region 
and the willingness to acclimatize with reality and stop 
condemning every new element that appears in the picture. Even 
Iran is changing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] On 5 February, the foreign ministers of Iran, 
Turkey, and Syria met in Istanbul, allegedly to study the 
situation in Iraq again. This was the fourth tripartite session 
in this connection. 
  It is surprising that the three countries should decide to 
hold such sessions to examine the situation in Iraq and to 
express their concern over the [word indistinct] there, when 
they are not ready to allow an Iraqi Government representative 
or representatives of the Iraqi opposition or Iraqi Kurds to 
attend these sessions. 
  Apparently, the objective behind the tripartite session of 
the Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian foreign ministers is to examine 
the possibility of reaching a common stance on a possible 
dismemberment of Iraq. For some time, these three countries 
have been paying lip service to safeguarding Iraq's territorial 
integrity and shed crocodile tears for it without having 
specific proof that Iraq is being dismembered. This, when both 
Iran and Turkey still covet part of Iraqi territory and 
sometimes repeat their territorial claims on part of it. 
  But the three countries have not been plunged into concern 
and fear out of the threat of Iraq's dismemberment. The concern 
and fear stem from the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the 
intensification of the justice seeking struggle of the Kurdish 
people elsewhere in Kurdistan. The three countries do not 
consider the intensification of national and freedom seeking 
beliefs and the consolidation of national feeling among the 
Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian Kurds to come within the framework 
of the growing world trend that seeks democracy, but try to 
portray that all this stems from the situation in Iraqi 
Kurdistan. Thus, the Kurdish problem in general and the 
situation in Iraqi Kurdistan in particular are portrayed as an 
important and common problem for these three countries. 
  Iran, Turkey, and Syria rule over part of Kurdish territory 
and the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan are striving to 
achieve their national and just rights. The three countries 
that control part of the Kurdish territory do not favor the 
fulfillment of the Kurdish people's aspirations and objectives 
in each part of Kurdistan. You can see clearly how the [words 
indistinct] allegedly shedding tears for Iraq's unity and 
integrity stem from the growing trend of the Kurdish people's 
freedom seeking movement. 
  The Islamic Republic, which has been [words indistinct] and 
suppressing the Kurdish people for over 15 years [words 
indistinct] for the Iraqi Kurds. In relation with this, Tehran 
scorns the Turkish Government for allowing the United States and 
its allies to use Turkish bases to support Iraqi Kurds. The 
Turkish Government, which for years has denied the existence of 
several million Kurds in eastern Turkey and has had to admit 
this existence because of domestic problems on the one hand and 
the West's public opinion on the other, has taken no serious 
step to ensure the national and political rights of the Kurds in 
Turkey. And finally, not only is Syria refraining from granting 
the just rights of the Syrian Kurds, but it is also trying to 
annihilate their national identity. It has always pursued the 
policy of crushing and decimating the Kurds. 
  Thus, the historic enmity of Iran, Turkey, and Syria toward 
the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan leaves no doubt that the 
various sessions among the three countries' foreign ministers 
are not meetings to exchange views on the general situation in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, but an effort for more cooperation in their 
opposition and hostility to the formation of a Kurdish country 
within the framework of Iraq and an effort to find ways to 
suppress the Kurdish people elsewhere in Kurdistan. 
  In the current situation--in which the world's support for 
the Kurdish people can (?prevent) these three countries from 
showing more (?hostility) against the Kurdish movement in the 
various parts of Kurdistan--the [word indistinct] of the Kurdish 
people throughout Kurdistan to uncover behind the scene 
agreements and plots being hatched by these three countries is 
very opportune. In addition to these agreements, the regimes of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey are implementing a 
special joint agreement. Also, Iran, Turkey, and Syria have 
decided to continue their sessions and their plotting against 
the Kurdish people in future. 
  Undoubtedly, any joint effort by these three to crush the 
Kurdish people will meet strong reaction worldwide, including 
among the supporters of the Kurdish people. These three 
countries should understand that suppressing and plotting 
against the Kurdish people cannot solve the Kurdish problem. 
Experience has proven this. [Word indistinct], in addition to 
dozens of domestic problems, these three governments are united 
as far as machinations against the Kurdish people go. There are 
many signs, particularly those seen recently, that this unity 
and these machinations are intensifying and that these three 
countries are moving toward a common attempt against the Kurdish 
people's interests. 
  For this reason and to thwart any plot against the Kurdish 
people, the public and humanitarian organizations and forums 
should be better informed. The Kurds should [words indistinct], 
adding to their self- confidence. Consider the fear and concern 
felt by the three countries. This clearly shows that the 
Kurdish movement is intensifying [words indistinct].

  [Text] The fifth joint session of the foreign ministers of 
Iran, Turkey, and Syria has opened in Istanbul, Turkey. The 
session is being held to examine the issues of north Iraq, 
specially the events stemming from the recent Turkish air raids 
against the region and losses inflicted in these attacks on the 
border areas of Iran. 
  Besides the aforesaid cases, the three foreign ministers 
attending the session will also follow up the manner of 
enforcement of the memorandums of understanding and agreements 
reached at the last session held in Tehran. At the current 
session various issues including Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
terrorism in the region have been discussed. However reports 
say that the main subject of discussion relates to the 
negotiations among the parties concerned over the events of 
north Iraq and their impact in regional states. 
  Special attention of Iran, Turkey and Syria to the issues of 
Iraq, and their importance for each of these three states, or 
the outcome of the [words indistinct] occurrence in north Iraq 
can have impacts directly or indirectly in the neighboring 
countries. 
  Such impacts have an unbreakable link with the national 
security of Turkey, Syria and Iran. 
  While at the fourth session of these three countries' 
foreign 
ministers held in Tehran in June 1993, there was expressed 
concern over these adverse impacts within the framework of 
diplomatic wordings in the final communique, this concern has 
now emerged openly with the attack of Turkish war planes on 
Iran's border areas. 
  However the question is asked too: What factors undermine 
the 
security stressed by these three states at numerous sessions 
held by their foreign ministers in Tehran, Damascus, and Ankara? 
  Response to this question is evident in options for [words 
indistinct] and accessible even though faced with certain 
difficulties. The fact of the matter is that deployment of 
multinational forces on the soil and some territorial water of 
some regional states is one of the reasons behind eruption of 
such unrest once in a while. These are the troops which enter 
into action with the intention of backing the Kurds in north 
Iraq but bring suffering to them and to their pains by the way 
of their intelligence umbrella and their logistical support to 
military operations against the people of this region. 
  At any rate it is hoped that by virtue of the identity of 
views among Iran, Syria and Turkey over preserving the 
territorial integrity of Iraq, current session of their foreign 
ministers in Istanbul will think about the negative impacts 
caused by Iraq's internal situation and find a solution to the 
problems which are rooted outside the region. 
  This measure should be assessed not from the viewpoint of 
intervention in Iraq's affairs but in terms of the desire and 
commitment of Iran, Syria, and Turkey to bolster and stabilize 
regional security.

  [Text] According to reports received from Mashhad, in 
anticipation of an explosion of people's protests, the Khomeyni 
regime has increased its military presence and the number of 
armed personnel in this city. The report states that checkposts 
have been set up on intersections and vehicles are regularly 
checked. Repressive patrols are conducted on the streets. In 
order to tighten control, at times, the regime's agents block 
the streets or announce that they are one-way streets. The 
ruling clerics, who are still gripped with the fear of last 
year's heroic uprising by the Mashhad residents, are 
implementing these repressive actions in an attempt to control 
the mounting protests of the people of Mashhad.

  [Text] The budget bill of the insolvent regime met with 
greater opposition this time due to the fear and apprehension of 
the reactionary Majles deputies of the explosive conditions in 
society and mounting protests by the people. 
  One of the reactionary Majles deputies, Khamushi, said that 
the 50.9 percent increase in current prices was shattering and 
stated: Unfortunately this budget will raise inflation to 50-60 
percent. 
  It is worth mentioning that in the course of the discussions 
on the regime's budget bill, 120 of the reactionary Majles 
deputies, who were terrified of the explosion of popular 
discontent against high prices, presented a triple urgency bill 
to the Majles that stipulated that the government should be 
stripped of all authority to raise prices and grant only the 
Majles this right.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Excerpts] The first congress of Iranologists and of 
Persian language and literature academicians from Central Asia 
and the Caucasus opened in Tehran on Friday afternoon, 4 
February, with a message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at 
the Cultural Heritage Organization. The congress, which is to 
continue until tomorrow, Monday, will study the role of Persian 
language and literature in the region and its influence on the 
culture and literature of countries in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus. [passage omitted] 
  Persian language and literature, which is influenced by 
Islam, prevails in extensive areas in southern, central, and 
western Asia and the peoples and nations in the region are 
familiar with this language and literature. This is at a time 
when the 70-year presence of communism in countries north of 
Iran prevented these peoples from becoming better acquainted 
with Persian culture and language and, as a result, from 
becoming better acquainted with their own ancient culture. The 
emergence of the Islamic revolution and the liberation of the 
nations in Central Asia and the Caucasus from the yoke of 
communism has made these nations show more interest in learning 
about Iran and its culture and language. 
  The truth is that the countries of the former Soviet Union 
are exerting great efforts to acquire their own culture and 
identity and to return to their historic Islamic roots. 
Meanwhile, the West is trying to propagate its own culture and 
to encourage these countries to follow Western culture. Thus, 
having strong cultural ties with these countries, and especially 
with Muslim-inhabited areas, can help them become acquainted 
with the Persian language and culture and with Islamic teachings 
and also help them realize that, like Iran, they can use Islamic 
culture to further enrich their society, language, literature, 
and culture and can do without the West.

<F P=106> ["Address to the nation" by President Liamine Zeroual in </F>
Algiers--live relay] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Prayers and peace be upon the most noble of messengers. 
Citizens-- men and women: The country is going through a 
decisive stage in its history, amid international changes and 
developments on the national scene which place the country in a 
multifaceted crisis. We have talked a great deal about this 
crisis, and an exact diagnosis of it has been made. The time 
has come for us to look forward to the future with all of our 
strength and to face the situation with courage. This is the 
challenge facing all Algerians, men and women alike. 
  Algeria has capabilities, and its sons have sufficient 
ability, will, and determination to confront this challenge. We 
have to remove the spirit of despair and failure from our 
hearts, and regain creative initiative. Fortunately, the force 
that is motivating our society is the will of a vital people who 
aspire to self-realization and to prove itself as an active and 
effective force. We understand well and in depth the will of 
change, and we understand the aspirations of our people, 
particularly our youth, for development, justice, and progress. 
We work for the embodiment of this will and push the process of 
change to its aspired end. The political crisis in Algeria is 
in fact a crisis of a society that aspires for radical change 
and for the building of a developed Algeria, capable of taking 
its position in the modern world: an Algeria that realizes 
democracy and believes in the ethical and human values. 
  An Algeria that rejects backwardness and marginalization, an 
Algeria deeply rooted in its religion, its identity, and its 
history and confidently looking forward to the future. We stand 
for this ambitious Algeria which is able to win the challenges 
and which should launch all of its capabilities and resources in 
the battle of change. This change, which is a true break from 
the past, could only be comprehensive and all of the effective 
forces in society have to take part in the change, including 
political, economic, social, and cultural forces and honourable 
citizens. This Algeria, deeply rooted in its countryside, 
villages, and towns, with its youth, cadres, workers, farmers 
and women, exists in the fields, factories, universities, and 
institutions. 
  We will work to provide conditions and suitable frameworks 
to 
bring about a break with the past and a change. 
  Youth ought to understand that the current transformations, 
which must be completed in an atmosphere of security and 
stability, are aiming, in essence, at giving an opportunity to 
the new generations to play their role in the administration and 
the management of the country. And this is one of the main aims 
of the new national system. 
  We will provide all available resources and the necessary 
facilities for our youth to shoulder their responsibilities in 
order to shape their fate with confidence. 
  Citizens: I salute all of the national forces and the 
security forces and members of the People's National Army as 
well as our cadres, workers, and youth who have been attending 
to the country's safety and security, to the state's continuity, 
and to the normal work of the institutions. 
  I salute our community abroad, which will receive special 
attention in our work. We will take the necessary measures 
leading to the consolidation of its solidarity and the defense 
of its interests and allow it to take part in the national 
action and the country's economic development. 
  Citizens: In the political sphere we have chosen the path 
of dialogue to deal with the country's current situations, and 
as a basis for political practice. Despite the difficulties and 
hesitation by some sides, we are determined to continue serious 
dialogue according to the aims listed in the national consensus 
platform to which we are committed throughout the transitional 
period. These goals are to ensure the availability of political 
and security conditions and to revert to the path of democratic 
election, thus enabling the people to choose its representatives 
with total freedom and without any form of pressure and 
falsification. We realize that the political crisis can be 
solved only through dialogue and with the participation of the 
national political and social forces--without exception. 
Algeria has a defined program and a clear plan for dealing with 
the political crisis. We are in control of this path and firm 
in applying this program. 
  We would like to draw the attention of the foreign partners 
to the fact that we need calm, and we ask them to be reserved in 
their evaluations of our country's situation. In order to 
consolidate this path the National People Army--the offshoot of 
the Liberation Army--will always remain at the level of 
challenges and wagerings, and will make every effort to help the 
country to a suitable political and permanent solution through 
dialogue within the framework of the principles of the republic 
and by respecting the people's choice. 
  Citizens: We are convinced that the security solution alone 
is not enough to take the country out of the crisis, and that 
radical solutions to the political, economic, social, and 
cultural issues are inevitable. 
  Furthermore, the return of security and stability in the 
country as well as tranquility to the citizen will undoubtedly 
secure a quick solution to these problems. 
  We will use all resources to contain violence and end the 
bloodletting. The blood that is being shed is Algerian 
blood--the blood of our sons and daughters. Therefore, it is 
imperative that we stop the blooldshed and free the country from 
violence once and for all. Violence as a way to political 
change and as a way to seize power is totally unacceptable. 
  Although we have been trying to free political action and 
organize it within the framework of law and away from all forms 
of violence and political manipulation, we will never tolerate 
those who are trying to sow the seeds of sedition and chaos, to 
destroy the country's material and human resources, and to 
tarnish its reputation. No religious, political, or cultural 
reason can explain or justify the crimes that have been 
committee against people and property. 
  The abnormal phenomenon in our country reflects nihilism and 
belongs to organized crime, whose main goal is to deal a blow to 
the nation's dynamic and real forces. 
  The law will be applied fully and strictly to the 
perpetrators of these acts. Those who have gone wrong and have 
not committed crimes against the nation can return to reason, 
sense, and adherence to the law. In this context, I would like 
to express my sympathy and support to the families of the 
victims of the crimes. 
  Citizens, everyone must be aware that political pluralism 
and 
democratic practice do not mean the weakening of the state or an 
undermining of its institutions. The new national order, devoid 
of political, ideological, economic, and cultural monopolies, 
can only be achieved in a state with strong institutions. This 
state must belong to all the Algerians, whatever their political 
affiliation. 
  In this context, the national media has a sensitive role to 
play in building the new national order. It has to rise to the 
level of responsibility to enlighten the public opinion and 
educate and promote it; promote its civil tendency; report the 
truth objectively, without distortion or falsification; inform 
it of what takes place around it; and raise it in a way that 
would serve the homeland. 
  Citizens: In order to get out of the current situation it 
is imperative for us to find solutions to the economic 
situation. This requires making decisions and taking practical 
measures that will effectively implement the economic reforms 
aimed at liberating the national economy from monopoly and 
centralization and providing the opportunity for creative 
initiatives to bring forth public and private economic and 
financial resources, as well as to build an advanced economy 
that complies with market laws and competition. All of this 
needs state protection for the more deprived social groups. 
  Appropriate solutions will be found for foreign debts, which 
are a heavy burden on the country, through negotiations with 
international financial institutions. Dealing with the economy 
will lead to temporary negative complications, which are the 
nature of any qualitative structural change. We will resolutely 
ensure that Algerians will share these complications within the 
framework of an effective national solidarity. 
  Citizens: Confronting the internal problems does not 
distract us from paying attention to the changes taking place 
around us in the world. Algeria, which is conscious of the new 
challenges, will do its best to determine its position in the 
new world order and play a vital role in the international 
cooperation and world peace. 
  In this respect, the need to build the Arab Maghreb Union 
appears to be a necessity imposed upon it. Algeria will use all 
its influence to achieve this noble goal. We will work 
sincerely to clarify the atmosphere for guaranteeing the 
interests of the peoples of the region and respect their will. 
This makes us give our complete support to the UN peace plan to 
settle the Western Saharan issue. 
  We emphasize the policy of good neighborliness and 
noninterference in internal affairs, and we are enthusiastic 
about consolidating the stability of the region and eliminating 
the causes of tension, conflicts, and extremism. 
  Algeria will continue to be committed to its solidarity with 
African peoples and the region's fateful causes. 
  Algeria will work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle 
East and in the Arab region; it will welcome any initiative 
aimed at cleansing the atmosphere in the Arab world. 
  Algeria will also continue to play its role in the 
Mediterranean in order to make it a region of peace, 
cooperation, and stability; it will be committed to bolstering 
relations with the countries of the North and developing them on 
bases of common interests and mutual respect. 
  Citizens: In conclusion, I would like to take this 
opportunity to salute the Algerian people, who in this difficult 
situation have shown awareness, vigilance, and compassion, and 
have rejected violence and adventurism. 
  I would like to appeal to all Algerians to mobilize in order 
to regain our country's glory, pride, and might. 
  Citizens: I hope on the occasion of the advent of the 
blessed month of Ramadan, the month of atonement and 
forgiveness, that tranquility will return to the people, peace 
to the country, and love between the people. Surmounting crises 
can be achieved only through compassion and work. 
  May God's guidance make our work successful and Algeria a 
peaceful country. 
  Long live Algeria. 
  Eternal glory to our martyrs. 
  May God's peace and benediction be upon you.

<F P=106> [Speech to the nation by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali </F>
on 7 February on the upcoming presidential elections, recorded; 
place not given] 
  [Excerpts] Citizens, this afternoon I submitted my 
nomination for the presidency for the next 5 years, in 
accordance with the provisions of the constitution and on the 
basis of my determination to continue serving the country, in 
order to develop the gains and accomplishments we have achieved, 
and to complete the plans and projects which we have started 
together, so that we are able to further consolidate the 
mainstays of the resurgence of the homeland and bolster the 
bases of its impregnability. 
  What has strengthened my determination and reaffirmed my 
will 
is that I regard the next phase as a very decisive one in the 
destiny of our dear homeland. Our country's final move toward 
advancement and progress depends on our success in that phase. 
Therefore, and due to the same reasons which motivated us on 
the dawn of 7 November [1987] to rise up to the sacred duty, I 
come forward again to undertake the trust and leadership of the 
country, appreciating the responsibility of the position, and 
that the responsibility comes before the honor of the position. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dear citizens, we developed the electoral code in such a say 
as to make it compatible with the development of society, as we 
pledged to do, and to guarantee the entrenchment of multiparty 
politics in parliament, so that political parties are 
represented in accordance with the extent of their popular base 
and their impact. Thus we have taken a further step, which will 
be added to previous steps, on the road of democracy and the 
freedom of choice. 
  The campaign for the parliamentary and presidential 
elections 
will begin on 6 March. On this occasion I would like to draw 
your attention to two matters which I believe are of the utmost 
importance. The first of these concerns the election campaign. 
It is the duty of everyone to adhere during this campaign to 
the rules of law and to avoid anything which may harm the 
reputation and honor of the candidates, and to shun all forms of 
slander and insinuations. The administration, which will be 
totally unbiased toward all political contestants and 
candidates, will be closely monitoring all excesses in order to 
curb them at once so that the campaign can take place in a 
civilized manner, and so that the voting is held on 20 March in 
total impartiality and with absolute openness. 
  The second matter is about the need to put the country's 
reputation and interest above all considerations, because the 
elections, which are indeed extremely important since they 
constitute one aspect of a civilized life and are a feature of 
democratic civilian societies, are however only an access to 
what is more important and more lasting. This is namely 
strengthening the constitutional institutions and guaranteeing 
their safety and effectiveness, and guaranteeing the continuity 
of the state and its stability to enable it to devote itself to 
carrying out its duties in the service of the country, which is 
for all Tunisians, men and women, without any distinction or 
exception. 
  What makes these two matters more important is what I said 
at 
the beginning of my speech, that Tunisia is about to enter a 
decisive stage in its historical transformation. We are hoping 
to prepare it in the best possible way to enter the new century 
stronger and more powerful, with better consolidated 
achievements and a readiness to follow world development in a 
competent manner that will allow it to secure a place among the 
other countries of the world. 
  Let us all be committed to the slogan: We are all committed 
to Tunisia's glory. 
  May God's peace, prayers, and benediction be upon you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Islamic Jihad Secretary General Fathi </F>
al-Shiqaqi by an unidentified AL-'AHD correspondent; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What happened during the recent 
meetings of the 10 factions opposed to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement? How did the factions overcome their differences? Or 
are there still many differences among them? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Since the beginning of September 1993, when 
news 
of the Oslo agreement began to leak, the 10 factions have been 
meeting to discuss the possibility of upgrading their year-old 
coalition. There was talk of establishing a national Islamic 
front with a political program that would be more advanced than 
the earlier points of minimum agreement among them and more 
developed organizationally. It took some time to agree on the 
front's name and its program. The disagreement at this stage 
was with the brothers in the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine because of certain political differences over the 
interim program and UN resolutions. Eventually, faced with 
pressure to be responsible, all the conferees found common 
ground for building a political program and outlining political 
tasks within the context of a front called "The Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces." Ideological differences were avoided. 
After this, the meeting was adjourned for a week pending a new 
proposal that was being prepared by the brothers in Hamas. 
  On the evening of Wednesday, 15 January 1993, the last 
meeting was held. Hamas made a new proposal that appeared to 
call for a formula that was stronger than the existing 10 
factions framework but still weaker than a front. It became 
apparent that the proposed political program, or rather the 
proposed political tasks, differed in more than one aspect than 
what had been agreed upon earlier. The organizational formula, 
however, treated all the factions as equals. The 5 January [date 
as published] meeting was tense and anxiety ridden at first and 
it appeared headed toward a deadlock. 
  Personally, however, I was optimistic and worked hard to 
bridge the gap between the position of the Hamas brothers and 
the positions of the other factions. I made several specific 
proposals to end the differences and when it became clear that 
my proposals would be received positively, we recessed the 
meeting for half an hour for private consultations within each 
faction and for bilateral consultations. During the recess I 
discussed the issue with the brothers in Hamas after holding 
quick meetings with the other factions. We returned to the 
conference room to announce that we had reached a full agreement 
that would satisfy everyone. An atmosphere of optimism and 
satisfaction replaced the tension and anxiety. We began to 
review the documents in a sincere and easy manner and decided to 
hold a news conference the next day to proclaim the happy news 
to our people about the establishment of "The Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces." 
  I can say that we have overcome the basic obstacles to such 
an alliance. However, there are pending issues of less 
importance. We will discuss them at a meeting of the central 
leadership in less than two weeks. 
  [Correspondent] Did you leave the meeting with a clearly 
defined program, or will you continue with the former methods? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We have agreed on clear and specific political 
tasks. Some are strategic and had to be spelled out in the 
agreement. Other tasks are interim and include the need to 
confront the Oslo agreement and its dangers. The basic tasks on 
which we agreed will guide our future activities. As for 
detailed plans, we will discuss them at future meetings. I will 
not hide from our people or the masses represented by our 
alliance that we are facing very difficult and complex 
circumstances. In the absence of any international or regional 
backing, what is being done on the real battleground inside 
Palestine will play the decisive role. The strength of the new 
alliance will be measured by its actual impact on the battle 
inside the homeland. We have taken an important step forward. 
Although we have no magical solutions, we are determined to do 
everything in our power to carry out the tasks on which we have 
agreed. 
  [Correspondent] What is your position on the election of 
the self-rule authority--if it takes place--and also on 
municipal elections? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We reject the Oslo agreement, known as 
Gaza-Jericho. We believe it is void and bad, and all its 
consequences are, therefore, null. The agreement brought 
disgrace to our people and planted illusions in their minds. As 
mujahid and leaders of the Islamic movement, we refuse to 
compete for this shame; we refuse to deceive our people and sell 
them illusions. I know that many good people believe that the 
elections have now become a reality and the participation of 
Islamists will make things less disastrous. I know they say 
that if the Islamists, honorable citizens, and others enter the 
elected council it will be better than one controlled by a 
Zionist-oriented group. But I tell these good people: I do not 
understand how can one remain Muslim, patriotic, honest, and 
honorable if he accepts--whether through his pen, tongue, or 
heart--this agreement, which has sold out Palestine to the 
enemies of the nation. 
  The agreement does not give our people anything. What are we 
going to contend for in the imaginary elections? The 
Palestinian who falls for the logic of spoils at this stage is 
extremely naive. All that we are doing is recognizing their 
occupation and helping them move easily toward the Arab and 
Islamic homeland in building their new Middle East. We will be 
serving only as a bridge for their ambitions and dreams. If we 
survive, we will be linked to them as the weak to the strong, 
the minority to the majority, the slave to the master, the 
worker to the employer, and the agent to the owner. 
  Just as we rejected the agreement, we will reject the 
elections. Our resolve cannot be shaken by any incentives. The 
future of Palestine is a million times more important than a 
lowly, worthless council. I advise all hesitant people and 
advocates of realism among those who once chose struggle and 
jihad not to come close to this pyre. I am convinced, however, 
that a certain party to the agreement will delete the election 
clause from the Declaration of Principles. 
  Concerning municipal elections or other ones, we determine 
our position based on their political significance and function. 
We will boycott any institution or organization stemming from 
the self-rule authority and entailing recognition of the Zionist 
enemy and its occupation of our land. But we will deal 
positively, as we did in the past, with the other institutions 
and with society's infrastructure. 
  [Correspondent] You strongly reject what is taking place. 
What alternative are you proposing, taking into account that the 
people continue to suffer in the occupied territories? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] What is the cause of the people's suffering? 
The occupation, of course. According to the Oslo agreement, 
will the occupation end? No, the opposite is true. The enemy 
wants to rid itself of the occupation's burdens and costs but 
wants to maintain the occupation's essence and role. We will 
then have to bear an occupation with double the burden. When 
the occupation continues, in disguise or without one, it will 
cast the burdens that it used to carry onto our shoulders. 
Saying that the above agreement will end our people's suffering 
is a major illusion that they are trying to sell us. What is 
really serious is that we are buying this illusion at a price 
greater than any nation ever paid, namely by acknowledging the 
enemy's continued presence on the entire territory of our sacred 
homeland. When our people have arisen in this century it 
certainly was not for the purpose of filling their bellies. 
They rose up because they yearned for liberty, independence, 
identity, and the preservation of their faith and sanctities. 
If all this is lost, is it important if one fills one's belly? 
Even the illusions of prosperity are belied by the conditions 
suffered by all peoples who accept humiliation. 
  This homeland is ours, the sea and the river are ours, and 
the olives and oranges are ours. The logic of the Koran and 
history underline these simple facts. Let us move according to 
this logic and struggle according to it. No matter how many 
battles the nation has lost, it still has not lost the war. It 
possesses aspects of power which, if properly organized, are 
capable of terrifying the invaders. 
  Palestine is the focus and pivot of polarization and 
renewal. 
The pain of jihad is a thousand times better than the pain of 
humiliation. Our alternative is steadfastness, endurance, and 
continued jihad until the balance of power changes. If we 
cannot defeat the enemy today, then at least let us not turn 
into a bridge over which the enemy can cross into the region to 
reshape it in the way he wants and in line with his goals, 
ambitions, and interests. We must not turn into allies and 
guides who show him the way as he presses ahead to control all 
the region's capitals. Let us continue to confront him and 
reduce his danger until the nation rises again and God permits 
change to come. The alternative to this is not peace and an end 
to suffering, but a Zionist, cancerous, destructive deluge. 
  [Correspondent] Why do you refuse to meet with Yasir 
'Arafat? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We do not believe there is room for a meeting 
after the Oslo agreement; there is no point. 
  As for why no meeting was held before the agreement, the 
political issue was again the basic reason. We saw constant 
gratuitous retreat in 'Arafat's political position. Add to this 
the war of containment, absorption, and blackmail that the PLO 
chairman waged against the Islamic Jihad movement. He traded in 
the movement's name through some distorted figures he created on 
the Palestinian scene. Claiming to speak for the Islamic Jihad, 
for instance, someone once came up with an announcement 
supporting the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when six Fatah 
members rejected it. We cannot be blackmailed, and we are not 
the ones who stand at the door of the Sultan [i.e. we are not 
supplicants]. However, this did not prevent our meetings and 
dialogues over the years with Fatah leaders and cadres; they 
contacted us from time to time. They rejected the PLO 
chairman's practices against the Islamic Jihad and opposed his 
political line, even though he was the one who sent them. 
  [Correspondent] How does the Gaza-Jericho agreement affect 
Jordan? Why does Jordan fear the agreement? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] For now, Jordan appears to be the biggest 
loser. 
The geopolitical situation does not allow three entities between 
Iraq's western border and the Mediterranean. The establishment 
of some independent entity in Jericho and the rest of the West 
Bank and Gaza will be at the expense of Jordan, and will cause 
sharp tension inside that country, where at least half of the 
population are Palestinians. As long as the agreement does not 
satisfy the Palestinians and gives them nothing, Jordan will 
remain the solution, the Palestinian homeland. If we consider 
the fact that the West and the Jews have believed that Jordan's 
role since its establishment was to deal with the consequences 
of the Balfour Declaration, then this role now appears to be in 
its final stages after an agreement that gave most of Palestine 
to the Israelis. 
  Jordan fears the loss of its role in the region; it fears 
dissolution. Regrettably, these fears are being reflected in 
suspect concessions in the talks with the Israelis. Indeed, the 
Palestinian Oslo team is competing with Jordan in the 
concessions each party is offering to maintain a role in an era 
of Israeli domination. This is the result of an agreement that 
was worked out secretly, away from the nation and the 
Palestinian people, and without minimal Arab coordination. It 
is an earthquake shaking an already cracked Arab settlement. 
After the Palestinian people, Jordan will be the first in a 
long queue of Arab and Muslim losers. 
  [Correspondent] If Hamas contests the self-rule elections, 
what will your position be? You will be standing alone against 
the plan. 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stressed 
to us that they are against the elections and that they will 
boycott them. They assert that their position is final and 
decisive. The program of the basic tasks of the Palestinian 
forces' alliance is clear in this respect. 
  At any rate, our position proceeds from our principled 
commitment to our people, homeland, and nation; from our 
understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine, 
and from our understanding and interpretation of the reality and 
the fact that the infamous agreement means an alliance with the 
enemy against the entire nation and region. We will remain 
witnesses before God and history, unharmed by those who oppose 
us. We will remain the conscience of the nation, even if we are 
reduced to only one person. However, we believe that a large 
sector of our people and their other leading forces stand with 
us in the same trench.

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 7 (AFP) -- UN disarmament chief 
Rolf Ekeus said here Monday [7 February] he was not convinced 
that Iraq had provided full details about its chemical weapons. 
  "We feel quite satisfied, but not fully satisfied," the head 
of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) told 
reporters, following his four-day mission to Baghdad. 
  "In the chemical area we are not satisfied that Iraq has 
given us full, detailed information necessary for us to be 
definite that all these weapons have been taken away," Ekeus 
said. 
  The Swedish UN official on Sunday ended a visit to Iraq 
saying Baghdad and the United Nations still disagreed over 
certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons 
programmes, despite their determination to implement the 
surveillance measures quickly. 
  Ekeus said Monday he was confident that all Iraq's 
long-range 
missiles had been destroyed, along with the production 
facilities. 
  "We have the satisfactory feeling that most of the Iraqi 
capabilities have now been destroyed and eliminated," Ekeus 
said, referring to the dismantling of Iraqi weapons programmes 
in line with the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions. 
  In a joint statement issued in Baghdad Sunday, Ekeus and 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said both sides 
"expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of 
goodwill." 
  They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to report to the UN Security Council "that, in 
their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by 
paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." 
  The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil 
embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions 
calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Ekeus was due to leave Kuwait for New York Monday, Kuwaiti 
officials said.

  [Text] In a statement issued today, the House of 
Representatives has appealed to people with a live conscience, 
regardless of their positions, especially world parliaments, the 
Security Council, the United Nations, and human rights 
organizations, to work seriously to end the crimes committed by 
the Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The statement asked for severe, deterrent punitive measures 
against the aggressive Serbs and immediately lifting the siege 
of the city of Sarajevo and all other Islamic cities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It also urged supplying the Bosnians with 
arms, equipment, food, and medicine, and allowing them to defend 
themselves by lifting the arms embargo, if the international 
forces do not immediately oppose the aggression against land, 
man, and human values. 
  The statement asserted that the painful, brutal massacre 
against Sarajevo by the shells of the Serbs, which killed or 
injured hundreds of people and targeted defenseless civilians -- 
elderly, women, and children -- is a link in the brutal 
aggression against innocent Muslims. The massacre took place 
amid international silence and mere verbal decisions.

  [Text] This morning, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was the 
guest of a conference of educators entitled "Education Toward 
Peace," held in Jerusalem. Taking the opportunity to deliver a 
message to Syria, the prime minister said the Syrians could have 
prevented the incident in south Lebanon yesterday. Our 
correspondent Ya'el Ben-Yehuda reports on Rabin's remarks: 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister opened 
his remarks by saying that it is hard to talk about peace on a 
day when the bodies of four soldiers are being laid to rest. 
His conscience as prime minister and as defense minister, 
however, is clear, he said, because in addition to upholding 
security, the government is trying to attain peace on a path 
fraught with hardship and terror. He offered his condolences to 
the bereaved families and sent his wishes for a speedy recovery 
to the wounded. 
  The prime minister accused Hizballah of sabotaging peace and 
held it responsible for the victims killed yesterday. He did 
not absolve Syria either. 
  [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from 
continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it 
is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use 
its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its 
backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more 
troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation 
Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquillity 
with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which 
entails certain arrangements concerning security and some 
guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating 
alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in 
this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would 
expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building 
measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister was asked whether the 
delegation currently in Cairo has a mandate to conclude issues. 
  [Rabin] The delegation headed by the foreign minister left 
for Egypt to conduct negotiations in order to reach agreement on 
key points in the implementation of the first phase of the 
Declaration of Principles, to finalize certain points in the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I very much hope that an 
agreement will be reached -- some progress was made in Davos -- 
but this will only be the nucleus for future negotiations on a 
comprehensive agreement that includes all the elements enabling 
the beginning of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister emphasized that one of 
Israel's principles in the peace talks is that there will be no 
uprooting of settlements. We will retain responsibility for 
settlements, Israelis, and traffic in the territories. United 
Jerusalem is outside the negotiations, the prime minister 
stated. [end recording]

  [Text] There have been important developments in the 
investigation into the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 
al-Ma'ayitah nine days ago. 
  Security sources this afternoon confirmed a REUTER report 
that the Lebanese police have arrested a Palestinian, who 
admitted that he assassinated al-Ma'ayitah. Citing security 
sources, REUTER reported that the accused belongs to a 
Palestinian fedayeen group, and that he is currently being 
questioned. The agency added that the investigation by security 
men has led to the arrest of two people belonging to a 
Palestinian organization in connection with al-Ma'ayitah's 
assassination last Saturday. 
  When Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij was asked about 
additional information on this matter, he replied that the case 
is in the hands of the judiciary, and that the investigation is 
continuing.

  [Excerpts] On the occasion of 19 Bahman [8 February] -- Air 
Force Day -- thousands of Air Force commanders, officers, and 
NCOs were received by His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the 
great leader of the Islamic revolution and the commander in 
chief, at Imam Khomeyni prayer house this morning. [passage 
omitted] 
  Referring to the arrogant powers' propaganda invasion of 
Iran 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: The enemies of the 
revolution accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran of having 
military tendencies and seeking banned weapons, while America 
and her accomplices, including the usurper Zionist regime, 
produce, sell, and use -- wherever they feel necessary -- the 
most forbidden of weapons such as chemical and nuclear weapons. 
They placed masses of chemical weapons at the Iraqi regime's 
disposal during the imposed war, which were used right in front 
of their noses, and they saw our wounded, too. But they still 
continued selling banned weapons to Iraq. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution said the arrogant 
powers 
have no right to talk about banned arms. He said: We will do 
anything which conforms to our principles, and if we deem it 
necessary we will manufacture or obtain weapons, as we did 
during the imposed war. But we do not seek to obtain and use 
banned weapons, because we respect our principles and faith. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i attributed the largest 
volume of weapons' sale in the region and the world to countries 
in line with the aims of arrogant powers. He said: We have no 
fear of the false and biased propaganda of the enemy. Such 
propaganda will not prevent us from continuing on our correct 
path. We have no arms deals. Compared to the large purchases 
of countries which act in line with America's goals our arms 
purchases are infinitesimal, because we do not need them.

  [Excerpts] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. The Majles held an open session with Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Zoroastrian 
minority, Ardabil, Taft, Ahvaz, and Qom made speeches. Then the 
Majles went into session. We call to your attention the detailed 
discussions. 
<H5>  Parviz Ravani, Deputy of the Zoroastrian Minority </H5>
<H3>  I Condemn the Publication of Incorrect News Regarding the 
Observance of the Rights of Religious Minorities in Iran </H3>
  The first pre-agenda speaker of yesterday's session of the 
Majles was Ravani, the deputy of the Zoroastrians, who offered 
his condolences on the death of Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani and 
said: We Zoroastrians during our prayers stand towards the 
light, that is, the light is our Kaaba. But we also have another 
light, which is the light of science and knowledge. Referring to 
the establishment of more than 30 schools by Zoroastrians in the 
country, addressing the minister of education, he said: These 
schools, which one day were the banner carriers of fighting 
illiteracy, are about to lose their true efficiency. In my 
recent visit to Yazd, I realized that some of these schools that 
are endowed in the villages are engaged in noneducational 
matters. Referring to the Zoroastrian schools in Tehran, Ravani 
said: Despite the fact that Zoroastrians have numerous buildings 
for elementary and high schools, they still do not have a middle 
school for girls. Certainly, the education officials will help 
in establishing this educational institution next year. 
Requesting that the mayor of Tehran pay attention to Zoroastrian 
religious places, some of which are in the green areas, he 
pointed out: The history of Iran in the past 100 years, 
especially since the Constitutional revolution, shows to what 
extent spreading rumors and creating skepticism has worked and 
does not allow the creation of an atmosphere of understanding 
for necessary government decisions. If history shows a picture 
of how Amir Kabir was the victim of injustice in the face of all 
domestic and foreign conspiracies, which indicates the plans 
that have always put pressure on our political figures, we would 
not have made an exaggerated remark. Today, under conditions 
much harsher than that period, the administration of the country 
is faced with similar conspiracies. The present approach is to 
avoid the scrutiny that can be seen in action and superficial 
reactions and finding fault. We must follow the recommendations 
of the grand leader and in our judgment and expression of 
opinion respect all the strata of the nation. We must accept the 
fact that in all cases, the implementation of great projects can 
only be achieved through the perseverance and courage of the 
faithful and self-sacrificing implementors, and is coupled with 
intentional or unintentional shortcomings. 
  He added: We must never judge on the basis of the standards 
of those who are always standing outside and awaiting an 
opportunity for their own personal interests. What is noteworthy 
and praiseworthy during this period is the prescription of the 
Constitution and attention by the officials of the regime to 
preserving national unity and the hopefulness of people of 
different religions in the preservation of their basic rights in 
their place of birth, Iran. 
  Stating that we must protect the manifestations of our 
national culture, literature, and language, he said: In 
conclusion, I condemn the publication of incorrect news 
concerning the observance of the rights of the religious 
minorities in Iran and ask God for the prosperity and glory of 
the Iranian nation and the success and victory of the officials 
of the regime of the Islamic Republic. 
<H5>  'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, Deputy From Ardabil </H5>
<H3>  One of the Effective Factors in the Fight Against Cultural 
Invasion Is the Fight Against Poverty </H3>
  The next speaker was 'Ali Mohammad Gharibani, from Ardabil, 
who offered his condolences on the death of the revered Shi'ite 
source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and said: 
[passages omitted on world arrogance and anti-American rhetoric] 
  In continuation, he asked the speaker of the Majles, because 
the content of the letters of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani in connection 
with relations with the United States has been reported widely 
in the newspapers and on the radio, in order to clarify it for 
the honorable colleagues and the noble people of Iran, to grant 
permission to use the legal authority in the bylaws to state his 
explanations concerning this matter. The deputy from Ardabil 
considered one of the effective steps in fighting cultural 
invasion to be fighting poverty and said: This will not be 
possible except through adequate economic planning and decisive 
dealing with hoarders and economic terrorists, those who in 
coordination with the West and taking advantage of the chaos in 
the market and accumulating large wealth want to bring about 
poverty and misery, and facilitate the spread of deviation 
resulting from poverty and destitution throughout the country, 
and allow financial corruption and bribery once again to become 
widespread. We all know that one of the most important 
consequences of the victory of the Islamic revolution was the 
elimination of usury and decisive dealing with the belligerent 
against God. In this connection, a number of judges were 
assigned by the Imam to put usurers on trial and investigate 
their corruption. But now, unfortunately, we witness the 
mushroom-like growth of usurers in various parts of our Islamic 
country. He added: One of the important factors in the 
reappearance of this ugly and ignoble phenomenon is the 
imposition of economic policies without any control and lowering 
the value of the national currency and making it dependent on 
the dollar. 
  The other part of my speech is addressed to that group, some 
of whom are said not to have severed ties to the organization 
that was hated by the Imam and to not have repented and who are 
the cause of all the economic and social misfortunes. In 
connection with one of them, the Imam, addressing one of the 
high-ranking officials of the country, wrote: Be careful lest 
suddenly you realize that the Hojjatiyeh Society members have 
destroyed all you have. Considering these statements, the 
officials of the regime, God willing, will not allow the key 
positions to fall to these sorts of people and not allow them to 
infiltrate the important national organizations. 
  Gharibani then referred to some of the characteristics of 
this group and said: On 28/05/1360 [19 August 1981], on the 
order of the Imam, in a session in the presence of the 
representative of his honor and the representatives of 
revolutionary institutions and members of the Central Council of 
the Hojjatiyyeh Society, a meeting was held and discussions 
continued for several hours. The leaders of the Hojjatiyyeh 
Society, in defending the ceremonies and trying to prove 
themselves to be revolutionary, made certain statements, and in 
rejecting their statements, one of those who had repented said: 
In the course of the Islamic studies lessons that the society 
teaches to its members, such as theology, etc., nothing has been 
said about a God who fights injustice and corruption. This is an 
ideological deviation by the society. He continues that he 
himself has heard the opposition of so and so, that is, the 
leader of the Hojjatiyyeh, to religious guardianship. When you 
say that he accepts religious guardianship it is a pure lie. He 
then states: Another issue is the categorization of individuals 
as political and religious figures. The deviation of the Society 
is this very separation of religion and politics. And the 
relations of the Society with SAVAK were not bad, and the 
seminar in Mashhad was carried out with SAVAK's permission. 
  He says: The leader of the Society, after being 
disrespectful 
towards the Imam, had such opinions about the revolution: "The 
buzzing of the baby mosquito of the phantom"; "It is like 
pounding the fist on an anvil"; "We cannot be rid of the rule of 
the tyrant." And in justifying the shah, he said, "The shah is 
more chaste than all the other kings." 
  He then continues: The first action by one of the leaders of 
the Society after the victory of the revolution was to raid 
SAVAK throughout the country to destroy the files of the 
Society. After the victory of the revolution, when there were 
many members of the Society, the leader of the Society said: The 
Imam must become desperate enough to write me a letter for me to 
place my forces at his disposal. Also, the tapes of the speeches 
of the leader of the Society over 55 years are available. 
  He continued: By the way, why do the true forces of the 
Islamic revolution and the values of the revolution gradually 
leave the scene? Why should such revered persons, such as the 
honorable wife of Martyr Raja'i, be forgotten and should we not 
see them on the political scene? Gharibani referred to the many 
shortages in the province of Ardabil and asked the president to 
issue the necessary instructions in connection with conformity 
to the ratifications of the government with the law and the 
procedures for their implementation. 
  Mr. Speaker, after being elected speaker of the Majles, you 
said that you would not change the employees of the Majles. You 
said that some officials during the change will get on the bus, 
I will not even go on a minibus. Apparently, the board of 
directors, on the basis of these statements, chose a train and 
not a bus or a minibus. After the speech of the deputy from 
Ardabil, the speaker of the Majles said: We must make use of 
Article 77 and say something. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Taqi Mohassel-Hamadani, Deputy From Taft </H5>
<H3>  One of the Grave Duties of the Majles and the Government Is 
To Create a Safe Climate for Investment and Fundamental Work </H3>
  Mohassel Hamadani was the third pre-agenda speaker of the 
Majles yesterday. He offered his condolences on the occasion of 
the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, to the Imam 
of the Age, the grand leader, and all the Muslims and expressed 
hope that our seminaries continue to be the cradle to nurture 
religious figures. 
  He continued: The First Five-Year Plan is about to end and 
the Second Five-Year Plan is about to be devised and ratified. 
It was expected that before the ratification of the Second Plan, 
a full report on the quality and quantity of the implementations 
of the First Plan would be given to the Majles and its weak and 
strong points would be examined to make the necessary 
precautions in the implementation of the Second Plan. 
  1) It seems that implementation of the economic 
modifications 
made the implementation of the Five-Year Plan face stagnation, 
and the related results were not achieved. It is necessary to 
specify the reasons and eliminate them. Perhaps this important 
task is the duty of the Majles, which in not doing it will 
commit a dangerous act of negligence. 
  2) The problems due to the modification in economic affairs 
and the conspiratorial acts of the East and the West in reducing 
the price of oil and the occurrence of unexpected events, such 
as floods and earthquakes, require consideration for the 
condition of the people, especially the vulnerable stratum of 
the society. After determining the actual resources, except for 
fundamental affairs and observing priorities, the Majles should 
budget expenditures. 
  3) The action of the government in regards to purchasing 
transfers [as published] of the shares of government companies 
to the private sector is successful and beneficial. But this 
action must be carried out properly and devoid of any misuse and 
the supervision of the government can be effective in this 
regard. 
  4) Attention of the Majles and the honorable Cabinet to 
achieve administrative discipline is a necessary issue and has 
first priority, and lack of attention to it will increase the 
problems and anger the people. It is necessary to act as soon as 
possible. 
  5) One of the problems of the country is the existence of 
several prices for the necessary goods and public needs. It was 
hoped that the Ministry of Economy and other honorable officials 
would find a solution for this social problem, to which some of 
the business people have been accustomed, but, unfortunately, 
there is no sign of it. 
  6) One of the grave duties of the Majles, the government, 
and 
all the officials is to create a safe climate for investment in 
commercial, industrial, and agricultural affairs and fundamental 
work, for there is no other way to transfer the capital of 
Iranians living abroad, which is not insignificant. 
  In conclusion, he made reminders to the Ministry of 
Education 
concerning the problem of elementary and middle school teachers 
and asked the president to attend to the executive affairs and 
planning for the cities and villages in his constituency. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Reza Mavalizadeh, Deputy From Ahvaz </H5>
  Mavalizadeh was the fourth pre-agenda speaker of the Majles 
yesterday. He offered his condolences on the death of the 
Shi'ite source of emulation of the world, Grand Ayatollah 
Golpayegani, and said: Last week, the noble and 
always-present-on-the-scene people in the blood-stained province 
of Khuzestan were the hosts of a very dear guest, the loyal 
friend of the late Imam and a trustee of the leader, Mr. 
Nateq-Nuri, who truly is one of the valuable pillars of the 
sacred Islamic regime. In his five-day visit to the province of 
Khuzestan, he brought hope to the martyr-nurturing people of the 
province. 
  Despite the intensity of the programs, the significant point 
that the deputies of the province of Khuzestan in the Majles 
observed during this visit was his pleasant attitude, patience, 
humility, modesty, interest in the people, precision, care, and 
proper moral behavior. 
  Continuating, while thanking the speaker of the Majles and 
the accompanying delegation, he said: I request that the 
honorable Cabinet help approve six of the villages of Ahvaz as 
deprived areas, which have also been approved by the Office of 
Deprived Regions. 
  He also made reminders to the Ministry of Education in 
connection with the shortage of educational cadre and space and 
the shortage of other educational aid in his constituency. 
<H5>  Hoseyn Irani, Deputy From Qom </H5>
<H3>  Sources of Emulation and Leadership Are Two Wings Flying 
Together and a Single Hand </H3>
  The last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr. 
Irani from Qom, who offered his condolences on the death of the 
revered Shi'ite source of emulation and continued: [passages 
omitted on Golpayegani's praises] 
  The presence of the people increased the responsibility of 
the officials of the country lest we be negligent in serving the 
resistant people and the untiring forces supporting the regime, 
particularly the vulnerable stratum. It was once again the 
covenant of the people with the leadership and source of 
emulation and the fact that the source of emulation and 
leadership are two wings flying together and a single hand. This 
vast movement was a response to those unaware people who look to 
the West with awe, who consider the religious source of 
emulation and religious jurisprudential management incapable and 
question it, and who consider Western rule and compromise with 
the Great Satan and criminal United States the solution. It was 
also a deadly response to global oppressors and deceptive 
international assemblies who everyday threaten great Iran with a 
new accusation or warn with the old weapon of the violation of 
human rights. They must know that if they want to stand against 
the ideology and the country of this brave nation, we shall 
stand with all of our power against their empty and hollow 
world, as they learned about the sacred defense and numerous 
conspiracies. 
  In conclusion, he also added: Has the time not come to 
attend 
to the needs of Qom, which has been left out, and eliminate the 
administrative and resource shortcomings of this city? 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was a report on the second round of discussions 
of the Health Committee concerning the bill on calculating the 
service of medical students (interns), which according to the 
related ratifications have served in the war-stricken regions as 
a part of their outside-the-capital service or the service of 
physicians and paramedics, for which the single article and the 
note were ratified. 
  Single article. The period of service of that group of 
medical students (interns) who, based on the ratifications 
related to the time of the imposed war, have served in the 
war-stricken regions, provided that period has not been 
calculated as a part of their military service and internship, 
may be calculated at the same ratio as part of their service 
outside the capital or the law of the service of physicians and 
paramedics (as the case may be), and the above-mentioned period 
shall not be deducted from the rural emergency period of those 
subject to this law. 
  Note. The implemental bylaws of this law shall be prepared 
by 
the Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education. 
  The second item on the agenda was a report on the first 
round 
of discussions by the Commerce Committee regarding the proposal 
to amend certain articles of the Chamber of Commerce, Industries 
and Mines of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ratified in 1369 [21 
March 1990-20 March 1991], the general points of which were 
ratified. 
  In this proposal, the establishment of the Chambers of 
Commerce in cities with at least 50 members was announced as 
permissible. 
  Efforts to establish export and import unions and production 
syndicates in regards to mining, industry, commerce, and service 
activities in accordance with the regulations are among other 
instances that have been projected in this amendment proposal. 
  In the continuation of the open session of today, 
examination 
of the urgent proposal for the procedures of the examination by 
the Majles of the annual budget and Five-Year Plan bills of the 
country continued and received final ratification. 
  According to this ratification, parts of Articles 76 and 
106-118 of the internal bylaws of the Majles were amended. 
  For ratifying the proposals related to the internal bylaws 
of 
the Majles, the vote of two-thirds of the deputies present in 
the session is necessary. 
  According to one of the paragraphs of this ratification, for 
discussions about the general points of the annual national 
budget, 10 hours, including three and a half hours for opponents 
and three and a half hours for supporters, one hour for the 
spokesman of the committee, two hours for the representative of 
the government, and 15 minutes for every speaker, have been 
allocated. 
  The examination of the national budget bill and the 
amendments and attachments shall take place in the committee. 
  Also, during the discussion of the first and second rounds 
of 
discussion of the budget bill in the Majles, the sessions must 
be held continuously on all days of the week except Fridays and 
official holidays for at least six hours per day. 
  Continuing this session, the examination of the proposal to 
attach the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture 
and Guidance in the first round of discussions began and after 
the speeches of a number of supporting and opposing deputies, 
the continuation of the examination was postponed to the next 
session. 
<H5>  Deputies of Khuzestan Thank the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  The deputies of the cities of the province of Khuzestan in a 
letter to the honorable speaker of the Majles thanked him as 
follows for his visit to that province. [passages omitted on 
words of appreciation] 
<H5>  Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan </H5>
<H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part I </H5>
  It was decided that the speaker of the Majles would make a 
five-day visit to Ahvaz to meet with the brave and untiring 
people of Khuzestan and to open and visit the developmental 
projects of the province and examine the process of the 
reconstruction of Ahvaz. After the passage of one and a half 
years in the Fourth Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri came to the province 
of Khuzestan, a province that according to the Imam has "paid 
its debt to Islam." In the course of the "eight years of sacred 
defense," Khuzestan created glory and heroism in such a way that 
the tongue and the pen fail to describe. Could anyone forget 
"brave and heroic Khuzestan"? Is there anyone who does not know 
"what Khuzestan did"? 
  In this meeting, first Engineer Moqimi, the governor-general 
of the resistant and hard-working people, presented to him a 
report about the conditions of the provinces and then several 
officials reported on their work. Jadari, the concerned deputy 
of Dasht-e Azadegan, said in this meeting: The resources of the 
province of Khuzestan are known to everyone. One-third of the 
water in the country is provided from this province. Such 
resources exist in few provinces in the country. In the course 
of the war, the resources of the province stopped, and lack of 
development of the province during the war was quite apparent. 
  Also, the director general of the Construction Jihad of the 
province of Khuzestan said: "The villages of the province five 
years after the war have a desirable growth, so that from 3,863 
villages throughout the province, 1,796 villages have 
electricity and 1,350 villages have safe drinking water. But, 
unfortunately, 35 percent of the people of these villages do not 
have safe drinking water, and it is hoped that by the end of the 
Second Plan it will reach 95 percent. [sentence as published] 
Also, by the end of the Second Plan, all the villages will have 
electricity." 
  When the speeches ended, the speaker of the Majles made a 
speech and explained internal and external issues and the 
problems and pressures that our country is facing. 
  After the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri visited the implemental 
operations of the Mirza Kuchek Khan industrial and agricultural 
project, with the development of sugar cane and its secondary 
industries. In this visit, the minister of agriculture and the 
deputy ministers of that ministry were also present. For two 
hours, the speaker of the Majles familiarized himself with the 
work of this great project, which is an exemplary effort by the 
government. This project has been implemented on 84,000 hectares 
of barren and low-return land of Khuzestan and will produce 
700,000 tons of sugar, 700,000 tons of animal feed, 350,000 tons 
of paper pulp, 20,000 tons of animal husbandry protein, and 
100,000 tons of semilight fiber. The cost of the implementation 
of this project has been estimated at more than 400 billion 
tomans. A noteworthy point of this project is that in 10 years 
it will gain more than $1 billion in additional revenues. 
  Also, with the implementation of the above-mentioned 
project, 
the import of red meat and sugar will gradually stop, and 50,000 
direct and indirect jobs will be created. It is noteworthy that 
the operation of the project has been projected for 1376 [21 
March 1997-20 March 1998]. Some of the plains of Khuzestan are 
barren, low return, and nonarable. The implementation of these 
projects will make the province prosper. This example of 
fundamental work will certainly reach fruition in the 
self-sufficiency of the country, given the fact that in the 
future countries will face severe crisis in terms of food.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles held a session yesterday and the deputies of Tuysarkan, 
Talesh, Eqlid, and Shadgan made speeches. Then the Majles went 
into session. The details of the discussion follow for the 
honorable readers. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mohammad Naqbayi, Deputy From Tuysarkan </H5>
<H3>  Many of the Ratifications of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994] Budget Have in All Practicality Faced Stagnation </H3>
  The first pre-agenda speaker was Naqbayi, from Tuysarkan, 
who 
offered his congratulations on the arrival of the month of Rajab 
and condolences on the occasion of the death of Grand Ayatollah 
Golpayegani and concerning the execution decree of the infidel 
Salman Rushdie said: This decree cannot be canceled and is a 
duty of any follower who takes steps to carry it out. Hence, I 
announce to [?Gerdip], the honorable member of the 90 Green 
Group of the German Parliament and all those who somehow request 
a reduction or cancelation of the decree, that religious decrees 
are irrevocable. 
  He then said: President and Speaker of the Majles, by the 
approaching end of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], it is 
worthy of note for us to know that many of the ratifications of 
the 1372 budget bill have in all practicality faced stagnation 
and have not been implemented. Among them is the payment of 
housing loans to educators and subsidies that were to be paid, 
failure to implement the ratification of the Majles concerning 
rural electricity outreach, failure to provide and implement 
banking loans in most ratified areas, failure to implement the 
laws to facilitate the construction of housing, failure to 
implement the law on natural gas outreach, etc., for which no 
justified and clear reason has been offered. 
  He continued: I request of the honorable speaker of the 
Majles, as the head of the supervisory power, and the honorable 
president, as the head of the executive power, to pursue the 
matter and order the related officials to present the necessary 
explanations and response. 
  The economic and foreign currency planning of the country 
and 
also the writing of the budget during the life of the Majles and 
prior to it indicate failure to conform words with deeds and the 
actions of the theoreticians, experts, and planners threaten the 
foundation of the economy and independence of the country. 
  The deputy from Tuysarkan also pointed out: During this 
period, the vast country of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
been a laboratory and the target of invasion by the planners. 
The masses of the deprived people and vulnerable and oppressed 
classes have been the tools of the implementation of 
experiments. The reverse is the result of the experiments of 
these theoreticians in small cities, oppressed regions, 
villages, agriculture, the rate of foreign currency, inflation, 
and again every day the instability of the actions of previous 
results and the cause of failure, dependence on the theories of 
Western countries, lack of intellectual independence, fear of 
precise implementation of economic issues and correct programs 
of the ideology of the Koran and Islam, and failure to 
understand the suffering and deprivation and taste the 
bitterness of hunger. Flying towards imagination without 
considering the existing conditions and lack of clear 
regulations and principles to achieve definite goals, which if 
continued, will ultimately confront us with the threat and many 
problems for the society and revolution. 
  In another part of his speech, Naqbayi said: Concerning the 
roads of the city of Tuysarkan within the province and the 
internal roads, despite the emphasis of the president, the 
assembly of the deputies of the province, and the related 
officials, no steps have been taken to eliminate the problems. 
  He mentioned the shortage of doctors, severance of the 
medicine ration of the only 24-hour pharmacy in the region by 
the province, and the stopping of the only national 95-bed 
hospital project among the problems, which since the time of the 
previous minister have not been eliminated, despite what was 
expected of Dr. Marandi. 
  In conclusion, he asked related officials for the change of 
the labor and cooperative agencies to the related administrative 
offices, which were promised this year. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mojtaba-'Erfani, Deputy From Talesh </H5>
<H3>  With All These Foreign Currency Problems, Still There Is No 
Agreement Between the Executive Managers and Monetary Policy 
Makers for the Appropriate Allocation of Our Limited Resources </H3>
  The second pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Erfani, the 
deputy from Talesh, who offered his condolences on the death of 
the revered Shi'ite source of Emulation, Grand Ayatollah 
Golpayegani, and said: Our people, both old and young, proved 
that they love the family of the prophet, the infallible imams, 
and the rightful successors of the pure imams. The religious 
seminaries proved that they are still the banner carriers of 
struggle against the oppressors and the hope of the deprived and 
the oppressed in the world. 
  He continued: We thank God that he has placed the 
describable 
love of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and the 
religious jurist, Grand Ayatollah Khamene'i, in the hearts of 
the people and displayed the bravery, power, piety, and 
disregard of this great man for the oppressive power and his 
popularity. This the harbinger of the good news that, God 
willing, once again his honor will be the spiritual source of 
emulation. 
  In continuation, he added: The sincere and revered presence 
of the people in the funeral procession of the revered source of 
emulation once again struck a hard blow to the mouth of the 
utterers of nonsense, who thought problems have separated people 
from religion and the revolution. 
  These people, who deserve our service no matter how we serve 
them, tolerate all the problems but condemn making peace with a 
miserable America, whose poor president, in order to humiliate 
Muslims, lowered himself so much to meet with Salman Rushdie and 
is not disgraced. They also strongly hate the miserable 
terrorist-nurturing France, which by giving shelter to the 
hypocrites is trying to inflict blows on Islam and the 
revolution, and they must understand that we are after the 
implementation of religion and religious values and are not 
afraid of such actions at all, because today the Muslim nation 
has not only established an Islamic Republic regime but has also 
presented itself for the awakening of the Islamic world and 
return to lofty values. 
  He continued: Today, the experts who believe in religion 
must 
use their minds and, by relying on God and not unfortunately 
under the influence of Westernized ideas, which have always 
caused misery and misfortune for the country, for the transition 
period, with appropriate reforms and in the context of the 
realities of the world today, design the model for the economic 
plan for the Five-Year Plan so that we can both take steps on 
the course of construction and economic blossoming and also 
establish divine spiritual values in the society. We must admit 
that accepting the dominant existing systems is never harmonious 
with our beliefs. 
  The deputy from Talesh continued: What has been clarified in 
determining the policies governing the Second Plan by the grand 
leader of the government and the officials should be put on the 
agenda, because in the regime of the Islamic Republic, the 
religious guardian prepares the course for political, cultural, 
and economic changes through devising and approving general 
policies. In other words, he prepares the ground for the divine 
development of the regime. 
  He added: In the face of events, incidents, and changes 
within the regime, we must have a change of leadership and 
initiative, and in the events we must not fade and wait for 
things to happen and then make decisions or in an isolationist, 
reactionary form engage in negative resistance. 
  In planning, we must anticipate the events rather than look 
for a solution after an occurrence. We must engage in cultural 
planning and form the political and economic culture with the 
goals of the regime of independence. 
  He also criticized some of the managers who are still 
thinking about luxury in their place of work and make improper 
expenditures and said: With all the foreign currency problems, 
still there is no understanding between the executive officials 
and the monetary policy makers for the appropriate allocation of 
our limited resources. Everyone is trying to implement the 
interests of his own section. Who must be accountable? For what 
reason have those who under the pretext of importing automobile 
industrial technology imported thousands of cars into the 
country and wasted the foreign currency of the country not been 
questioned. Why are these economic criminals not punished for 
their actions, and why have these middlemen of bankrupt foreign 
companies who before the interests of their country are trying 
to create multinational corporations done whatever they wish? 
The agreements in principle must also be investigated and the 
foreign currency given to them. 
  Concluding, he thanked all the officials of his constituency 
who with solidarity have established the religious and brotherly 
spirit in the region and asked the government to expedite the 
issue of the free commercial port of Bandar Anzali. 
<H5>  Ahmad Nikfar, Deputy From Eqlid </H5>
<H3>  Increased Economic Pressure Is by No Means in the Interest 
of Our Sacred Regime </H3>
  The third pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Nikfar, from 
Eqlid, who offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the 
birthday of the fifth star of the heavens of the imamate and 
offering his condolences on the martyrdom of the 10th infallible 
imam and the death of the spiritual scholar, Grand Ayatollah 
Golpayegani, said: Global oppressors, one day by means of 
military invasion and another day cultural invasion and once 
with an economic embargo and disrupting the trade of our Islamic 
regime, try by creating and aggrandizing the problems to make 
life intolerable to our revolutionary people and by driving the 
people from the scene achieve their sinister goal. Considering 
the timely presence of our people in the unprecedented welcome 
of the visit of the grand leader to the province of Azerbaijan, 
which was comparable only to the welcoming ceremonies of the 
Imam of the Nation in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], and 
considering the several-million-large presence in the funeral 
procession of the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, 
and the welcome by the Muslim people of the Central Asian and 
African countries of the honorable President, the Muslim people 
of Iran and the world have displayed their support for the 
Islamic regime and dear Islam. 
  Hence, it is necessary for the Great Satan to learn a lesson 
not to play with the pure sentiments of and all that is sacred 
to the 1.5 billion Muslims in the world any longer by supporting 
the infidel Rushdie, the treacherous hypocrites, usurping 
Israel, and the bloodthirsty Serbs. It must know that behavior 
of this kind toward the Islamic Republic of Iran and other 
Islamic movements have, thank God, caused more unity of Muslims. 
He continued: Today, the time has come for all the high-ranking 
scholars of the Shi'ite school and the teachers of the 
seminaries to hold conferences to engage in discussions on the 
issue of guardianship and the successor to the Infallible Imam 
during the occultation in a more clear and definite manner and 
find a solution so that, God willing, Imam Khamene'i, who is 
among the most learned religious jurists, will favor us and take 
charge of all the affairs of Muslims. Who can doubt that if 
these dear ones are negligent, the creation of confusion and 
factionalism in the Islamic world will be certain. 
  In continuation, addressing the Judicial Branch, he said: 
Unfortunately, the situation has reached a point that 
bloodthirsty khans, who in the past, fearing the consequences of 
the oppressive actions, crawled into their holes have even set 
traps for the faithful and dutiful judges and when they fail to 
make them greedy, threaten them. It has been heard that a khan, 
a leftover of the Qajar kings, has sent a faithful judge a 
message that he has the power to transfer him and find him a 
better position in Tehran. When he did not receive a positive 
response, he threatened the judge. This warning is sufficient 
that through a proper and intelligent reaction these new figures 
will be stopped from showing themselves once again, and the 
trust and judicial security of the committed and concerned 
judges will increase. 
  The speaker continued: We are on the verge of writing and 
ratifying the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget. It is necessary for the honorable 
Majles and the serving government, with more investigation, if 
the policy of economic modification is to continue, to make 
arrangements to help the oppressed classes and those deserving 
government aid, that is, the small businessmen, workers, 
employees, small farmers, and those under the coverage of 
emergency organizations, to benefit from the significant direct 
aid of the government in an assured and continual manner, 
because continuation of the existing situation, which caused 
more pressure on the above-mentioned classes, is by no means in 
the interest of our sacred regime. On the other hand, it is 
heard that the start of new projects in the 1373 budget and the 
Second Five-Year Plan has been prohibited. Yes, this is a proper 
action if fairness is observed in distributing the projects, 
especially large-scale investments. However, now that in many of 
the oppressed cities of the country there is no sign of 
large-scale investments, is it not clear and unjust 
discrimination to spend existing resources to complete ongoing 
projects, which are limited to some regions? Is deprivation 
eliminated from the oppressed regions merely by providing water, 
electricity, roads, and schools? Has the time not come for 
identifying and investing in the potential of the oppressed 
regions and the centers of economic, social, and cultural 
developments of those regions? 
  He also expressed hope that in the Second Five-Year Plan a 
number of projects under study will be implemented to compensate 
for the witting and unwitting lack of attention in the past. 
  In conclusion, he thanked the Central Office of Roads and 
Transport of Fars and the Construction Jihad of Eqlid and made 
reminders to the Cabinet concerning more attention to the 
agricultural sector. 
<H5>  'Isa Moqaddamizad, Deputy From Shadegan </H5>
<H3>  Ministers Must Do Their Best in Choosing Their Deputies and 
the General Managers </H3>
  'Isa Moqaddamizad, as the last pre-agenda speaker, offered 
his condolences to all the people on the heartrending death of 
the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and, offering his 
congratulations on the birthday of Imam Mohammad Baqer, said: 
The resistant and noble people of Khuzestan in the past week 
hosted the old friend of the Imam and the eternal supporter of 
the grand leader of the revolution, Mr. Nateq-Nuri. On behalf of 
myself and all the deputies of this province, I thank him for 
all of his kindness. 
  He thanked the people of the province of Khuzestan for 
their welcome to the speaker of the Majles and said: Since the 
Second Five-Year Plan of the government is going through its 
final stages, I find it necessary to remind the ministers of 
this point. You know that writing the above-mentioned plan took 
a great deal of the time of the ministers, experts, and 
executive officials. But more important than writing the plan is 
precision in its announcement and implementation. Hence, the 
ministers must do their best in choosing their deputies and 
general managers and choose individuals who at least have the 
following characteristics, in order for the efforts to reach 
fruition and the goals of the plan to be implemented. 
  1) Faith in the value of work, because interest in and love 
of work revive a sort of initiative and innovation in a human 
being and eliminate problems. 
  2) Trustworthiness and commitment; no group or guild can 
deny 
the value of purity of the self. Lofty spirit is a 
characteristic of men who have goals, who never sacrifice the 
goal for their personal inclinations. 
  3) Knowledge and capability. 
  4) Decisiveness and determination in decisions. Because of 
his position, a manager requires a strong will to be able to 
make decisive decisions after examining all sides of an issue. 
  5) Humility, modesty, and belonging to the people. 
  6) Good past history, which can encourage the officials who 
have chosen a manager without management [as published]. 
  7) Accepting criticism. The manager must see his problems in 
the mirror of other people's ideas and look fairly at the 
criticism of critics. 
  [8)] And finally, the last characteristic of a manager is 
his 
perception. 
  Moqaddamizad, continuing, referred to the problems of his 
constituency, mentioned the issue of the completion of water 
outreach to 88 villages of Shadegan, and said: The manager of 
the Water and Electricity Organization of Khuzestan, in regards 
to the second phase of the irrigation and drainage network of 
Shadegan last year, gave me false information and said that he 
had announced the funds for the above-mentioned phase to the 
Mahab-e Qods Company. But after the matter was pursued, the 
contrary was proved, whereas the timely implementation of this 
project can have a vital role for my constituency. 
  Then, in connection with the completion of the construction 
operation of the educational affairs of Shadegan and payment of 
loans to people who reside in 80 villages, which fell victim to 
floods in the region, he asked the related officials for help 
and cooperation. 
  Concluding, he thanked the officials of the Emergency 
Committee who were able to aid in the marriages of a number of 
brides and grooms on the birthday of her holiness Zahra. 
<H5>  Ratification </H5>
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was the report on the first round of 
discussions of the Islamic Guidance and Art Committee concerning 
the proposal to attach the National Library to the Ministry of 
Islamic Culture and Guidance. 
  Regarding the general points of the proposal, Morteza Nabavi 
said in support of this proposal: This library must be under the 
supervision of the Ministry of Guidance. In terms of comparison 
with other parts of the world, statistics show that in most 
countries, the National Library is under the supervision of the 
executive organization in charge of culture and information 
outreach issues. And if we do not want to make a comparison with 
other countries, in our own country, the president has a great 
deal to do. Since 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], when this 
law was ratified, the president has had the opportunity to 
participate in one session and examine this matter. 
  The deputy of the people of Tehran then rejected the 
reasoning of the opponents that this law has been ratified 
previously and it would not be proper for the Majles to change 
it and said: The charter of this library, which has been 
ratified by the Majles, is not supposed to change. Only the 
place of the library, which concerns the Ministry of Guidance, 
will be changed. 
  He also added: Some of the opponents have stated that we 
shall have the problem of parallel organizations. Some of our 
colleagues have reached the conclusion that this law should be 
amended, like other laws, and put in place. This is very 
logical. This action will include the elimination of parallel 
organizations as the president at the present manages this task, 
and also it is the duty of the Ministry of Guidance. 
  Dr. Sheybani said in opposition to the proposal: We have one 
library so large in the country, and that is the National 
Library, which must be operated under the supervision of the 
highest executive authority in the country, who should have an 
open hand and provide more resources. When this issue came up, I 
went to the president and said, Is there any reason why you 
cannot attend to this library? He said: "No, in fact, I can 
provide more resources." 
  He then said: We should not do something to bring the 
National Library to the level of other libraries and then 
ultimately be unable to attend to it. This library is a national 
treasure, not to mention that its president is a person who was 
the minister of guidance once and previously engaged in vast 
propaganda in Europe in the Hamburg mosque. He is a person who 
is known to everyone. 
  'Ata'ollah Mohajerani, the parliamentary deputy of the 
president, then explained: Essentially, the strength and 
credibility of the Majles is in proportion to the strength and 
the credibility of the laws. If the laws of a country change, 
openly in the mind of the people the belief will exist that the 
law can be changed. Hence, we must act in a way that we only 
change the law when necessary, and do it tastefully. In the 
Third Majles, separating the National Library from the Ministry 
of Guidance and attaching it to the presidential institution was 
not a political idea but one of expertise. Certainly, the Fourth 
Majles also will look at the law from the perspective of 
expertise, and ultimately the government will implement the 
ratifications of the Majles. 
  After the speech of the government representative, 
Zare'i-Qanavati, the spokesman of the Guidance Committee said: 
None of the deputies oppose the National Library, and all agree 
that the library must be expanded. 
  He then said: To say that this proposal has not been made 
out 
of necessity is not correct. The reasons for the committee 
ratifying the proposal were expert arguments not issues of 
factional and personal taste. These issues, thank God, do not 
govern the committee. If the Administrative Committee has voted 
negatively regarding the above-mentioned proposal, it means that 
the committee has seen its organizational problems and given an 
opinion, whereas the expert Guidance Committee has seen the 
cultural coordination in the country and in all the sessions of 
the committee is concerned about the culture of the country. 
Hence, by attaching this library to the Ministry of Guidance, a 
great deal of coordination will be created in the culture of the 
country. 
  After the explanations of the spokesman of the committee, 
the 
general points of the proposal were put to a vote and were not 
ratified. There were 86 supporting and 93 opposing votes. 
  The second item on the agenda was the urgent proposal on the 
procedures for punishing individuals who engage in illegal 
audiovisual activities. The general points of the proposal were 
put to a vote and ratified. The details of the proposal will be 
discussed in the next session. 
  Article 1 of the above-mentioned proposal, which had been 
proposed by the Judicial Committee, states: Any person who 
engages in any action regarding illegal audiovisual materials in 
place of legal materials or violates the rights of the owners of 
the work, including forgery of the official label of the 
Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance on tapes or changing 
the tape or the content of the tape cassettes that have labels 
and the like, in addition to punishment for forgery and damages 
according to the case, if demanded, he shall be fined 2 million 
to 20 million rials. 
  Note. During the phase of determining whether the action has 
taken place, the court may use the expert opinion of the 
Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance as its standard. 
<H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5>
<H5>  Bylaws Reminder of the Deputy of Lenjan </H5>
  In connection with the discussion concerning the attachment 
of the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and 
Guidance not being a political but an expert decision, Mr. 
Kuhkan said in a bylaws reminder: We did not expect our dear 
brother, Mr. Mohajerani, to speak in this manner, that the Third 
Majles dealt with proposals and bills from an expert perspective 
and now it is done from a perspective of personal taste. Since 
we signed this proposal and spoke in support of it, I think his 
address includes me, as well, as one of the signatories and 
speakers, and I consider his statement an insult to the Majles 
in mentioning the opinion of the Fourth Majles in this case as 
having been based on personal taste rather than expert opinion. 
  In this connection, Mr. Mohajerani in yesterday's issue of 
ETTELA'AT, in an article entitled "Criticism of the Situation," 
defended his speech in opposition to the proposal to attach the 
National Library to the Ministry of Guidance and said: "The 
problem is that sometimes an honorable deputy...regards his own 
preference or that of a few people as the opinion of the Majles." 
  In continuation, he added: "Neither did I mean that the 
Fourth Majles acts inexpertly, as the evidence came like 
lightening and the proposal to attach the National Library was 
rejected, nor can the preference of a few deputies be regarded 
as that of the Majles. The Majles is not formed of a building, 
chairs, and discussions. The basic identity of the Majles is in 
its votes." 
  In explaining the statements of Mr. Mohajerani, it can be 
said that the number of supporting and opposing notes shows that 
the person making the objection is right, because if "the basic 
identity of the Majles is in its votes," there are 86 supporting 
and 93 opposing votes. In other words, the votes of 86 persons 
cannot be regarded as merely the preference of a few people, 
because there is a difference of only seven votes. It seems that 
the accusation by Mr. Kuhkan has remained unanswered. 
<H5>  Five Days With the War-Scarred People of Khuzestan </H5>
<H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part 2 </H5>
  On Sunday afternoon, 14/09/1372 [5 December 1993], Mr. 
Nateq-Nuri participated unexpectedly in the marriage ceremonies 
of 600 couples of the Imam Khomeyni Emergency Committee of the 
province of Khuzestan, which was truly very attractive and 
enjoyable. Their presence in this interesting and spiritually 
joyful gathering revived every one revived from the tiredness of 
the trip. I will never forget this memorable gathering. Truly we 
must say to the unknown members of the Emergency Committee who 
work sincerely: Well done. After these exciting ceremonies, Mr. 
Nateq-Nuri took part in a gathering of Ahvaz University people 
and responded to the questions of the officials with regard to 
political and cultural areas. This great gathering, in which a 
large number of students participated, was interesting. They 
welcomed the speaker of the Majles warmly. Of course, in this 
meeting, many questions were posed by the students, of which the 
speaker of the Majles responded to a few, due to the shortage of 
time. Among the questions posed to him was one concerning 
"Raja'i-Khorasani," which resulted in a heated discussion. He 
was asked, "Considering his letter, why was he not dismissed 
from the Majles?" Mr. Nateq-Nuri responded: "In the Majles, we 
do not have a law that if a deputy makes a speech, we can 
dismiss him as a deputy. I myself spoke in detail in connection 
with his letter on 13 Aban [4 November] and condemned this idea. 
I do not agree with him at all. The fact is that the newspapers 
are making an issue of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani. On the one hand, if 
someone is arrested, they say there is no freedom of expression 
and democracy. But if a person writes a letter to the leader of 
the revolution and gives us a copy, does making a ruckus against 
him indicate democracy and freedom of expression? This action 
does not conform religiously and legally with democracy and 
freedom. Hence, I reject and condemn the opinion of Mr. 
Raja'i-Khorasani. 
  "I announced earlier that the alley that ends in America is 
a 
dead-end alley." When the speaker of the Majles made this 
statement in a loud voice, the sound of "God is great" by the 
students shook the amphitheater of the university. Among the 
other questions by the students was the issue of national 
economy, to which Mr. Nateq-Nuri gave a strong and dignified 
answer. Also, among other questions was that of relations with 
South Africa, to which the speaker of the Majles responded: As 
long as the white racists are in charge, we will not have 
relations with them. At this moment, the minister of agriculture 
said: The blacks are supposed to come to power. 
  And Mr. Nateq-Nuri immediately said: "If they come to power, 
we shall have no problems with them." 
  Among the other questions by the students was a question 
concerning relations with Egypt. The speaker of the Majles said: 
"The grand leader of the revolution agreed to relations with 
Egypt at a certain level." 
  After this meeting, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to a gathering of 
the 
brave people of Ahvaz, a stronghold of combative forces, and 
spoke of their self-sacrifice and bravery and praised them. 
  On Monday morning, 15/09/1372 [6 December 1993], the speaker 
of the Majles, in order to become familiar with the 
implementation of the Karun River dredging operation, visited 
the above-mentioned project. The project began four months ago 
to provide protection against seasonal flooding and to stabilize 
the Karun River banks, and it is anticipated that it will be 
completed in 32 months, if funds and heavy machinery are 
provided. 
  Afterwards, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to Susangerd to visit with 
the resistant people of that city. During the imposed war this 
city was occupied twice by the Ba'thists, but with the bravery 
and resistance of the Hezbollah forces, the Ba'thist mercenaries 
could not stay in that city for even one day. The same people, 
on seeing the speaker of the Majles, became joyful and welcomed 
him and his companions enthusiastically. During the moments that 
we spent in Susangerd, the signs of deprivation and damage from 
the war were evident. 
  The implementation of the developmental projects will cause 
the city to thrive and repair the war damage. The first 
implementation of the project in the city was the natural gas 
outreach, water and sewage, and the establishment of Payam-e Nur 
University in Susangerd, all of which were visited by the 
speaker of the Majles, which will be encouraging to the 
war-stricken people of this city. 
  When Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to the gathering of the resistant 
people of this city, the city stadium was filled with men and 
women. He said: "What we all wish is to sacrifice ourselves for 
you people. I believe that you have not received what you 
deserve. No matter how much work is done around the clock, it is 
still too little."

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
open session of the Majles was held yesterday with Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri presiding. In this session, the bill of the 
Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget were presented to the Majles. It is interesting that 
before the bills were presented, the deputies of Tehran, Semnan, 
and Baft made speeches. 
<H5>  Seyyed Reza Akrami, Deputy From Semnan </H5>
<H3>  For the Late Debts of the Country, We Must Have a 
Comprehensive Solution in Order To Pay Them at the Appropriate 
Time </H3>
  The first pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr. 
Akrami, the deputy from Semnan, who said: Today, the Second 
Five-Year Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 1373 
budget bills will also have problematic consequences. 
  The deputy of the people of Semnan, referring to the 
importance of oil and oil revenues in the national economy, 
said: Oil is the national capital of the country and it must be 
used for capital investment. In other words, we must sell the 
oil, train an educated, skilled work force, create work, 
workshops, electricity and factories, and create suitable jobs. 
Otherwise, in the long run, there will be problems. 
  He then suggested in this connection that in the Second 
Five-Year Plan, the oil revenues be only used for national 
investment. For the late debts of the country, we must have a 
comprehensive solution in order to at least pay the debts at an 
appropriate time, and in the future suitable ways other than the 
oil revenues can be used for borrowing. Our Islamic country has 
the potential for nonoil exports at a level several times the 
present one. In this connection, does the Ministry of 
Agriculture not import the equivalent of $1.5 billion in food 
stuff. Is it not able to export an equivalent amount of fruit, 
dried fruits, etc.? With proper planning, can we not become 
self-sufficient in wheat, rice, fodder, meat, and cheese? Why is 
the milk that is produced in the districts and villages wasted, 
and then we read in the press that the Ministry of Construction 
Jihad, with the help of the Ministry of Commerce, intends to 
import 20,000 tons of cheese by the end of the year? 
  Why are 1.4 million barrels of petroleum products used in 
this country? Can we not seriously revise this tremendous 
consumption? Why should more than 50 percent of our cars carry 
only one passenger and use 50 rials per liter of gasoline? He 
suggested that a traffic plan be implemented in all the cities 
in order to counteract the present trend of the consumption of 
imported fuel. 
  He added: The speaker of the Majles and the president can 
request that the ministries have an annual foreign currency 
income of $10 billion [as published] from the export of 
minerals, manufactured goods, fruits and dry goods, training of 
students from other countries, offering medical services, and 
the sale of software and hardware. 
  Referring to the recycling of goods by advanced industrial 
countries such as Germany that, for example, obtains 52 percent 
of its consumer paper through recycling paper, the speaker said: 
In our country, only a seminar was held by the City Hall and the 
issue was filed away. The recycling of paper in our country is 
very small. The Planning and Budget Committee has included a 
note in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget according 
to which every province will be able with proper planning 
through exports, the sale of land, and business taxes, to make a 
deposit in the national treasury and allocate it to fundamental 
projects or incomplete projects of its cities. 
  In conclusion, he said: Can only the province of Kerman have 
the first rank in nonoil products by exporting pistachios, 
carpets, and handicrafts and for other provinces to be ranked 
lower or does this potential exist in other provinces of the 
country as well? It only requires thought, initiative, planning, 
management, and cooperation. 
<H5>  Marziyyeh Vahid-Dastjerdi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  Another pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Ms. 
Vahid-Dastjerdi, the deputy from Tehran, who expressed her 
condolences on the death of the revered source of emulation, 
Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and mentioned a present problem of 
the country as the lack of a unified and correct management 
system. Emphasizing the sensitivity and difficulty of the 
present conditions, she said: Because of the lack of such a 
system, the best instruction, decrees, and plans do not result 
in the slightest action. 
  She said that the Five-Year Plan and the budget will be 
successful, provided the preparations and means for the 
implementation of these programs and also a strong management 
for its organization are available. 
  The speaker then emphasized the necessity of the existence 
of 
a balance of powers in decision making and planning and said: 
Our economic stability depends on the political and cultural 
stability of the country. 
  Ms. Dastjerdi added: Our sworn enemies also do not deny the 
fact that Iran has recently been the reviver of the religion of 
Islam in the world, and all that we state in the various parts 
of the world as the increasing property of Islam and even 
spirituality is the result of the sacred divine revolution of 
Iran. 
  She continued: The world today is ready to follow and 
requires a model, a model of economy, politics, culture, etc. If 
we are not able to offer the best practical models in these 
areas, other Islamic nations and even non-Islamic nations will 
win the match. 
  The speaker considered one of the most important issues in 
Islamic economy as conservation and avoiding waste and added: 
Unfortunately, despite all the emphasis by the Commander of the 
Faithful to his officials in regards to conservation, what is 
prevalent today is waste and what is not seen is conservation. 
Just a few days ago, we witnessed that the Ministry of 
Construction Jihad sent an invitation card on relatively large, 
high-quality paper with gold print and English on the back to 
270 Majles deputies for the first authentic Iranian Holstein Cow 
Festival, inviting all the deputies to this so-called festival. 
She pointed out: The annual import of 500,000 tons of paper into 
the country is significant, and the result is that this kind of 
useless paper distribution and printing of cards, invitations, 
and small and large magazines takes place. How can we say we 
obey Imam 'Ali, who at one time examined the treasury of the 
Muslims with the light of one candle? 
  Go to the offices and government centers in the morning. You 
will see most of the lights on in the bright daylight. Why is 
the energy and the treasury of the Muslims wasted without any 
consideration? 
  The speaker emphasized: The Majles must in its budgeting, 
aside from all interests, reduce the budget of every ministry in 
which there is more waste. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Tehran said: It is clear that 
when we control the flow of oil but others the price, it cannot 
be relied on as an important and reliable lever in economic 
planning, because it will create chaos and an imbalance in all 
planning. 
  She emphasized proper supervision by the Majles over the 
executive organizations. 
  In conclusion, with reference to the Ministry of Education, 
even though it is an educational matter, and especially since 65 
percent of its personnel are women, she said: Is it not 
religiously and logically more proper to have a woman as the 
minister of education? Even though we do not have a shortage of 
administrative and creative women, they speak of lack of 
experience of women at the upper management level. My question, 
is were the gentlemen born as ministers, or have they come to 
occupy these position gradually? What is wrong with some of the 
deputy ministers of education being women? 
<H5>  Ahmad Pishbin, Deputy From Baft </H5>
  The third pre-agenda speaker was Ahmad Pishbin, the deputy 
from Baft, who offered his condolences on the death of the 
revered source of emulation of the Shi'ites and, speaking of 
foreign currency situation, said: 
  The daily life of the various strata of people has been 
disrupted. Who is to be accountable for such chaos? On what 
basis have the economic planners deregulated the dollar and 
placed the existing foreign currency of the country at the 
disposal of capitalists, thereby causing problems and high 
prices? Would it not have been better, instead of using 
Western-style planning, for them to plan according to 
capabilities? Is it not better to put our efforts into a variety 
of exports and production? We must avoid unnecessary imports and 
make use of the resources of the country. Among the most 
important resources of this country are faith and belief of the 
people in the revolution, Islam, and religious guardianship. 
Through strong planning, the future must be drawn through 
reliance on God and without attention to the ideas and 
disruptions of global oppressors. 
  Referring to making agriculture active and creating jobs in 
the existing areas of every city, he said: Today, we are 
confused in the area of industrialization and the use of 
appropriate tactics in the progress of industry in the country. 
  Every powerful person and group has engaged in importing 
expensive machinery from various countries and displays the 
mirage of machine-manufacturing factories to the people. We have 
created a large consumer market for foreign countries. Hence, 
every day, the number of the unemployed increases and the price 
of the dollar increases. With the implementation of the 
modification plan, the weakest strata of the society will be 
sitting at home. 
  Referring to the discovery of embezzling gangs on various 
levels, he said: The people are waiting to see how the judicial 
organizations deal with these people. Would it not be better, 
before false and apparently legal ways are found for these 
individuals to be released by their partners, for the judicial 
organizations to put these individuals on trial openly and 
punish them, in order to both soothe the pain of the 
revolutionary people and serve as a warning to these who would 
continue the path of these individuals? 
  Referring to the problems of his constituency, Pishbin spoke 
about the problem of the shortage of chemical fertilizers and 
seeds, the high price of fodder, and the lack of government 
support for animal husbandry products. 
  He made reminders regarding the failure to pay for damages 
to 
the houses of the flood victims, the failure to build flood 
dams, the failure to distribute fuel in the region, and the 
severe shortage of doctors. 
  In conclusion, he asked for more attention by the officials 
to his constituency. 
<H5>  Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  The fourth and last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles 
yesterday was Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, the deputy from Tehran, who 
spoke about the question of Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, to 
the minister of interior concerning the "reason for not granting 
a march permit to the students of the Office of Strengthening 
Unity." The details were published in a RESALAT editorial this 
Monday. 
<H5>  Speech of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  After the speech of the president, the speaker of the Majles 
thanked him and said: Mr. Hashemi kindly presented to the Majles 
the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] national budget for two continuous hours, with his usual 
patience and perseverance. I also thank the honorable Cabinet, 
who were inspired by the president and with perseverance and 
24-hour efforts tolerated the burden more than in any other 
year. Every year, we want to prepare the next year's budget, and 
the gentlemen worked hard on the chapters this year. In 
addition, the Second Five-Year Plan is added to it. First, it 
appeared that examination of the Second Plan would negate the 
need for us and the honorable government to have a 1373 budget. 
  But, as the honorable president pointed out, the projection 
was that due to the fluctuation of the price of oil and other 
issues the Second Plan might not be presented to the Majles on 
time, and naturally in a short period of time it would be 
impossible to attend to the people's plan. Fortunately, with 
contacts and coordination with the president and his awareness, 
he reached the conclusion, and we did too, that we need to have 
the 1373 budget. This doubled the work of the honorable Cabinet, 
in addition to adding to the examination of the Second Plan. 
Hence, the generosity and kindness of Mr. Hashemi, the 
government, and the honorable ministers and experts is worthy of 
praise and gives us the opportunity to examine the budget bill 
and the Second Plan on the basis of the amended bylaws of the 
Majles (two rounds of discussion). This task will give the 
opportunity for more expert examination in both rounds of 
discussion in the Majles. We hope, as you pointed out and with 
the same patience and care that your honor and the government 
have used, God willing, our colleagues, with the same care and 
coordination and with the active presence of the honorable 
government experts, that we will be able to examine the budget 
law in the Majles within the period allowed by the new law and 
present it to the honorable government for implementation. Then 
we will complete the Second Plan more carefully in a period of 
one year. 
  In conclusion, the speaker of the Majles added: It seems 
that 
1373 is a completion for the First Five-Year Plan, or the fifth 
year of the First Five-Year Plan, which in practice makes no 
difference to us. 
<H5>  Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan </H5>
<H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. `Final Section' </H5>
  The meetings of the speaker of the Majles with the nobel 
people of the cities of Shadegan, Behbahan, and Ramhormoz were 
among the trips of Mr. Nateq-Nuri to this province. In each of 
these cities, the welcome was most enthusiastic. 
  Despite the deprivation that exists in Shadegan, this city 
has good and pleasant people. In this region, prior to the 
imposed war, the so-called Khalqi Arabs, whose purpose was to 
inflict disunity and conspiracy against beloved Khuzestan, faced 
the self-sacrifice of these same Arab people and were 
eliminated. With the empty support of these mercenaries, the 
Ba'thists wanted to separate Khuzestan from Iran, but they 
failed. 
  In the city of Behbahan, the friendly people closed down the 
city altogether and came to welcome the head of the Legislative 
Branch, an action that was nearly unprecedented in the history 
of that city. Among the interesting points in the city is the 
implementation of the reservoir dam of Marun, which is located 
19 km from Behbahan and was visited by the delegation. 
Ramhormoz, also like other cities, made a great deal of effort 
to host the friend and supporter of the Imam and the leader. In 
this city, a large Khuzestan cement factory has been built, 
which can expedite its economy. 
  In this city, a letter by a woman from Ramhormoz to the 
delegation attracted everyone's attention. The letter stated: 
"Despite the fact that all my possessions consisted of two 
pieces of gold, I gave one piece in response to the call of the 
leader for the people of Lebanon and I gave this one to the 
treasury, even though I am embarrassed for it is very 
insignificant." This woman could have stated her problems in 
this letter, but with generosity showed that such actions are 
higher than anything else. 
  On Wednesday morning, 17/09/1372 [8 December 1993], we left 
Ramhormoz to visit the Petrochemical Complex of Bandar-e Imam 
Khomeyni. This complex, which is one of the largest 
petrochemical complexes in the world and if the agents of global 
oppression would not cause disruption, our country would be 
rescued from dependence now, finally after Japan refused to 
complete this complex, our committed domestic experts along with 
the participation of some countries took steps to develop and 
operate it and were able to bring up to 70 percent of the 
capacity of this complex to operation. Now, various kinds of raw 
material for plastic industries, water pipes, plastic equipment 
for cars, and PVC production in this complex have reached 
operation. 
  On Thursday, that is, the last day of the trip, visits to 
Khorramshahr and Abadan became possible for the delegation. The 
heroism and resistance of the brave people of Khorramshahr and 
Abadan will never be forgotten. All the visits to the cities of 
the province are on one side, and the visit to these cities on 
the other. The people of the province must allow us to praise 
these two cities more, because Khorramshahr was the center of 
the war action. 
  The trend of reconstruction, especially in Khorramshahr, 
despite the fact that much work has been done, progresses slowly. 
  One of the reasons for the problems that Khorramshahr faces 
is lack of wealthy immigrants to this city. The governor of 
Khorramshahr told me: In this city, we have 10,000 people who 
receive regular pay from the Emergency Committee. They do not 
have the financial ability to complete the reconstruction of the 
residential housing and commercial buildings. Unfortunately, the 
immigrants who enjoy relative financial resources have not 
entered the city yet. Of course, their coming may be due to lack 
of treatment and health resources, water, sewage, recreational, 
cultural, and other resources, which is true to some extent. 
  Haj Aqa Nateq-Nuri said: To eliminate the problem of water 
and sewage of the cities of Khorramshahr and Abadan, 80 billion 
tomans is needed, and if this problem is not eliminated, it will 
be as if no reconstruction has taken place. In connection with 
the recreational and cultural resources, it is necessary to say 
that the speaker of the Majles inaugurated the construction of 
the "Khorramshahr Martyrs" Athletic Complex with 1.2 billion 
tomans in funds. Engineer Kamravi, deputy director of the 
Reconstruction Crusade of the province, said: This athletic 
center will be even larger than the large Azadi Stadium of 
Tehran. 
  With the news that the speaker of the Majles announced on 
behalf of the Cabinet, stating that the "government has 
increased the reconstruction funds in the 1373 budget bill by 15 
percent compared to last year," and also that the process of 
reconstruction will continue to the end of the Second Five-Year 
Plan, a wave of happiness overcame the people of Khorramshahr. 
  At 1900 on Thursday, 18/09/1372 [9 December 1993], in the 
residence of the delegation, the news of the death of the 
revered source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, 
overtook everyone with mourning, and no one felt like speaking. 
  In conclusion, it is necessary to express appreciation to 
the 
honorable speaker of the Majles, who was able to visit the 
cities and centers without any rest on the five-day trip, from 
0700 to 2030, to be with the people and officials. Also, during 
this visit, with his behavior towards the reporters, 
photographers, and cameramen, he showed that he especially 
values journalism and journalists. Also, we thank his office, 
the Security Affairs and News Affairs, who made their best 
efforts, and it is hoped that this visit will bring prosperity 
to the rich province of Khuzestan.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad, 
Kermanshah, Chenaran and Tarqobeh spoke as pre-agenda speakers. 
  Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the attention 
of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Qodsiyeh Seyyedi 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>
  The security the women in our country have under the shelter 
of Islam is unequaled in the world. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Ms. Seyyed 'Alavi, deputy from the Mashhad electoral 
district. During her speech she offered congratulations on the 
birth anniversary of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and 
also the birth anniversary of His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon 
him) in the lunar month of Rajab to the followers of those great 
one. Continuing, she said: Now, as we are about to compile and 
approve the Second Five-Year Plan in the Majles, it is 
appropriate, in view of the guidance from the exalted leader, 
with a proper view to the future and a study of the nation's 
existing resources, that we move in such a way that the real 
principles of the Islamic revolution will not be crushed under 
the wheels of economics, especially by the extravagance and 
dissipation of the executive officials and their programs. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Explicit attention has been 
given in the Constitution to women and their value and dignity. 
Now that the respected government has presented the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill and the Second Five-Year 
Plan to the Majles, it is the duty of the deputies, and 
especially the specialist commissions, to consider the guidance 
from the exalted leader. When compiling and allocating the 
budget, they must keep in mind the articles in the Constitution 
that pertain specifically to women and the family, especially 
with regard to the law enacted by the Majles concerning women 
and children without guardians. This year a suitable budget for 
that must definitely be provided. 
  In view of the measures taken so far to achieve social 
justice, reduce poverty and alleviate deprivation, the 
government, and especially the judiciary, must take serious 
steps to redistribute wealth and to stop parasitical behavior 
and hoarding. Continuing, the deputy from Mashhad said: Another 
issue is the evolution and growth of the Muslim woman since the 
revolution. With regard to the claims being made in the world in 
an attempt to damage the revolution, especially by the so-called 
human rights organizations concerning the lack of freedom or the 
failure to observe the rights of women in Iran, it must be said 
that world imperialism and these organizations who work 
hand-in-hand with America have not understood the issue. The 
real issue is the the evolution, which has taken place since the 
revolution thanks to the blood of the martyrs, the guidance from 
the Imam of the nation, God's mercy be upon him, and the real 
and righteous positions taken by the exalted leader in Iran's 
revolutionary society, especially among Muslim women. 
  She discussed the high divorce and abortion figures in the 
Western nations, as well as the lack of security for women in 
Western societies, figures that increase every year. She added: 
This summary shows the image of women in some Western nations 
and their behavior and how they are dealt with. Now let these 
people making false claims about human rights and this Mr. 
Galindopol come and make a realistic study without dependence on 
the world's empty world-devouring powers. Our respected women 
have great dignity and high standing in Iran's Islamic society. 
  If they do not regard as a violation of human rights the 
implementation of divine limits and commands, Almighty God's 
commands in the Glorious Koran and the sacred religious law, 
which penalize deviant individuals to prevent the growth of 
social corruption, the security the women in our country have 
under the shelter of Islam is unequalled in the world. If some 
of our women are subject to a small amount of oppression by the 
men, this has nothing to do with Islam. 
  She also called on the Ministry of Guidance and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs to use the relevant cultural centers and 
embassies to acquaint the world with the true Islamic 
revolutionary image of the sacrificing and loyal Muslim women. 
  Continuing, Seyyedi 'Alavi said: Now, as the rights and 
honor 
of women are being trampled in many societies and her only 
salvation is to turn to the orthodoxy of Islam, let us permit 
the Muslim Iranian women to remain a complete and proper model 
and example for the world. Let us not permit an incorrect 
interpretation of Islam to be made in some of the statements 
that come from the sacred Majles. 
  Abuses of the terms "human rights" and "women's rights" to 
settle international and purely political accounts are taking 
place in circumstances where the disgraced supporters of human 
rights have fallen silent on the crimes committed in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Israel, and other parts of the world. This has 
brought about aversion and repulsion in every nation. It is 
incumbent upon Muslim women to try to foster their own 
intellectual growth and productivity and to achieve their rights 
through greater understanding and awareness, and to make it 
possible for themselves to participate more in society while 
strengthening the position of families and family ties. 
  Continuing, she asked the officials in the judiciary to 
implement Article 49 of the Constitution and to cut off the 
leeches and economic terrorists and to punish them. She also 
asked the Medical System Organization to exercise diligent 
supervision over the writing of doctor and clinic prescriptions 
and signs, and to aggressively prevent the writing of sometimes 
false propaganda which misleads patients, using the necessary 
guidelines. 
  In conclusion the deputy from Mashhad added: Some of the 
things discussed by some of the brothers are not worthy of the 
Majles, which is at the head of the government. 
  It is necessary in many cases to observe international and 
social concerns, although we are all Muslims and we also accept 
Islamic regulations and laws. However, each one is situated in 
spacial and temporal circumstances. Issues related to corruption 
in society and the cultural invasion cannot be studied and 
reasoned about solely from the point of view of multiple spouses 
and temporary marriage. In a society where many people are 
unable to marry once, how can multiple spouses be the solution 
to the above problems? 
  In conclusion, she added: If we are Muslims, let us take as 
our example His Holiness Mohammad (peace be upon him), who did 
not take another wife as long as Her Holiness Khadijeh was 
alive, and Imam 'Ali (peace be upon him), who did not take 
another spouse as long as Her Holiness Faseleh was alive, and 
who truly regarded his spouse as his friend, companion and 
comrade-in-arms. 
<H5>  Akhtar Rokhshandeh, Deputy From Kermanshah </H5>
  The best way to fight the enemy cultural invasion is to keep 
the Islamic veil on our women. 
  The second pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Ms. Rokhshandeh, deputy from Kermanshah. During her 
speech she offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of 
His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon him). She said: Using 
comprehensive and future-oriented policies, one can stand up to 
the cultural invasion and American imperialism. If this policy 
is based as much as possible on a deep understanding of the 
history of the culture of traditions and national alertness in 
the country, it will be very important and much more valuable. 
Preservation of the Islamic veil for Muslim women, which 
bespeaks the high position of the powerful culture of the women 
in our country, is the best way to fight the imperialist 
cultural invasion. The culture of American imperialism is 
incapable of understanding the concepts of the Islamic 
revolution. It creates war in the name of peace. In the name of 
knowledge it spreads ignorance and unawareness. It fights 
religious activities in the name of religion. We must fight the 
policies of the culture of imperialism using the weapon of 
enjoining good and prohibiting evil. 
  Continuing, she discussed Salman Rushdie's meeting with the 
American president. She said: America must realize that nothing 
will be achieved in doing this other than provoking disgust in 
most Muslims and affirming their determination to carry out the 
order from our late Imam, may God have mercy on him, to execute 
Salman Rushdie. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Kermanshah said: Unfortunately, 
because of the imposed war the government has not invested in 
the western region, especially the province of Kermanshah, which 
has been ignored to a great extent. As a result, the youth of 
this province are suffering from unemployment and a shortage of 
welfare and educational resources. As you know, the greatest 
danger to youth, who are a matter of concern for the president 
of the republic, is unemployment. Therefore, government 
construction and startup of factories for production and mother 
industries is a necessity in order to create employment. 
  She called upon officials to start up the paper plant, 
expedite the province gas delivery project, internationalize the 
airport, and to carry out the project to study the nation's 
western railroads. 
  She then made the following points regarding the Second 
Five-Year Plan: The exalted leader's commands focus on the 
creation of social justice in society. We are now faced with the 
upheaval of the population increase. Since these societies must 
give priority to making educational, economic, social and 
political efforts in order to evolve, rapid population growth 
will prevent growth of the public social and welfare scales. I 
am therefore asking that this important issue in society be 
dealt with. There are problems evident in the nation's 
administrative systems which are causing anxiety. In the Second 
Five-Year Plan it is necessary that changes be made in the 
government's administrative and executive systems, and there 
must be real planning and supervision combined with the proper 
implementation of the laws. 
<H5>  Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Chenaran and Tarqobeh </H5>
  Have the economic planners yet achieved the goals of the 
economic adjustment? 
  The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Moradi, deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh. During 
his speech he said: It is not logical and just for us constantly 
to invite the public to fight imperialist military and cultural 
assaults, while a group of godless people and merchants are 
guiding and controlling the nation's economy and taking 
advantage of this disorderly situation. The government must not 
stand by and watch the perpetual growth in prices and the 
instability of the price of foreign exchange caused by 
profiteers and opportunists. The people are waiting for 
revolutionary and decisive measures and the removal of these 
individuals. 
  He added: Economic insiders and planners must give a 
satisfactory answer to the question of whether or not they 
anticipated this kind of situation in the framework of the 
theory of economic adjustment and unification of the foreign 
exchange rate, and whether or not they have yet reached the 
goals of the economic adjustment. Can they claim that 
unification and stabilization of the foreign exchange rate has 
been achieved? On what justification have those who know about 
the resources for procuring foreign exchange set up lines of 
foreign exchange brokers, and used the wealth belonging to 
future generations as a source of revenue? Those who have the 
slightest acquaintance with the basics of economics know well 
that the goal of this science is the best allocation of limited 
resources and making the most of minimal of resources for the 
purpose of answering to the nation's important and basic needs. 
It is thus clear and obvious that oil revenues must be spent on 
infrastructure investment and the nation's economic and 
industrial prosperity. They must not be spent to buy various 
kinds of consumer goods. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: One of the government's basic 
problems is extremism in economic and social policy. In a 
country where until recently all of what is needed for the lives 
of the people and for industry was controlled and supervised by 
the government, deregulation in this form means wasting several 
years of experience and effort. Currently many economic and 
social policies are not coordinated with each other, and this 
has caused unreasonable profiteering brokerage services to come 
into play in investments in the various economic sectors, and 
even investment in industry has been made to stop. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh said: 
The new changes and developments illustrate the bitter reality 
that in some cases we are still doing our economic planning 
using old, experimental and mistaken policies. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  The only item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was continued consideration of the details of the 
Proposed Law on Procedures for Punishing Individuals Who Engage 
in Unauthorized Activities in Audiovisual Affairs, whose 
articles were approved by the Majles. 
  Article 3: Agents engaged in the production, distribution,

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles held an open session last Sunday, and deputies of 
Shahreza, Mashhad, Maragheh, and Shabestar made speeches. Then 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri made a speech about the birthdays of 
his holiness 'Ali and his holiness Jesus, and then the Majles 
went into session. 
  Then the credentials of Mr. Mofattah from Razan were 
examined 
and ratified. We to call your attention the details of the 
discussions. 
<H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  In his speech, Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of 
the 
Majles, offered his congratulations on the birthday of his 
holiness, Jesus Christ, and asked all the Christians of the 
world not to allow during these days the massacre of Muslims 
such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the hand of false followers 
of his holiness in the Christian world, contrary to the lofty 
ideas of that divine prophet who was a prophet of justice and 
humanity. 
  He added: In the Christian world especially, why do the 
spiritual leaders of Christianity keep silent with regard to 
such crimes in the world and pass over such horrible crimes with 
indifference? Would Christ pass over so many crimes with 
indifference if he were here? 
  In another part of his speech, the speaker of the Majles 
offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali 
to all the Shi'ites in the world and said: Rajab 13 is the 
birthday of a revered human being who does not accept being a 
caliph because he seeks justice and finally, if he accepts the 
leadership of the Islamic nation, again it is because he seeks 
justice. [sentence as published] 
  Pointing out that the pious offspring of the Commander of 
the 
Faithful in the policies of the Second Five-Year Plan that he 
outlined follows the same goals (social justice) he said: It is 
the same social justice [which he shows] in the general policies 
that the grand leader of the revolution stated. We thank God 
that if we were not fortunate to live at the time of his 
holiness 'Ali, we live in the time of his pious offspring and 
leader of the revolution, who thinks like him and defends the 
suffering of history, and that we are in a Majles, which is the 
manifestation of 'Ali's justice. 
  He expressed hope that we will take steps to implement 
social 
justice and support for the oppressed, especially in examining 
the budget and the Second Five-Year Plan, which will soon start. 
Also, in our speech, behavior, and speeches from our podium, in 
our positions and in our meetings, we should observe justice and 
human rights and try to make the Majles a manifestation of 
'Ali's justice in the true sense of the word. 
  In conclusion, he offered his congratulations on the 
birthday 
of his holiness 'Ali to the [social] workers. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mojtaba Hashemi, Deputy From Shahreza </H5>
  In our country, most government subsidies are for 
imported items. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles on Sunday was Mr. Hashemi, the deputy from Shahreza, who 
offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali 
and said: Reaching the stage of social justice for which the 
true owners of the revolution are hungry and seeing their wishes 
in the words of the grand leader, especially the lines of the 
economic, cultural, and social policies of the Second Plan, 
makes careful examination and thinking about the developmental 
standards of the Second Plan of the regime a certainty. 
  The experience of developed countries can to some extent 
draw 
the curve and stages of development for us. 
  In continuation, he considered one of the most important 
characteristics of the Development Plan the setting of the 
financial and monetary framework of the regime and said: 
Determining this axis is in the area of foreign borrowing, 
raising the issue of privatization, controlling imports, 
creating a proper tax system, and expansinf exports. If it is 
uncoordinated with the financial system of the national economy, 
it will act as a double-edged sword. Using the experiences of 
developing countries and examining the causes of failure of many 
of the Latin American countries and the factor of success in the 
developing countries have made use of foreign borrowing 
resources. [sentence as published] The use of such resources is 
pursued with conditions, of which the most major expressed by 
the lending establishments and countries are the free commercial 
and economic markets of the borrowing country and securing 
democracy. Political freedom is for creating a free commercial 
system. On this basis, multinational companies that themselves 
have taken advantage of these funds under very simple conditions 
in raising this complex phenomenon, under the pretext of 
attracting investments in the developing countries, procure all 
their financial needs through the banking systems of the country 
in debt along with the clear difference in foreign currency in 
the region. [sentence as published] On the other hand, the 
interests from the activities of the so-called foreign 
investments within the framework of the progress of banks and 
financial establishments causes the free exit of large amounts 
gained every year through this system. In this manner, we see 
that the so-called developed countries of Latin America have 
about $400 billion in foreign debt today, whose annual interest 
is about $40 billion annually. Hence, we see that the transfer 
and escape of capital from these countries every year is about 
$35 billion, whereas in the Pacific region countries, we see 
that by creating an orderly banking system and using all banking 
and monetary resources and ultimately severely controling 
imports, large amounts of capital, especially in industrial 
production and commerce, are employed. These financial resources 
are mainly provided domestically and prepared from the savings 
of the people in a suitable environment towards a philosophy of 
export investment. 
  The deputy from Shahreza continued: The consumer model in 
these countries (the Pacific region) is strongly controlled. 
What we lack, despite the directions of the First Plan, are the 
necessary restrictions on the import of luxury items and the 
prevention of the capital outflow are handled with care in order 
that the use of these resources achieve development. Hence, 
absolute government power over the above-mentioned pivotal 
points, as the main driving force along with necessary controls, 
is one of the special priorities of a development program. 
  He added: A high percentage of these debts are paid under 
transferring technology and creating coordination and 
improvement of the monetary system to the borrowing countries. 
For example, in 1987, Argentina allotted $400 million of the 
loans it received to equip and revise its monetary system and 
computerize its Central Bank. 
  The largest portion of these loans ultimately is used to 
repay past loans. The creation of uncontrolled inflation due to 
the increase in the rate of foreign currency and the devaluation 
of domestic currency, failure to pay the interest on loans and 
to pay debts or delays result in the escape of capital and under 
special conditions when economic growth requires investment, it 
will cause foreign banks to increase their interest rates. 
  In conclusion, the speaker said: Protective policies of the 
lending companies, establishment of heavy taxes on the products 
of developing countries, and other protective measures prevent 
offerings and competition by developing countries. In our 
country, most government subsidies are allocated to import 
items. The question is, has foreign aid been effective in 
economic development? 
<H5>  Hoseyn Fattahi-Ma'sum, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>
  The next speaker was Fattahi, the deputy from Mashhad, who 
offered his congratulations on the blessed birthdays of his 
holiness 'Ali and his holiness Christ and, honoring Agricultural 
Development Week, said: Today, with the problem that so-called 
civilized humanity is facing and also the problems facing our 
Islamic country due to the cruel policies of global oppressors, 
having a model and example for the perpetuation of government 
and the life of people is very important and essential. The 
human-creating school of Islam, due to its ideological content, 
has offered clear methods and models in its practical dimensions 
as well. 
  He added: These questions are at issue before all the 
officials and people. If we claim to be Shi'ites and followers 
of 'Ali, like Osman ebn Hanif who was a friend of the Imam, are 
we not the target of the Imam's words and reprimands? Why do you 
have aristocratic banquets and sit at the glittering tables of 
aristocracy? If we truly consider ourselves the followers of 
Imam 'Ali and followers of religious guardianship, let us show 
with our sincere actions and with a national and general will, 
as was the view of our sire, 'Ali, and the statements of the 
grand leader, which have been all but forgotten, that we will 
avoid luxuries, waste, festivals, aristocratic ceremonies, 
experience seminars, and unnecessary travels abroad, and in 
keeping with the method and ways of being a Shi'ite of 'Ali 
implement simple living in all the offices, ministries, 
institutions, organizations, and everywhere in the country. 
  Dr. Fattahi then continued: If the Islamic Republic of Iran 
today cannot free itself through a general mobilization from the 
claws of domestic and foreign problems, can it claim that it has 
truly acted for the goals of Islam and followed 'Ali? 
  Why is it that with an annual foreign currency income of 
more 
than $16 billion it is unable to pay its debts on time? What 
factor has caused society to be lead on this course? 
  Of course, the fundamental essential investments and the 
efforts of the revered government officials and the president 
following the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, which 
was successful, must be remembered. Is the way to be free of 
these economic problems to move towards more borrowing and the 
creation of new obligations, or is it in preventing the futile 
waste of the foreign currency revenues on unnecessary projects 
and programs and avoiding various excesses of the organizations 
and institutions that require government foreign currency and 
the uncontrolled sale of foreign currency to the people? 
  Requesting that the officials supervise the uncontrolled 
import of goods, he also asked all the officials who somehow are 
responsible for supervising the current affairs of the country 
to increase their investigation and supervision and deal 
decisively, like 'Ali, with the violators, economic terrorists, 
embezzlers, and bribery gangs. 
  He added: On the one hand, I request that the economic 
planners of the country devise their course of action on the 
path of raising production and revenues and conserving 
expenditures and avoiding excessive waste in the offices. They 
should not think that by raising prices and putting pressure on 
the shoulders of the oppressed and downtrodden classes in 
society we can follow the correct economic path. Has anyone 
thought about who must tolerate all this economic pressure? Will 
the increase in the cash flow of the ministries and companies 
not be followed by excessive expenditures and waste? 
  Will this method not cause a small number to become rich and 
a large number of low-income people to be harmed more than ever 
before? 
  Continuing, Dr. Fattahi pointed out the issue of 
self-management and the bill of general insurance, which is the 
basis of the Plan: The spirit and basis of this bill was the 
transfer and sale of nonteaching government hospitals to the 
private sector or insurance companies, and the teaching 
hospitals must be self-sufficient, as stated in Note 10 of the 
budget bill. 
  The question is, is insuring people and providing general 
insurance only possible through the sale of hospitals to the 
private sector or collecting heavy treatment expenditures from 
people in the educational hospitals? 
  The deputy of Mashhad then, in regarding the issue of oil, 
referred to the policies set by the grand leader and, addressing 
the related officials, said: Why do you not revise oil policies 
in order to eliminate dependence of this important industry on 
Western countries? Why should OPEC headquarters be in Austria? 
Why should we not try, as a revolutionary country with the help 
of other oil rich countries that are mostly in the Middle East, 
to foloow the idea of the leader of the revolution and think 
about honor and dignity through oil in the world? 
<H5>  Mostafa Seyyed Hashemi, Deputy From Maragheh </H5>
  When the response to the Majles deputies is issued 
after one year by the ministries, how do they deal with the 
letters and requests of ordinary people? 
  The third speaker was Hashemi, from Maragheh, who offered 
his 
congratulations on the birthday of the Commander of the Faithful 
and said: Our people know that the Islamic revolution of Iran 
has central and fundamental principles, which are molded with 
the blood of the nation and have forever drawn the perspective 
of domestic and foreign policy. This revolutionary and political 
enthusiasm has been manifested in the slogans of independence, 
freedom, and Islamic Republic. He then continued: We must know 
that the struggle of the Iranian people against the United 
States is not a slogan struggle, but our struggle is a Koranic 
and principled struggle that has ideological roots. 
  The government must think about the unhealthy economic 
relations, discrimination, poverty and unemployment, 
bureaucracy, law breaking, creating jobs that are among the 
effective factors in poverty and deprivation, addiction to 
narcotics, smuggling, migration, decrease in agriculutural 
production, and growth of false jobs. It must take steps in the 
area of jobs and job opportunities for unemployed youth who are 
at a critical age. For this purpose, the ground for investments 
in industry and production must be prepared. Both in theory and 
practice, we must think about education and the universities of 
the country that are a fundamental and rooted principle for the 
training of expert manpower. It should not be that our 
high-school and college graduates do not benefit from scientific 
learning and use of individual and social life without being 
armed by any kind of skill, merely pursuing an education to 
receive a degree. [sentence as published] In continuation, the 
speaker criticized the system of bureaucracy left over from the 
monarchical regime and said: We have a system of a Ministry of 
Agriculture, Ministry of Construction Jihad, environmental 
health, welfare, the Imam's Emergency Committee, and Ministry of 
Post with 5,000 postal workers. [sentence as published] And we 
have a parallel to the Ministry of Post in other organizations 
with several times the above-mentioned people. Today, science 
and 14 years of experience tell us that any parallel system, in 
fact, rather than having a positive effect has a destructive 
effect. Mr. President, the people are happy with the changes you 
made in bureaucracy in terms of the issuance of passports, 
drivers' licenses, birth certificates, etc. These steps were 
necessary but not sufficient. When the response to the honorable 
deputies of the Majles is issued by ministries after more than 
one year, how are the letters and requests of ordinary people 
dealt with? 
  He then said: You (president) know better than anyone that 
administrative change must be at the top of the agenda and 
programs of the government. The unprincipled behavior of some of 
the organizations with clients must be investigated. As God is 
my witness, if this continues, the people may get tired. We must 
not stall the people. I swear to God, the people are noble. 
  In conclusion, he made reminders to the minister of roads 
and 
transport concerning the establishment of flights to Sahand 
Airport, preparing division plans, and expediting people's 
building permits to the Ministry of Housing. 
<H5>  Hasan Aminlu, Deputy From Shabestar </H5>
  Hasan Aminlu from Shabestar, as the last pre-agenda speaker, 
offered his congratulations to the social workers of the country 
and said: The Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget were presented to the Majles late. 
This budget, which was supposed to be presented to the Majles on 
15 Azar [6 December], was completed after a 15-day delay. A 
cursory study of the above-mentioned budget shows problems and 
weaknesses, and it is noteworthy that certainly on the days that 
we shall have a discussion of the budget, we shall deal with the 
details. Referring to Notes 25 and 29 of the 1373 budget, he 
said: A cursory study of the chapters concerning social affairs 
clearly reveals that divisions are not balanced. In this year's 
budget, in social affairs, we had a growth of 22 percent. This 
increase, when divided among various chapters, is unbalanced. 
  He continued: Of this 22 percent, 66 percent is allocated to 
social security and welfare, 48 percent to training and affairs 
of the youth, 41 percent to culture and art, 26 percent to 
higher education, 25 percent to education, 24 percent to urban 
development, 24 percent to the environment, 13 percent to rural 
development and 12 percent to health and treatment [percentages 
as published]. The least growth that exists in the 1373 
developmental budget is the budget for health and treatment. 
  Aminlu then referred to the deputies' reminders to the 
health 
and treatment sectors and pointed out: With the ratifications of 
the budget, when it is too late, reminders do not mean anything 
anymore. If the deputies want to create just distribution in 
these sectors so that later it would not be necessary to make 
reminders, they must look at it when writing the budget. 
  Thirty percent of the budget growth of health and treatment, 
if we take into consideration 22 percent inflation, means a 
19-percent decrease in the growth in this sector. Hence, next 
year in the developmental chapter, in our health and treatment 
section, I warn you right now, we shall have an absolute 
stoppage. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles on Sunday was examinating the credentials of Mohammad 
Mehdi Mofattah from Razan. 
  First the report of the Investigation Committee concerning 
his credentials was read as follows: 
  The election file of Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah from Razan, 
which was referred to the Investigation Committee due to the 
objection by Mr. Naqba'i, was examined in numerous sessions and 
now the report is presented to the Majles. Based on the final 
minutes of the lieutenant governor's office of Razan, the 
election were held on 29/05/1372 [19 June 1993] with the 
formation of 165 registration centers. The total votes were 
29,762: of that Seyyed Abolqasem Hasani-Tabataba'i had 15,221 
votes; and Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, 14,183 votes. [figures 
as published] As a result of eight objections made to the 
Executive Committee and their being sent to the above-mentioned 
Council of Guardians, on two occasions representatives were sent 
to Razan electoral region, and a number of ballot boxes were 
invalidated. As a result, Mr. Tabataba'i's votes decreased to 
12,954. Hence, Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah, with 14,155 votes, 
gained the majority of votes and was introduced to the Majles as 
a Majles deputy. Due to Mr. Naqba'i's objection in the Majles, 
the above-mentioned case was sent to the Investigation 
Committee. After listening to the statements of Mr. Naqba'i and 
also the reasons of the member of the Council of Guardians, the 
committee sent a three-member delegation to Razan. The 
above-mentioned delegation, after contacting the officials of 
the election regions, the people of those areas, and also the 
dispatched representative of the Council of Guardians, submitted 
a detailed report to the committee. The Investigation Committee, 
after hearing the delegation's report regarding the most 
important objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the invalidation 
of six ballot boxes, based on Article 20 of the law of the 
supervision of the Council of Guardians over Majles elections, 
considered the opinion of the Council of Guardians regardings 
the invalidation of ballot boxes as the final opinion and the 
matter was closed by them. 
  In other instances of the objections by Mr. Naqba'i, the 
opinion of the committee is as follows: In Paragraphs 1 and 6, 
the rejection of the competence of the candidates is determined 
by the Council of Guardians. In regards to Paragraph 2, support 
of executive elements for the elected candidate was not proved. 
In regards to Paragraph 3, the participation of well-known 
people in the campaign and the use of well-known figures, if 
true, is not prohibited by law. In regards to Paragraph 4, there 
are generalizations that have not been proved. And in regards to 
Paragraph 7, the ballot boxes have generally been examined and 
no violations observed. 
  It should be pointed out that there is no protest concerning 
the competence of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah. Finally, the 
committee, after hearing the statements of Mr. Mofattah and 
holding six sessions, voted by secret ballot and announced the 
following results: 
  Total votes, 11; supporting, 9; opposing, 1; abstentions, 1. 
Hence, the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah were 
ratified. 
  Then Naqba'i defended his objections and expressed his 
objection regarding the credentials of the deputy from Razan. 
Then Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah defended his credentials, which 
were ratified by the Investigation Committee, and considered Mr. 
Naqba'i's protest baseless. 
  It is interesting that then Mr. Mohassel-Hamadani defended 
the credentials of Mr. Mohammad Mehdi Mofattah and rejected the 
objection of Mr. Naqba'i concerning the procedure of the 
elections in Razan. Then his credentials were put to a vote and 
ratified with 121 supporting votes by the Majles. 
  The next item on the agenda was the proposal to extend the 
content of the law of landlords and tenants to the offices of 
physicians that was returned from the Council of Guardians, 
which was amended in the open session of the Majles on Sunday. 
  According to this amendment, two notes were attached to 
Article 2 of the law of the relations of landlords and tenants 
ratified in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984]. 
  In Note 1, the collection of any sort of fee under the 
heading of lock money in the rented offices and transfer of the 
physician offices to others, if not mentioned in the text of 
agreement between landlord and tenant, is prohibited. 
  Also, the use of residential places in places that in the 
landlord and tenant agreement it is not stated to be used as a 
physician's office is prohibited without the consent of the 
owner. 
  Also in this session, the proposal exempting the 
ratifications concerning the internal bylaws of the Majles from 
the content of Article 2 of the civil law as very urgent was 
presented to the Majles and its urgency was ratified. 
  It is interesting that according to the article of the civil 
law, the law must be implemented 15 days after it is published 
throughout the country. The next item on the agenda of the open 
session of the Majles on Sunday was the proposal to amend Note 1 
of the law of the employment status of the martyred, 
self-sacrificing, and freed prisoners of war employees ratified 
on 16/06/1372 [17 August 1993]. First, its very urgent status 
was put to a vote. Prior to that, Mr. Gharibani, the deputy from 
Ardabil, said: This proposal on the employment status of the 
employees of the martyrs families was presented to the Majles 
with more than 80 signatures. Our opinion is that this very 
urgent proposal be ratified prior to the discussion of the 
budget in the Majles, because if after the ratification of the 
budget there is a financial burden, the gentlemen will not 
succeed. Then, the very urgent status was put to a vote and not 
ratified. Then an urgent status of the proposal was put to a 
vote and ratified by the Majles. 
  The next proposal was the urgent amendment of Articles 16 
and 
20 of the law of documents and property records, which was 
ratified by the deputies. It is noteworthy that Articles 16 and 
12 concerning the period of protest in regards to property to be 
registered, claims related to the protest to the boundaries of 
the property requested for registration, protests by neighbors, 
number of times of protest, the situation of protests after 
notification, and the period..., respectively. 
<H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5>
<H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Hazrati, Deputy From Rasht </H5>
  Mr. Hazrati, in the early moments of the open session on 
Sunday, referring to Article 147 of the internal bylaws, made a 
bylaws reminder and said: My question to the honorable minister 
of interior was supposed to be discussed today in the open 
session, and it was said that he was on a trip and whenever he 
is free he is supposed to act on these bylaws. Mr. Nateq-Nuri 
said: The day that the president spoke about the plan in the 
Majles, your question was on the agenda of the Majles. But his 
speech was long and you agreed that the Majles was tired. Today, 
also, we had put it on the agenda of the Majles, but it was 
reported that he is accompanying the president on a trip, and we 
will certainly put it on the agenda for Tuesday. 
<H5>  Bylaws Reminder of Mr. Noruzi </H5>
  Engineer Noruzi, in a bylaws reminder concerning his 
question 
to the minister of industries, said: Since Azar [22 November-21 
December], almost simultaneous with the question of Mr. Hazrati, 
I posed a question. It was also published, but was not put on 
the agenda. Now, in regards to Mr. Hazrati, due to the absence 
of the minister of interior, there was no opportunity. But my 
question has not been published in the weekly agenda, either. 
  The speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said in this 
regard: According to the new bylaws, a question that is given to 
me is given to the committee. The committee invites your honor 
to speak there. The procedure that was acted on on the basis of 
the decree of the Imam was made into a bylaw. After examination 
in the committee it will be given to us. Now, we will 
investigate to see whether or not the committee has pursued the 
matter.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. The Majles held an open session yesterday with 
Mr. Nateq-Nuri presiding. First Mr. Majdara made a speech. Then 
the speaker of the Majles spoke about the crimes of the Serbs 
against the innocent Muslims of Bosnia and the false claims of 
the human rights assemblies and Europeans concerning human 
rights, which was published in yesterday's issue. Then the 
question of Mr. Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, to the minister 
of interior was discussed. We call to your attention the details 
of the Majles discussion. 
<H5>  Selection From the Majles </H5>
<H5>  Speech </H5>
  The only speaker was Mr. Majdara, the deputy from Babolsar, 
who spoke about the visit of the president to Mazandaran 
Province and the unprecedented welcome of the people of that 
province to the president. He then referred to the potential 
resources of the rich province of Mazandaran in agriculture, 
fisheries, forests, lumber, and industry and pointed out the 
importance of attention to the transit road of this province 
with the Central Asian countries. The reason for Mr. Majdara 
being the only speaker yesterday was that the open session began 
at 0900 and the reason for the delay was mentioned as being the 
open discussion concerning the economic issues of the country 
and the procedure for the examination of the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget. 
<H5>  Question of Hazrati to the Minister of Interior </H5>
  Mr. Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, asked the minister of 
interior about the reason for the Ministry of Interior not 
agreeing to the march on 11 Aban [2 November] by the Islamic 
Society of the Universities in Tehran. The minister of interior 
responded: Based on the law, we are obliged to give a marching 
permit on 13 Aban [4 November] to only one institution. The 
Cultural Council was the institution that had obtained a permit 
to march and had organized all groups, including the student 
groups, for 13 Aban. He said: The main reason for the refusal 
was that we must say one thing and have one slogan, whereas they 
had separated themselves from the people and shouted slogans 
against the government and the values of the revolution. 
  The minister of interior's response was not considered 
satisfactory to Hazrati, and the issue was referred to the 
Articles 88 and 90 Committee. 
<H5>  Mohammad Majdara, Deputy From Babolsar </H5>
  Investment in fundamental affairs in the Province of 
Mazandaran brings a return three times that of other areas. 
  The only pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles 
yesterday was Majdara, the deputy from Babolsar, who offered his 
congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali and said: 
The noble people of the tulip-growing province of Mazandaran in 
the past five days engaged in an enthusiastic and unprecedented 
welcome, the likes of which had not been seen very often in the 
history of the province. This welcome once again revived in the 
minds of the people the exciting memory of the arrival of the 
grand leader of the revolution during his presidency. Once 
again, the ever-green domain of 'Ali had come to welcome the 
pious slave of God, the old friend of the Imam, the brother of 
the leader and the concerned lover of the people, Ayatollah 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. [sentence as published] 
  Describing the unprecedented welcome of the president on the 
part of the people of the province of Mazandaran, he said: 
Undoubtedly, this great maneuver of the people in their presence 
once again on the scenes of strengthening their covenant with 
the regime will never go unnoticed by the aware expert eyes of 
domestic and foreign political circles and they will bow to the 
divine strength of the nation and the just rulers. In addition 
to this important matter, what was observed in this fruitful 
visit everywhere was the unity and solidarity among the 
religious scholars, the clerics, the Friday and congregational 
imams, and the officials of the province and the coordination 
and unity between the valued Shi'ite and Sunni people, which 
according to the president is glory rarely seen in history for 
the religion of Islam. 
  He then referred to the gains of this visit, including 
emphasis on and issuance of permits to build and complete the 
parts of the province, the dam-building projects to harness 
water, and emphatic emphasis on carrying out and examining the 
essential 11 important demands of all the deputies and added: 
Mazandaran has a great share in the gross national product and 
provides an important part of the essential goods of the 
country, including rice, meat, wheat, soybeans, cotton, marine 
products, and lumber. 
  Hence, with this God-given gift, as the president said, 
investment in this rich province in fundamental affairs will 
have three times the results and profit of other areas, and in 
this connection, it is necessary for the economic planners and 
thinkers of the country to prefer in the essential investments 
of the country the province that has more of these added value 
characteristics in order to overcome the present economic 
problems of the country. 
  The speaker also said in conclusion: We consider it 
obligatory, before God and the beloved responsible people, on 
behalf of all the revered people in the province, the revered 
clerics, and all the officials and people of the province of 
Mazandaran, to thank the president and his companions. May his 
blessed and fruitful visit be a new chapter in the economic 
development of the province and release Mazandaran from the 
70-year-old deadlock following the political and administrative 
changes of the northern neighbors in the Second and Tenth Plan 
of the future of Islamic Iran. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
  Educational and cultural establishments and units that 
are not licensed will be closed. 
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was the "proposal to exempt the ratification 
concerning the internal bylaws of the Majles from the content of 
Article 2 of the civil law." First, its general points were 
ratified and then its details were discussed and ratified by the 
deputies. 
  Single article. All the ratifications concerning the 
internal 
bylaws of the Majles shall be implemented immediately after 
final ratification. This ruling also applies to this single 
article. 
  The third item on the agenda was a report on the second 
round 
of discussions of the Judicial and Legal Affairs Committee 
concerning the bill on the closure of educational, research, and

<H5>  Question of Hazrati to the Minister of Interior </H5>
  My question is clear, and a copy of it is available to the 
deputies: What is the reason for the Ministry of Interior 
preventing the march of the students of the Islamic societies of 
the Tehran universities on 11 Azar 1372 [2 December 1993], which 
was supposed to take place from the University of Tehran to the 
spy nest? We had a meeting in the committee with the minister. 
He gave some explanation in regards to having been informed too 
late, and for this reason the issue was denied, which was not 
satisfactory from our point of view. 
<H5>  Response of the Minister of Interior </H5>
  Then the minister of interior responsed: Every phenomenon 
has 
a crystallization and manifestation and has a series of 
standards and measures. As our revolution is an Islamic 
revolution and Islam is a part of the essence of our revolution 
and inseparable from the revolution itself, fighting injustice, 
oppression, and heathenism is a part of the essence of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  He added: Because the crystallization of so much oppression, 
injustice, aggression, and interference in the internal affairs 
of countries is an attribute of American imperialism, fighting 
the United States is in the nature of our Islamic revolution. 
Fighting the United States has been, is, and will be a part of 
the Islamic revolution from the beginning. 
  Today, at the head of all the affairs, the grand leader, 
Ayatollah Khamene'i, who as the manifestation, spokesman, 
symbol, and leader, clarified the policy of the Islamic 
revolution, which is a continuation of the policy determined by 
the founder of the Islamic Republic, the late Imam, and the 
government continues this course without question and has based 
the direction of its social and foreign policies on it. The 
minister of interior continued: Hence, such statements and 
discussions must be made elsewhere, not here. Those factors that 
caused us not to agree to the parallel march that the Students 
for the Strengthening of Unity had suggested were mostly these. 
If our nation is united, as the most powerful phenomenon, this 
can stop any aggression and neutralize open and secret 
opposition to this unity. And we find this to be desirable. If 
it were not agreed to on that day, the main reason was that we 
must, like others, submerge ourselves in the endless sea of the 
nation and say the same thing and have the same slogan. 
  He also said: I am not in a position to want to give advice 
to anyone. I must defend what I did. Based on the same report, 
then, Mr. Hazrati said: Mr. Besharati said in the committee that 
we agree to any march against America, but I received the 
request of the students a bit too late. There is sufficient 
reason and evidence that the students submitted the request one 
week before, and on the basis of the request of the students of 
Tehran universities, which took place on 05/08/1372 [27 October 
1993] and was presented in writing to the Ministry of Interior 
on the 10th, upon the instructions of the minister, it was 
pointed out that with regard to the Islamic Student Societies of 
the universities throughout the country, based on Letter No. 
5467, dated 05/08/1372, requesting coordination with law 
enforcement forces, etc., the minister did not agree with the 
above-mentioned ceremonies. Following this issue, unfortunately, 
the governor-general's office of Tehran also issued a 
pseudomarshal law communique stating that if such a march takes 
place, they will do thus and so to deal with it. And since it 
was not agreed to, the students did not march. 
<H5>  The Question of Mr. Hazrati in Response </H5>
  Hazrati again added: My question is, first, where in the law 
is the statement that 10 days or a week earlier it must be 
announced and the request made? Second, based on the 
Constitution, all assemblies and marches are permitted, provided 
they are not contrary to the fundamentals of Islam. Yes, it 
would have been better to carry out the ceremonies altogether 
and in a unified way. This is a bit of advice from all of us. 
The same advice was also made in previous years. The differences 
in methods and tastes in our country are a reality that has 
existed, exists, and will exist. In previous years also, we have 
had problems among the Muslim groups who support the Islamic 
revolution. No matter what label and accusation we make, they 
are interested forces and are endorsed by the grand leader. They 
also had marches in the previous years. Sometimes in the morning 
one group marched and in the afternoon another. What happened 
this year, when that infamous letter was published and such 
accusations made against the Islamic Republic? We must encourage 
the students and the Muslim forces and our various strata to 
come and show themselves and declare their positions. At such a 
time, upon the anniversary of the capture of the spy nest, 
should we oppose the students? Then, in one place we say that we 
received it too late and in another place, on the basis of the 
directive of RESALAT newspaper and the revered brother who 
expressed his kindness to us here, we speak of unity and 
solidarity, and for this reason decide our opposition to one 
group carrying out its duty. We cannot stop the action of one 
group unless we have strong evidence that the march is contrary 
to security issues and contrary to Islamic goals. We cannot 
deprive the person who has not listened to my advice as a deputy. 
<H5>  Counter Response of the Minister of Interior </H5>
  Mr. Besharati counter responded: We thank Mr. Hazrati for 
announcing what happened in the committee, partially. I have 
come here on the basis of my legal duty. I consider myself 
responsible and consider it my duty to respond to Mr. Hazrati, 
but I do not consider myself responsible to convince him, as 
this cannot be done, because we presented the best evidence in 
the committee, but when he is not going to be convinced, it is 
not. Now, no matter how many reasons, 70, 80, 100, or 200, you 
provide, it will have no effect, and it is not our purpose to 
give reasons in this regard that will convince him. We consider 
the Majles responsible when we must come and respond. 
  He continued: First, I should say that I read a letter from 
the Islamic Propaganda Coordinating Council that requested a 
march on 13 Aban [4 November]. The date the late Imam was sent 
into exile, the day of fighting global oppression, the day of 
the occupation of the American spy nest, which the Imam called 
the Second Revolution, is a very great day. That day must 
certainly be revived along with the positions that we have 
against the imperialists. They wrote: "While wishing you 
increasing success, in reference to the circular letter of the 
honorable president, which is attached, the organization, 
management, and responsibility of holding all the public and 
official ceremonies and marches is conferred on the Islamic 
Propaganda Coordinating Council." Hence, as the official in 
charge of the Ministry of Interior, I give permission to one 
organization to march, and that is the Islamic Propaganda 
Coordinating Council, and no one else, under no title, name, 
flag, central council, or anything else. 
  He then read the continuation of the letter of the Islamic 
Propaganda Council Organization: "Hence, considering the 
approaching ceremonies of 13 Aban, the anniversary of the exile 
of the great leader of the revolution, Precollegiate Students' 
Day, the day of the capture of the spy nest, and the day of 
national struggle against global oppressors, for which every 
year special ceremonies are held in Tehran and throughout the 
country, this year, too, in order to hold the ceremonies in a 
more coordinated and magnificent manner, a headquarters composed 
of students and precollegiate students, institutions, and 
people's assemblies has been established in this council, and 
so-and-so is in charge of the Central Headquarters of the 13 
Aban [4 November] ceremonies in regards to the coordination and 
follow-up of the tasks. Hence, it is requested that you issue 
the necessary instructions and introduce the person on that 
council and the permit to hold the above-mentioned ceremonies 
from 1300 to 1800 on 13/08/1372 [4 November 1993] in front of 
the spy nest. Thank you, Ahmad Jannati, representative of the 
Religious Guardian and secretary of the Islamic Propaganda 
Coordinating Council. Hence, our basis is this circular letter, 
and this is what is legal to us. We can give one institution a 
permit to march. Second, based on this circular letter, you were 
a member of this headquarters and changed your path midway. It 
is not our duty to protect everyone in every case and give 
permission to march or provide facilities. Mr. Besharati 
continued: The day that I presented the proposal here, we made 
the center of the policies three things: power, law, and good 
treatment of the people. We must advance on the basis of the 
law. The law has made us responsible for being present here. The 
law has told us what is our duty with regard to issuing march 
permits. Now, some people come and instead of 13 Aban [4 
November] declare 11 Aban [2 November] as the day of struggle 
against global oppressors. It is like the man who performed his 
Friday prayers on Wednesday. It is like announcing 21 Bahman [10 
February] as the day of the crumbling of the palaces of 
injustice and oppressors. We shall not allow it. We have another 
duty. Most humbly, Ayatollah Jannati requested a permit from me, 
and we gave permission for the march. The totality of 
institutions and organizations that have a share in this issue 
are members of this headquarters. You are responsible for your 
own work. You should have gone and coordinated it. We did not 
permit it to protect you. Our forces came. That day, you had a 
gathering without a permit. This gathering also needs a permit. 
And you changed the day of struggle against global oppressors 
and U.S. imperialism in the whole world to a conference or a 
seminar or a gathering against the government and questioned the 
values of the revolution. You made statements that were not in 
support of the government, this society, these people, and the 
revolution. You break the people's hearts so soon. You separate 
your way so soon. It is unfortunate. Where do we want to go? If 
the people are the basis, then why did you not join the people? 
Do we not all say that we are obedient to and emulate the 
founder of the Islamic Republic and do we not all follow the 
statements and directives of the Imam, the straight path of the 
revolution, forever? Did the Imam not say that the basis for 
opinion is the people? Our children were there. They said there 
were a total of about 1,000 people. Is this good? Does this 
strengthen our society or is the prestige of the revolution 
protected? These dear students who broke the awesome image of 
the United States, exposed its documents, and showed to the 
whole world what the United States has done in independent 
countries under the pretext of its embassy. That was a very 
great day. But that action will never be a justification for 
those who want to put the values of the revolution on trial. The 
revolution will not allow anyone to evaluate its work. Who was 
made happy with what you did that day, U.S. imperialism or the 
families of the martyrs, or the owners of the revolution? You 
ask me one question. I ask you 50 questions. So many complaints 
from the families of the martyrs have come to the Ministry of 
Interior asking why we allow such statements against the most 
sacred individuals of the country. In this country, the 
government is obedient to the leader. When you question an 
institution or organization, you are questioning all the values 
of the revolution. And my last word is that not only do I defend 
not granting a permit, but also by the help of God, if I am 
alive and remain a minister, I will not give a permit next year 
or the following year, either. 
  It is interesting that after Mr. Besharati, the minister of 
interior, statements were finished, Mr. Hazrati, the deputy from 
Rasht, announced that the response of the minister of interior 
was not satisfactory, and the issue was referred to the 
Investigation of Questions Committee. 
<H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5>
  Elyas Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, regarding the reciting 
of the sacred verse by the minister of interior, in a Majles 
internal bylaws reminder said: In regards to the verse that Mr. 
Besharati recited in connection with my question, it is about 
the heathens and hypocrites. I need 10 minutes to respond, in 
accordance with the law. 
  Dr. Ruhani said in response: Mr. Besharati certainly did not 
mean to insult Mr. Hazrati. He wanted to use that verse as an 
example without intending to make a comparison. He wanted to 
say, in some cases no matter how much effort is made, no results 
are gained. And he wanted to say, I feel no matter how much I 
reason, the other side is not concerned. (In examples, 
similarities are not necessary. One similarity is sufficient.) 
This question of yours will go to the committee and be discussed 
again and will ultimately come to the Majles. The fact that you 
made an objection, you should have confessed immediately. I 
think later some people came and talked to you and gradually you 
reached this conclusion. Otherwise, you could have responded 
then. After all, this issue too place during the administration 
of Mr. Nateq-Nuri, and he must make a decision. 
  The deputy speaker then addressed Mr. Qomi, the deputy from 
Varamin, and said: Mr. Qomi, Mr. Hazrati is articulate and does 
not need your help. 
  The open session of the Majles yesterday started at 0900, 
later than the regular time. The report of our correspondent 
indicates that during this period, the deputies, considering the 
changes made in the internal Majles bylaws and the change to two 
rounds of discussions, discussed the procedures for examining 
the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles held an open session yesterday and the deputies from 
Tabriz, Karaj, Tehran, and Torbat Heydariyyeh made speeches. 
Then Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri made a speech on the occasion of 
the martyrdom of the revered daughter of his holiness 'Ali, 
Zeynab Kobra, and the Majles went into session. 
  We call to the attention of our dear readers the details of 
the discussions. 
<H5>  Selections From the Majles </H5>
<H5>  Speeches </H5>
  Ms. Amirshaqaqi, the deputy from Tabriz, said: Privatization 
in our country is not realistic. 
  Continuing, she said: The Majles must follow the statements 
of the grand leader concerning social justice and not allow high 
prices to break the back of the weak. 
  Dr. Sadr, the deputy from Tehran, spoke on the role of 
students and, commenting on revising and paying deep attention 
to the educational system in the universities, added: Students 
must be actively present in political issues. 
  Tavassolizadeh, the deputy from Torbat Heydariyyeh, said: 
Why 
do we not devise a clear policy for agricultural products? 
  Dr. Zali, the deputy from Karaj, focused on fully observing 
priorities in the examinations of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget and the Second Plan and said: The directives 
of the grand leader concerning social justice, attention to 
agriculture, the growth of exports, and a foreign policy based 
on dignity, wisdom, and our interests must be followed. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
  The amount of 5 billion tomans from the unused funds in the 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget will be spent on 
repairing the damages due to unexpected incidents and ground 
preparation to relocate the people. City Halls governing a 
population of more than 50,000 are responsible to take 
appropriate steps to create passenger terminals outside the 
cities. 
  The Majles ratified a clarification concerning the 
coordinated system of payment of government employees. 
<H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the Majles, in a 
speech in the open session of the Majles yesterday, said: I 
offer my condolences on the death of the brave daughter of his 
holiness 'Ali, Zeynab Kobra, to his holiness Mahdi and the 
Islamic nation, particularly the women in our Islamic society, 
those ladies who in the course of the war and the revolution 
carried out their mission well, continued the path of the 
revered lady on the field of battle, and today follow that great 
lady. May God grant us all success in gaining inspiration from 
the school of these great human beings in history to defend 
Islam, the Koran, and the ideology. 
<H5>  Farrokhtaj Amirshaqaqi, Deputy From Tabriz </H5>
  Privatization in our country is not realistic. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was Ms. Amirshaqaqi, from Tabriz, who offered 
her congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali and, 
referring to the Second Five-Year Plan, said: The Majles intends 
by a careful and overall examination to increase its strength. 
Of course, this is not possible except through criticizing the 
weaknesses of the First Plan and also verifying its strengths. 
The First Plan, despite its strong points, suffers from two 
important weaknesses. (A) The length of the schedule. As I said 
before, the time schedule of the Plan at the present does not 
conform to the scientific model of mid-term plans, especially 
for a country undergoing a period of reconstruction. 
  She added: At the present time, what must be given priority 
on the agenda of economic planning and developmental projects is 
the medium-term plan, because in countries that have been able 
to find an appropriate model in this area, the length of time of 
the program is calculated in days. Shortening the time in cases 
when the economic balance is subjected to fluctuations can make 
the program conform to it, especially in our country, in which 
at the present the economy is dependent on oil revenues. 
  Stating that (B) privatization is not realistic in our 
country, Ms. Amirshaqaqi said: Our country does not follow an 
open capitalist economy in order for privatization to be able to 
expedite its movement by creating competition. In fact, the 
basis of our economy is a set of beliefs that must end in social 
equity and justice. 
  While the capitalist economy does not conform to the spirit 
of social justice, and in a society such as ours with the 
supervisory power and government control system, privatization 
follows a deviant path, service businesses with high profits 
develop and stop the process of production. 
  She called the special attention of the government and the 
Majles to the problems of the Basijis, the self-sacrificers, and 
their families, who should be given priority, and said: I ask 
the government and the Majles to follow the statements of the 
grand leader concerning social justice and no longer allow high 
prices to break the backs of the weak and the vulnerable stratum 
of the society and main owners of the revolution to be 
eliminated under the pressure of inflation. 
  She also added: I ask the government and the Majles to find 
a 
solution to the problems of government employees, particularly 
the educators and teachers throughout the country. Special civil 
courts face problems in practice. I seriously ask the 
government, the Majles, and the Judicial Branch to revise the 
laws of the special civil courts in order to revive the rights 
of women and devise laws that protect and guarantee full rights 
for women. 
  The deputy from Tabriz made it explicit: Whereas in the 
Islamic government, everyone's living must be provided for, 
unfortunately, in regards to retired people, what did not get 
anywhere are the cries. Truly this stratum is facing serious 
problems. I request the president to issue emphatic instructions 
concerning the sending of the bill on the coordinated system of 
salaries of retired people to the Majles. 
  She asked the minister of economic affairs and finance that 
instead of adding to the number of floors in their building and 
their decor, the banks reduce banking interest so that at least 
government employees will be able to have some kind of a 
shelter. With the existing backbreaking interest, government 
employees, particularly the educators, who make up a high 
percentage of this stratum, will be renters all their lives. 
  Ms. Amirshaqaqi invited the president and the speaker of the 
Majles to visit the city of Tabriz and asked the related 
ministers for assistance in regards to attending to the youth 
unemployment, the foreign currency problems of Tabriz 
Petrochemical, the expansion of the Zanjan-Tabriz expressway, 
and the problems of the factories and the ghetto-dwellers of 
Tabriz. 
<H5>  'Abbas 'Ali Zali, Deputy From Karaj </H5>
  The second pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was Zali, the deputy from Karaj, who expressed 
his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 'Ali and 
said: Considering the limitations of foreign currency and rial 
resources and the large volume of programs under way, the 
examination of the Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget requires the special attention and 
cooperation of the deputies to fully observe the priorities on 
the national level and prepare the desirable grounds to use the 
potential resources of the country. It is necessary, by spending 
time and care and with all of our power, that we take steps in 
devising and ratifying the Five-Year Plan and the 1373 budget in 
such a way that they will be able to provide the grounds to 
eliminate the existing problems, coordinated development, 
economic and cultural prosperity, and the strengthening and 
perpetuation of the political positions of the regime vis-a-vis 
the foreigners on the basis of reality. 
  He continued: In examining the 1373 budget and the Second 
Five-Year Plan, the directives of the grand leader in connection 
with observing social justice, serious support for the oppressed 
strata, attention to the problems of the people, attention to 
agriculture, creating essential change in the administrative 
system, the growth of exports, careful attention to the 
priorities, and finally strengthening the defense capability, as 
well as continuation of a foreign policy based on dignity, 
government, and interests, must be considered. 
  The speaker continued: Considering the special conditions of 
the country after the imposed war, it was necessary to preserve 
the spirit governing the war and, by creating law and order and 
strengthening the spirit of hard work and conservation, to 
prepare the grounds for reconstruction and prevent the society 
from being entrapped in consumerism and overlooking the 
continuation of the interests of the enemies. Now, too, it is 
necessary for the spirit of conservation and simple living to be 
manifested in the private lives of all the members of the 
country, especially their deputies and officials, and for them 
to regard any sort of waste, deviation from moderation, and 
distancing one's life from those of the low-income classes to be 
against our values. With such a policy, our patient and 
resistant people, who seriously consider the fact that the 
officials are not separate from the people as a great gift of 
the revolution, will accept the burden of any sort of hardship 
for the construction of the country and preservation of the 
gains of the revolution. 
  The deputy from Karaj also pointed out: The people expect 
their deputies, who with ultimate conservation and attention to 
the spending and distribution of the Treasury and supervision 
over the way it is spent, as trustees and treasurers of the 
people, to avoid proposals that are related to districts and 
regions vis-a-vis the present priorities of the country. 
  Stating that the people are the greatest investment of the 
revolution, he said: In any planning and allocation of funds, 
preparing grounds for their united presence on the scene of 
construction and economic activities must be taken into 
consideration and, by examining the opinions of the people, 
strengthening their trust and belief in the planners and policy 
makers of the country. 
  The deputy from Karaj mentioned one of the problems of the 
country to be the high cost of administrative organizations and 
pointed out: The spending of Treasury funds to publish journals 
and magazines and congratulations and condolence cards at the 
expense of the government have been increasing and many of the 
ministers have imposed higher expenditures on the Treasury more 
freely, with payment of high salaries and benefits. Such charges 
need to be examined by the Administrative and Employment 
Committee. 
  The important issue of the country in reducing economic 
problems is increasing production. In the First Five-Year Plan, 
no significant change occurred in the level of investments and 
expansion of people's activities in production. In the Second 
Plan and the next year's budget, it is necessary, by legislating 
the needed regulations, controlling imports, and eliminating the 
existing obstacles and restrictions and by eliminating the 
grounds for gaining windfall income, to prepare better grounds 
for increasing activities and investments by the people in 
production and services, and more attention must be paid to 
agriculture. 
  The weak points must be identified and, by strengthening 
control over imports and by research, the quality of goods 
improved. The production units must be obliged to plan for 
increasing exports. 
  In conclusion, the speaker thanked the Revolutionary 
Prosecutor General's office of Karaj, Ayatollah Yazdi, and 
Ayatollah Moqtada'i for their decisive action and the arrest of 
a number of the outlaws of the cities of Karaj and Shahriar. 
<H5>  Seyyed Shahabeddin Sadr, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  The next speaker was Dr. Sadr, the deputy from Tehran, who 
emphasized the importance of universities in the regime and, 
referring to the statements of the late Imam and the grand 
leader in this connection, he said: Considering the importance 
of the issue, I suggest that all the cultural and university 
centers, especially the academics and particularly the committed 
and concerned students, take appropriate steps to clarify the 
dimensions of this grave and essential matter. Certainly our 
Islamic regime gives a special value and place to training a 
competent, expert, committed, and concerned manpower, because 
the academics and researchers of the universities today are the 
officials and administrators of the future of the country. 
  He added: The axis of all the activities and planning in 
this 
vital and destiny-making center is the eyes of the students, and 
all the effective factors in the universities, the professors, 
employees, and equipment, work round-the-clock to impart to this 
determining element the necessary knowledge. What is sensed 
today and must be noted more seriously by the cultural and 
higher education policy makers of the country is a revision of 
and deeper attention to the educational system in the 
universities. The problem solver in this course is the statement 
of the late Imam that universities must become factories to 
produce human beings. Among the necessities of such a university 
is to achieve several goals. 1) Religion and a spiritual 
atmosphere must govern the universities, because the university 
environment must conform to science and knowledge. 
Unfortunately, the enemies of Islam in the course of many years 
tried to create disunity between the universities and religious 
ideas. 
  The deputy from Tehran explained: On the other hand, we must 
note that the young, future-building generation of the country 
in the universities is one of the targets of the cultural 
invasion by the enemy of the universities and centers of higher 
education. 
  2) Students in the universities must be actively present in 
political issues. In other words, the university must be a 
living and dynamic center in all political, social, and economic 
issues of the country and should have a sound life. With this 
characteristic, the student must move shoulder to shoulder and 
in step with the nation to follow the leadership and religious 
guardianship. A student must have a deep-rooted understanding of 
political issues. He must understand the political events of the 
country and the world and make an effort in this area. 
  Dr. Sadr continued: One of the necessities to do this 
correctly and to safeguard it against transgression and 
deviation is that in all his actions and decisions he be 
obedient to the absolute guardianship of the religious jurist 
and follow his Imam. Second, he must always preserve his unity 
with the seminaries and authentic clerics, because, according to 
the Imam, one of the most important factions that induced the 
victory of the Islamic revolution was the unity of the 
seminaries and universities. It must be noted that this factor 
plays a very important role in the continuation of the life of 
the revolution and the Islamic regime. 
  In the continuation of his speech, the deputy from Tehran 
emphasized: It is a mere mistake and absolute superficial 
perception for us to see the political activities of the 
students in the framework of demonstrations by a few hundred 
students separate from the nation. We ask the students and 
Islamic student organizations that, regardless of their tastes, 
they pay attention to several issues seriously. First, with 
unity and solidarity, religion and religious thinking must be 
established in the universities. Second, all students and 
universities must have an active and effective presence in all 
the problems of society and know that any action by them that 
disrupts these two important goals will certainly be to the 
detriment of the university, and for the universities to become 
arenas of uncalled-for and superficial conflicts between the 
Muslim forces must not be allowed. Rather, by tolerating the 
concerned opinions and ideas of others, they must effect the 
political growth of the universities. 
  Dr. Sadr mentioned the problems of medicine and treatment 
throughout the country and said: I request the honorable 
government to deal with this important issue more seriously and 
in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget exactly 
determine the situation of the implementation of the general 
insurance bill and make the necessary calculations. The present 
conditions of the country and the situation of the people are 
not suitable to implement the hospital self-sufficiency plan in 
this widespread form, because if all the expenditures of the 
hospitals, including the salaries of doctors, nurses, and the 
service and logistics cadre as well as the equipment, are 
collected from the clients, it will impose excessive pressure on 
the people, which is not in the interest of the country. This 
issue requires further examination. On the other hand, the sale 
of nonteaching hospitals to the private sector will disrupt the 
securing of health and treatment in the society, which is a 
primary right of the people, and the first strata that will be 
harmed by the implementation of this plan are the deprived 
regions and the downtrodden. 
  Dr. Sadr, referring the economic issues, then said: As the 
leader of the revolution said, giving hope to the people is holy 
struggle in the arena of propaganda, and creating a spirit of 
despair and hopelessness is treason. He asked all the officials 
of the country to use the behavior of the president as a model 
and then said: Today, in the whole world, attention to the issue 
of the mental health of the society is of special importance and 
plays a serious role alongside the effects of economic issues 
and calculations related to this issue in the various changes of 
economic affairs. Today, we witness the effects of propaganda 
and psychological issues in the world and how they change the 
fate of the issues or how they cause the increase in rates, 
inflation, and other problems. Second, care must be taken in 
describing the issues. The affairs of the country must not be 
discussed in a deadlock so that it would cause despair in the 
people. Third, we must speak to the people and raise the issues 
correctly and ask for their help. We must not forget that one of 
the important factors of the victory and survival of the 
revolution is the presence of the people on the scene. In all 
problems, they pave the way themselves with generosity and 
self-sacrifice. 
  It is necessary to pay more attention to pricing and price 
controls. Some might regularly speak of the role of the market 
in setting the prices. But we must note that neither this nor 
any other mechanism can negate the government and supervision by 
the Islamic regime. If it is said that people in all cases have 
the power of choice, it must be pointed out what will happen to 
the necessities of the people and goods such as medicine and 
their vital needs. The price of goods must be determined and 
precise supervision imposed and the violators who disregard the 
conditions of the country and only concern themselves with 
increasing their capital and accumulating wealth by sucking the 
blood of the people must be dealt with most severely. 
<H5>  Mohammad Naser Tavassolizadeh, Deputy From Torbat Heydariyyeh </H5>
  The last pre-agenda speaker was Tavassolizadeh from Torbat 
Heydariyyeh, who expressed his sympathy with the Bosnian Muslims 
and, offering condolences on the anniversary of the martyrdom of 
her holiness Zeynab, said: One of the tools used by the 
colonialists in the course of the past years to strike blows on 
our nation is oil, and those concerned are seriously suffering 
because the economy of our country is dependent on oil. 
  Now that the United States has resorted once again to oil to 
weaken us economically, some experts consider this an 
opportunity to make use of other capabilities and potential in 
order to be able to shape our economy, like our neighboring 
large and populated countries, without dependence on oil. 
  He added: The honorable government has taken long strides 
toward agricultural self-sufficiency. Now that we are coming 
upon Agriculture Week, it is time to critically examine why we 
do not make clear policies about our agricultural products. Why, 
when the farmers in the city of Torbat Heydariyyeh brought their 
surplus wheat after the revolution up to 100,000 tons, do we not 
see any practical support and encouragement for saffron, cotton, 
sugar beets, silk, and animal husbandry? 
  Why do not the related ministries, through coordination with 
the Ministry of Agriculture, save these simple laborers from 
confusion and losses? Even though the officials have made an 
effort to preserve the culture of the revolution, unfortunately, 
we are weak in the broadening and development of this valuable 
resource, which the Islamic revolution has brought. The deputy 
of Torbat Heydariyyeh then continued: In the arena of the 
consumer model and living, we have not acted decisively. For 
this reason, some of the people in the country suffer from a 
life of consumerism and have been influenced in various ways by 
foreigners, and consequently blows are inflicted on cultural 
independence. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Now, the budget bill is to be 
discussed, but unfortunately, we still write the budget without 
attention to the characteristics of the region, and this causes 
us not to understand the potential of the region. 
  In pricing, if with regard to some items we have still not 
reached the level of saturation and creation of competition, 
what is preventing us, despite the existence of inflation, from 
presenting clear prices for goods, so that our noble people will 
not to be worried about the gross difference in prices. 
  In conclusion, he made a reminder to the Ministry of 
Industries in connection with the loan stated in Note 52 for the 
sugar, oxygen, silk and cotton weaving, and cotton spinning 
factories of Torbat Heydariyyeh.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met 
today with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and discussed 
the progress achieved so far in eliminating the obstacles 
hindering the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The meeting was attended on the Egyptian side by Ambassador 
to Israel Mahmud Basyuni and Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ambassador Naji al-Ghatrifi and on the Israeli side by 
Environment Minister Yosi Sarid and Ambassador David Sultan. 
  Musa met earlier today for one hour with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  'Arafat, Peres, and Musa are expected to get together at a 
working luncheon Musa is hosting for the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations. 
  In another development, Avi Gil, Israeli Foreign Ministry 
deputy director general, stated that at noon today President 
Husni Mubarak contacted Shim'on Peres. The Israeli foreign 
minister informed Mubarak of the real stand regarding the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations so far, Gil said. 
  He added that President Mubarak invited Peres to attend a 
meeting with him at 1830 this evening. 
  The spokesman noted that the Israeli minister will also meet 
with the Austrian president at 1930 today. 
  In other developments, sources close to the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations stated to MENA that the general 
atmosphere of the talks is good. 
  The Palestinian delegation sources said that the Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators will continue their negotiations today 
and tomorrow. Peres will not leave Cairo until late on 
Wednesday evening or early Thursday morning after finding a 
solution to the obstacles to signing the agreement. 
  The same sources clarified that the minutes of the 
negotiations, including all the points of difference and 
agreement, will only be initialed by the two sides. The points 
of difference will be left for President 'Arafat and Yitzhaq 
Rabin to resolve later. 
  The sources said that the points of difference revolve 
basically around the issue of the crossings and Israel's 
insistence on maintaining its security control over them. 
  The news agency has also learned that the paper being 
discussed currently is the Davos document, which is based on the 
Cairo paper. The Davos document consists of three main pages in 
addition to a special and a separate eight-page section on the 
minutes regarding the crossings. 
  The Israelis made some changes to the Davos document which 
the Palestinians reject, insisting that this matter should be 
seen as a comprehensive deal that includes the Davos and Cairo 
documents. 
  It is worth noting here that the Palestinian delegation to 
the talks includes Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', Nabil Sha'th, 
Akram Haniyah, and Faysal al-Husayni; the Israeli delegation 
includes Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director general; Yo'el 
Zinger, the legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry; and Uzi 
Dayan, chief of military planning.

again at 1000. We are determined to reach an agreement. 
  Sha'th said we will be meeting immediately, but we cannot

  Answering a question on whether the agreement will be signed

  The Israeli minister expressed his happiness over his 
meeting 
this evening with President Husni Mubarak, which, according to 
him, took place upon the invitation of his excellency. 
  He said that the negotiations are going on continuously. If 
the need should arise on both sides for us, "myself and Chairman 
[al-ra'is] 'Arafat," to meet, "we will meet with each other to 
overcome the obstacles." 
  Shim'on Peres praised the great cooperation the Palestinians 
and the Israelis are getting from the Egyptian side.

the same that were discussed before in Cairo, Taba, and Davos. 
These issues revolve round the crossings, the axis roads

issues pertaining to Jericho.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Feb (MENA)-- The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations continued up to dawn today under the cochairmanship 
of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and the presence of Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa, in an attempt to reach an agreement that would eliminate 
the obstacles hindering the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Sources close to 
the negotiations have said that the stances assumed by both 
sides have not changed a bit and that differences still persist 
on the crossing points and the area of Jericho. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0210 GMT on 9 February carries a 
Cairo-datelined item by Haro Chakmakjian on the negotiations, 
which adds: "Israeli and PLO negotiators made `some progress' in 
a marathon session of talks deep into the night aimed at 
launching Palestinian self-rule, but an accord would still need 
more work, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said here 
early Wednesday. 
  ["`We made some progress and we shall try tomorrow 
(Wednesday) to complete our work,' Peres told reporters after 
more than four hours of discussions with a PLO delegation led by 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  ["Peres said both sides would meet again at about 10:00 a.m. 
(0800 GMT) Wednesday, and he would meet 'Arafat at about midday. 
  ["`We are working on a text that we are to agree on,' Peres 
added. 
  ["Another Israeli negotiator, Foreign Ministry Director 
General Uri Savir, said differences with the PLO had been 
reduced, but `nobody at this point knows how close we are' to an 
agreement. 
  ["The points of disagreement were sensitive, he explained. 
`We haven't set a deadline yet.' 
  ["Negotiators from the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
could not be reached for comment on Tuesday's talks held at the 
Andalus Palace in the northeastern suburb of Heliopolis, where 
'Arafat was staying. 
  ["Savir said both sides were working `word by word and 
paragraph by paragraph.' 
  ["They were concentrating on security issues such as the 
control of international borders and road access to Jewish 
settlements, which, together with the size of the autonomous 
Jericho area, have been the main stumbling blocks. 
  ["Earlier Egyptian leaders stepped in to try to break the 
deadlock after an inconclusive round of talks Monday."] 
  The same AFP report adds: ["An Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
official told AFP Egypt had `made every effort to enable the two 
sides to reach an accord.' 
  ["President Husni Mubarak held a 45-minute meeting with 
'Arafat and Peres, after a day when the two sides reported no 
progress. 
  ["Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa later met Peres for an hour to 
try to resolve the remaining difficulties. 
  ["Peres said he had the `mandate of the government' and 
would 
stay on in Cairo as long as necessary to overcome obstacles. 
The points agreed in Davos still stood, he said, denying 
Palestinian charges that Israel was backing out. 
  ["However, he told Israeli radio: `Even if we sign an 
agreement on security issues, which are on the agenda, there is 
a range of other subjects which we have not yet tackled and 
which will have to be settled.' 
  ["They included the powers to be devolved to the Palestinian 
autonomy council, the electoral system and the transfer of 
civilian authority."]

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Feb (MENA)--Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres held a brief private meeting with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat this morning at the al-Andalus Palace. 
The Palestinian president then left for a meeting with Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at the Arab 
League. 
  Palestinian and Israeli delegations, led respectively by 
Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO Economic 
Department, and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli 
Foreign Ministry, continued their "marathon talks" aiming to 
overcome the difficulties facing the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement signed on 13 September 1993. 
  Commenting on his talks until dawn with president 'Arafat 
and 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Peres said some topics were 
discussed in private. We are trying to overcome some obstacles. 
Asked if he was optimistic, Peres said: We should not be 
making statements or forecasts now while the negotiations are 
under way. When we finish our work, we will make statements. 
Peres said things are moving forward. 
  Faysal al-Husayni, a member of the Palestinian delegation 
and 
the man in charge of the occupied territories, said there is 
some progress in the talks and that further discussions will be 
held to reach results. 
  Elsewhere, president 'Arafat received Torje Larsen, the 
Norwegian Government's envoy, in the al-Andalus Palace this 
morning. Afterward, Larsen said he is in Cairo to follow the 
current Palestinian-Israeli negotiations closely. 
  Sources close to the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators 
told 
MENA of cautious optimism prevailing during the marathon talks, 
which have been going on continuously for two days. 
  The sources said that during his meeting with 'Arafat and 
Peres yesterday, President Husni Mubarak emphasized the need to 
reach an agreement during the current talks. He humored his 
guests by saying: You will not leave Cairo until you reach an 
agreement. 
  The same sources said that Peres will not leave Cairo this 
evening as scheduled. He will resume talks until tomorrow, 
Thursday, before heading for Geneva to attend a conference for 
the Jewish community in Europe. 
  MENA has learned that the major points of dispute are 
security control of the crossing points, settlements security, 
issues pertaining to the roads leading to Gaza settlements, and 
the area of Jericho. 
  To put it simply, the dispute persisting between the Israeli 
and Palestinian sides throughout all earlier rounds has revolved 
around Palestinian control of symbols of national sovereignty in 
the context of self-rule and the Israeli fear that granting the 
Palestinians such control might lead to the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. 
  Sources close to the Israeli delegation have said that the 
Israeli military institution, represented in the delegation by 
General Uzi Dayan, head of the political planning department of 
the Israeli Army Staff Command, refuses to grant the 
Palestinians security control over crossing points between 
Jordan and Jericho and between Egypt and Gaza under the excuse 
of preserving Israel's security.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Feb (MENA)--Egyptian sources today said 
that the Palestinian and Israeli sides have made progress in 
their talks over the past two days, particularly with regard to 
the remaining problems facing the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  The sources said that the two delegations will continue 
their 
meetings today to examine points of disagreement concerning the 
crossings and the Jericho area. The sources said that the 
outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli talks is expected to be 
announced tonight or tomorrow. 
  Israel's Ambassador to Cairo David Sultan said the talks 
have 
made progress. He voiced the hope that more progress will follow 
and that the remaining points of disagreement will be settled. 
The Israeli ambassador said the talks will continue today and 
that there is a climate of optimism. The ambassador pointed to 
a need to reach agreement on particular issues but added that 
others have been settled in talks over the past two days. The 
Israeli ambassador declined to elaborate further, saying that 
the talks are still under way and that it is better to wait 
until they are over before discussing their details.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 9 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has said that during his recent 
visit to Bonn he told German officials that the Arab side 
generally supports Germany's acquirement of a permanent seat at 
the UN Security Council [UNSC], but any decision in this matter 
will have to be made by the Arab League Council. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the United Nations should 
treat the Arab region as a geographical unit entitled to a 
permanent seat in the UNSC in the event that the latter's 
membership is expanded in accordance with the proposal made by 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that granting a permanent seat at the 
UNSC to the Arab group would help boost relations between the 
Arab World, Europe, and the rest of the World. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--The International Islamic 
Council for Propagation and Relief has appealed to the 
governments and nations of the Islamic world to sever 
diplomatic, cultural, and economic ties with Serbia and the 
countries collaborating with it, particularly Russia and Greece, 
to expel these countries' ambassadors from Islamic capitals, and 
to close down their embassies in accordance with UN resolutions 
on an economic boycott of the former Yugoslavia. 
  In a statement today, the council noted the need to call on 
the Islamic nations and their political and party institutions, 
trade and professional unions, labor, youth, and student 
federations, and economic, trade, cultural, tourism centers to 
boycott the Yugoslav interests and companies in Islamic 
countries, to suspend all dealings with Yugoslavia, and not to 
offer services for its communications companies at ports and 
airports. 
  The council stressed the need for an immediate response to 
the world intention to use military power to enforce 
international legitimacy, lift the blockade of Sarajevo 
disregarding impediments that some countries face in 
implementing this policy, and to adopt a political, military 
plan to lift the international embargo on arming the Bosnian 
people with all means to enable them to defend themselves. 
  The statement explained the importance of setting up an 
international popular tribunal that should have access to 
information and be impartial and neutral to pursue and punish 
the Serb criminals in line with human (?principles), 
international laws, and human rights documents. 
  The statement called on banks, economic institutions, and 
financiers and businessmen in the Islamic world to open funds to 
collect contributions to help the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
eliminate the effects of aggression, and urge Islamic 
organizations to increase their aid to the victims of the 
oppressive Serbian aggression. 
  The council emphasized the importance of coordinating stands 
between the Islamic Conference Organization and the Arab League 
and similar official and public regional and international 
leagues to rally all sincere efforts in support of the 
principles of right, justice, and peace.

  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO] contact 
group has issued a statement announcing that if the 
international community refrains from staging aerial attacks on 
the positions of the Serbian aggressors, the Islamic countries, 
based on Article 51 of the UN Charter, will take steps toward 
securing the legitimate right of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to defend itself. 
  The statement asks the NATO member countries to implement 
the 
will of the international community without wasting any time, 
and by resorting to aerial attacks, to ensure that the Serbs 
comply with the Security Council resolutions.

  [Text] A military spokesman for the General Command of the 
al-'Asifah Forces -- the command of the Fatah forces inside the 
occupied territories -- has stated the following: 
  Our cells operating inside the occupied homeland have 
planted 
advanced explosive charges in the Haifa chemical factory north 
of the industrial zone, which is adjacent to the Haifa oil 
refineries. 
  The charges went off at 1300 on 7 February destroying the 
factory and setting huge fires that spread to neighboring 
factories and installations. 
  The military spokesman added that, since the operation, 
rescue and fire fighting teams, the police, and the mobile 
environment protection unit for treating dangerous materials 
have been making great attempts to place the situation under 
control, while clouds of black smoke covered the whole Gulf of 
Haifa.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] "Were Hamas and the Fatah Hawks really 
discussing the possibility of cooperation, the two Hamas leaders 
would not have rushed to tell the newspapers that they 
encouraged the Fatah Hawks to attack Israelis, as they did 
several days ago." This statement was made yesterday to 
HA'ARETZ by Fatah member Sufiyan Abu-Zayida in reaction to a 
report by security elements on the emerging cooperation between 
Fatah Hawks squads and Hamas. 
  "In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid 
al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against 
Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli 
authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young 
leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to 
reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would 
not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my 
opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet." 
[passage omitted] 
  A senior officer said yesterday that the experimental period 
in which the pursuit of Fatah members was discontinued in return 
for their stopping all terrorist activity failed and therefore 
was called off. [passage omitted] 
  Over the past month, the security forces have resumed their 
efforts to capture Fatah activists. Their most recent operation 
on 3 February, in which senior Fatah activist Salim Mu'affi was 
killed, caused an uproar in Fatah. 
  Faysal al-Husayni said last Sunday that the Palestinians 
never really accepted the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] proposal 
concerning fugitives, including the clause proposing that the 
fugitives lay down their arms and transfer to Tunis. 
  The senior officer added that Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister 
and defense minister, was briefed by senior IDF officers on the 
situation and voiced great disappointment in Fatah's inability 
to control the terrorists and their squads. He added that Rabin 
has endorsed the continued pursuit of terrorists.

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- Jibril al-Rajub, adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has protested the killing 
of Salim Muwafi, the Fatah Hawks leader in Gaza, by the Israeli 
forces. He considered this act as an attempt to kill the peace 
process. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, al-Rajub said that 
the Palestinian leadership regards the Fatah Hawks as part of 
the forces that have to protect the national authority. 
Consequently, we have to provide security for them. 
  Regarding the peace process, al-Rajub accused Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of responsibility for hampering the peace 
process, and said: We realize that Rabin is the key figure in 
Israel, but apparently he regrets signing the Oslo accord. 
Therefore, he is trying to hinder what was agreed on in Davos. 
  Al-Rajub said that the PLO is ready to sign the drafts that 
were agreed on in Davos. It is also ready to take over power 
within 24 hours after the Israeli withdrawal. 
  'Arafat's occupied territories' affairs adviser said that 
the 
Palestinian side considers a Palestinian-Israeli summit to be 
warranted. He also expressed his apprehension at the 
perpetuation of the current situation, which can only lead to 
frustration, opposition to the peace process, and an increase in 
the phenomena of internal and foreign violence. [passage

  [Text] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi yesterday strongly 
condemned excesses, actions which undermine the internal 
Palestinian rank, reckless use of firearms, and acts that 
subject the residents' lives to danger and death. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that violating the rights of others, 
resorting to violence, and undermining the principle of 
cooperation and assistance are grave indications that harm the 
Palestinian people's unity and cohesion. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held the Israeli authorities responsible 
for the disorder and chaos among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, 
especially the spread of weapons in the streets, which reach the 
hands of adolescents and irresponsible individuals. He added 
that in accordance with international law, Israel, as an 
occupying country, is obligated to protect Palestinian residents 
and care for their safety. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: In light of this situation, for 
which everyone knows Israel is responsible, the Palestinians 
should rally around their unity and avoid infighting, which does 
not serve the Palestinian people. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi appealed to the Palestinian leadership to 
work tirelessly and adopt a unified Palestinian position on a 
democratic basis in order to avoid all the dangers that threaten 
the Palestinian people, their militant heritage, and honorable 
history of struggle against the occupation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: The continuous obstacles in the 
negotiations to implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles agreement -- which are caused by Israeli 
intransigence and the maneuvers of the Israeli negotiating team, 
which tries to evade the spirit and letter of the agreement -- 
confirm, once again, the truth about the Palestinian reading of 
the agreement. This reading proved at the negotiations to be 
the more accurate reading of the agreement, the closest to its 
spirit, and the most accurate to interpreting its clauses. 
  The stumbling of the talks indicate, beyond any doubt, that 
the Palestinian reading is facing the Israeli reading -- with 
full strength and firmness -- and that the fierce conflict 
between them refutes the desperate allegations by the 
rejectionist forces on Palestinian capitulation and on the 
weakness of the Palestinian negotiator in the face of the 
Israeli negotiator. 
  If the arguments of the rejectionist forces on capitulation, 
weakness, and enormous concessions -- which the Palestinian 
negotiator is supposedly making there -- are true, we would not 
have seen obstacles, conflict in the negotiations, or Israeli 
intransigence, since the Israeli negotiator would have taken 
everything from the Palestinian negotiator -- as claimed by the 
statements of the rejectionist. The agreement also would have 
been implemented from the first moments in the negotiations in 
accordance with the Israeli way and reading. 
  Yes, if the Palestinian negotiator was weak and surrendered 
to the Israeli negotiator, we would not have passed through 
three months of heated negotiations, which have been fruitful 
thus far, between the two parties. 
  Will the Palestinian rejectionist forces look at these facts 
thoroughly and with a national eye so as to practice a role -- 
even as an opposition -- to support the Palestinian view and the 
Palestinian reading, which is aimed at turning the agreement 
into a first step on the path of building the independent 
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
  Yes, this is what we want from the agreement. There is no 
difference over this national objective. Will there be a review 
of stands before it is too late?

  [Text] MBC has obtained the first reaction to Algerian 
President Zeroual's call for dialogue. Rabah Kebir, 
spokesman-in-exile for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], said 
yesterday in an interview with MBC--despite the ban imposed on 
his activity by the German authorities--that the FIS will go 
along with the call for a dialogue, provided all prisoners are 
released. Here is a report from our correspondent Anis 
Abu-al-'Ila in Germany: 
  [Begin recording] [Kebir] I believe that the conviction that 
negotiations are the key to a solution in Algeria is a suitable 
and civilized approach. However, we must wait for actual deeds. 
Although there is some seriousness, as I can see from some 
paragraphs in the speech, there are some contradictions as well. 
On one hand, Liamine Zeroual insists on using violence once 
again, while on the other he is insisting on dialogue. A 
clear-cut stance needs to be adopted. Yesterday, for instance, 
(al-Qulb) mountains were bombed by aircraft while the speech was 
being delivered, and these are confirmed reports. Once again we 
say that if there is a serious desire to hold negotiations, it 
will have to begin with releasing all prisoners, first and 
foremost the FIS leaders, and then allowing a meeting among FIS 
key figures under the leadership of its leaders, Abbassi Madani 
and Ali Belhadj. 
  [Abu-al-'Ila] Does that mean you are ready for such a 
meeting 
as a first step toward a dialogue with the Algerian Government? 
  [Kebir] What I am saying is that a final decision on this 
matter is up to the FIS leaders, once they are able to meet with 
their historic leadership. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Here is an analysis of the address made by the 
head of state, Liamine Zeroual, with colleagues Hocine Chaiche 
and Chaaban Lounaka. 
  [First unidentified speaker] The essential idea in the head 
of state's address was his announcement that Algeria had a 
specific policy and a clear plan to deal with the political 
crisis, and that it was in control of that process and firm in 
implementing the policy. This means that we have moved from the 
stage of diagnosis to the stage of treatment, and that the 
latter no longer needs further explanation. However, 
explanations will be made within the framework of the dialogue 
process which remains a firm option. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] It is true that the head of 
state's address included the aforementioned policy. It seems 
that the policy is based on an essential idea, namely that the 
new authority is convinced that the political crisis could only 
be resolved through dialogue and the participation of all the 
national political forces, without exception. This statement 
restores hope after the effective parties' boycott of the 
national conference, the possible effects of which on the 
authority's position was feared by many people. However, it has 
become clear now that the political line declared by the head of 
state when he was only defense minister represents a strong and 
firm non-circumstantial conviction. This means now is the time 
for serious and real work with the parties. We now have to wait 
for the reactions of political forces. 
  [First speaker] That is clear from the head of state's 
mention of the parties to the dialogue which boycotted the 
conference, describing them as hesitant. This means that he was 
careful to maintain the dialogue bridges with those parties. He 
also gave assurance regarding the future of the dialogue when he 
said: We are determined to continue the dialogue in earnest, and 
earnest dialogue will inevitably be rewarded. The head of state 
made a commitment to returning to a democratic electoral path. 
  [Second speaker] As it is known, one of the fundamental 
issues in the dialogue generally is the participation of the 
dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. We are aware that 
before the address, officials confirmed that contacts made with 
the FIS to achieve that aim produced positive and encouraging 
results. The speech confirmed officially but indirectly that 
that group was interested in serious dialogue as much as other 
parties when Zeroual talked about national political forces 
without exception. 
  We note that the head of state used the term political 
forces 
instead of political parties, maybe to remove obstacles in the 
way of the expected dialogue. Naturally, the serious dialogue 
mentioned by the head of state and demanded by the political 
forces would require a host of measures. 
  [First speaker] Although the head of state did not announce 
them in his address as most people expected, we conclude that 
these measures would inevitably be adopted within the overall 
framework of the dialogue. Generally, these measures will 
concern the state of emergency and the concurrent events and the 
aftermath of the security situation. 
  Naturally, holding a dialogue without exceptions and linking 
it to the previously announced contacts with effective figures 
representing the FIS, will necessarily lead to adopting measures 
regarding that tendency. The constitution authorizes the head 
of state to make appropriate decisions to ensure the success of 
the defined policy and the clear plan in dealing with the 
political crisis which Zeroual stressed in his address. Without 
doubt, the sooner all the sides work for the restoration of 
security, stability and peace of mind the sooner the 
aforementioned measures would be adopted and the crisis would be 
resolved. [passage omitted] 
  [Second speaker] The new head of state is now pledging to 
make efforts to implement the economic reforms and carry them 
out in practice. The result expected from the reforms is to rid 
the economy of administrative and other obstacles, remove the 
monopolies exercised by the state over the economic process and 
provide opportunity to public and private sector economic 
initiatives. Indeed, we shall find that many people would say 
that there is nothing new in this and that it has been repeated 
since the debate on economic reforms began but the same problems 
still exist. This is absolutely true and the reason is very 
simple, namely the reforms have never been carried out. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, the president of 
the Republic, has confirmed the revolution's seriousness in 
implementing its sincere aims in the southern states in terms of 
peace and development and creating better living conditions. 
His excellency stated this during a meeting in his office at 
the Friendship Hall this morning with a delegation of 
representatives of returnees from the rebel movement. 
  The delegates confirmed their support for the revolution's 
aims and programs designed to achieve a real peace, saying the 
revolution was the dynamo of economic, social, and political 
development. The delegation dwelt on the rebel movement's 
intransigence and frivolity on the peace issue, as had become 
clear through the Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Abuja talks. The 
members of the delegation added that they would play their part 
in all the country's issues and participate in the political and 
social aspects. They affirmed that the plan for redividing the 
states would lead to the achievement of a comprehensive peace by 
widening the scope of participation.

  [Text] Khartoum, 8 Feb (SUNA) -- The Sudanese Government on 
8 February categorically denied the unfounded accusations 
contained in a communique issued by the U.S. State Department on 
military operations in the Eastern and Western Equatoria regions. 
  In the communique issued Tuesday in Khartoum in response to 
the U.S. accusations, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry stressed the 
United States double standards, noting that while the United 
States was referring to imaginary military operations in 
southern Sudan, it maintained total silence on Israel's deadly 
operations in the occupied territories. The communique stressed 
that the military operations in southern Sudan were nothing but 
fighting between rebel factions and that the people's armed 
forces only fired in cases of legitimate defense. 
  The communique also confirmed the commitment of the Sudanese 
Government to all the agreements on humanitarian aid, including 
those signed with the United Nations, which stipulate the 
facilitation of the transport of relief material to war victims 
in southern Sudan. 
  The United States' support for the rebel movement and for 
its 
springboard and these unfounded accusations were phenomena which 
could encourage the rebel movement to escalate the war and to 
reject all initiatives designed to achieve a peaceful solution 
to the problem in southern Sudan, the communique said.

  [Text] Khartoum, 8 Feb (SUNA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
yesterday issued a statement on the massacre recently 
perpetrated by the Serbs in Sarajevo, in which over 100 Bosnian 
Muslim citizens fell victim. The statement condemend the heinous 
crime and reaffirmed Sudan's (?denunciation) of the failure and 
conspiracies of the great powers. 
  The statement condemned the UN Security Council's negative 
stance towards the massacre. It expressed Sudan's concern over 
the international community's silence in response to the 
violation of human rights in Bosnia. The statement said that 
what the Serbs were doing in Bosnia was unprecedented since what 
the Nazis did during the Hitlerite era and that the UN's failure 
was exactly like the League of Nations' failure to stop the 
crimes of the Nazis, which lost it the confidence of the peoples 
of the world (?at that time). 
  The statement appealed to the peace-loving forces and all 
states to confront this inhuman (?whirlpool), to stand firmly by 
the Muslim people of Bosnia, to pressure the Security Council 
into discharging its duty to protect the Bosnian people's 
legitimate rights and lift the arms embargo imposed on the 
Bosnian people to enable them to defend themselves, strike at 
the Serbian forces to destroy their military concentrations and 
to immediately evict them from the Bosnian territories.

  [Text] Mr. 'Umar Baridu, first under secretary of the 
Foreign Ministry, reviewed at the ministry's forum today the 
statement issued by the African, Caribbean, and Pacific group of 
states -- the Lome Convention states -- in reply to the 
statement issued by the European Union accusing Sudan of human 
rights violations. His excellency praised the attitude of the 
Lome Convention states in asking the European Union to be 
patient and to respond to Sudan's invitation to send a joint 
fact-finding mission. The Lome Convention states said the 
convention would lose credibility if it let itself be exploited 
as a tool to increase the difficulties faced by any of its 
peoples. 
  Mr. Baridu also reviewed the activities of Sudan's 
delegation 
during the meetings of the OAU ministerial council held recently 
in Addis Ababa. 
  His excellency also described the massacre perpetrated by 
the 
Serbian forces against defenseless civilians in Sarajevo as a 
hideous crime that shook the pillars of the accords of 
international legality and highlighted the weakness of the new 
world order. Baridu affirmed that the great powers, the members 
of the Security Council, had badly failed in their efforts to 
solve the issue of Bosnia, saying that this failure would 
diminish the UN's importance. He said Sudan had issued a 
statement demanding the lifting of the siege on Sarajevo and for 
the Muslim Bosnian people to be allowed to obtain weapons to 
defend themselves.

  [Text] Pageri, Sudan, Feb 8 (AFP)--A Sudanese government 
warplane bombed a village and a refugee camp Tuesday [8 
February], seriously wounding at least one woman in their fourth 
air strike against the rebel-held south in five days. Nearly 
70,000 people have fled camps along Sudan's southern border with 
Uganda since the bombings intensified in the past two weeks, 
United Nations officials said. 
  Sudan's hard-line Islamic government launched one of its 
biggest military offensives against the mainly Christian and 
animist southern rebels last month, relief sources said. 
  Khartoum, however, has denied the bombings and blamed rival 
rebel factions for fighting in the south, where UN officials say 
millions need food and emergency aid. But reporters who visited 
Pageri on Tuesday had to dive for cover as a lumbering 
Soviet-built Antonov military plane dropped four bombs shortly 
before noon (1000 GMT) on the village. 
  About half of Pageri's 10,000 residents sought refuge there 
after being forced to flee their homes by the civil war that has 
ravaged the south for more than a decade. Minutes later the 
Antonov dropped another two bombs which fell harmlessly close to 
the nearby Aswa camp, sheltering 21,000 displaced people. 
  Aswa and Pageri are less than 20 kilometres (12 miles) from 
the Ugandan border. 
  Western diplomats said the rebels had no aircraft and the 
Antonov must have been a government bomber. 
  The United States government strongly condemned Khartoum for 
two air strikes Friday near camps in the same area sheltering 
hundreds of thousands of displaced people. There were no 
casualties, but Sally Burnheim of the UN Operation Lifeline 
Sudan said 18 people had been killed and another 17 wounded in a 
third bombing raid Monday on Parajok, about 100 kilometres (60 
miles) east of the camps, where some of the displaced people who 
fled had gathered for safety. 
  Khartoum has banned relief flights to several destinations 
along the Ugandan border where 200,000 displaced people are 
gathered. "If we can't reach the people in need, there's going 
to be a colossal disaster," Burnheim said. 
  Bullets crackled as they exploded when flames engulfed the 
ruins of one of Pageri's largest buildings, which was directly 
hit. Youths darted into the building and ran out seconds later 
clutching Kalashnikov rifles which they had saved from the fire. 
  Mario Muor, head of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan 
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), dismissed suggestions that 
Pageri housed a rebel base. He said the building contained arms 
and ammunition because it was "a military police station." 
  But few women and children were seen in Pageri on Tuesday. 
Most of the panic-stricken inhabitants who streamed out of 
their beehive-shaped grass-thatched huts were young men. Many 
carried Kalashnikovs. 
  A women hit by shrapnel in both legs was carried bleeding 
from the burning ruins of a house and driven to a makeshift 
hospital in Aswa. Doctors said she would die if not evacuated 
to neighbouring Kenya for a blood transfusion within 24 hours. 
  Local sources said SPLA leader John Garang was near Pageri 
to 
chair a meeting of top commanders Tuesday, but there was no 
confirmation. 
  The government recaptured most major southern towns in a 
major offensive launched a few months after the SPLA split into 
two warring factions in 1991. 
  Muor accused the splinter group led by Riak Machar of 
collaborating with Khartoum, a claim Machar has repeatedly 
denied.

  [Excerpts] Rolf Ekeus, the chairman of the United Nation 
Special Commission [UNSCOM] in charge of scrapping Iraq's 
weapons of mass destruction, said that the international embargo 
imposed on the Iraqi regime for invading the State of Kuwait 
would not be lifted now. 
  In a news conference he held this evening before leaving the 
country, Ekeus added that there was nothing to this effect on 
the UN agenda at present. 
  The UN commission chairman expressed his full conviction 
that 
most of the Baghdad regime's military capabilities had been 
identified and destroyed. 
  He added that the commission was confident that all 
long-range missiles, which remained in the possession of the 
Iraqi regime after the Kuwait liberation war, had been 
destroyed. The special plants for producing those weapons had 
also been identified and destroyed. 
  Ekeus pointed out that UN inspectors found large quantities 
of chemical weapons that were, in reality, rendered inactive. 
He added that the commission still had before it the mission of 
completing the destruction of the chemical weapons in Iraq. 
  Concerning the Iraqi regime's biological weapons arsenal, 
Ekeus said in the news conference that the commission was 
relatively confident that all the essential elements had been 
treated, but was not fully satisfied, and that the commission 
was slightly worried about chemical weapons. 
  Ekeus pointed out that, according to the cease-fire in the 
State of Kuwait liberation war, the UN commission faced two 
aims. These were: Installing a long-term surveillance system on 
the Iraqi regime's armament program, and making sure that that 
regime would not attempt to obtain forbidden weapons. [passage 
omitted] 
  Ekeus went on to say that he briefed the country's officials 
on the progress that the commission achieved, and also listened 
to remarks in this respect. 
  He added that the senior officials in Kuwait also briefed 
him 
on their evaluation of the situation in the region. He said 
that that would help the commission to a great extent in its 
work.

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The Kuwaiti criminal 
court Tuesday threw out an allegation by defence lawyers that it 
was not competent to rule in the case of a member of the ruling 
royal family and four co-defendants accused of embezzlement. 
  Rejecting the charge, acting state prosecutor Sultan 
Bu-Jarwah adjourned the trial until March 22 to give the lawyers 
time to answer the prosecution case, judicial sources said. 
  The five defendants, including Shaykh 'Ali Khalifah al-Sabah 
of the royal family, are accused of having embezzled up to 100 
million dollars from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company 
(KOTC). 
  Shaykh 'Ali, who was oil and finance minister in the cabinet 
formed in exile in Saudi Arabia after Iraqi troops invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990, pleaded not guilty when the trial opened 
on January 18. 
  Judge Bu-Jarwah rejected the defence's allegation that the 
trial had a "political" dimension. He said the prosecution was 
judging the defendants "not according to their social or 
political affiliations, but on the basis of equality before the 
law." 
  The other four accused in the trial are Kuwaitis Hasan 
Qabazard and 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Badr, Jordanian Nasim Muhsin and 
Briton Tim Stafford. 
  Defence lawyers argued that the case should be handled by a 
supreme court of five members, in accordance with a royal decree 
of 1990 which ruled that any minister accused of crimes must 
appear before such a supreme body. 
  However, parliament abrogated the decree on January 11 on 
the 
grounds that it "obstructed" justice and "protected ministers," 
particularly in connection with financial scandals which came to 
light after Kuwait was liberated in February 1991.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia and West's Civilization Claims"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The recent massacre in Sarajevo clearly exposes 
the extent of the Western states' collusion through 
procrastination and by delaying a decision to stop the criminal 
actions against the Muslim people of Bosnia. 
  "Protect us, or let us defend ourselves!" This is the 
message the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government is trying to convey to 
the international community. The message is urgent and what 
makes it even more urgent is the recent massacre in Sarajevo. 
  Everyone knows the locations of the heavy artillery killing 
the innocent in Sarajevo. These posts can be seen with ordinary 
binoculars from the center of the Bosnian capital. There exist 
the deadly guns seen on television screens by hundreds of 
millions of people throughout the world. Despite all this, we 
are told that the United Nation has launched an investigation to 
determine the source of the shell which killed 55 people while 
they were buying their daily food. The investigation will be 
similar to scores of investigations conducted before. That is, 
it will produce no results, or it might produce a result but the 
international community will then hasten to put it quietly away 
on the top shelf. 
  Everyone knows who is in control of these deadly guns. The 
peoples of the world watch the murderers giving interviews on 
television screen every evening. UN diplomats embrace the same 
murderers in cocktail parties and in diplomatic corridors. 
Despite all this, we are told that the United Nations is 
planning to conduct an investigation to identify the 
perpetrator. [passage omitted] 
  The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina has become one of the 
questions that are of historic significance. That is, the 
questions which expose the true positions by stripping the world 
order of its claims to civilization and proving that it is based 
on respect for force, and force alone. 
  In Bosnia-Herzegovina we see the real Europe. And in it the 
present world order, which is supposed to be based on respect 
for international law, has been exposed. So rescuing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not merely rescuing a war-torn state from 
suffering and possible extinction: The question raised now is 
rescuing the international organizations, especially the United 
Nations, and rescuing the future of international relations 
throughout the globe.

  [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, accompanied by House of 
Representatives Speaker Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar, met today with the brother representatives of the 
Shabwah Governorate expanded popular gathering comprising tribal 
chiefs, society figures, intellectuals, and representatives of 
party and political groupings, popular and professional 
organizations, and youth, military men, and others. 
  The representatives submitted to the brother president the 
results of the Shabwah Governorate expanded popular gathering 
and the statement issued by the gathering which met under the 
slogan "For the Sake of A United And Effective Stand of the 
Governorate's Sons To Defend Unity, Democracy, Justice, and 
Social Development." 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke at the 
meeting. He praised the national role played by the sons of 
Shabwah Governorate in the march of the Yemeni revolution, the 
national movement, and the confrontation of the colonialist 
presence and the imamate regime. He praised the results of the 
expanded gathering of the sons of the Shabwah governorate and 
the positive decisions they adopted. He said these results 
embody a high sense of national responsibility and demonstrate a 
dynamic militant spirit that is committed to the homeland and 
eager to safeguard its unity and democratic course. 
  The brother chairman said: The most important achievement of 
this gathering is the unity of ranks of the sons of the 
governorate, irrespective of their party affiliations. He 
added: This is a great gain for this governorate which suffered 
much, whether before or after the independence. Its sons have 
offered convoys of martyrs for the sake of independence. They 
also offered many of its elite men as defenseless victims of the 
regrettable political disputes. 
  The brother president added: Our target has been and 
continues to be that 22 May 1990 will be the decisive date for 
ending all these disputes and tragedies from which our Yemeni 
people have suffered much. He added that Yemeni unity is the 
framework for settling differences. It is the fence within 
whose boundaries the Yemeni family is reunited. It is the balm 
that soothes all the wounds of the past. The brother chairman 
added: However, it is regrettable that political quarrels and 
private interests seek to sully this beautiful picture of unity 
and to assassinate the joy our people feel as they proceed 
toward a new era where ranks are closed, hatred disappears and 
all work together to build the homeland, carry out development, 
construct roads and schools, hospitals, educational 
institutions, and spread services throughout Yemen. 
  The brother chairman said: However, it is regrettable that 
some try to obstruct this so that the benefits of unity will not 
reach all the people who will then realize the importance and 
value of unity in their lives. 
  The brother chairman said it is important to unite the 
efforts of the sons of the Shabwah governorate so that they work 
for the interest of the governorate and the homeland, and 
benefit from the lessons of the past. The past is replete with 
unfortunate lessons which should be kept in mind so that they 
are not repeated in our lives. 
  The brother chairman said: Unity is the means to achieve a 
better future. Preserving it is a sacred national duty, and the 
alternative to unity will be destructive for the entire 
homeland. He added: All are dutybound to safeguard unity 
because it will prevent the return to the past where 
partitioning prevailed. The preservation of unity takes place 
through sincere and fruitful action in the field and through the 
decisive confrontation of all those who seek to harm unity. 
  Addressing the audience, the sons of Shabwah Governorate, 
the 
brother chairman said: I highly value the results you have 
attained in your gathering. We support them because they embody 
a national spirit that remains committed to the constants which 
cannot be relinquished. We support all your legitimate demands 
and needs, whether in the field of services or in other fields. 
We will do our best to meet them within the available 
capabilities of the state. We are also in tune with the 
sentiments you have expressed that Shabwah should never again be 
the scapegoat or the arena for political disputes. We are 
confident that our homeland's future will be promising, God 
willing. We believe that the course of dialogue and 
understanding is the best approach for settling matters and 
disagreements. He added: Party, provincial, or religious 
biogtry will only cause tragedies. 
  The brother chairman said: We were united on 22 May, and we 
will safeguard our homeland's unity with all the power we have. 
Unity brings accord, peace of mind, establishes an atmopshere 
of amity and fraternity, responds to the people's needs and 
protects their rights. Unity means safety. Without it, we will 
become fragmented into more than one entity. 
  The brother chairman referred to the incident of the 
impounding of the large shipment of espionage, monitoring,and 
military telecommunications equipment which was recently 
confiscated by the competent authorities. He said that attempts 
were made to bring this shipment into the country illegally, a 
shipment which was impounded by the competent bodies. He said: 
In whose interest was this, and who paid for it? He added: 
Where are the regulations, the laws, and the conscience on 
whose basis we should account for what we do? We want to employ 
funds for the good of the Yemeni people, for developing the 
homeland, entrenching their unity, and not to harm the people 
and destroy the homeland. We must learn lessons from the past, 
and resort to reason, and not be influenced by whims and 
suspicions which only benefit Yemen's enemies. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Yemeni Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah has attributed the cause of the current 
political crisis in his country to the rivalry for power, which 
has affected the flow of foreign investment into Yemen. He 
denied that the worsening crisis can be blamed on external 
factors. 
  In statements to AL-AHRAM published Wednesday, he noted that 
charges that his country is providing refuge for terrorists 
might be prompted by some Afghan Arabs' infiltration of Yemen. 
He said that their infiltration takes place secretly and 
without the security authorities' consent. 
  He pointed out that Yemen has managed to normalize its 
relations with some of the Gulf Cooperation Council member 
countries and is still pursuing normalization with other 
countries so that these ties will return to their level 
preceding the crisis of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
  He called for not using the new oil oil discoveries in his 
country as pretext for contemplating partition, otherwise its 
wealth will turn into a misfortune instead of a blessing. 
  He said that clouds still loom Arab-Iraqi ties and that 
further strenuous efforts and essential amendments to the Arab 
League charter are needed. 
  On Yemen's stand on the Middle East market, the Yemeni 
foreign minister said his country is not inclined to end the 
boycott of Israel before a comprehensive and just peace is 
established in the region.

<F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah report: "Al-Bid Tells AL-HAYAH: The </F>
Socialist Party Is Committed to Signing the Accord Document But 
It Wants `Real' Guarantees"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Presidential Council 
deputy chairman and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], has, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, reaffirmed the 
"need" for signing the Pledge and Accord Document approved by 
the Yemeni parties. He saw it as a "document of national 
consensus" and said that it "complements" the unity agreement 
signed on 22 May 1990. But al-Bid, who was answering a written 
question sent to him by AL-HAYAH about the reasons for the delay 
in signing the document, pointed out that his party links 
signing the document to "real and sufficient guarantees for the 
implementation of its provisions." In what seemed like a 
warning, he stressed that "history will not turn back," a clear 
indication that the YSP refuses to return to the situation which 
prevailed before he chose seclusion in Aden since 19 August. 
  Following is the text of al-Bid's statement explaining the 
reasons which have delayed the signing of the agreement: 
  "First of all I wish to emphasize that the YSP considers the 
Pledge and Accord Document approved by the National Dialogue 
Committee to be a document representing the common vision of all 
the vital forces interested in protecting unity, consolidating 
the democratic experiment, and building a modern state in Yemen. 
  "Having been endorsed by the parties to the dialogue and 
received widespread popular support, it is now a document of 
national consensus in the sense that it has become the document 
of all the good people in Yemen who, without doubt, are the vast 
majority of the population. No views, positions, or agreements 
on issues pertaining to the Yemeni homeland and people have 
received such vast support as has this important agreement 
which, we in the YSP believe, complements the unity agreement 
signed on 22 May 1990. 
  "That document (the agreement) was signed by two Yemeni 
national parties, namely the YSP and the General People's 
Congress, but the Pledge and Accord Document was endorsed by all 
the parties operating in the Yemeni national arena, and it in 
effect reaffirms protection of the unity agreed on 22 May 1990 
and emphasizes the importance of building the unity state, which 
was not built during the transitional period and should be built 
now, with its roots reaching all the depth and width of the 
homeland and its edifice rising into the skies. That is why the 
YSP, proceeding from its national unionist outlook and its real 
interest in unity and democracy, reaffirms the need for signing 
this important national document which has been called the 
Pledge and Accord Document. 
  "Second, while emphasizing the importance of this document, 
seeing it as a document which heralds a new era, putting an end 
to the era and vestiges of secession and partition, the YSP is 
interested in this document finding its way to serious, speedy, 
practical implementation so that all aspects of life may 
stabilize. Therefore, and in light of its assessment of its 
past experience, it underscores -- and it has every right to do 
so -- the need for real and sufficient guarantees for the 
implementation of that document. The YSP now reasserts this 
point which it has been emphasizing since the beginning of the 
crisis and since the presentation of the known 18 points. When 
these 18 points were submitted, we underlined the importance of 
linking the acceptance of these points to commencement of their 
implementation and the provision of sufficient guarantees for 
that, including the party's proposal at the time that the 
dialogue be widened to include all influential forces in the 
Yemeni homeland, which later were represented in the National 
Dialogue Committee. 
  "That is why we continue to reaffirm what we had stressed 
along with all the forces really and genuinely interested in 
resolving the current crisis and eliminating all the obstacles 
threatening unity and democracy and their continuation. 
  "Third, in light of what we have just explained, we should 
proceed to sign the document with the presence of guarantees for 
its implementation. Anyone who rejects that in fact stands 
against the will of the people. The YSP will always uphold the 
will of the people, the good people of Yemen who are the vast 
majority of our fine people, or rather the entire struggling 
Yemeni people. 
  "Fourth, on the question of who is impeding the signing of 
the document, it is the party placing obstacles in the way of 
the provision of guarantees for the implementation of the Pledge 
and Accord Document which, as I said, has been unanimously 
approved by all the people. Those are in fact exposing their 
true intentions of rejecting the agreement and insisting on 
putting their personal narrow interests before the interests of 
the people. What is important is that history will not turn 
back." 
  Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council member 
and YSP assistant secretary general, has stated that "the YSP 
welcomes the conclusions reached by the Dialogue Committee of 
the Political Forces during its meeting in Sanaa the day before 
yesterday." He declared that the "party totally accepts the 
committee's decision naming the Jordanian capital Amman as the 
venue for the final signing of the Pledge and Accord Document."

  [Text] The Military Committee, led by brother Staff Colonel 
'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy chief of the General Staff and 
committee head, visited the (Nabudha) camp as part of its field 
[word indistinct] of the southern axis. 
  The committee met with the soldiers, noncommissioned 
officers, and officers of the camp. 
  The deputy chief of staff conveyed the greetings of the 
political and military leadership to the commanders and fighters 
of the brigade. He emphasized the unity and integration of our 
Armed Forces. 
  He said: The Armed Forces are in good shape, and the 
propaganda and rumors by those who are not concerned for the 
Yemeni unity [words indistinct] Armed Forces were received by 
enlightened behavior on the part of fighters. This demonstrated 
their eagerness to keep the military establishment away from 
conflicts and political rivalries. 
  He urged all to remain vigilant and have a sense of national 
responsibility in the service of the higher interest of the 
Yemeni homeland and people. 
  Brother Staff Colonel 'Ali Naji, Military Committee member, 
also spoke about the reality of current conditions in the 
national arena concerning the building of modern Yemen. He said 
the dispute was not between the north and the south, a fact 
which was emphasized by the document of pledge and accord and 
the popular meetings that agreed on various issues on building 
the state on the basis of unity. 
  The brother brigade commander welcomed the Military 
Committee 
members, and valued the great efforts made by the committee 
during the regrettable political crisis. He said these efforts 
had increased satisfaction and confidence that the homeland and 
its people are able to overcome the crisis through dialogue. 
  The Military Committee also visited the southern operations 
axis and met with commanders and soldiers. The deputy chief of 
the General Staff emphasized that the committee has implemented 
the tasks assigned to it based on a national concept and a high 
sense of responsibility that gives priority to the homeland's 
higher interests. 
  For his part, brother Staff Colonel Khalid al-Mahmar [not 
further identified] referred to the impact of the political 
crisis on the Armed Forces, and the positive role shouldered by 
the Military Committee to end the crisis and tension. He said 
the fighters highly appreciated this role, which has greatly 
helped to preserve the unity of our Armed Forces. He hoped that 
the crisis would be the last in order to forge ahead in building 
the homeland and the modern Yemeni state that is based on 
justice and order. 
  Brothers Colonel Ahmad Sayf, member of the Military 
Committee, and the commander of the 2d Brigade spoke about the 
vital importance of not getting drawn into the tension and 
wrongful incitement that harm the status of the Armed Forces and 
the nature of their tasks in defending the homeland. They urged 
the Armed Forces members to work for further integration and to 
bolster confidence on the basis of national unity. 
  Afterwards, an open discussion took place among the fighters 
in which they emphasized their total faith in the Yemeni unity 
and sincerity in defending it. They also emphasized their firm 
support for the masses' option of unity and democracy. They 
welcomed the document of pledge and accord, and said this 
document came to correct many defects concerning rights and 
duties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General </F>
Haytham Qasim Tahir by Lutfi Shatarah in Aden; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shatarah] A visitor to Yemen, which is 
experiencing one of its most serious political crises, senses 
profound official and popular optimism about the Pledge and 
Accord Document resulting from the national dialogue. In your 
view, what is the national and historic importance of this 
document? 
  [Tahir] The document's importance is that it represents a 
national consensus base in which everyone shoulders their 
responsibility honorably and sincerely. It embodies the Yemeni 
democratic political movement's ability to respond to the 
homeland's and people's objective need for democracy and to 
build the institutions of the unified state in accordance with 
contemporary concepts. The national and historic importance of 
this document transcends all the secondary and narrow agreements 
based on the principle of balance and power sharing between the 
two parties which forged unity. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] What new elements has the document introduced at 
the military level, and how would you assess its importance with 
regard to the military building of the unified state? 
  [Tahir] At the military level it can be said that this 
document has drawn up a clear strategic concept to rebuild -- I 
repeat, rebuild -- and organize the Armed Forces on the basis of 
modern national foundations matching the comprehensive unionist 
and democratic developments on the national and international 
scenes. More importantly, it has drawn up principles that are 
bound to reinforce the army's status and positive role in the 
context of the development process and to turn it into a factor 
of progress and stability rather than an obstacle to it. And as 
you noted, it specified the tasks for the Armed Forces in terms 
of the corps, their ideal sizes, their organization, and how 
they should be run. It also drew up the general outlines for 
attaining optimum preparedness, armament levels, organization, 
and rehabilitation. It can be said that for the first time 
national forces have been able to contribute directly to 
formulating a methodological view of the homeland's defense 
issue and to enhancing the Armed Forces' capability. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shatarah] In your capacity as a leader of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], which is a party to the current crisis, 
do you expect the Pledge and Accord Document to succeed? And in 
your view, what factor and conditions are needed for its 
successful implementation? 
  [Tahir] The criterion of any document's importance lies in 
its being turned into a transforming force and achieving the 
aims sought from it. It also lies in our ability to implement 
this document. Implementation of this document cannot be 
"partial" or "selective" in accordance with the criteria of 
narrow interests. It should be comprehensive and on schedule. 
And I hope the document will be different from the previous 
ones, namely that it will be seriously implemented and 
translated into reality. 
  As for the guarantees and conditions for its implementation, 
they lie in a group of practical and binding implementation 
measures which should be formulated and crystallized by the 
dialogue committee as part of this document. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] What are the conditions and guarantees at the 
military level? Implementing this document at the military 
level requires huge material and human resources in moving units 
to new positions. Have all the arrangements been made in this 
connection? 
  [Tahir] Success at the military level cannot be in 
isolation from the success of the implementation process as a 
whole. It is an integrated process. Birds cannot fly with one 
wing. I believe that the conditions for success are general 
before they can be particular, and all the country's 
capabilities, resources, and energies should be utilized to 
secure these conditions as long as they are to do with building 
foundations for a new unionist, strong, and prosperous state. 
  With regard to the capabilities needed to move the more 
disciplined military units, it is a very significant point. 
There are additional requirements which I believe society and 
the state will not be unable to meet. Citizens who have 
suffered a great deal as a result of the crisis, for the sake of 
defending unity and building a contemporary state, can see that 
the aim for which they have been struggling is about to be 
achieved, and are thus willing to make further sacrifices, even 
if the situation requires that they sacrifice their own lives 
for the sake of important and noble aims. The country's 
resources and capabilities are great and sufficient if they are 
used rationally and utilized correctly. 
  [Shatarah] The Armed Forces are given more attention in the 
national dialogue than any other institution. What do you think 
the reason for this is, and what are your plans to implement 
what is mentioned in the document with regard to the military 
aspect? 
  [Tahir] As you said, the military aspect was given more 
attention by the various parties engaged in the dialogue than 
any other aspect. Maybe because of the existence of legitimate 
concerns. Some people are rightly concerned about the present 
position of the Armed Forces and hence the potential sinister 
dangers and risks. And maybe because the Armed Forces represent 
the melting pot of Yemeni unity which accommodates all 
contradictions and the homeland's social, political, cultural, 
and geographical map. And their complete unification is a 
necessity to ensure unity's victory and consolidation. This 
importance is also derived from the Armed Forces' distinctive 
role in safeguarding the achievements of unity, the revolution, 
and democracy. 
  With regard to our plans for implementation, the document 
clearly specified the general outlines of our tasks in the Armed 
Forces, namely, to complete their merger, their redeployment, 
their withdrawal from the partition areas, and other tasks. It 
also specifies the timetable for implementing that. So we have 
begun to analyze and assess what is mentioned in the document 
and to draw up detailed tasks and steps for implementation, in 
addition to the necessary means and methods. We have formed 
specialized committees for each task and determined the 
orientations, aims, and principles that guarantee accurate and 
rigorous implementation. 
  [Shatarah] The document stipulates that the units present in 
what used to be known as the fringes between the two parts of 
Yemen be moved. To what areas will they be moved? 
  [Tahir] That principle is not prompted by the crisis or the 
present situation, to defuse that situation and avert an 
explosion in the present crisis, or to spare these units the 
risks of political frictions. It has always been part of our 
general view since the first day of unity. Because there is no 
military, security, or even economic need for these units to 
remain in their old positions. Their current presence has 
partially embodied the partition reality, even psychologically. 
The units should be moved to the areas that require the army's 
services and national and historic role in defending national 
sovereignty and protecting the people's economic interests 
against any aggression. That is, the units' movement should be 
governed by the principle of reinforcing the homeland's security 
and stability, protecting economic installations and foreign 
companies, closing outlets for terrorism and smuggling, and 
decisively contributing to combating them. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] What military units are required to be moved from 
the cities? 
  [Tahir] All military units that have combat tasks and 
weapons and which have no service, administrative, or military 
tasks that require their remaining in the cities. I believe 
that the stipulation is very clear in the document. 
  [Shatarah] Southern military officials demanded the need to 
abolish the Republican Guard and merge the Armed Forces. Why? 
And is there an alternative plan to provide protection for the 
president, vice president, and the other Presidential Council 
members? 
  [Tahir] Before unity the Republican Guard existed within 
the military formation of the Armed Forces in the northern 
governorates. Its leadership is under the control of the head 
of state along the lines of the practice in some countries, like 
fraternal Iraq. There is nothing similar to it in the southern 
or eastern governorates. The Republican Guard is not an 
internal security unit, as some people think. They are combat 
military units with a high level of preparedness and advanced 
and modern armament. 
  In terms of its structure, preparedness, and armament, the 
Republican Guard is above all else prepared to carry out 
large-scale military tasks to defend national sovereignty. This 
is why it is necessary for them to be within the formation of 
the Yemeni Armed Forces and for its units to be merged within 
the Yemeni Army. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] There have been numerous reports of the YSP's 
rejection of plans to move the camps from the fringes to the 
positions allocated to defending national sovereignty. 
  [Tahir] I am talking to you in my capacity as the defense 
minister of the Republic of Yemen, not as a partisan element. 
  All that is being reported about this or that party's 
rejection is untrue. It is a joint responsibility in all cases 
of failure and in all cases of success. We spoke about that 
earlier. The Army's deployment in the fringes continues to 
represent a form of partition and embody a failure to unify and 
merge the two armies after unity. The situation continued in 
that manner until the crisis emerged, when it assumed serious 
political dimensions. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Some observers believe that there will always be 
obstacles to the unification of the Armed Forces because of the 
clear difference between the two armies in terms of their 
partisan affiliations and the personnel's military and political 
upbringing? 
  [Tahir] The observers' expectations are inaccurate, indeed 
untrue. I do not whether this error is the result of their 
ignorance of the simplest axioms of Yemeni unity, which was 
established between two coherent social entities that are united 
in many aspects within a historical, geographical, and social 
framework and one stock and one religion. What is more, they 
are more united by family ties and demographic interlinkage than 
by political decisions, which have merely embodied the popular 
and official will and action. The army is part of this people. 
Its personnel have grown up under one Yemeni revolution and in 
a deep-rooted unionist foundation. No secondary factors can 
pose a threat to the spiritual, historical, ethical, and 
unionist formation of Yemeni fighters. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] How do you view the U.S. and European move to 
include U.S. and Western military officials in the military 
committees which are visiting the camps? And will their role 
focus on averting a military confrontation? 
  [Tahir] Military representatives from some embassies of the 
friendly states that expressed interest in the crisis and 
internal conditions in Yemen will participate in some field 
visits by the competent military committees. This military 
activity is an extension to their political and diplomatic 
activity aimed at resolving the crisis peacefully and through a 
broadly based democratic dialogue founded on safeguarding unity, 
building a contemporary state, and broadening the masses' 
participation in power. We thank these parties for their 
sincere efforts to secure a rapprochement of views at the 
political level and reduce military tension in the fringes. We 
thank them for their endeavors to avert the threats of war. 
  [Shatarah] If the parties which signed the document fail to 
implement its clauses, do you expect the situation to be settled 
militarily? 
  [Tahir] Why should we expect failure, not certain success? 
That is what I believe, for several reasons: First, we are 
serious and indeed determined to work to make the document a 
success. Nothing is impossible if there is a national will and 
consensus to work for the sake of the homeland. 
  Second, I believe that the document contains many success 
factors, namely, the national consensus, absolute popular 
support, and the great Arab and international blessing and 
support it enjoys. 
  Talk about the possible failure or abortion of this great 
plan is nothing but a desire and dream among those who are 
harmed by national reform and the building of a contemporary 
state, and among the enemies of unity and democracy, who by any 
standards are few and have no influence. 
  [Shatarah] What about the possibility of war? 
  [Tahir] The possibility of war is remote from our political 
vocabulary. Everyone realizes -- indeed, is convinced -- that 
war and its calamitous devastation are futile. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Right now, Yemen is experiencing a state of real 
separation. In your view, what are the ways out if the 
situation continues as it stands and if the clauses of the 
agreement are not implemented? 
  [Tahir] The crisis is the result of objective reality. It 
has its own causes and forces, and surmounting it is not 
impossible. 
  We always rely on the language of reason and dialogue. 
Because it is capable of solving the most complex of problems 
in a democratic and civilized manner. Despite the complexity 
and seriousness of the situation, it is still under political 
control. I always bank on the masses and their action, which 
achieved the Pledge and Accord Document. I believe that they 
are capable of implementing it. They achieved unity and they 
are its protectors. 
  If the document -- God forbid -- is not implemented, I 
personally cannot even accurately predict the disastrous 
consequences for the homeland's unity and future. If something 
of that kind takes place, it will mean an absolute inability to 
control the situation and its fallout. It would be a 
catastrophe by any standards. 
  Everyone has a grave national responsibility and crucial 
choice. Everyone must shoulder this responsibility both 
honorably and sincerely. And since we have succeeded in drawing 
up this document, we must continue to struggle in the same 
spirit for the sake of its implementation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A responsible source at the General Civil Aviation 
and Meteorology Authority has made a statement to the Yemeni 
News Agency, SABA', in which he expressed surprise over the 
statement made by brother Brigadier General Qasim Tahir, defense 
minister and member of the Political Bureau of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, on the Ugandan Boeing 707. He said that the 
statement is not in harmony with the Civil Aviation Law and the 
valid rules pertaining to aviation, and does not reflect reality. 
  To explain this, he said the air traffic controller at Sanaa 
International Airport was surprised by the entry of the plane 
into Yemeni airspace without obtaining a prior authorization 
from the competent authorities. The air traffic controller 
recalled the report of the Air Defense Command, which also 
stressed that there was no authorization for the entry and 
landing of that plane. If there had been any prior permit from 
the competent authorities, the concerned parties at air traffic 
control and air defense would have been informed [words 
indistinct] in accordance with the rules of the air 
transportation valid in our country and the rest of the world. 
  The responsible source at the Civil Aviation Authority 
asserted that the General Civil Aviation Authorities is the 
party responsible for issuing such permits in accordance with 
Article 10 of the Civil Aviation Law. Neither airports nor any 
other party have the right to grant such permits. 
  In addition to that, and if we consider that the Ugandan 
plane's travel was in the interest of the war effort of the 
Armed Forces in the southern and eastern governorates, as stated 
in the defense minister's statement, the Defense Ministry should 
have obtained a permit from the General Civil Aviation Authority 
in accordance with Article 10 of Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of 
1993, to which the authority referred in its previous statement. 
  The source also added that the authorization mentioned in 
the 
defense minister's statement No. 94/57, Aden, [word indistinct] 
was not issued by the competent and authorized authority; 
namely, the Civil Aviation Authority, which does not have any 
information on the issue. The source denounced the content of 
the statement made by the defense minister, who said that the 
measures taken to make the plane land in al-Hudaydah airport is 
considered a violation of the rules of the national and 
international aviation. The reverse is true. Organizing 
aviation is part of the duties assigned to the aviation 
authority, which it does in accordance with international 
agreements, particularly with the Chicago agreement on civil 
aviation. 
  Concluding, the source said: The brother defense minister 
should not have interfered in the work of the authority that is 
charged with the organization of aviation rules and should have 
encouraged the employees of the civil aviation authority, who 
carried out their duty to defend national sovereignty over the 
Republic of Yemen's airspace.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, accompanied by Presidential 
Council Member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani and House of 
Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, 
this morning attended the celebration organized by the Sanaa 
branch of the General People's Congress at the Cultural Center 
in Sanaa marking the 26th anniversary of the 70-day siege on 
Sanaa, December 1967 to February 1968 and the Yemeni people's 
triumph in the 70-day epic against the forces of tyranny and 
backwardness. 
  Brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council 
chairman, delivered a speech in which he said he was happy to 
attend this celebration marking the 26th anniversary of the 
siege on valiant Sanaa and the anniversary of the 70-day 
(?immortal) epic. He said: I am very pleased to see these 
national symbols and historic leaders, who had the honor to 
defend the revolution and the republic and defeat the [word 
indistinct] savage onslaught by the antirevolution and 
antirepublic forces during the 70-day siege on valiant Sanaa. 
On behalf of the Presidential Council -- the political 
leadership of united Yemen -- we have decided to award the 
70-day Medal to the city of Sanaa and the 70-day Medal to all 
the virtuous martyrs who fell during the 70-day epic and to all 
disabled veterans. [Words indistinct] of all historic, militant 
figures and leaders, and the shaykhs, dignitaries, social 
figures, and fighters who played prominent roles during that 
immortal, heroic epic. 
  The brother chairman added: As we approach the beginning of 
the holy month of Ramadan, we had hoped that we would have been 
able to sign the accord document achieved by the Political 
Forces Dialogue Committee on this day -- the 26th anniversary of 
the defeat of the siege on valiant Sanaa, in order to rescue our 
people from this regrettable crisis, which benefits none of us. 
[Word indistinct] to those who are responsible for fabricating 
this crisis, which is hurting our people, bringing price hikes 
and destroying their stable and tranquil life. It is an 
occasion on which we renew the call to all of our citizens, 
particularly the political forces, to pool their forces to 
preserve unity and democracy and [word indistinct] the firm 
militant spirit, with which our people preserved the march of 
revolution and the republic.

<F P=106> [News conference by Jordanian Ambassador Fakhri Abu-Talib </F>
with unidentified correspondents in Beirut on 8 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Talib] I visited the interior minister today to 
thank him for his interest since the time of the crime [29 
January assassination of Jordanian diplomat] and for instructing 
the security departments to take all the necessary measures to 
divulge the circumstances of the incident. I also thanked him 
for his condolences, which he conveyed to the embassy, on a 
common calamity that has pained us and all the Lebanese. 
  Such incidents will not affect Jordan or Lebanon. They can 
happen anywhere. I do not believe this incident will deflect 
the Jordanians from the correct course and the wise policy 
pursued by the king. 
  [Correspondent] Have you identified the motives of the 
crime? 
  [Abu-Talib] The motives and the investigation are in the 
hands of the Interior Ministry and the security departments; 
they are the ones qualified to make statements on the 
investigation. We are not conducting the investigation. 
  [Correspondent] There is talk .... [incomplete sentence as 
heard] 
  [Abu-Talib] I cannot confirm or deny who the culprits are. 
We are being put in the picture but we are not the ones 
authorized to officially state where the investigation has 
reached. 
  [Correspondent] Will Jordan demand the culprits' 
extradition? 
  [Abu-Talib] This is premature. 
  [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to 
the Jordanian regime behind the incident? 
  [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for 
the 
incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan 
and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent 
regimes, which still resort to such incidents. 
  [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes? 
  [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who 
committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of 
Lebanon or the Arab nation. 
  [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes? 
  [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me. 
  [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are 
Palestinians, do they not? 
  [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard. 
  [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this? 
  [Abu-Talib] We have not. 
  [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter? 
  [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot 
tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese 
security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role 
that is not ours to play.

  [Text] Fatah-the Revolutionary Council [FRC], led by 
Abu-Nidal, denied today that it is connected with the murder 10 
days ago of a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut. 
  In a statement released in Beirut, the movement said: We 
affirm that we have no connection, either closely or distantly, 
with the assassination of the first secretary [as heard] of the 
Jordanian Embassy in Lebanon. 
  The FRC statement asserted its confidence in the Lebanese 
judiciary and its integrity. The statement accused various 
agencies and parties of being behind this well-devised scenario, 
as the FRC statement put it.

  [Text] At around 1145 today, the Lebanese resistance 
shelled and launched several attacks on the Israeli positions in 
al-Ghizlan and Sujud. The Israeli forces retaliated with 
intensive artillery bombardment of several villages in Iqlim 
al-Tuffah. The clashes later developed into artillery duels 
between Tallat Sujud and the resistance positions in Iqlim 
al-Tuffah in which 155-mm and 120-mm artillery was used. 
Israeli aircraft flew intensive sorties over the central and 
western sectors and over Tyre, breaking the sound barrier more 
than once. 
  According to our correspondent in al-Biqa', a South Lebanese 
Army [SLA] foot patrol of 12, backed by a tank, crossed the 
contact line in the Zhaghlah-Hasbayya sector at 1000 today, 
advanced 2 km north of the security zone toward Mimis valley, 
and stopped 1 km from the Lebanese Army positions. The Army 
personnel in the area were placed on alert and took up combat 
positions. The SLA patrol returned to its position at 1200. 
Our correspondent said that Israeli Merkava tanks were spotted 
moving along the Kawkaba axis and fired five artillery shells at 
the al-Dallafi-Jabal al-Dahr axis.

  [Excerpts] The Israeli forces have deployed an artillery 
battery consisting of four 155-mm guns near al-'Ayshiyah. The 
enemy troops consolidated the posts of Tumat Niha, al-Surayri 
hills, Burghuz, and al-Kassarat with four Merkava tanks. M-113 
armored personnel carriers have been deployed in bunkers and 
trenches around the aforementioned posts. Mechanized vehicular 
movement has been noticed in the Kawkaba area. The Israeli 
troops brought in a number of mechanized vehicles, four 
long-range 202-mm guns, and three 175- mm guns from the occupied 
Arab territories into their posts in al- Khiyam and Marj 'Uyun 
area. They set up three observation towers on hills overlooking 
the roads, forests, and tracks near Kafr Huna and al-'Ayshiyah 
and supplied them with binoculars, flash lights, and mechanized 
vehicles. 
  Security sources have stated that the occupation troops this 
afternoon defused an explosive device to which two rockets were 
attached that was planted along the 'Alman-al-Shumariyah road. 
[passage omitted] 
  Hizballah today announced that one of its members was 
martyred during the ambush that the resistance fighters laid for 
an Israeli security patrol along the 'Alman-al-Shumariyah road 
yesterday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Robert Verdussen in Brussels; date not given: "Israel-PLO: 
Principal Problems Solved, but Time Still Needed"; first 
paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] It seems that Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will 
no doubt not be meeting on the evening of 7 February in Cairo in 
order to try, yet again, to open the door to an agreement on the 
implementation of Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
Failing a guarantee that, this time, he will be able to 
conclude with the Israeli foreign minister, the PLO leader will 
be absent. On the eve of this possible further meeting, Israeli 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin seemed to us both optimistic 
and prudent regarding the possibility of quickly concluding an 
agreement. 
<H5>  Such An Agreement Takes More Than a Couple of Pages </H5>
  [Verdussen] From the outside, it seems that Shim'on Peres 
and 
Yitzhaq Rabin are out of step. When the former meets 'Arafat, 
such as last time in Davos, he gives the impression that 
everything has been virtually settled. Then the prime minister 
comes across as much less optimistic and speaks of several weeks 
before everything is concluded. Is this a question of tactics 
or is there a problem within the government? 
  [Beilin] First of all, they are two different people and 
they 
may have different opinions. Having said this, most of the 
problems on the agenda were solved in Davos. Broadly speaking, 
there were three: the defense of the Israeli settlements in the 
Gaza strip, the extent of autonomy in Jericho, and control of 
the border with Jordan. These problems have so far prevented 
the signing of an agreement which, furthermore, was not on the 
agenda of Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat, not in Oslo, Cairo or 
Davos. If, as I hope, the solution is found this week in Cairo, 
we will still need several weeks to conclude. Such an agreement 
takes more than a couple of pages. Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin are 
not out of step, but there is a need to interpret and clarify. 
When Mr. Peres was optimistic, it was with respect to these 
three problems, not on the prospects of signing an agreement 
this Monday. 
<H5>  Respecting the Deadline? </H5>
  [Verdussen] Does this mean that the timetable set could have 
to be revised? 
  [Beilin] In Oslo, we decided that the whole process 
concerning Gaza and Jericho should take six months: two months 
for negotiations, four months for implementation. During the 
negotiations we realized that due to several details it would be 
impossible to conclude in two months. But we do not need four 
months to implement it. If the negotiations can be completed 
within the next few weeks, we can still respect the April 1994 
deadline. If not, it will be very difficult. 
  [Verdussen] What are the concrete problems which remain to 
be 
solved today for Palestinian autonomy? 
  [Beilin] Most of the problems are solved except regarding 
the 
transfer of authority in the fields of education, health, social 
assistance, etc. We are negotiating on all of this. Three or 
four questions remain to be settled or clarified. It is no 
longer always a question of negotiating but of exchanging 
information. It is a process. There are also economic problems 
which are not only important for us but also for Jordan and 
Egypt: currency, customs, population movements. 
<H5>  At the Highest Level </H5>
  [Verdussen] And to solve these problems do you need meetings 
at the highest level, between Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat? 
  [Beilin] In theory, it is true, problems of this kind could 
be settled at a lower level. But the fact is that it is not 
possible at this level. 
  [Verdussen] Why? 
  [Beilin] Firstly, no doubt because there are no precedents 
for us. And then, it is a fact that there is less flexibility 
at this level than at the summit. 
  [Verdussen] Yitzhaq Rabin recently expressed regret before 
the European Parliament at the ambiguous position of the 12 
towards Israel. Can you explain this point of view? 
  [Beilin] If you ask me what I think of the attitude of the 
Europeans, I would say to you that the 12 should be more 
committed to the peace process. They are already committed, it 
is true, especially in the economic field. But that is not 
enough. The Europeans have always told us: We follow the 
Americans. And that can seem ambiguous. The Europeans must 
first help the Palestinians by being sure that the dollars they 
give get through to the population. And this is not easy to the 
extent that the Palestinians are still just beginning to set up 
their institutions. The Europeans must then become involved in 
joint development projects in the Middle East: electricity, 
water, roads, telecommunications. Security depends on politics 
but also on the economy. If certain countries such as Belgium 
are fully committed, other members of the European Union do not 
award the same priority to this problem. Money is important. 
But the Middle East also needs know-how and technology. And we 
must not forget that it is not just a question of charity but 
also an economic potential which could be very attractive.

Israel to examine investment possibilities. Moti Trotosh, Union

includes private businessmen who came for purely business 
purposes, but in his opinion this visit will be followed by 
political contacts. 
  According to Mr. Trotosh the delegation will mainly deal 
with 
energy related deals, because after the contacts with Qatar on 
this issue new vistas have been opened to Israel in the gas and 
oil sphere. 
  The Saudis are also examining trade possibilities after 
peace 
agreements are signed.

  [Text] The commander of the Northern Command has said that 
the northern border is relatively quiet. There is constant 
activity along the border by both Israel and the terrorist 
elements, in particular Hizballah, he said. Major General 
Yitzhaq Mordekhay said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is 
operating inside the security zone and outside it according to 
the policy decided on by the political echelon. He noted that 
the understandings with Syria worked out in the wake of 
Operation Accountability are still in effect. The Israeli side 
of the northern border is not being shelled. 
  It is difficult to act against Hizballah when its members 
operate in built-up areas populated by civilians, he said. Gen. 
Mordekhay said that the IDF is carrying out initiated actions 
because were it not doing so, the situation on the ground would 
be worse. The general added that the IDF has drawn lessons from 
Monday's [7 February] firefight in the al-Rayhan area in which 
four soldiers were killed. Gen. Mordekhay made these remarks 
to our army affairs correspondent, Karmela Menashe.

<F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>
  [Excerpts] For the first time since the Israel-PLO 
agreements were signed, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
yesterday began to reduce the number of troops stationed in the 
Gaza Strip. 
  An IDF post overlooking the Jabalyah refugee camp was closed 
yesterday and was replaced with a small lookout. 
  Military sources said the outpost, called "Outpost Oranim," 
was evacuated in the wake of the IDF's change in deployment in 
the Gaza Strip, but they did not rule out the possibility that 
the reduction in forces came in the wake of the agreements with 
the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  The bullet-ridden body of 'Ata Abu-Ahmad, 30, who worked in 
Gaza's local hospital, was found. 'Ata was abducted four days 
ago from his place of work on suspicion of aiding Israel. He 
was murdered and following the murder the hospital workers went 
on strike.

  [Excerpt] The Israel Navy yesterday received the 
Nirit-category missile boat which will bear the name of Kidon. 
The boat's construction began at Israel Shipyards some two 
years as part of the plan to upgrade the Israel Navy missile 
warships. The boat was designed in Israel on the basis of many 
years of operational experience with missile boats. 
  The boat's body is identical to that of Saar 4.5. It is 
61.7-meter long and 7-meter wide, and its maximum displacement 
is 488 metric tons. The vessel will be equipped with 
sophisticated modern means of warfare, including an electronic 
combat system, a ship- detecting radar system, aircraft and 
missiles, a control and monitoring system, Gabriel missiles, 
Harpoon missiles, Vulcan and Phalanx antiaircraft guns, and 
Barak, the Israeli-developed antimissile missile. The vessel's 
maximum speed is 31 knots, and it will accommodate a crew of 45 
officers and soldiers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The testing phase of antimissile missile Barak have 
been completed, and the Israeli Navy will procure its first 
Barak system in the coming months. 
  "Baraqi completed a three-part series of tests at the end of 
last year, and all three tests were successful." This was 
revealed yesterday by a senior Israeli Navy figure. He added 
that the Navy plans to install this missile system on the Saar 5 
missile boats which are being built in the United States, and on 
some of the Saar 4.5 vessels. 
  The Barak missile is the result of a joint REFA'EL [Armament 
Development Authority] and IAI [Israel Aircraft Industries] 
development. The missile's range is about 10 km, and it can hit 
a pinpointed target. The missile will be mounted on Saar 5 and 
Saar 4.5 as the central defense weapon system. The senior 
figure said that Barak is the best missile of its kind in the 
world, and its uniqueness lies in its ability to intercept 
low-flying missiles cruising a few meters above water. The 
missile can be also used against attacking aircraft. 
  In the last three tests, the missile was fired from a naval 
platform, and it intercepted a Gabriel ship-to-ship missile. In 
one of the tests, Barak hit Gabriel as it had been programmed, 
while in the other two tests, it passed a short distance from it 
-- also in accordance with the programming which sought to 
collect data about the missile's performance.

Li'or Tubul, Ronen Qaramani, Rafi Doron, and Yehoshu'a Friedberg 
were given four consecutive life sentences each. Two of them 
were given additional 20 years in prison for attempted murder. 
The Jerusalem District Court handed down the sentence after 
convicting them upon their own admission. 
  Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that in an 
unprecedented move, the president of the court did not allow one 
of the defendants to complete his statement before the sentence 
was issued in view of the political nature of his remarks, as 
the judge put it. After the sentencing, Qaramani's brother 
tried to attack one of the murderers, but was stopped.

<F P=106> ["Final statement" issued after the joint meeting of the </F>
Presidential and the Executive Councils of the united Iraqi 
National Congress in Salah-al-Din on 6 February -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
The Presidential and Executive Councils of the united Iraqi 
National Congress, INC, held their sixth joint meeting in the 
INC headquarters in the city of Salah-al-Din from 1-6 February 
1994. 
  The meeting was inaugurated by a Koranic recitation. The 
chairman of the Executive Council then read a report on the 
INC's activities during 1993 and the agenda of the meeting was 
approved. The agenda includes a review of recent developments 
inside Iraq and on the regional and international levels with 
regard to the Iraqi issue. The conferees studied the report 
presented by the chairman of the Executive Council. 
  In light of this, the following committees were formed to 
discuss matters in detail: 
  The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee; the International 
Affairs Committee; the Financial Committee; the Administration 
and Organizational Committee; and the 1994 Plan Committee. 
  The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee discussed ways to 
promote the INC's relations with the neighborly states, the Arab 
states, and the Islamic world to serve the cause of the Iraqi 
people and to confront dictatorship in Iraq. The committee made 
many recommendations in this regard. 
  The International Affairs Committee dealt with developments 
in the issue in terms of international organizations and foreign 
countries. The committee recommended that the INC exert efforts 
to ensure the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 
706 and 712, which call for providing food and medicine to the 
Iraqi people to alleviate their suffering provided that the 
dictatorial regime is deprived of the flow of funds. 
  The conferees studied the new international efforts to 
implement the UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council 
Resolution 688, which call for ending repression and coercion 
against the Iraqi people. The conferees underscored the need to 
protect human rights and called for an expansion of the no-fly 
zone to cover the whole of Iraq and establish a safehaven in the 
south. They also noted that the international community is 
becoming firmer vis-a-vis the dictatorial regime of Saddam 
Husayn and is supporting trends to set up a national democratic 
alternative in Iraq that respects the will of the Arab and 
Kurdish people to choose the form of their future government in 
Iraq. 
  The Financial, Administrative, and Organizational Committees 
studied financial, administrative, and organizational affairs. 
The committees' reports tackled financial, administrative, and 
organizational matters. The conferees discussed these issues 
and made the appropriate decisions. 
  The conferees also made the necessary decisions and took 
measures to activate the constitutional consultative council. 
  The committee charged with charting the 1994 plan stressed 
the need to continue the conference's program and working plans 
to confront the dictatorial regime and establish a democratic 
alternative. 
  The plan touches on the principal issues in the struggle 
against dictatorship, especially the political aspect. It is 
aimed at implementing the conference's political statement by: 
emphasizing the democratic, national alternative that we seek 
to achieve; by entrenching the democratic experience in 
Kurdistan; by showing concern for the unity of Iraq, which is 
being threatened by the course followed by the dictatorial 
regime and by the regime's continuation; by emphasizing the 
importance of strengthening Arab-Kurdish brotherhood and 
guaranteeing administrative and cultural national rights to the 
Turkomans and Assyrians; and by seeking to create a democratic, 
pluralistic, federal Iraq that strengthens the country's unity. 
  The plan also emphasizes the need to employ regional and 
international sympathy for our people to help enact the 
international resolutions and serve the struggle against 
dictatorship. The plan also emphasizes our reliance on our 
people's administration to establish an alternative of their 
choice. 
  The plan is also aimed at strengthening the conference's 
initiatives on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels to 
win greater attention from the world in support of the Iraqi 
cause. 
  On the subject of human rights, we stress the need to draft 
a 
comprehensive plan to activate and implement UN Security Council 
Resolution 688. This includes the dispatch of UN observers to 
monitor human rights violations in Iraq, the stationing of UN 
guards in all parts of Iraq, the confrontation of all acts of 
suppression practiced by the regime, and the end of the domestic 
embargo imposed on liberated Kurdistan and other areas in the 
south. Iraqi Kurdistan must be exempted from the international 
embargo in order to alleviate the people's suffering and to help 
ensure the success of democracy in the region. We must do 
everything possible to stop the regime from continuing the 
policy of drying up the marshlands and displacing its Arab 
Shiite inhabitants. We also demand that Saddam and his gang be 
brought before an international court in accordance with the 
bill of indictment, which was prepared by the INC and presented 
to the United Nations and other international organizations. 
  In the field of the media, the plan stresses the need to 
adopt a policy, both inside and outside, to implement the 
political directives of the conference, develop media agencies, 
and provide the necessary funds and supplies for them. 
  The conferees also decided to consider all the papers 
presented by the specialized committees, after they are 
approved, as part of the 1994 plan. 
  The joint meeting of the two councils was briefed on certain 
aspects and results of the field action. The competent agencies 
in the conference have chartered the plan for the field action 
for 1994. 
  The problems, programs, and action plan were discussed with 
a sense of great responsibility. Constructive and practical 
decisions and recommendations were reached in a democratic 
fashion, which confirms the existence of common convictions in 
all areas. 
  The conferees were apprised of the outcome of the meeting 
held in Ankara by the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran, and 
Turkey. They welcomed the ministers' statement the the internal 
siege clamped on Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Iraq must be 
lifted, and that electrical services must be restored to Dahuk. 
They also welcomed the ministers' reiteration that Iraqi 
people must be allowed to determine their future by free will. 
In the same vein, the conferees would like to assert that the 
continued survival of Saddam Husayn's regime poses a real threat 
to the country's unity. We Iraqis, are the most concerned for 
the unity of our people and homeland, the conferees noted. 
  The conferees underlined their eagerness and constant 
efforts 
to establish a democratic Iraq that would promote regional 
security and stability, contribute to the establishment of good 
relations with neighboring countries, and foster the economic 
growth of the peoples of the region. 
  The conferees hailed the third anniversary of the glorious 
popular uprising of March 1991, which expressed the people's 
will against dictatorship and constituted a popular referendum 
demanding the ousting of the regime. They glorified the martyrs 
of the uprising and the anniversary of the heroic feats forged 
by the uprising's heroes. They also pledged to the martyrs to 
continue the struggle until the achievement of their objective 
of toppling dictatorship. 
  While condemning the regime's repressive and criminal 
practices, the joint meeting of the INC's Presidential Council 
and Executive Council commends the steadfastness and sacrifices 
of the glorious Iraqi people. In the same vein, they hail the 
Kurdish people's resistance, as demonstrated in their efforts to 
safeguard their democratic experiment, as well as the gains they 
have made for the whole of Iraq. The conferees also commend our 
people's steadfastness and resistance in southern and central 
Iraq and the rest of Iraq. They urge military personnel and 
Ba'thists to abandon the tyrant, to join the people's ranks in 
struggle, and to step up this struggle on all levels in order to 
topple dictatorship and set up a patriotic and democratic regime. 
  And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your 
work, and His Apostle, and the believers. [part of a Koranic 
verse] 
  [signed] The Presidential Council and Executive Council of 
the united INC, Salah-al-Din, Irbil 
  [dated] 6 February 1994, corresponding to 24 Sha'ban 1414 
Hegira

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraqi Opposition Criticizes Istanbul </F>
Meeting and Reaffirms Insistence on Federal System"] 
  [Text] London -- The "Unified Iraqi National Congress" 
[UINC] and the tripartite Presidential Council emanating from it 
have approved a "field action" plan and reaffirmed that they 
seek "a democratic federal Iraq that would consolidate the 
country's unity." A statement issued at the conclusion of the 
meetings held by the UINC and the Presidential Council in the 
town of Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq criticized the 
Syrian-Turkish-Iranian ministerial meeting held in Istanbul last 
Saturday [5 February]. 
  The Iraqi opposition's joint meetings were held 1-6 February 
and were boycotted by the opposition's pan-Arab faction based in 
Damascus. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati had pledged to "confront any attempt to fragment 
Iraq." 
  In a telephone statement from Salah-al-Din, Sami 
'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the UINC Executive Council, said that 
"the tone of the ministerial statement in reference to the 
fragmentation of Iraq was the strongest" issued by al-Shar', 
Cetin, and Velayati, "and it very much surprised the UINC in its 
emphasis on this issue, for neither the Kurdistan Front nor the 
UINC is calling for the division or partition of Iraq." He 
added: "We do not know if these fears are a result of 
dissatisfaction with the democratic experiment in Iraqi 
Kurdistan." But he also said that "the ministerial statement 
contained some positive points such as the call for an end to 
the internal (Iraqi) blockade against Iraqi Kurdistan and the 
south and for the restoration of the power supply to Dahuk, 
asserting that it should be left to the Iraqi people to 
determine their own future freely." 
  He drew attention to the Iraqi opposition's statement that 
"the regime of (President) Saddam Husayn and its continuation 
are the real threat to the country's unity. We Iraqis care most 
about the unity of our people and homeland." In his view, there 
was no connection between the Turkish raids on positions in 
northern Iraq the day before yesterday and the results of the 
Istanbul meeting. He stressed that "these raids will never 
settle anything" as regards tackling the issue of the Kurdish 
Workers Party which is waging a war against the Turkish state. 
  Sami 'Abd-al-Rahman emphasized that the opposition "is not 
contemplating setting up an army to fight the Iraqi Army." He 
said that the Salah-al-Din statement "renewed its appeal to the 
military and to the members of the ruling Ba'th Party to join 
the ranks of the people to escalate the struggle to overthrow 
the regime." He added that over 300 figures took part in the 
joint meetings, which were also attended by tripartite 
Presidential Council Members Muhammad Bahr-al-'Ulum, Mas'ud 
Barzani, and Major General Hasan al-Naqib and which "passed 
resolutions dealing with all organizational and financial 
problems." He said that the conferees also concentrated on ways 
of handling the issue of the Kurdistan Islamic Movement [KIM] 
after the clashes which broke out between its fighters and 
fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal 
Talabani. "The UINC's view is that the solutions should be 
based on the principle of reconciliation and that the KIM should 
be treated like any other party in accordance with the Kurdish 
parliament's laws including the law prohibiting possession of 
arms." 
  The opposition also renewed its call for "the expansion of 
the air exclusion zone to include all Iraq and for the creation 
of safe havens in the south." The statement of the UINC 
Presidential Council and Executive Council "called for the 
deployment of UN guards throughout all Iraq" and for the 
dispatch of UN observers to "watch out for violations of human 
rights, lift the internal blocade imposed on liberated Kurdistan 
and southern areas, and exclude Kurdistan from the international 
embargo to ease the people's suffering." It praised the 
"steadfastness of our people in the south, the center, and the 
rest of the country," and it "saluted the third anniversary of 
the popular uprising" in southern Iraq which followed the Gulf 
war. The conferees also discussed development of ties between 
the UINC and the neighboring states and the Arab and Islamic 
states.

  [Text] According to sources of the Iraqi opposition abroad, 
a huge explosion occurred at the Foreign Ministry of tyrant 
Saddam's regime. According to sources inside Iraq, the 
explosion took place on Saturday [5 February] night, causing 
severe property damage and killing some of the ministry's 
employees. 
  Tyrant Saddam's regime imposed a tight cordon around the 
scene of the blast and desperately tried to prevent the news 
from reaching news agencies abroad, but eyewitnesses have 
described the explosion as breathtaking and said it was heard in 
several areas of Baghdad.

8 February revolution. 
  The leader president has received a cable of congratulations 
from Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative Council of 
the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. The cable reads as follows: 
On the 31st anniversary of the glorious 8 February revolution, 
I would like to extend, in my name and on behalf of the 
Legislative Council members and all noble Kurds, my heartfelt 
congratulations to Your Excellency the president. I beseech 
Almighty God to grant you continued good health, and to help our 
steadfast people, under your wise leadership, achieve complete 
victory over the evil aggressors, consummate the march of 
reconstruction and jihad, and break the unfair embargo imposed 
on great Iraq. 
  Leader president: The will of our people, be they Arabs, 
Kurds, or other minorities, will remain strong and unbeatable, 
regardless of the savagery of the aggression and its evil 
chapters. Our Kurdish people, whose dreams have come true and 
whose rights have been restored under your wise and historic 
leadership, are opposed to the imperialist-Zionist-reactionary 
presence on Kurdish territory. They would like to underscore 
their unwavering faith in inevitable victory over the hateful 
enemies, who are now gathered in a treacherous and atheistic 
alliance to harm great Iraq and starve their militant people. 
  For his part, Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim al-Barazanji, chairman of 
the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous region, has 
sent a similar cable to the leader president, saying: On the 
occasion of our Iraqi people's celebrations marking the blessed 
8 February revolution, allow me, leader president, to extend to 
you, in my name and on behalf of the Executive Council members 
and all sincere Kurds, my heartfelt congratulations. We pledge 
to Your Excellency to remain loyal soldiers under your wise 
leadership to defeat the 30-state aggression, consummate the 
reconstruction and jihad drive, and break the unfair embargo 
imposed on Iraq. 
  Leader President: Our people, under your courageous 
leadership, are bound to win the war. They will humiliate all 
enemies and cause them to suffer certain defeat and 
disappointment. On the anniversary of the glorious 8 February 
revolution, our people will derive strength and determination 
from your strength and resolve to defeat the evildoers and 
achieve victory. They will forge ahead with all confidence and 
resolve behind your historic leadership to build new Iraq and 
uphold the lofty banner of God is great. 
  Mujahid President: May you live long as a historic leader 
for Iraq, the home of Arabs, Kurds, and minorities, and as a 
shining symbol of our hopes, aspirations, and reconstruction 
drive.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 7 (INA)--A recent report by a Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) mission has confirmed earlier 
conclusions by another FAO/WFP survey that warns of a rapid 
deterioration in food supply situation throughout Iraq. The 
present mission report, issued in December last year, notes with 
deep concerns the prevalence of several commonly recognized 
pre-famine indicators. These conclusions, based on observations 
and interviews in several areas of the country, confirm the 
presence of such indicators as very high food prices, collapse 
of private incomes, depletion of personal assets as well as 
rapidly increasing numbers of the destitutes. Following is the 
fourth part of the FAO mission report: 
  The shortage in water supply has led to severe problems in 
hygiene. According to health authorities outbreaks of lice, 
typhoid, and cholera continue to be serious public health 
problems in al-Basrah and throughout the country (department in 
al-Basrah, personal communication). 
  Moreover, sanitation has become a common problem in schools 
that now have 2-3 shifts a day leading to facilitated 
transmission of water-borne diseases amongst the primary age 
school children. Care International reported that in 1954 [year 
as received] it plans to rehabilitate school lavatories. 
  Although the extensive vaccination supply system and the 
cold 
chain broke down completely immediately after the war, 
immunization rates are back well above 80 per cent, better than 
pre-war levels in certain areas (UNICEF 1993, personal 
communication). The Ministry of Health has received substantial 
assistance from UNICEF/WHO in maintaining the cold chain and in 
the provision of vaccines for immunization. The mission noted 
adequate stocks of vaccines in Maysan and Irbil Governorates. 
In addition, many mothers when asked, knew about the BCG 
vaccination. 
  Although little is known about the incidence of acute 
respiratory factions (ARI), drugs to treat infections in 
children remain inadequate. The mission noted that several 
cases of ARI in the pediatric wards of Saddam City Hospital in 
Baghdad. These cases were receiving antibiotic treatment but 
physicians complained of shortages, especially during the later 
winter months when ARI is a more frequent occurrence. WHO does 
provide drugs and other medical supplies, but the total amount 
is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. In July to 
March 1993, 780,000 U.S. dollars worth of drugs were provided 
under the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Programme. However, 
drugs to treat chronic diseases, anesthesia to perform basic 
surgical procedures, nitrous oxide for birthing facilities as 
well as antibiotics to control infection after surgery are 
virtually unavailable as reported by several hospitals and the 
minister of health. This was offered as the explanation of why 
hospitals are now functioning at 40-50 per cent of their 
original capacity in spite of the reported increase in 
infectious disease and severe malnutrition. 
  Only severely ill cases are now being treated. Even when 
drugs are available, their price on the free market may be 200 
times greater than the government rationed price, thus making 
them virtually unobtainable for the poor. 
  In summary, food insecurity at the household level, 
inadequate water and sanitary system, and the shortage of drugs 
to treat infections are likely to result in more serious 
malnutrition. 
  A small scale study was conducted in collaboration with the 
Nutrition Research Institute in one of the least privileged 
areas of Baghdad Saddam City. 
  The objective of the study was to observe first hand the 
household food security situation in a disadvantaged subsample 
of the urban population and to assess their nutritional status 
using simple anthropometric measures. All members of the family 
present at the time of the home visit were measured and their 
age ascertained utilizing whenever possible the subjects health 
cards, eight of the 13 clusters in Saddam City canvassed during 
the 1991 international team survey were selected for the study 
to permit a comparison. 
  Although the study was carried out by five teams, results 
from only 4 teams are reported. These teams were supervised by 
mission members. Each team included two technicians and one 
professional supervisor from the Nutrition Research Institute 
and one member of the mission. One hundred and twenty one 
households were visited and a total of 506 subjects were 
measured; 194 were children under 5 years of age, 136 children 
between 5 and 15 years of age, and 172 persons 15 years of age 
and older. 
  Mission member observed that a number of households had sold 
most of their family assets: Furniture, refrigerators, 
television, jewelry, and other items. Some of the children and 
adults wore tattered clothes but most households appeared to 
have access to kerosene for heating, tap water, and electricity. 
  The study had a number of limitations. The sample was not 
representative of Baghdad as a whole; it was purposely chosen to 
assess the situation among an underprivileged urban group but 
results cannot be extrapolated to a defined sector of the Iraqi 
population. The study had other limitations; the bathroom 
scales to weigh the preschool children were designed to weigh 
adults and therefore lacked precision when used to measure 
children. It should be noted, however, that although these 
scales were not calibrated and standardized because of lack of 
time, they were SECA manufactured and used for the first time. 
They were provided by UNICEF for use in anthropometric 
measurements. Baby balances (SECA) were used in weighing very 
young infants below 10 kg weight. The height boards and tapes 
were all new and perfectly suitable for the purpose. The 
enumerators included persons with variable degrees of experience 
in taking anthropometric measurements and there was no time to 
train them or to standardize their techniques.

<F P=106> [Report by Shihab Ahmad Mahmud titled: "Why Do Some Military </F>
Policemen Refuse To Recognize End of Service Document?"] 
  [Excerpt] Military policemen's known duty is to punish 
wrongdoers, apprehend deserters from military service and so 
forth. Nobody differs on that. But there have been complaints 
against these policemen which must be mentioned. We have 
received many complaints about their behavior and maltreatment 
of certain innocent individuals. Despite the fact these 
individuals carried documents proving their correct status, the 
military policemen treated them as wrongdoers or deserters. The 
complaints include one sent by citizen (J-'A), from Madinat 
al-Hurriyah who was apprehended by a military police detachment 
and remanded for five days despite the fact that he carried an 
end of service document which was issued by the Ministry of 
Defense. Still, they did not recognize it! [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Hamid Sa'id article: "The Last Word"] </F>
  [Text] It seems to me that the subdistricts development 
project, which we have rejoiced in and written about 
enthusiastically, has not produced all the results we had hoped 
for, nor has it been as successful as we have read in some of 
our media. 
  It is clear to me, at least, that what has been achieved by 
this project has not been even in all areas of development. In 
some areas, the level of development and the standard of work 
was higher than in others. 
  I had hoped to visit many of those subdistricts to get 
directly acquainted with the work that has been achieved by the 
development project, but it was not possible for many reasons. 
And in the areas I did visit I noticed that the level and 
volume of what we termed the development project was not as 
described in the news media. 
  But I have also received letters from several subdistricts 
included in the development, and all of them referred to the 
many negative points and the artificiality of work on this 
project. In several cases, the citizens's basic needs in the 
subdistricts have remained unfulfilled. 
  It appeared to me from some of the letters that the writer 
had exaggerated their criticism of the work that had been done 
in their subdistricts. Some of the letters said that the funds 
that had been spent on developing the subdistricts could have 
been used to accomplish something more important, but that the 
funds were not spent properly and some subcontractors had 
benefited more than the subdistricts themselves. 
  I cannot confirm or deny what the letters said, but let me 
put it this way: the citizens in the subdistricts know more 
about their affairs than I do. 
  Since I have not seen most of the subdistricts, and I cannot 
accept all that is contained in the letters either, I can only 
say that it is not logical to ignore what has come out in these 
letters. I believe that it is essential to establish honest 
neutral committees in order to inspect the areas where the work 
has taken place. 
  I hope that these committees will be able to hear what the 
citizens have to say and to determine the needs and shortages of 
their subdistricts. 
  We all know that work that is incomplete or ill-considered 
often leads to results directly opposed to what was intended. 
  I asked a National Assembly member about his subdistrict and 
what he told me did not please me. He confirmed what was 
written in the letter I received from a citizen in his 
subdistrict.

  [Excerpt] Leading members of the Libyan cultural and 
information mission currently visiting Iraq have stated that the 
blockade imposed on Iraq is only an old imperialist attempt in a 
new guise to strike at the beacons of light and awakening, of 
which Iraq is an important one. 
  The visitors denounced the continuation of the blockade as a 
crime, since Iraq has fulfilled its obligations toward the 
so-called United Nations. They also condemned the crimes caused 
by the blockade, such as the death of children and old people 
due to shortage of food and medicine. 
  The members expressed their admiration for Iraq's mighty 
resources, which have contributed to the rebuilding of what was 
destroyed by the evil aggressors. They noted that these 
resources are not just for Iraq, but for the entire Arab nation, 
which the enemies seek to undermine. 
  Dr. Ahmad 'Aziz, director general of the Libyan Cultural 
Affairs Department, said: The resources we have seen in Iraq 
confirm the nation's vitality and ability for sacrifice and 
creativity. Had the Arab countries been given the opportunity 
to solidly unite together, they would have become a great 
nation, contributing to the building of human civilization and 
asserting its place among world nations, thus realizing its 
ambitions and will. 
  Dr. 'Aziz added that the blockades imposed on Iraq and Libya 
show that the imperialist states do not want the Arab nation and 
the Arab people, whether in Libya or Iraq, to assert their Arab 
identity. They want to suppress the Arab nation's aspiration for 
unity and power, he said. 
  Regarding the prospects for cultural cooperation between the 
two fraternal countries, Dr. 'Aziz said that cultural activity 
in Iraq is as good and distinctive as it is in the Libyan 
Jamahiriyah. Holding Libyan cultural functions in Iraq such as 
these, he added, will mark a new beginning, God willing, for 
further interaction in the cultural and media fields between the 
two fraternal countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 8 Feb (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
says that the problem with British Prime Minister Major is that 
he, just like the other politicians whose calculations have 
proven to be wrong, thought that playing the Kurdish card would 
result in destabilizing the Iraqi regime. The end result is 
that he has placed his country and the U.S. Administration at an 
impasse. 
  In its editorial today, the paper ridicules Major's 
statements that "the Kurdistan region is safe," wondering when 
it was actually more safe -- now or before the anti-Iraq 
aggression. 
  The paper answers this question, saying that all fair-minded 
people, even Major himself, cannot deny that the Iraqi Kurdistan 
region enjoyed stability, security, a high standard of living, 
as well as the potential for rapid growth before the onset of 
the aggression. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that, before the aggression, there was a 
kind of tranquility along the Iraqi-Turkish borders--a 
tranquility that was marred by only few minor clashes between 
the Kurdish Workers Party and the Turkish authorities. 
  The paper points out the current situation in the Kurdistan 
region, including the military interventions there, as well as 
the Turkish and Iranian attacks on some positions in the region. 
It also mentions the incidents witnessed in southeastern 
Turkey, which have been stepped up since the anti-Iraq 
aggression. 
  The paper also speaks of the impasse in which Major placed 
the U.S. Administration, as manifested by the presence of the 
so-called Hammer Force in the region. The opposition is 
wagering on the continued deployment of this force. However, 
this force is stuck there. It can neither stay there forever, 
nor withdraw, because it has failed to turn the region into a 
"safe haven." Likewise, this force cannot establish a Kurdish 
state there, because Turkey, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and other states 
strongly oppose this. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: There are indications of another impasse 
in Iraqi Kurdistan. For the armed agents in northern Iraq are 
confused. Worse still, they feel that they have reached a dead 
end, and that they have been exposed as terrorist gangs that are 
willing to slay one another for trivial reasons, to betray 
Kurdish nationalism, and to collude with the enemies of Kurds 
just to maintain their oppression of our Kurdish people. 
  The paper goes on to say: The people of Kurdistan have begun 
to speak publicly, expressing their desire to return to Iraq's 
lap. They are singing the praises of His Excellency President 
Saddam Husayn and writing graffiti expressing their sentiments 
toward his excellency the president. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper says that our Kurdish 
people's return to Iraq's lap would grant them the warmth, 
security, and stability they have been denied in the false "safe 
haven" created and protected by the British and Americans. The 
"safe haven" the British and Americans created is even robbing 
its creators of security, the paper maintains.

  [Text] New York, 8 Feb (INA) -- Iraq has informed the UN 
General Secretariat of U.S. aircraft violations of its airspace 
on provocation and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft, 
breaking the sound barrier, are also dropping hostile leaflets 
and flares. 
  In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
Iraq's permanent UN representative said between 21-31 January, 
the U.S. aircraft violated Iraq's airspace, conducting 719 
sorties over wide areas in northern and southern Iraq. 
  He pointed out that a red drone was seen in the Umm Qasr 
region, heading from west to east. Another drone, coming from 
Saudi Arabia, dropped leaflets between al-Shu'aybah and 
al-Wahdah Airport. 
  He also confirmed that on 25 January, a drone was observed 
heading toward al-Dayr region. On 27 January, another drone was 
seen falling in the al-Barjasiyah region. 
  Iraq's permanent UN representative added that two 
reconnaissance TR-1 planes were detected over al-Basrah, 
al-'Amarah, al-Nasiriyah, al-Diwaniyah, and southern al-Najaf, 
which then headed for Saudi territories. 
  He added that on 28 January, a drone violated Iraq's 
airspace 
over al-Basrah, Safwan, al-Shu'aybah, Jabal Sinam, and returned 
to Kuwait again on the same day.

  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn, accompanied by His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan, today visited the Prime Ministry, 
where he met with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. 
Al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal Hashemite Court, 
attended. 
  His majesty chaired part of the Cabinet session, during 
which 
his majesty emphasized his support for and constant confidence 
in the prime minister and ministers. 
  His majesty was briefed by the prime minister on the most 
important topics discussed during the Cabinet session, 
especially the general tax on sales and agricultural conditions 
in the Jordan Valley. 
  His majesty reviewed his visits to the United States, 
Croatia, and Austria, saying these visits were very successful. 
He said: In the United States, emphasis was placed on the fact 
that peace must be comprehensive and just and that Jordan cannot 
accept the idea of signing a peace treaty and then go back to 
discuss its provisions. The matters agreed upon in the common 
agenda must be discussed first and when they are all resolved, 
then discussion of a peace treaty can start within the framework 
of the principle of comprehensiveness. 
  In this regard, his majesty said that some of the provisions 
of the agenda could be implemented before signing the peace 
treaty. If agreement is reached on territory or borders, then 
Jordan will regain its waters within this context. He also said 
he found understanding and positive response from President 
Clinton and the U.S. Administration on this point in particular. 
  Regarding his visit to Croatia, his majesty stressed that 
the 
Jordanian soldiers there are fulfilling their duties with a 
great degree of service and without bias and are demonstrating 
good manners and prudence. He said the Jordanian peacekeeping 
force in the former Yugoslavia is the second largest 
international force after France. He also said he was pleased 
to meet with the soldiers there. 
  Regarding his visit to Austria, his majesty said he met with 
Austria's current and former presidents, as well as the Austrian 
chancellor. He said he found a readiness and understanding to 
increase cooperation between Jordan and Austria. 
  As for his visit to Syria, his majesty said the visit was 
primarily made to offer condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad 
on the death of his son. He said they also discussed issues 
within the context of coordination between the two countries. 
His majesty briefed President al-Asad on the impression created 
with the U.S. side on the meeting between Presidents al-Asad and 
Clinton. His majesty said he found that the U.S. President 
created a positive impression of his meeting with Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  His majesty then moved to speak about domestic issues. He 
stressed the need to pay attention to the individual, stressing 
that attention must always be given to the individual, 
especially regarding his material needs, water, food, and 
medicine. He said we must always develop scientific and 
technological resources within this context and follow the 
correct standards and specifications that will enable us to 
protect the individual and provide the best quality products for 
his basic needs. 
  His majesty said: We must pay attention to the individual's 
education, especially at this phase. There are many challenges 
awaiting us in the coming phase which dictate that the 
individual must always be ready to bear and confront the 
challenges that may face him in the future. 
  His majesty touched on certain domestic issues that must be 
addressed by the government, particularly the fight against 
narcotics, administrative control and reform, and awarding 
productive employees and punishing wrongdoers. He said we must 
address our issues with some degree of precision, because 
generalization may create a distorted image of Jordan, 
especially since some people may try to take advantage of this 
situation. 
  Some ministers then reviewed some of the activities 
conducted 
by their ministries. 
  At the end of the session, his majesty gave statements to 
reporters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] His majesty the king said Jordan was following 
developments in the case of the assassinated Jordanian diplomat, 
Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, and highly evaluated the Lebanese 
Government's efforts with regards to the ugly crime. Speaking 
to reporters at the Prime Ministry, the king expressed hope for 
a quick solution to the Yemeni crisis, and said Jordan would be 
honored to host its leaders to sign a reconciliation accord. 
His majesty also said Jordan would always support the 
Palestinians to regain their legitimate rights on their national 
soil. However, the king said, coordination with the 
Palestinians was not yet satisfactory, unlike that with Syria 
and Lebanon. 
  His majesty told the "News at Ten" of his absolute 
confidence 
in the prime minister and the cabinet: 
  [Begin Husayn recording, in progress] ... the meeting and I 
had the pleasure of speaking with the ministers of all that 
happened during the period when I was away, and in the same time 
hearing from them some of their views, and having an idea about 
what they were meeting to accomplish in this very day, and to 
reemphasize my complete confidence in the prime minister and in 
every minister for their efforts. And my hope that they will 
not lose heart, but that they will keep going in serving this 
country to the best of their abilities in the times ahead. 
Hopefully, the same case will apply to the parliament, the 
legislative branch, and the cooperation will further solidify 
the foundations that are paved in this country in terms of 
democracy and respect for human rights. [end recording] 
  The king had earlier chaired part of today's Cabinet meeting 
and discussed recent developments in Jordan as well as his 
majesty's visits to the United States, Austria, and Croatia. 
  The king, who was accompanied by His Royal Highness Crown 
Prince Hasan and the chief of the Royal Court, reaffirmed the 
importance of the human element, particularly with regards to 
food and medicine.

  [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has stated that a 
group of saboteurs has recently been apprehended. The group was 
planning to blow up public places and assassinate a number of 
intellectuals. 
  Replying to a question at a House of Representatives session 
held today under the speakership of Tahir al-Masri and attended 
by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, the interior minister 
added: 
  [Begin recording] [Salamah Hammad] In the name of God, the 
merciful, the compassionate. Almighty God has said: Remember, 
Abraham said: O my Lord! Make this city one of peace and 
security. [Koranic verse] 
  Mr. Speaker, Honorable Deputies: With the help of God, this 
country will remain secure because the Almighty has blessed our 
country with a leadership believing in God and sincere in 
performing its duty, and because this country has qualified 
security organs that believe in their duty to protect the 
homeland and the citizen. We do not brag about that because they 
are all your sons and brothers, people of this country. 
However, they deserve admiration, appreciation, and respect. 
  Recently, a group or groups of people have been arrested. 
They sought to harm this country. They had aims, which 
included plans to blow up public places. These included the 
House of Representatives, considering it a state institution. 
They also planned to blow up places such as cinemas, video 
shops, and night clubs; assassinate a number of intellectuals 
and economists in this country; rob banks, considering them 
usurious establishments; attack police foot patrols and seize 
their weapons and also attack intelligence men; and attack 
public places. 
  Four crimes against supermarkets, taxi drivers, and a liquor 
store were carried out. They also committed crimes in the 
Rivoli Cinema in Amman and the Salwa Cinema in al-Zarqa', as you 
heard and as we announced. An explosive charge planted in 
Zahran Cinema in Amman was defused and did not explode. 
  Yesterday, a group of persons were arrested. They had in 
their possession two bombs intended to be detonated in Irbid, 
and another two in al-Salt. 
  This morning we received information that a bomb had been 
planted in al-Hashimiyah Square [in Amman]. All measures were 
taken, but the bomb was not found. Last night we received word 
about a bomb in the al-Nasr Cinema in al-Zarqa' and we 
investigated that this morning. 
  In fact, brothers, investigations are going on and efforts 
are continuing. In reply to the brothers' questions, I wanted 
to clarify these points, and all details will be announced when 
the investigations are completed. 
  The eyes of your sons, the men of all security organs will 
remain open, with God's help, to serve this steadfast country. 
  This is what I have, Mr. Speaker, at present. When the 
investigations are completed, we will announce all dimensions of 
this issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
  [Tahir al-Masri] Thank you Mr. Minister, and thank you all 
for these efforts that, with God's help, will keep this country 
safe and secure. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the Jordanian Government on </F>
"the savage aggression against innocent Muslims in Sarajevo;" 
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Jordanian Government has followed with deep 
concern the reports on the painful and bloody massacre to which 
Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was exposed and in 
which a large number of defenseless civilian children, women, 
and elderly people were killed. 
  As the Jordanian Government denounces the brutal aggression 
against innocent Muslims in Sarajevo and strongly condemns this 
fierce barbarism, which ignores all values, ideals, and human 
rights, it calls on the international community to move 
immediately to shoulder its responsibility to save the innocent 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the continuing aggression and 
to work toward ending the siege on the Bosnian capital. 
  The Jordanian Government appeals to the UN Security Council, 
the United Nations, and human rights organization to work 
earnestly to stop the bloodshed and achieve security, 
tranquility, and peace for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina who 
are being exposed, day and night, to human rights violations 
before the eyes of the world.

  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--Japan and Jordan Sunday [6 February] 
signed an agreement rescheduling over $14 million in Jordan's 
debts owed to Japan. 
  The agreement, signed by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh and 
Japanese Ambassador Yuji Ikeda, followed a decision in June by 
the Paris Club of major government creditors to ease Jordan's 
foreign debts. 
  Under the accord, Japan will reschedule installments on 
arrears from July 1993 until February 1994, the Jordan News 
Agency, Petra, said. The sum will be added to a previously 
rescheduled amount of $87.3 million dollars, it added. 
  The deal provides for a grace period of nine years for 
government debts and seven years for government-guaranteed 
commercial loans.

  [Text] Two financial agreements and two memorandums were 
signed between Jordan and the German Government at the Ministry 
of Planning today. According to these agreements and 
memorandums, the German Government will grant Jordan soft loans 
and grants to finance several development projects in Jordan. 
Planning Minister Dr. Ziyad Fariz signed the agreements for the 
Jordanian Government, while the German ambassador in Amman 
signed for Germany. 
  Dr. Fariz spoke to our correspondent 'Atif Nusur after the 
signing of the agreements, saying: 
  [Begin Fariz recording] The agreements concern a very 
important project, namely, the establishment of water networks 
and two water purification stations in the southern part of the 
city of Irbid and neighboring villages. The project will 
benefit 15 villages in the governorate. The loan agreement that 
was signed to implement this project stipulates that the German 
Government will grant Jordan a soft loan totaling some 76 
million German marks. This loan will contribute to financing the 
projects implemented by the Water Authority. 
  The Bank [not further identified] also granted Jordan a 
grant 
of 2 million marks to implement the greater Amman water project. 
This grant will finance studies on this project. Besides, both 
sides signed memorandums on grants, rather than loans. 
According to these memorandums, the German agencies will 
provide technical training to hospital personnel. The Royal 
Medical Services Corps will be the main beneficiary from such 
training. The competent German agencies will provide this 
medical institution with modern medical technology. Its 
personnel will be provided with training. Moreover, the German 
agencies will provide maintenance at hospitals in general, and 
at the Husayn Medical Center in particular. This grant totals 
some 2.7 million marks. The agreements are also meant to 
finance energy research and development projects, particularly 
those pertaining to renewable energy resources. These projects 
are being implemented by the Royal Scientific Society. They are 
primarily aimed at developing solar geysers and fans, and 
launching laboratories devoted to energy development and other 
scientific research that could promote Jordan's capabilities in 
this regard. The cost of these projects total some 2 million 
marks, 1.8 million, to be exact. The German Government has, 
from the outset, aided Jordan's endeavors in this regard. [end

  [Text] AL-DUSTUR has learned from official sources that 
competent agencies have made efforts regarding the excavations 
Israel is making in search of antiquities in the border areas, 
which encroach on the antiquities of the Jordanian territories. 
  The sources said Jordanian efforts in this regard came about 
following Western news reports of Israeli excavations searching 
for antiquities in the Qumran area north of the Dead Sea. The 
Qumran area is believed to be the home of important historical 
scrolls that date back to the first century A.D. 
  The sources indicated the Qumran area is Jordanian territory 
that Israel occupied in the aftermath of the 1967 war. The 
Israeli occupation of this territory is believed to be listed on 
the agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli peace negotiations, in order 
to ensure its return to Jordanian sovereignty.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The government will ask the general 
prosecutor to investigate charges raised by Minister of Health 
'Abd al-Rahim Malhas that a good quantity of food and medicine 
that reaches the market is unfit for consumption, Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said Sunday [6 February]. 
  Dr. al-Majali said the government would provide the general 
prosecutor with all information it has on the case and ask him 
to collect other relevant information from the public and the 
Lower House of Parliament. 
  Instructions will be issued to all government departments to 
"put all official documents they have at the disposal of the 
general prosecutor," Dr al-Majali told the House at the end of a 
three-day session held to discuss Dr. Malhas' charges that 
appeared in a weekly tabloid over two weeks ago. 
  Dr. al-Majali said people suspected of violating regulations 
related to food and medicine standards would be referred to 
court. 
  House Speaker Tahir al-Masri asked the Public Freedoms and 
General Health committees to provide the House with a report on 
the results of investigations that they have launched into the 
issue in two weeks. 
  "The executive authority has prime responsibility in 
initiating reform and taking immediate and decisive measures (on 
the food and medicine situation). The responsibilities of the 
(House) are no less important and the House has to shoulder them 
through following up and monitoring the measures the government 
will take and putting them in the right direction," Mr. al-Masri 
said at the end of the session in which 37 deputies spoke on Dr. 
Malhas' charges. 
  "If it becomes necessary, the House will take all measures 
that the Constitution and laws make available to it (to ensure 
this)," Mr. al-Masri said. 
  Mr. al-Masri said the public's response to Dr. al-Malhas' 
charges show their thirst for reform in all government agencies, 
and asserted that the House would continue to check the 
government's actions "in all fields." 
  Twenty-seven out of the 37 deputies who spoke on the issue 
supported Dr. Malhas, while seven severely criticised him for 
"failing" to substantiate his charges and not presenting a 
reform programme. Four legislators adopted neutrality but 
demanded thorough investigations into the charges that have 
landed the government in its worst political crisis since it won 
the confidence of the house in December. 
  Many opposition deputies lashed out at the government during 
the debate, saying the government was "incapable" of initiating 
reform. Over 19 deputies, including the Islamic Action Front's 
(IAF) members, urged a vote of no-confidence in the government 
over the issue. 
  Deputies who opposed Dr. Malhas criticised him for failing 
to 
go through "proper channels" to raise the issue, failing to 
prove his charges and shaking public confidence in the safety of 
food and medicine and "hurting Jordan's reputation and its 
national economy." 
  Those who supported the minister expressed appreciation of 
his "courage" in speaking out about alleged corruption and 
determination to fight what he described as a "mafia" of drug 
and food merchants who sought fast profits at the expense of the 
people and their safety. 
  Some deputies lashed out at the Ministry of Supply for 
allegedly allowing the entry of shipments of sub-standard food 
into the market, with one lawmaker saying he would request a 
"general discussion" of the situation at the ministry in order 
to investigate alleged cases of violations of the law. 
  In his speech to the House, Dr. al-Majali reaffirmed the 
government's commitment to protect the citizens in cooperation 
with the House. But he took a firm stand against deputies who 
questioned his cabinet's abilities and determination to fight 
corruption and bring about reform. 
  Responding to the severe criticism that deputies made of his 
cabinet, Dr. al-Majali said some deputies seized "the 
opportunity to shake the status of the government. But we say 
here in front of you (that) we hide nothing from you and have 
provided you with all (the information) you demanded... we have 
nothing to hide or to fear." 
  Dr. al-Majali said some deputies were still addressing the 
government with slanderous language. 
  "But we will not respond to these accusations and will stick 
to (proper) norms of talking... out of our concern for 
consolidating democracy," which benefitted from the debate that 
took place in the House over Dr. Malhas' allegations, Dr. 
al-Majali told the lawmakers. 
  Dr. al-Majali said that cases of corruption and abuse of 
office in Jordan were an exception, saying that they do not 
exceed similar violations in any other country. 
  "I assure you that our food is safe and that our medicine is 
safe," said Dr. al-Majali. 
  But, he said, the government would take more measures to 
ensure the safety of food and medicine and raise the standards 
governing the safety and quality of food and medicine. 
  He said the government would prepare draft laws to establish 
separate food and medicine directorates and to prevent 
monopolies in producing and marketing food and medicine. 
  He said the government had asked the finance minister to 
take 
measures against medicine merchants if it was proven that they 
charged exorbitant profits. 
  In comments to the press and later in a speech to the House, 
Dr. Malhas said there was a deficiency in laws governing the 
sale of drug and food in the country and some traders were 
reaping exorbitant profits. 
  In a response to the deputies' speeches on Sunday, Dr. 
Malhas 
reiterated these charges but said the Ministry of Health, with 
the suport of the government, had started a process of reform 
that would plug all loopholes in legislations. 
  "The government will not allow the entry (into the market) 
of 
any food and medicine shipments that does not meet (standards 
and specifications)," Dr. Malhas told the House. 
  Dr. Malhas said the ministry in 1993 referred thousands of 
violators of the law to courts and would continue to take 
measures against any new violations. 
  Dr. Malhas denied that he was in disagreement with the prime 
minister over the need to fight corruption. He reiterated 
earlier statements that the disagreement with Dr. al-Majali that 
he mentioned in his press interview was restricted to the 
interpretation of the law on pharmacies. 
  Dr. al-Majali also denied that he had any differences over 
the issue with the health minister. 
  Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy 'Arif 
al-Batayinah agreed with Dr. Malhas that pressure was 
"sometimes" applied on the Ministry of Health but said available 
laws empower the minister to resist such pressures. 
  Dr. al-Batayinah cited incidents that occurred during his 
work as minister of health and director of the Royal Medical 
Services to prove that laws were sufficient to ensure the safety 
of food and medicine and to refer violators of the law to courts. 
  He also confirmed that foreign countries sometimes apply 
pressure to get their exports to Jordan approved for sale, 
citing an alleged threat by the Indian minister of trade that if 
Jordan did not approve an already rejected shipment of Indian 
meat, "our exports of phosphates will be negatively affected." 
  But as minister of health, he said, he rejected the shipment 
and nobody could force him to accept it. 
  "Wouldn't it have been better for the health minister to 
refer the violators to court unless a certain group prevented 
him from using his authority," said Dr. al-Batayinah. 
  Deputy Nazih al-'Ammarin, who pledged support for Dr. 
Malhas, 
also provided examples to show the drug merchants charge 
exorbitant profits. He said manufacturing, importing and sale 
of medicine were in the hands of few "sharks" who resist reform. 
  "There is a confidence gap between the citizens and 
officials 
and hence is the big noise that this issue has caused," said 
Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, voicing support for Dr. Malhas in the 
fight against corruption. 
  "I thanked God when I heard about the food and medicine that 
are unfit for consumption because most people in the Jordan 
Valley do not eat meat," said Deputy Jamil al-Hushush in a 
reference to poverty in his constituency. 
  "Our children do not drink powered milk," said Mr. 
al-Hushush 
as about 20 farmers from the valley declared a hunger-strike to 
demand measures to help them fight poverty in what they called a 
"disaster area."

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Political sources have stated that preparations are 
under way to hold a meeting between the Syrian Foreign Minister 
and the U.S. Secretary of State to discuss the removal of 
Syria's name from the list of states that support terrorism. 
The meeting will discuss the conditions which U.S. President 
Bill Clinton conveyed to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad during 
their recent meeting in Geneva. The sources said these 
conditions are: 
  1. Syria should support the U.S. efforts to fight the 
current 
of fundamentalist terrorism in the region by handing over files 
on the Iranian personalities who support this current, on Iran's 
role in giving material support for this, and on Iran's present 
contacts with some Arab personalities to intensify the 
fundamentalist terrorists' operations. 
  In this regard, the United States has asked Syria to 
disclose 
the intricate details of Iranian-Syrian relations. Clinton 
alleged that the United States has information that Syrian 
intelligence services have complete files in this connection. 
  2. Syria should halt the Palestinian factions opposing the 
peace process and turn over to Israel about 23 Palestinians 
wanted for committing serious (terrorist) incidents where killed 
many Israeli citizens were killed. These individuals are living 
under the protection of the Syrian regime. 
  3. Syria should halt all forms of support for the 
pro-Iranian 
Hizballah forces in Lebanon and hand over files regarding 
Hizballah's plans, the main figures behind the terrorist 
operations, and the Iranian personalities who have direct 
influence in Iran. 
  4. Syria should condemn the intifadah in the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  The sources said there are some differences between the two 
sides regarding the U.S. conditions. Contacts are under way to 
narrow these differences and bring about a meeting between the 
Syrian foreign minister and the U.S. Secretary of State.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: It is clear that Israel is deliberately 
dragging out the Arab-Israeli peace talks as part of a scheme 
that seeks to disperse the momentum produced by the Geneva 
summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. That same scheme also seeks to exhaust the efforts and 
patience of the Arab parties one after the other, force them 
into positions different from their current ones, and push them 
into signing separate deals that are not based on the UN 
Security Council resolutions governing the region's peace 
process. 
  With the absence of the Security Council resolutions, 
everything can be subject to interpretation and different 
readings, like the Oslo agreement. Everything can also be 
subject to extortion and procrastination. What is agreed upon 
now can be violated tomorrow. In such agreements, the rights of 
the weak will be lost and the powerful evil can gain supremacy. 
  We say this because the Washington talks on the level of 
heads of delegations ended without any progress. Israel 
expected, and even wanted to see, such a result even before they 
started. The World was expecting positive results, especially 
after the great momentum given to the peace process by the 
Geneva summit. Nothing was preventing the achievement of 
decisive progress on the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks. Syria 
explained its concept of peace and its position was supported by 
the United States and the world. Israel was supposed to pledge 
complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the occupied 
territories in implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions and the principle of land for peace. But, as usual, 
Israel maneuvered, procrastinated, and once again raised the 
issue of its security concerns. 
  In this regard, we recall a statement by Former Israeli 
Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Shamir in which he stated publicly that he was 
planning for talks lasting several years so that the world will 
forget the Middle East question. It appears that what Shamir 
said is being implemented now in letter and spirit. The 
Washington talks have entered their third year with no signs of 
an impending agreement. The positions remain the same. Israel 
is avoiding the requirement of the complete withdrawal from 
occupied Arab territories, insists on subjugating the 
Palestinian people, confiscates their land to give to settlers, 
and treats the Palestinian people in a manner that runs contrary 
to all charters and principles of the United Nations and human 
rights. It murders, destroys, sets fires, and erects further 
detention centers in violation of all international laws. At 
the same time, it continues its aggressions against southern 
Lebanon. Today is so similar to yesterday and the day before 
because nothing has changed in Israel's behavior and conduct. 
Everything is being done as if the Madrid Conference had not 
been convened and as if the Washington talks were a mere 
opportunity to kill time. 
  With its course of maneuvering, procrastinating, and 
emptying 
the peace talks of any substance, Israel seeks to frustrate the 
Arab parties first, and then the world so the world will reach 
the point of despair concerning the Middle East question and the 
stage will be set for Israel to exercise its arrogance, 
extortion, and aggression. 
  Israel is trying to surpass the results of Geneva summit, 
which revived the world's hope in the possibility of reaching a 
just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and torpedo its 
dynamism by dragging out the talks in Washington, by reviving 
procedural matters, by raising the security excuses, and by 
avoiding as much as possible the substance of the talks; namely, 
the exchange of land for peace. Israel is avoiding the future 
of the territory and gives priority to security before peace as 
if peace were not the ideal guarantee for the security of states 
in the region. 
  However, Israel's old-new game is not hidden from the world, 
particularly the sponsoring party of the peace process. In 
Geneva, the United States committed itself before the world to 
the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace based on the 
UN Security Council resolutions. The United States must 
intervene at the right time to put things in order because the 
collapse of the peace process will only bring great harm to 
world stability and U.S. interests.
